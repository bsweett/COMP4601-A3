Jack is celebrating his final days as a bachelor, and Miles is his tour guide of sorts, a man who knows and enjoys fine wine.  Jack is a handsome risk-taker character actor and Miles is the mild mannered neurotic lonely man.  They are as different as night and day, but they are friends facing the autumn of their lives, wishing they had done more and been more.<br /><br />Soon they become faced with free-spirited women (Viginia Madsen and Sandra Oh), and fabulous fun happens.  Also, a realization that each day opens with opportunity and a chance to start over.  There is also fine wine to enjoy and savor like life itself.  This is a roadtrip examining character and hope as well as the ups and downs of everyman's life.<br /><br />Although slow, overall the film is worth watching for some smiles, and interesting insights.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Miles and Jack are on their way back to Jack wedding.<br />Miles is a wine kind of guy and Jack is a hunk actor with over developed libido.<br />They had been roommates in the college dorm, but besides that have very little in common.<br />Miles is a pinot type of expensive drunk whose life is at what<br />he thinks is a dead end.<br />Some strange pair are these.<br />These two guys made San Diego look bad.<br />But the acting an plot is pretty good and what is very much a tragedy<br />comes off as comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I think that it's truly the mark of a stupendous actor when you can't believe they're pulling off role that you're simultaneously seeing them in. This is exactly the case with Paul Giamatti playing Miles in this film. After seeing American Splendor, I could not fathom how the same man could so convincingly depict a Californian metrosexual, wine snob who is far more sensitive than the women he meets. Giamatti's is a heckuva talent because, on top of everything else, he takes the thoroughly beaten clich&eacute; of unpublished layabout writer and morphs it into a believable role, or as his friend says, which so aptly describes his life: "They think you're a writer." If I would have read the description of his character on paper, there would be no way that I'd even be slightly interested in him, but in this movie you cannot help but care throughout.<br /><br />The film definitely has an avant-guard feel with its early double, triple, and quadruple feature frames and camera angles. The landscape of the wine country is marvelous so the physical setting could not be improved upon. Authenticity is the most accurate word for the film making. The actors look like real people and so does everybody else. When Miles calls his ex-wife via a payphone, her voice legitimately sounds as if we're listening to it through an obsolete receiver.<br /><br />The only real quandary I had when watching Sideways is just how Thomas Haden Church, who plays Jack, ever became best friends with Miles in the first place even if they were college roommates. Church is a wooden, shallow Ken doll who just wants to have a good time and forget that he's getting married; whereas, Miles wishes he were still married. The one is a connoisseur of outstanding wine while the other just wants to know what the alcohol content is.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen is the sister of Michael Madson and she looks far younger than her real age. Speaking of which, it was a fine idea to use older, mature looking actors in this film because there are few wine enthusiasts in their early twenties. A particularly well-done, and uncommon, scene occurs when Miles projects his own personality onto the Pino grape. He seems to have no idea that he is doing it but, in Madsen's eyes, we can see that she comprehends.<br /><br />I'd have to say that Sideways is a highly refreshing film as it is subtle, sensitive, and redeeming.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Alexander Payne is fast becoming one of the most interesting film directors in the business. His previous films Election and About Schmidt are light social commentary comedies. His latest, Sideways, is no different.<br /><br />Sideways tells the story of two middle aged men, one a middle school Social Studies teacher named Miles Raymond played by Paul Giamatti, and the other an actor named Jack played by Thomas Haden Church. Jack is supposedly getting married in a week, while Miles is still suffering from a two year old divorce. The two men go on a trip through the wine counties of California on a wine-tasting tour that Miles is an expert at. Along the way, they meet the humble, charming waitress Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, and the wild single mother Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Jack has a dirty plan of enjoying one last sexual fling before he ties the knot and at the same time show his depressed buddy Miles that life is still worth looking into and enjoying by trying to hook him up with Maya. Miles becomes outraged with Jack's disloyalty and at the same time his own struggles to fall in love again.<br /><br />With funny dialogue and the Alexander Payne style of realism, Sideways succeeds in making a connection with the audience. Even if you are not a middle aged person, you will still enjoy watching Church and Giamatti in their ridiculous and sometimes absurd shenanigans.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>When I went to the theatre to see the film within the first five minutes I was convinced that I wasn't going to like it.  But Sideways sneaks up on you.  Miles, somehow when you're not looking, steals your heart.  Miles is a complex man whose grief, sorrow, and regret keeps the audience emotionally invested.  I found myself wanting to know more about wine and their histories, too.  Paul Giamatti was definitely robbed of an Oscar nomination, however, it was year of great male performances.  Who would you take out-?  Maybe 2004 should have had six nominees?  Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>The DVD of "Sideways" should be watched twice.  The first time without the commentary on so you can appreciate the terrific jazz score by Rolfe Kent that terrifically underscores the action on the screen.  Criminally, Kent's score was not even nominated for an Oscar.  The commentary track by the film's stars Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church is indispensible and not to be missed.  This pair have infinite clever bon mots about the action on the screen and the making of the film.  As for the film itself it is a humorous account of two college buddies, one depressive the other libidinous, who go on an extended bachelor party through California wine country.  In the process they learn about life, love, themselves, some of it painful, some of it wickedly hilarious.  Director Alexander Payne with this film and his previous comic masterworks, "Election" and "About Schmidt" continues to rise to the upper echelon of American filmmakers.  We can thank him for advancing the careers here of Paul Giamatti, star of last year's brilliant "American Splendor", Thomas Haden Church, best known for his work in sitcoms, "Wings" and "Ned and Stacey".  Particular mention should be made of his utilization of Virginia Madsen as Maya, the waitress that captures the heart of Giamatti's character, Miles.  Madsen had fallen from grace with the powers-that-be in Hollywood even though she delivered solid work in movies as diverse as the horror film "Candyman" and Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of John Grisham's "The Rainmaker".  Here's hoping the success of this film is a springboard for the careers of all those involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Sideways" is a "dramedy" based on the novel of the same name by Rex Pickett. There is more drama than comedy, though, as middle-aged pals Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) set off on a week-long trip through California wine country just before Jack is to be married. Miles is a wine fanatic -connoisseur would be an understatement- intent on sending his friend off "in style" by guiding him through the finest wines California has to offer. Jack has other ideas. He wants to sow his wild oats before plunging into matrimony, and he thinks Miles should do the same. Miles has been morose, self-deafeatist, and uncomfortable around the opposite sex since his divorce 2 years before. Through their adventures, they meet two women: Maya (Virginia Madsen), a soulful old acquaintance of Miles who enjoys wine as much as he does. And Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who pours wine at vineyard and likes adventure as much as Jack.<br /><br />Every once in a while a "food movie" comes along, but I don't recall ever seeing a "drink movie" before now. "Sideways" is a drink movie, not to be confused with a "drunk movie", although there is a bit of that too. It does for wine what "Big Night" and "Babette's Feast" did for food. Oenophiles will probably enjoy "Sideways" for the passion it expresses for wine. I found the film only mildly comic, though, and the humor generally relies on Miles' neuroses or Jack's insensitivity. "Sideways" fault is that it makes dysfunction its central gag and plot device. Miles is simply not someone you'd want to be around if he were real. The story revolves around the men, but Maya and Stephanie are more interesting characters. "Sideways" is a solid adaptation, but 2 hours of characters who are essentially annoying wears on the audience, even if what they do is amusing.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): Bonus features include 7 deleted scenes, 1 featurette, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. The "Behind-the-Scenes Featurette" (6 minutes) features interviews with the 4 principle actors and director Alexander Payne in which they primarily discuss characters. In the audio commentary, actors Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church joke about their experiences filming  "Sideways". It sounds like they hit the booze before recording the commentary. There is an occasional piece of information in the commentary, but you'd have a hard time finding it amid all the chortling. Subtitles available in English, French, and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I watched "Sideways" several months ago and I find myself still thinking about it a lot.  I watched it because it won an Oscar for something, I don't even know what.  My guess would be for Best Writing.  Anyway, I wasn't expecting anything all that much but I was very impressed on how the movie kept coming at me with more and more to offer.<br /><br />The story begins with a look at what appears to be a rather inept individual.  It's a lot of little things (along with an apparent hangover) that gives us this impression.  That's one of the keys to "Sideways"; the many subtle little things that enhance the movie.<br /><br />We come to understand that the man is picking up a former college roommate for a two-some bachelor party weekend in the California wine district.  The ex-roommate has a personality; our main character seems to lack anything of the sort.<br /><br />They arrive at their motel and start checking out the scene and we gradually get to know more and more about these guys.  The ex-roommate is out to have fun; the other has planned how they will have fun.  One is spontaneous and the other is calculated and that is another key to "Sideways"; the way these two play off each other.<br /><br />There's a lot of funny things that take place in the movie.  I would categorize "Sideways" as a comedy.  However, the part that impressed me the most was the romantic aspect of the movie.  I was really touched by the relationship that developed with our bumbling hero.  It was the part that stayed with me the longest.<br /><br />So many laughs and a bit of anguish led me to conclude that Hollywood can still do it.  "Sideways" is my idea of a complete movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>Alexander Payne's wonderful, Academy Award winning film, "Sideways" is a mixture of two types of comedy genres, the 'road picture' and the 'buddy picture'. Both these genres mesh together perfectly to create both big laughs and some sobering reflections about how people live their lives.<br /><br />In the film we meet two old friends. First there is Miles (Paul Giamatti) a schlumpy, depressed, middle aged, high school teacher and would-be novelist. He is also a wine connoiseur, who is using his hobby as a cover to get drunk and medicate his depression over his divorce from two years ago. His life is basically stuck in neutral. Then there is Jack (Thomas Haden Church) a handsome but shallow actor, who seems to do most of his thinking with his private parts. His addiction is women and he will say just about anything to get them into bed.<br /><br />As the film opens, Jack is about to get married. The two middle aged men embark on a "bachelor's week", vacation road trip, before the nupitals occur. Miles' plan is to go north from San Diego, visit a number of wineries for "tastings", have some good meals and take in a little golf. But Jack has other ideals, which are basically more carnal in nature. In their travels, they meet and pick-up, both Maya (Virginia Madsen) a local waitress (and fellow wine connoisseur) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a sexy winery employee. Romantic sparks fly and entanglements occur, that produce humor, hidden truths, and self-realizations for the characters.<br /><br />The Academy Award winning Script ("2005 Best writing, Adapted Screenplay") by Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor is both witty, funny and emotionally moving. They have created interesting characters, who you just want to listen to and find out more about. The most interesting scenes in the movie don't necessary involve the slapstick humor, but are the parts, where the characters just sit and talk about themselves. In one of the most memorable scenes of the film, Miles is describing Pinot Noir grapes (his favorite) but eventually you realize he's actually talking about himself. Maya's response to his description is just as good. The scene is almost poetic.<br /><br />The cast in this film is just first rate. Paul Giamatti as the morose, Miles, dosn't just play his part, but inhabits it! The fact that Giamatti wasn't even nominated for an Academy award is mind-boggling. Virginia Madsen (who was nominated) plays the Maya character with a special vitality and sexiness, that the role requires. She makes it believable, that this bright, sexy woman could fall for this sad-sack of a man. Thomas Haden Church (also nomimnated) and Sandra Oh are very funny in their indespensible roles. After seeing these actors you can't imagine anyone else playing these characters.<br /><br />I also want to mention how much this film does work as a road picture. Most movies of this nature ar either filled with endless highways or national monuments. But in this picture, not only are the characters interesting, but so are their vacation stops. Both the locations and the beautiful cinematography (By Phedon Papamichael) just hold your interest and make wish you were there! (In real life the film locations became tourist hotspots!) Finally, I want to mention the breezy, light jazz sountrack from composer, Rolfe Kent, that unobtrusively adds to the flavor of the film. You will unknowingly be humming along with it. This is a wonderfully, funny and moving film, that has some interesting characters. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Middle-aged Miles' (Paul Giamatti) life isn't going forward. And it isn't going backwards either. His life is going "Sideways".<br /><br />Miles is headed to No-wheresville. He's a failed writer, has a messed up friendship with a nearly washed-up actor named Jack (Thomas Haden Church...remember the low-IQ mechanic from the WINGS TV series? Yep, he's back), and is spinning into a pit of self-loathing since his divorce two years prior.<br /><br />If that weren't enough, Jack, his best buddy, is now getting married and Miles has to be his Best Man. Oh! And did we mention that Miles' ex-wife and her new husband are coming to the wedding, too. Lovely! For Miles, already on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, something is about to break. Better do something unpredictable. But what? Ah yes! ROAD TRIP!<br /><br />So Miles and Jack take a jaunt into California's wine country. Miles, who is a connoisseur of great wines, tries to teach Jake (who's only interests are in getting nasty with a girl -- any girl -- who's interested in him) how to enjoy Pinots, Blancs, and all the other available grape incarnations.<br /><br />But what the two have brought along with them on this trip is their pasts, their present, and, ultimately, their futures.<br /><br />Will this trip spell the end of Jack's engagement if he falls in love with someone else (or thinks he falls)? Can Miles wrestle his own personal demons out from under him while meanwhile trying to keep his best friend from self-destructing?<br /><br />Okay, so some of you might be asking yourselves, "So what's with the title of your film review?" Let me explain. First off, this movie has zero CGI effects (Did you hear that! Zero!). Second, there are no heroic battle scenes (not really, unless you consider Susan Oh beating on someone with her motorcycle helmet a "battle scene") or impressive set shots. Third, this film moves you into the characters' lives gently, kind of like getting into a pool filled with ice water. You have to go slowly, let your body adjust to the temperature change. For film, this is known as plot and character development (something that Hollyweird sometimes has trouble with). Fourth, you won't find Cindy Crawford look-alikes, or Vin Diesel muscle-types strutting their stuff in this film. This movie has "true" characters." They're F#@$ed up people who look like you or me. And they have real-world problems (they aren't trying to save the world from Zork-the-Terrible before he implodes Earth with his Confabulator 9000).<br /><br />So if you're the type who goes into a theater expecting to be "blown away" by the special effects, bypass this one and spare us your review here. But if you enjoy character studies, and don't mind a slow, funny, touching, and downright realistic film, you'll probably love this one.<br /><br />(Congratulations to the screenwriters for their Oscar win!)</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Sideways was a 2004 sleeper comedy hit by director Alexander Payne that really deserved its plaudits. He previously made the funny Reese Witherspoon comedy Election and the so-so Jack Nicholson film About Schmidt. The film's title comes from the proper way to store a bottle of wine, as well the angle a drunk sees the world from when he's recovering from passing out on the floor. While not a particularly deep film, and at two hours and four minutes in length it is about a half an hour too long, the film nonetheless does provide some insights into male insecurities and mid-life crises, as it celebrates human foibles in an intelligent manner. It was adapted by Payne and Jim Taylor from an unpublished novel by a writer named Rex Pickett, and won a well deserved Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.<br />  The film follows in a long tradition of buddy comedies, from the silent era, wherein one guy is a good fellow, and the other is his ne'er do well pal. Basically, a week before the bad pal, his ex-college roommate, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), a failed actor, is to get married, his good pal, Miles (Paul Giamatti), a divorced school teacher of English, and an aspiring novelist, plans to take him on a week's getaway to the California wine country, to relax and play golf.... the film is a ray of hope for viewers who want intelligent films, especially comedies, from someone not named Woody Allen. Payne was quoted as saying, in an online interview: `I want Sideways, which has no movie stars in it, and a movie for which I had final cut, to make money, not just for my own career but for other film makers so that film makers and studios can point, if I didn't have stars to make money, Sideways didn't have a gun or a chase even though that made money, we have to be changing our cinema, little by little and have more human films. But the only way it's going to happen is there are examples they can point to, where they made money. It was just like that in the late 60s and 70s. Look, Easy Rider made money, The Graduate made money, Midnight Cowboy made money, and we should make more movies like those. That's what we need.'<br />  He's right, of course. Here's hoping that he has a long career of such hits as Sideways, but that he only gets better with each succeeding film.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>For me, this started slowly, got quite a bit better, then got somewhat immoral and ugly, then got boring again, then ridiculous, then concluded with a happy ending neither of the main characters deserved. Neither Giamatti nor Church played likable characters. The best thing in the film is Virginia Madsen, who was other-worldly radiant as the angel of death in "A Prairie Home Companion" and is realistically radiant here. I had a lot in common with Giamatti's sad-sack broken-hearted failure, and one of my best friends behaves a like lot Thomas Hayden Church's character. Halfway through the film, I was planning to send my copy on to him to see if he agreed that these men were a lot like us. By the end of the movie, I disliked both men so much that I changed my plan, and I'll be donating this DVD to our Friends of the Library book sale in the Spring.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This movie centers on four characters. The two main characters are the two old college odd-couple buddies Jack (Thomas Haden Church) and Miles (Paul Giamatti) hit the road for Jack's last week of freedom before his wedding. Jack is an actor who was on a daytime soap opera once, but now does voiceovers for commercials. And Miles is a mid-school English teacher who fancies him self a novelist.<br /><br />Miles thinks he is going to introduce his friend into marriage with a tour of the wine country and some golf. While Jack has no morals and wants to just go wild party every night. They both hook up with woman played by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. While Jack is getting him self deeper into to trouble each day, Miles is just standing at the edge of life and is waiting to be pushed back into it.<br /><br />I would have given the movie three stars instead of four, but the acting is superb in this movie. Paul Giamatti is at his best. The movie not only has a plot, but some subtext as well. A well-written script, well edited for timing and flow.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>As many reviewers have nicely explained before me, this is a story about 2 friends, college roomates freshman year, that take a trip to wine country in california. Miles, an 8th grade english teacher, essentially on the verge of a nervous breakdown is helping his buddy Jack, a b-list advertisement/soap opera actor celebrate his upcoming wedding. Miles is a strugling writer, divorced two years and has trouble comming to terms with the loss. Jack, a womanizing sterotypical hollywood star, wants to get his grove on one last time before the wedding.  As you can see, this combo makes for an interesting weeks adventure. Mix in some fine wine, and let the show begin.<br /><br />I could drag this reveiw on and rehash the story like the reveiwers before me, but I'll spare future readers.  I just watched this movie for about the third time, and each time its like a fine wine, the humor and drama really come out with viewing.  I admit, I have not read the book, but if this movie is even half as good as the book, then the book is definitely a page-turner, one of those addictive ones you read cover to cover in one day.  So I strongly recommend this movie, it really was one of the best films of 2004, for once ebert and ropert were right, and the acadamy awards robbed it from best picture, stolen by million dollar baby, why?  So grab a glass of wine and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>I saw SIDEWAYS before all the hype and thoroughly enjoyed it...especially the reemergence of Virginia Madsen and a memorable performance by Thomas Haden Church.  It's a pretty, witty little movie about interesting albeit unlikeable folks who love drinking wine as much as I do.  When the reviews and box office begin to jettison SIDEWAYS into the stratosphere of "Blockbuster," I worried that going mainstream would detract from the simple pleasures to be derived from merely watching this cool "indie style" movie.<br /><br />That's why you'll enjoy the DVD...deleted scenes and a fun commentary track will bring the movie "back down to earth" for you.  Haden Church, particularly, is incredibly honest and clever in his commentary--there's a real genius and comic timing you wouldn't expect.  Hopefully, the attention and accolades he garnered for this role will allow him to showcase more of his talents in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Sideways is about 2 friends who take a week-long trip through California wine country before one of them gets married, and hook up with two hot women. The good things were the acting was excellent and the dialogue was written by a real writer, not some of the hacks that write most of the movies made today. The bad is it was pretty dull most of the time. I've heard this called a comedy masterpiece but I didn't see it. I don't think I laughed out loud once; I smiled and chuckled a few times. I did end up rooting for something good to happen to Paul Giamatti's character in the end, but some of his problems wouldn't have exitsed if he had a backbone. Thomas Hayden Church's character had no redeeming qualities I could see and I saw no reason why the two guys were even friends. There was also a scene that was unnecessarily vulgar. I like some of what they tried to do with Sideways, but it didn't work well enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This kaleidoscopic movie has certain highlights: structurally well made, with the taste and enrapturing company of the wine: this emblematic friendship drink. Around the standpoints of this kind connoisseur, we assist to a  road movie about two extremely closed friends: emotionally they are separated 180o  . One of them is profoundly depressed since his divorce two years ago, he has been unable to forget his ex wife Vicky ; he is a literature teacher and waits for the approbation for publishing his last auto biographical novel. He decides to make a true gift to his friend : an ex actor who finds himself at the edge of the collective forgetfulness, his narcissism rules and sharps his behavior with the women. Both of them are too worried by the pass of time and try to revive their vanished university experiences. Along the road they will meet two women: both of them are somehow the mirror image: they are divorced and find in the wine a good reason to live.<br /><br />The story maintains the surprise element in its two thirds parts: in fact our loser, isolated, frustrated and desperate writer seems to be emerged from the Woody Allen imagination: his memories don't allow to grow up and enjoy the little details the life gives us; his wine dissertations are cerebral<br /><br />But the film experiments a lack of creative breath since the announcement of Jack's marriage to Maya. From that instant the inspiration's light lacks intensity and the story becomes predictable: the magic starts to vanish.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen is terrific with this role that deserved her  a nomination in the Academy Awards. But we have to recognize and even celebrate the great return of the author cinema: there are some flashes in the script that remind me to the French filmmaker: Eric Rohmer. Visually arresting, the picture is a true hidden homage to the French New Wave and the savoir vivre!.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>Read the other reviews if you want the plot. The movie is about friendship, love, obsession, and existential angst. The acting and casting are excellent: Giamatti, Church, Madsen and Oh are all very good. The story is bittersweet, but the movie has some very funny scenes. The movie is literate and intelligent. My favorite part is when the characters of Giamatti and Madsen discuss why they love wine. The movie gives me insight into an obsession and a world of which I am not familiar.<br /><br />There are several scenes where the characters are talking, eating, drinking wine and enjoying life and each other. The movie works in part, because the characters seem to enjoy each others company. There is nothing I really dislike about the movie. The two main characters are not very likeable, but the movie works because the characters are not perfect or even good people. They are two losers and that is the point.<br /><br />The DVD has extra features. The deleted scenes are okay, but nothing stands out. The commentary by Church and Giammatti is funny, but not very poignant. They really enjoyed making the movie and they have an enjoyable self-deprecating sense of humor.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect and not everybody will like it. However, like a good wine, it has complexity, character, and depth.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>absolutely awesome film-hands down, the best of 2004, or should have been. incredible performances from all 4 principal actors, esp. paul giamatti, are superb! the film cannot be described-it must be "smelled", like a great glass of wine, in this case, a pinot. but the film, the story, everything about it is truly astounding from start to great finish! i had to see it twice in a packed movie house, now i am so over anxiously waiting for this superb dvd, i can barely breathe waiting for it's tuesday release. it is hilarious, sad, hypotrical, great-i mean great acting by all, i could go on for an hour here, but i won't! it is a real masterpiece of a comedy with raw, sore, human emotions that literally begs for a 2nd and third viewing. it'a s real keeper, an instant classic, and one masterpiece of a film!  bravos to all the marvelous cast-kudos for the producer/director for attempting it in the first place!  get it or rent it, but watch it over and over-the wine/whine will so very much go to yourhead, you are apt never to forget it-i have not been able to get it out of my mind since the theater!

Adapting Rex Pickett's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312342519">2004 novel</a> with Jim Taylor, Payne continues on the particularly idiosyncratic filmmaking path that he started with the hilariously acidic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007K028">Citizen Ruth</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001MXXJ">Election</a> and seemed to deepen with the meandering <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLSK">About Schmidt</a>. The premise of this 2004 film sounds flimsy on the surface - two guys, one about to get married, take a week-long trip through the Santa Barbara wine country as a last hurrah celebration filled with fine wine, good food and golf. But the execution of this plot is full of shrewd observations and so many delightfully unexpected scenes that seem like non-sequiturs at first but somehow mesh into a story that keeps you guessing what will come next. It's a fascinating journey, often hysterical, sometimes painful, about lost opportunities and facing one's deep-seeded fears.<br /><br />The characters are familiar and unpredictable at the same time, and the actors inhabiting them are terrific. In a relatively understated, finely detailed performance, Paul Giamatti provides the emotional core of the story as put-upon, unrelentingly dissatisfied Miles, the pinot wine aficionado so caught up in his passion for the grape he has no idea how pretentious he sounds. His character's aching, post-divorce vulnerability and decreased sense of worth wring truthfully through his hound dog expressions, excessive drinking and pained fits of anger. A failing novelist and quite likely an alcoholic, Miles hides behind his extensive wine knowledge to avoid getting hurt again even when confronted by a beautiful woman open to the possibility of starting a relationship with him. After years of medium-level success in TV sitcoms, Thomas Haden Church makes the ideal comic foil as Jack, a has-been soap star and self-proclaimed ladies' man who is not nearly ready to face commitment at the altar.<br /><br />The two actors have an easy and sometimes tense rapport as best friends with opposite approaches to life but a strong sense of devotion to each other. Their wine tasting scenes with a liberal use of jargon, in particular, are hilarious in that only-in-California sort of way. Of course, women complicate the journey. Sandra Oh shows surprising female swagger as wine pourer Stephanie, who blindly falls for all of Jack's lines. And it's gratifying to see Virginia Madsen make the most of a good role. This beautiful, searingly intelligent actress had been kicking around bad potboilers and horror flicks for over two decades, and it's about time someone saved her from Lifetime TV-movie hell. She plays the smart, wine-worshipping waitress Maya with lovely subtlety and has a wonderfully transfixing, wine-as-life monologue that makes Miles look all the more foolish for not capitalizing on the moment.<br /><br />But like a wine that peaks and fades, as she seductively describes, so does Miles in fits of depression that make his search for love and fulfillment an evasive proposition at best. The 2005 DVD package provides a wonderfully hilarious commentary track courtesy of the improvisational wit of Giamatti and especially Church, who seems to be a treasure trove of erudite trivia. Make sure to have the English subtitle feature on as they talk non-stop over the film. Their natural chemistry is unforced off-screen. Eight deleted scenes are included with Payne's written descriptions of what function they served and why they were ultimate excised. My favorite is a side trip to the mall to shop for a pair of sporty sneakers for Miles. There is a brief making-of featurette, totally dispensable, and the original theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>I would just like to add another positive review to this list,just because this movie was so...deep,so sad somehow,<br /><br />It made me feel so MANY things,and I never thought much about wine before I seen this movie...Driving through wine country and tasting along the way is what the story anchored on,But the people Miles and Jack come into contact with,how we connect with people we meet,was so true to life like.<br /><br /> Especially Miles character got to me so much. Jack was pretty shallow and his shenanigans were pretty..funny/stupid, but Miles character had raw EMOTION in everything he did and everyone he touched.<br /><br />I was happy we were left to believe he and Maya connected as a couple when he knocked at her door at the ending,His character was just so sad, unsure of himself,hurt after his breakup,dissapointed in all the people around him,and in life in general..<br /><br />If you are a person with a deep well of feeling,and an intelligent person, you will love this movie. It's one of a kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Wow! No wonder this film generated so much Oscar buzz last year...it is a SPECTACULAR little movie! Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a struggling novelist and wine snob who is disenchanted with his personal and professional life. He went through a painful divorce two years ago and hasn't had a relationship since then. He's also suffocating in his teaching position and is hoping that a publisher will finally accept his manuscript. Then there's Jack (Thomas Haden Church), Miles' best friend from college. Jack is a small-time actor who is getting married in a week, and he and Miles decide to embark on a final "guy trip" and spend a week touring the California vineyards. Miles and Jack are as different as night and day, and while Miles plans on simply having a good time with his friend, Jack fully intends to make the most of his final days of bachelorhood and has only one objective: to get laid.<br /><br />As they explore the vineyards, Miles and Jack encounter two women (Sandra Oh, Virginia Madsen) that they get to know over a series of double-dates. While Jack enjoys his last hurrah before saying "I do," Miles finds light at the end of the tunnel with Maya, a woman who awakens feeling in him that have been dead for a long time. "Sideways" makes clever comparisons between wine and people, and the film explores how individuals and couples evolve over time. This is a very simple movie, but it's definitely one of the best films I've seen in a while. Even though much of the film is bittersweet, there are certain scenes that had me laughing so hard that I cried. (Miles sneaking into that house to retrieve Jack's wallet...priceless!) Watch this movie as soon as you can!</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I saw this film late at night at hotel in Dallas, I was about to go to sleep and just started watching it and really liked it.  It's totally offbeat, but so well done.  Giamatti, is first rate as always and Church is his perfect foil.  It's a touching film and you really pull for Giamatti's character, you so want him to find some happiness, I can't think of any actor working today that is better at these type of parts than Giamatti.  This film really is a true comedy drama, parts of it are just hilarious, but parts are so raw you want to look away..really a very good film.  If you appreciate top notch acting and quality film work, then you will like this film, pop the DVD in and stick with it, you will be drawn in.</p></br><a href="../users/AMMEMPM9MPS55.html">AMMEMPM9MPS55</a><br/><p>I watched this twice on two consecutive days, and then vowed not to watch it again for a while - I have a tendency to indulge in too much of a good thing, and it ruins the experience. As it was, I really savoured this wonderful comic drama.<br /><br />The story concerns a would-be-novelist and wine connoisseur, divorced and depressed, dissatisfied as a high-school English teacher, and struggling financially. It's his best friend's wedding, and the two of them take off into Californian wine country for a last bit of fun together.<br /><br />This central relationship is beautifully portrayed. The two are poles apart on every level, having in common only the fact they shared a room together in college, and yet they share a strong bond that goes deep.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti's performance as Miles is the backbone of the film. You're always wondering what he's thinking, and even though for a long time you're unsure whether you even really *like* him, he immediately garners our sympathy, because his pain shows through in so many ways. He invests the character with all kinds of nuances.<br /><br />Having praised Giammati's performance, let's not underrate his support. His scenes with Virginia Madsen are particularly poignant. The porch scene, in which the script gets heavily into wine-as-metaphor-for-life territory, could have been disastrously pretentious, but it works because of two perfect performances and because it is obvious the characters are aware of what's going on - she's trying to communicate with something deep inside Miles, while he's trying to fasten his seatbelt and avoid getting close. Their deep connection, her warm heart and his hurt are so evident.<br /><br />Other delights in the film are the Californian landscape and Guy Rolfe's quirky, jazzy score. Payne is a great storyteller, and throws in lots of neat devices to tell us more about the characters and the story without having to hit us in the face with the script all the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Sideways" is an exceptionally fine comedy/drama for adults.<br /><br />This is the story of Miles and Jack [Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church]. Each has a mid-life crisis in full swing. Miles solution has been to become a wine expert, a pursuit that gives him intellectual satisfaction. Perhaps even better, it also gives him justification to drink a great deal. While Miles is still recovering from a bitter divorce, Jack's answer is to get married. Just before the nuptials, the guys take a road trip together to California's wine country. Miles, a frustrated writer, tries to teach Jack the intricacies of wine, but Jack is more interested in the intricacies of women. For him, the trip is just an excuse to have one last fling before settling down to married life. [We suspect Jack is just kidding himself!]<br /><br />Giamatti and Church are excellent. They create memorable characters. Equally memorable are Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh as Maya and Stephanie, the women the boys become involved with.<br /><br />"Sideways" is about equal parts drama and comedy, but it may be remembered more as a comedy because it contains many truly funny scenes. The movie remains true to itself right up to the ending, which is hopeful rather than happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Sideways" is excellent!

People who are dissing this film do it because they're reminded of their own pathetic lives. At least, that's my take on it.<br /><br />Cheers!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>It's always dangerous when you are late in coming to a small movie that has unexpectedly hit the big time -- your viewing enjoyment may be hampered by the crushing weight of expectations.  It's wonderful when you can be among the first to see small-budget classics like Stanely Tucci's "Big Night," but I didn't get to see "Sideways" until after the Oscar nominations, the critics' Top 10 lists, and so on.  How could "Sideways" possibly live up to these awesome credentials?<br /><br />Well, "Sideways" does live up to its billing, and it does so through one simple virtue -- truth.  "Sideways" is an extremely funny and insightful examination of two men struggling with their mediocrity -- one who is all too aware of his shortcomings, and another who uses a pathetic Peter Pan syndrome to keep at bay the harsh glare of reality.<br /><br />The self-aware guy is Miles (the lovable schlub Paul Giamatti), a recently divorced middle school English teacher who's having a difficult time getting his novel published . . . or even explained.  Miles is awash in bitterness, but he knows deep down that he's a sweet guy once you get past the sour layers (of which there are many).  The ignorant guy is Jack (Thomas Hayden Church), Miles' freshman roommate from San Diego State and a mildly successful actor.  Jack is one of those guys who should be thankful for the successes he has, but is incapable of doing so because by accepting a given success, he is placing a ceiling on his dreams.<br /><br />The "plot" of "Sideways" revolves around Jack's impending marriage.  Engaged to a rich beauty and walking down the aisle on Saturday, Jack gets escorted by Miles for a week of freedom in the California central coast wine country.  While wine, for Jack, is a means for getting drunk, it is a religion for Miles.  Of course, it's obvious to anyone who spends five minutes with Miles that he uses his mastery of wine as a defense mechanism ("I appreciate great wine, so I must be worth something") - thanks to the witty script, "there's just like the faintest soup?on of like, uh, asparagus," has entered our lexicon of pretentious criticism.  Miles can use his focus on wine to avoid meeting people who could possibly reject him.<br /><br />That's difficult on this trip, because Miles has met his soulmate, Maya (Virginia Madsen), who is a waitress at a wine country restaurant.  Miles and Maya share a devotion to wine, and Miles is continuously surprised at the depth and character of this woman.  The question of whether Miles can break out of his various layers of emotional armor to forge a connection with this delightful woman dominates the movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Miles, Jack is as shallow as Miles is deep.  In a classic self-destructive move, Jack gets involved with Stepanie (Sandra Oh), a vibrant single mother and good friend of Maya's.  A pell-mell romance ensues, with the ever-so-slight complication that Jack hasn't told Stephanie about his impending marriage.  Watching Jack skirt emotional ruin while selfishly justifying his caddish behavior is a gruesome delight.<br /><br />Through it all, the script for "Sideways" puts believable, memorable lines into the mouths of these talented actors.  Long narratives about wine reveal surprising details of the speakers, and each character receives a separate, distinct voice (this isn't a Quentin Tarantino movie where all the actors sound like Saint Quentin, or a George Lucas movie where all the actors sound like idiots).  A "talky" movie, "Sideways" never runs out of steam.<br /><br />There is plenty of humor in "Sideways," but most of it is reserved - you will chuckle more often than laugh outright - but there are a few gut-busting moments, as well.<br /><br />"Sideways" is an attractive movie, but it is shot with a realistic eye -- the California wine country looks great, but this is not an "eye candy" movie like "Under the Tuscan Sun," which looked sumptuous but had little else to offer.  "Sideways" gets the balance of visuals and substance just right - one can easily imagine Miles liking his own movie, and that is high praise.</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>The Film<br /><br />What a great film. Sideways is one of the few movies based on a book that improves a good deal over its source material. And it is absolutely hilarious. The reason I like Sideways, for better or for worse, is I know both Jack and Miles too well. At one time or another, I've walked in both of their shoes. Alexander Payne reaches a zenith of sorts with his quiet eccentric style. The film blends friendship, the road trip and a party flick. The wine provides an interesting tenor to boot. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are completely irreplaceable in their respective roles. They're sort of cosmopolitan R2D2 and C3P0 roadies.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />There's been a lot of complaints over perceived Blu-Ray quality over the standard DVD.  I can tell you, the Blu-Ray is better.  On a large 1080p screen, there is a noticeable difference.  Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael created a unique look for the visuals to give the film a signature feel.  All those smudgy light plumes, and glowing highlights come from diffusion and slight overexposure folks, maybe even a shot of digital grading to punch the highlights.  None of those things lend themselves to the sharpest end products - the end product is a vintage style soft image.  The Blu-Ray IS indeed better. There is no way i would choose the DVD over this. If you don't have a big enough 1080p screen for it to matter, however, the DVD will probably suffice.  But come on, at $10 for the BD, why choose the DVD?</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Tonight had been the first time I seen this film and the reason why it took me so long to see this film was because it wasn't high on my "Must See List." At the end of this film I quite enjoyed it and for many reasons. One may be that I will never see a commemorative Sideways bottle of wine or the Sideways happy meal at McDonald's. My point is that Sideways is a great movie and nothing more. It doesn't rely on blockbuster star power. It doesn't need flashy special effects or gimmicks. Paul Giammatti performs flawlessly as a flawed and deeply troubled character. I found myself forgetting he was acting. I only saw the character he was playing and became engrossed by his presence. Thomas Haden Church offers a very nice contrast by playing what appears to be a two-dimensional, sophomoric, womanizer.<br /><br />The story is simple and focuses more on character development. It is easy to connect with each of the main characters. They may not be likable but what they are is human. If you can't relate to them personally, they remind you of a family member or close friend.<br /><br />Overall, this film is for those who like movies based in reality, which as you will see can produce some of the most bizarre and comical situations of all. If you like movies with jokes you don't have to think about (Who doesn't from time to time) don't worry, this film has a surprisingly high amount of low brow, and immature humor. While it is so easy to resort to the wine as metaphor - as the film amply does with smart, sharp and pungent dialogue - the film is a full-bodied, never precocious vintage that needs to be savored in a desirable bouquet of cinematic finesse.  Give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Since it's tough to classify (it's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and not quite anything else) and  it rewards repeated viewing, it's probably no surprise that Sideways wasn't exactly a commercial blockbuster on the level of Jurassic Park, but that didn't stop it from being probably the best movie released last year.  Although granted, I've been a total Alexander Payne sycophant since I went and saw Election back when I was 20, so I may be somewhat biased.  There's just something he manages to put in every one of his movies that can appeal to just about anyone who takes the time to appreciate them, and this one is no exception.  Sideways is certainly far from the twisted and violent fare I typically patronize, but no matter.  I also hate wine, which occupies a good deal of the focus in this movie, but that proved to be nothing more than a minor stumbling block as well.  This is, to put it simply, a brilliant movie, sometimes not all that easy to watch but in the end all the better for it.  Those accustomed to movies with tidy plots and unambiguous endings will probably find themselves disappointed with this one, but I actually found its irregular rhythms and relaxed pace to be a welcome deviation from the norm.  Sideways is filled with open spaces, uncomfortable silences, and some truly painful moments, but it's also filled with hilarious, deadpan dialogue, occasionally unlikable but persistently believable characters, and random bits of outrageous slapstick humor and unforgettable imagery.  At its best, this movie perfectly captures the boredom, frustration, and mounting indignities of lives that don't turn out the way we think they will.  Not to mention, it further demonstrates Payne's genius when it comes finding meaning and hilarity in the lives of completely ordinary people.<br /><br />Payne has long since demonstrated a knack for crafting characters who are deeply flawed but strangely sympathetic at the same time, and in Miles Raymond he may have his best protagonist yet.  Played in note-perfect fashion down to the minutest facial expression by Paul Giamatti, Miles is a pudgy bundle of nerves, hangups, and regrets who could turn a trip to the bathroom into an occasion for negativity and self-loathing.  This guy is, for lack of a better term, a tool, but at the same time he's the kind of tool you can easily find yourself sympathizing with, even rooting for, in spite of his many less-than-stellar qualities.  Stuck teaching English to eighth-graders while he tries to get his mammoth novel published, and still trying to get over his three-year-old divorce, Miles is rocketing towards middle age and clearly primed for a blowup.  At more than one point in the movie, I found myself thinking Miles was a prime candidate to be found dangling at the end of a rope in his bachelor pad by the end.<br /><br />It's against this backdrop that Miles embarks on a weeklong bachelor-party trip to California wine country with Jack (Thomas Haden Church), his mismatched best buddy, who's looking to score some action before his wedding.  Jack is everything Miles isn't: a laid-back, charming, seat-of-his-pants-living actor who means well but seems completely oblivious to the consequences of his actions.  Although it starts out promisingly enough, the trip quickly becomes an ordeal for Miles as his lack of anything meaningful in common with Jack and his utter discomfort in social situations become increasingly apparent.  It ends up descending into a tangle of lies, infidelity, recriminations, and resentments, as the movie explores such weighty subjects as friendship, love, and the meaning of life without ever being heavy-handed or manipulative about it. There are also plenty of classic comedy moments thrown in to lighten the mood a bit, a few of which rival even anything from Election in terms of hilarity: Miles's erm, vehement objections to ordering Merlot on a double date; his complete meltdown at a low-grade winery when he can't get enough to drink; his discovery of Jack violating a woman in their hotel room; and of course the indelible image of an overweight couple having makeup sex.<br /><br />In a wise move, Payne decides to leave the camera on Miles througout the movie (repeating the device he used with Jack Nicholson's character in About Schmidt), a strategy that pays off as we get to see him at his highest and (mostly) lowest moments, capturing the mounting desperation and alienation that he experiences.  This is obviously a guy who has major difficulty connecting with people, a trait that's certainly not going to serve him well as he continues getting older and less attractive.  The only hope he manages to find comes in the form of Mya (Virginia Madsen, who's old enough to be my much older sister but still pretty hot), a local waitress with whom he manages to form an unlikely connection in spite of himself.  To its credit, though, the movie even leaves that relationship open-ended, as there's ultimately only a hint of an indication where it's going to end up, fitting the air of uncertainty that generally prevails.  The depiction of their relationship is kept pretty low-key, but in a movie that's generally as subdued as this one it wouldn't feel right otherwise.<br /><br />Just in the case the movie isn't enough (which it should be) the DVD edition comes with a commentary from Giamatti and Church that just may be the BEST COMMENTARY TRACK EVER, even better than the classic Henry Hill commentary from the special edition of Goodfellas.  Too many director commentaries wind up dwelling excessively on the technical aspects of the movies, but obviously there's no concern about that here, as the two actors seem intent on just having a good time.  The tone of the commentary is mock pretentious and consistently self-deprecating, as Giamatti and Church spend two hours making high-toned allusions and ripping on themselves as well as occasionally talking about the movie.  At some points it's even funnier than the movie itself, which is saying something.  Not to mention, it reveals that Paul Giamatti is the son of none other than A. Bartlett Giamatti, the late former commissioner of Major League Baseball best known for banning Pete Rose, one of those little-known facts that are always nice to find out when watching a DVD.  Oh and of course, it goes without saying that you should pick up the widescreen edition, as the transfer you get with it is decidedly excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Despite being hesitant about watching this (the director was behind the overrated About Schmidt) i came out of the theater reasonably happy that i did.<br /><br />While "Sideways" is actually a film that blends many familiar themes in its plot it manages to introduce them achieving an atmosphere that makes it a very warm and ultimately very human film. These themes include a traditional loser type who cant get over his collapsed marriage (Giammati) and who has become self-loathing and bitter about it as well as about his soon NOT to be published book, and his friend who fully exploits him for a few sexual adventures before he himself gets married as they both embark in a weekly trip culminating to the wedding.<br /><br />  Now, if you feel that the storyline might be one of those pseudo-intellectual comedies rest assured that it isn't.<br /><br />  Sideways is genuingly funny in a manner that we all know real life can be. It's also equally tragic mostly because the loser of the story is a terrifically convincing character, one of those people that actually proclaim themselves losers even though they possess wonderful qualities that they themselves do not realise. This character is given a great performance by Giammati, one that should easily be considered for Oscar material even if the film doesnt have the otherwise flashy credentials recquired for such a consideration.<br /><br />The world of "Sideways" evolves around this loser and his efforts to somehow fit in despite his defeats. His closest friend isnt too interested in saving him and couldnt even if he intended to. Not only that but he leads him from one hilarious disaster onto another. Hilarious yes, farsical even, but still very believable. The scriptwriter obviously managed to achieve a very fine balance here, without which we'd have another fine idea messed up on celluloid.<br /><br />I's definetely not a situational comedy as most of the charm of the film is based on some seriously self-sarcastic and poignant dialogue and this counts as an extra asset to it.<br /><br />One of the bigger surprises in films this year, "Sideways" shouldnt be ignored by anyone who looks for a comedy which isnt really a comedy or for a drama which isnt that either, but something in between which will have you laughing and thinking at the same time..</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Sideways" is a buddy film where a bachelor week to wine country in Northern California allows two good friends to enjoy some time away from the city.<br /><br />Protagonists Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are at different stages in their lives with Miles clinically depressed because of his divorce and Jack about to take the plunge for the first time in his life.<br /><br />The two are an unlikely pair as Miles presents as considerate while Jack is reckless and is only interested in thrills for himself.<br /><br />During their trip away they put themselves in situations which bring out the best and the worst in each other.

What begins as a tour of California wineries and golf courses takes a fateful turn as the groom-to-be makes clear his intention to sample more than just prestigious vintages and pristine fairways.  It is a dearth of the more salacious pleasures (rather those of dusky pinots and well-manicured greens) that Jack anticipates with the coming of married life, as his quest for wanton female companionship becomes the focus of their trip.  This change of agenda proves to be unnerving to poor Miles: an intellectual oenophile, English teacher, and frustrated novelist still gun shy in wake of his recent divorce.  Nevertheless, these adventures prove illuminating for these two very different friends.  While Miles, at the urging of the gregarious Jack, attempts to be more outgoing, Jack ultimately seems to take to heart Mile's concern regarding his reckless behavior.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>There's a temptation to say that I thought this movie was a little overrated.<br /><br />The movie is either going to connect with you or it isn't.  I was pleased that I finally saw it.  A friend of mine is planning a wine-tasting trip to everywhere the movie went (which are all real places, I believe--even the Hitching Post).<br /><br />The cast is outstanding.  The production is top-notch.  But it takes a while to get going.  I don't know if it needed all that set-up to get the characters going but I stuck it out through a dry opening.  Miles, the Paul Giammatti character, nearly loses me right off the bat.  Okay, he's a frustrated writer who isn't going anywhere (I just watched WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and that was about TWO frustrated writer/teachers who didn't go anywhere).  Fine.  But when he steals money from his mother...how do you get "lovable loser" back after that?  Misstep or really revealing character flaw?  That's up to each viewer.<br /><br />His hopeless behavior with women and then adding alcohol to unleash darker rages didn't help either.  He is such a loser by the midpoint that, instead of seeing him pull it together and win the girl or whatever happy ending you want to tag on this, I wanted to see him pay for his boorish behavior to everyone.<br /><br />Thankfully, Thomas Haden Church is on hand to goose this movie to life.  His wild, reckless needs give an unpredictable energy to everything.

He might look as innocous as they come with his balding feature but he manages to actually become the soul of character,that of a writer who is helplessly in love with wine and the fading memory of his ex-wife, quite perfectly. Along with a friend, he manages to stunt my expectations and come out with a film that I wasnt expecting one bit. This film has excitement,that of a kind of it's own, this film is not funny, not one bit but yet it is meant for a patient viewer who's been yearning to watch a film of a "Certain" kind for a long time.<br /><br />Sideways will entertain you if you read the first para rather well. I might have failed in nailing the point and convincing you but atleast you know how I feel.<br /><br />(Please See or)PS:<br /><br />You might call me stupid for naming my review so but I got you to read it in this heap of 519 reviews, out of which I read just one before watching Sideways.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />In the scene where Paul goes to the loo and curses himself for not being able to kiss the girl behind the door, I saw myself. I saw and I relate to that scared bald man who's too scared of the world they live. It perfectly,without preaching, managed to clinch the silent tenacity of such individuals irrespective of the result of the character's actions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>SIDEWAYS is the film that made pinot noir the in-wine for a generation and reduced once-chic merlot to near pariah status. I still enjoy a nice merlot but I have to admit that I now know about and buy pinot noir which I did not do before I first saw SIDEWAYS. (One wonders if pinot noir vineyards had an investment in this film. Hmmmm....) Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a hyper, twitchy would-be novelist, recently divorced, and Thomas Haden Church plays his best friend Jack, a laid-back, hunky, second-rate actor. Both take a boys-only, wine-tasting excursion together through the vineyards of California. For Miles this is an opportunity perhaps to contemplate his failed marriage. For Jack, it is his last time to get laid before getting married. Miles, the nuerotic nerd, is a serious student of wines and Jack, the shallow stud, is a serious student of women. One wonders how these two complete opposites ever became best friends. But, putting convenient and somewhat strange screenplay logic aside, Miles and Jack together find adventure, romance and redemption on the road. I have seen SIDEWAYS twice; the second time I enjoyed it more than the first viewing. It is a film that grows on you; a character study and a film with some depth, the perfect antidote to mindless thrillers. The scene where Miles and a recently divorced acquaintance of Miles, played by Virginia Madsen, passionately discuss what they like about wine is worth the price of admission. SIDEWAYS is one of the best films of the year or maybe the decade. Rent it or buy it but enjoy it with a bottle of pinot noir.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>I was a little surprised to see this billed as a comedy.  Not that I didn't experience many wry grins, tickling chuckles, and some outright belly laughs as I watched it.  I did.  And it is a whole lot funnier than most movies that are supposed to be comedies.  But this is not a comedy, per se.  It is a relationship movie.  It is a buddy movie.  It is a brilliant tour de force by Alexander Payne, who along with Jim Taylor wrote the script, and who directed, based on the novel by Rex Pickett.  On the basis of seeing two of his movies, this and Election (1999) I can say without the slightest doubt, Payne is one very talented man who has Hollywood by the proverbials.<br /><br />Both the script and the direction were superb.  One might say Payne spent a little too much time developing character, but when you see the result, you have to say, it was worth it.  Yes, the movie begins a little slowly, just a little.  Everything seems a little on the ordinary side.  There is not much happening.  We can see that Miles is one of life's losers and that his best bud Jack is one of life's lucky guys.  They are off to the wine country for one last buddy time together before Jack gets married.<br /><br />Jack is a sometime, somewhat talented actor.  God, I knew a few of those guys.  And Miles is a talented but somehow failed writer, a school teacher who has penned a 750-page novel.  Oh, Lord let me buy you a Mercedes Benz.  (Sorry that lyric just slipped in.)  He also reminds me of someone.<br /><br />Miles recently (two years ago actually) got dumped by the true love of his life, his now ex-wife Victoria.  And Jack, bless his heart, is about to marry a very well appointed and very nice looking young woman who lives in a grand house in Palos Verdes (in the script; in the movie it's more like BelAir or thereabouts--which amount to about the same thing).  And so off the two go for wine and golf and the open road.  But be back by Friday night for the rehearsal.  (I'll say no more about that, but keep the word "rehearsal" in mind.  Those who have seen the movie know what I mean.)<br /><br />All right I confess.  This movie hit home with me.  I have been there and done that in a number of ways.  In fact, the familiarity kind of put me off at the beginning.  I mean, I have been to France and I have drunk Chateau Cheval Blanc, and to be honest I have also drunk great burgundies with (God help us) fast food, although unlike Miles I took the food home; I wouldn't de-sanctify the wine by drinking it on the sly at a diner.  By the way, Cheval Blanc is NOT a burgundy and it not made with Pinot Noir grapes.  It is a red wine from Bordeaux made with Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes.<br /><br />And I and a buddy dated two young women many years ago and almost the same thing happened.  But never mind.<br /><br />In other words, the movie is realistic, so much so that I suspect a lot of viewers will find something in it that relates directly and even spookily to their own lives.  Watch it and see.<br /><br />Can you be too realistic?  Can a movie be so absolutely true to life that it...what?  Loses something?  Is too painful?  Is too prosaic?  Well, I almost thought that in the beginning.  But the movie is so well planned, so well contrived (if you will) so aggressively true to life and honest about human nature that I came within a hair breath of turning it off.<br /><br />Don't you do that!  Don't give up on this movie!  It is craftily planned to reward the viewer with a most interesting and enjoyable movie experience.  This is not to say it is perfect.  Some of the wine dialogue is compromised because what is said must make sense to the general viewer while at the same time remain true (almost) to what afficionados of wine would actually say.  And yes, Payne could have cut to the chase a little quicker.  But sometimes the appetite is whetted when the meal is delayed.<br /><br />In addition to a brilliant script and some very fine direction from Payne, the movie is blessed with some excellent casting.  Paul Giamatti is perfect as Miles, who really is not a loser.  Thomas Haden Church is exactly right as the attractive and confident, every-hustling, womanizing, marginal actor who will get his comeuppance in the next life, not in this one.  Sandra Oh provides a perfect fit as the Asian-American who falls heavily for American men who are not necessarily of Asian descent; and Virginia Madsen keeps just enough of her beauty hidden to be believable as the waitress with a head on her shoulders.<br /><br />I guess I could give Hollywood the ultimate compliment and say that this movie is so slick that it doesn't seem in the slightest bit slick.  That it is so realistic that one never thinks for a moment that it is contrived.  To paraphrase somebody, the essence of the art of story, whether it be a novel, a short story or a movie, is in believable characters in believable situations doing the things we all do, but in a way that goes beyond realism to artistry.  If you can fake that you can make it big not only in Hollywood but anywhere there is an audience, a viewer, a reader, anybody who seeks to be enlightened and entertained and experience the catharsis that art can bring.<br /><br />See this for director Alexander Payne who knows what he is doing at all times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Sideways tells of a weekend road trip shared by Jack and Miles - two unlikely friends who are also borderline losers - during a pivotal weekend of their lives.  Jack, an unaccomplished actor, is about to marry a woman he doesn't really love.  Miles, an unaccomplished writer and wine enthusiast, has already lost the woman he loves, and is on the verge of having his just-finished novel rejected by his publisher.  Though trapped in an existence teaching literature to unimpressed high-schoolers, and unlikely to make an impact with his own writing, Miles is buoyed by his wine senses.  (Especially Pino, the sensitive grape that requires lots of TLC; he resolutely refuses to even look at Merlot, which seems to be the Paris Hilton of wines.)  Looking for distractions, the two drive out to California's wine country for an antidepressant-free weekend of fine wines, good food and wholesome golf.  Jack - out of a mixture of sympathy for the downtrodden Miles and his own compulsion for pleasure - is determined to have both of them...serviced.  Miles is smart enough to see through Jack's plans - which include a passionate and free-spirited winery pourer named Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and a pretty waitress named Maya (Virginia Madsen) - but lacks the force of will to object to them.  Jack won't listen to reason - even as a failed actor, he's ruled by his actor's instincts.  Of course neither Maya nor Stephanie know of Jack's wedding plans, and Miles overlooks the imminent possibility that his novel won't be published.  Jack salves his near-dead ego by feeding his passion for fine wines -sampling the finest Pinot and also sharing his intellectual love with Maya.<br /><br />Almost everybody in this flick loves wines (or in the case of Jack, he shares an emotional bond with everybody else into wines).  Happily "Sideways" manages not to become a movie about wines (like "Year of the Comet") as much as a story about people who are into wines.  We're never asked to accept the virtues of the vine as much as recognize why the characters have a weakness for it.  For its passion, "Sideways" is a soft-spoken movie that never becomes remote.  Not a laugh-riot, it does have its comic moments - mostly towards the end of Jack & Miles's strange weekend.  Giamatti works pretty well for a depressive character who seems to seek in wine what he knows he can't find in other people; Church also excels as another seemingly unsympathetic character - he lies and exploits, though it's obvious that he's the most consistent victim of his own instincts and desires; Sandra Oh rises to the occasion but gets little attention from the story; Virginia Madsen is a revelation as Maya, who seems to be as sensitive as Miles.<br /><br />It's no spoiler to reveal that nothing happens as our heroes planned, yet like a glass of fine wine, we pretty much see the end from the beginning, and savor instead the taste left between the two moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Sideways won an Academy Award for best Adaptation.  I have heard the frustration in reviews from folks that don't like wine lovers, Lost In Translation, or wry, witty situations.  They want belly laughs, feces jokes, more naked people, or less naked people.<br /><br />I didn't care for Paul Giamatti in American Splender.  This had less to do with Giamatti than my own distaste for characters and screenplays that whine about the human condition.  In Sideways, I got over it.  Giamatti is a very fine actor.  If you want to see the difference between good acting and poor, see Adam Sandler in Spanglish and then Giamatti in Sideways.  It's a revelation.<br /><br />The events of our buddy movie seem a bit stretched, especially the lost wallet scenes, which though funny, couldn't actually happen.  Drowning your sorrow in wine, that could happen and most of the film is pinned on the idea that two opposites from their college days could drive around picturesque wine country, get drunk, get laid, and in one character at least, learn something about the grueling trials of manly life.  Sideways is not perfect, but it does have a nutty, aromatic, fruity bouquet.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Hollywood needs more films like this. Director Alexander Payne took a gigantic risk in choosing non superstar actors for major roles- Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Alexander Payne Thomas Hadden Church (Jack) and sending these two guys, facing various mid life difficulties, on a road trip just prior to Jack's upcoming wedding to a smart girl in San Diego. Miles is a failed novelist, sensitive intellectual and Pinot Noir quaffing wine snob who awaits news on his 750 page autobiographical novel which is churning around a small publishing house in New York, and looks forwards to a civilized, convivial week of good food and wine with his one time college roomate. Jack on the other hand is a compulsive ass chaser who wants one more bout of sexual freedom before he ties the knot. The friends' two personalities grate terrifically, which makes for some superb character comedy .<br /><br />Sideways works so well because the characters of Miles and Jack are so realistically and intelligently drawn by Payne, bringing them from Rex Pickett's novel to the screen with thoughtful dexterity. Every man at some point in his life has been a Miles (self pitying, depressed, anxious about his failings with women) or a Jack (anxious to get his rocks off), or if not has encountered men like this.<br /><br />The comedy is a mixture of high farce (the scenes when Jack is playing the field as ferociously as he can in his final pre- marital days), and the more poignant comedy of self absorbed anquish (such as when Miles pours the tasting bucket in a wine tasting bar over himself in a climactic moment of self loathing and mental collapse). The romantic sagas of the two guys perfectly reflects their characters. Jack wastes no time in going to bed with Stephanie (played by Sandra Oh who is one of those women with a unique, indefinable sex appeal) whereas Miles is more unnerved by the whole process and needs to be jolted into action by the almost implausibly tolerant Maya (Virginia Madsen). The sexual tension between them allows some poignant scenes. Miles, unable to communicate his emotions in bare form uses wine as a metaphor for his existence - he adores Pinot Noir because it is a delicate grape that requires nurturing, not a survivor in all situations like the more common Cabernet (which reads obviously as a metaphor for the more sexually confident Jack).<br /><br />If there is a criticism, it is that the characters are perhaps too crassly drawn as representing the various totems of male mid life crisis too one sidedly, and the extras on the DVD are missable - a trite, self indulgent commentary on the movie by Giamatti and Hadden Church and some deleted scenes. But Sideways is an important film that suggests there is a potential for quality filmaking in contemporary Hollywood that doesn't solely involve one dimensional glamour models thrashing around in formulaic plots that touch the subtleties of human relationships not one jot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a wine aficionado, an aspiring writer, and a high school English teacher. He wants to take his friend since college, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), on a wine tour before Jack gets married. Jack is anxious to sow a few wild oats before he gets hitched, and also wants Miles to sow a few of his own, so Miles can get over the depression of his divorce. Jack is a bounder, a bit of a cad, and an aging rake. He is an actor, primarily television, soap operas, and commercials. His career has peaked, though, and he sees marriage as his last chance. But before that ball and chain gets strapped on to his ankle, he manages to hook up with Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and fixes Miles up with Maya (Virginia Madsen). Together they will go on a double date that will take them through deception to ultimate truth, and for Jack and Miles, it will be a lesson in life, betrayal, and a chance for redemption.<br /><br />Sideways is a great film about 4 humans, each with their own good points and flaws. It was played by 4 actors, each with their own virtues and shortcomings. There was also a writer, who wrote a book that was turned into a screenplay by the director. The director was married to one of the actresses in real life. She was quoted as saying that her favorite rock musician was Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips, because he looked like her husband, Alexander Payne, and she could fantasize that she was married to a rock star. They married shortly before starting the film project, and divorced soon after. In an interview on NPR Sandra Oh said that it was all right working with a spouse, but on the way home from the set each night, they would talk about themselves in the third person. Alexander would say, "So, was the director being too harsh with you today?" I am speculating that some of the steamy love scenes might have created a lot of friction, that wasn't being resolved because of their oblique approach to conflict resolution, the third person discussions of themselves, the disguised arguments that must have come off like some kind of passive-aggressive Olympics.<br /><br />Sandra Oh gave an excellent performance in Sideways. Nowadays she plays Dr Christina Yang on Gray's Anatomy. I used to like the TV show, but the preposterous plots finally got in the way of my enjoyment of the strong characters. I stopped believing in it, I think, after Dr Gray somehow got her hand stuck on a bomb that might go off if she let go, while in the OR next door, another doctor's lover was having brain surgery, and then, they realized that all of the oxygen tubes that ran throughout the hospital would ignite if even a small bomb went off, it would start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire hospital. Puh-lease.<br /><br />I have been watching Oh work since she made The Diary of Evelyn Lau for Canadian television. Evelyn Lau ran away from home, and became a drug addict, a prostitute, and a poet and a writer. Out of 1,000 young women who auditioned for the role, Oh got the part, and gave a very memorable performance, so I wasn't surprised to see her turn up again in Sideways, and doing Oh so well.<br /><br />Her character in Sideways is Stephanie, a single mother who works as a bartender in a winery. She is very knowledgeable about wine, and also has a zest for living. Even though she may be a product of the wish fulfillment principle, she was a very real person, who was totally believable. If I met her, I might pinch myself, but there she was.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen, who played Maya, was also fantastic. Her brother, Michael Madsen, played a cold blooded killer who gleefully sliced off a man's ear while rocking out to Stuck in The Middle with You by Stealer's Wheel in Quentin Tarrentino's Reservoir Dogs. I guess acting talent runs in their family, because she was equally convincing in her role as a wine country waitress studying for her Master's degree in Horticulture (I am surprised that Miles didn't pun "You can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think" at that point). She not only feigned attraction to Miles, but also gave an excellent monologue about how much she loved wine, and how she came to realize that she loved wine.  She was too good to be true, but there she was.<br /><br />Alexander Payne did a great job of directing. Repeated viewings constantly reward you with new details and insights into how well the story was paced, how the momentum flowed, how little details were juxtaposed to either counterpoint or enhance the main action. The settings were all so well chosen. California, from Los Angeles to the little wine country towns. The wineries, the Wind Mill motel, the golf courses, The Hitching Post restaurant. There seemed to be a bit of a wind mill motif running through it all, as if they were on a quixotic journey, and The Hitching Post was a foreshadowing of Jack's eminent marriage. One scene in a restaurant with elaborately carved woodwork in the faux Danish town of Solvang was reminiscent of Pinocchio and Lampwick before setting off to Pleasure Island. Another scene was filmed in a run down house that had recently been a meth lab, and was left intact, except for a new door that replaced the one the cops busted down. The cinematography was excellent, with colors that were almost pastel, or depending on the mood, dark and foreboding. Payne takes risks, making Miles and Jack do despicable things, daring you to not care about the characters.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church has a life that in some ways parallels his character Jack. He is an actor who has appeared in sitcoms, maybe not soap operas, but he was the mechanic Lowell on Wings, and played Ned in Ned and Stacy. Wings wasn't a very good show, but he was someone who really stood out. You just knew that if only he had the right vehicle, he could really shine. Sideways is that vehicle. There are so many great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life. The way he praises the latest draft of Miles' novel, though he obviously hasn't read it. The way he keeps three condoms for himself and gives Miles one when they all end up at Stephanie's after their double date. And then later the next day, takes it back. And for this, he was nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />Miles is exasperating and pretentious. As they embark on their journey, they stop off to visit Miles' mother. He steals money from her. How can you care about someone who would do that? He is passionate about wine, especially Pinot Noir, and seems sincere and genuine, but is an alcoholic, or at least using wine to escape from his problems--one of them being excessive drinking. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast in this role. He has the middle aged paunch, the bald spot, the pretentious bohemian goatee, and a flair for physical comedy. He played Harvey Peckar in American Splendor, and has that quirky, awkward, misfit kind of character down. He can go from funny to sad in 60 seconds. There are lots of great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life, like the way he sprinkles his vocabulary with French, does crossword puzzles from the New York Times in pen, and refuses to drink Merlot, because it is too prosaic, too much the worn out clich&eacute;.<br /><br />If Sideways was a bottle of wine instead of a movie, it would be Pinot Noir, not Merlot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Sideways follows old friends Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Church) on a final road trip before Jack's wedding. Miles, a wine enthusiast and failed writer, takes B-list actor Jack to the California wine country, where he envisions them sipping pinot noir and enjoying delicious food. Jack, however, sees the trip as a final opportunity to sow his very wild oats before entering into the eternal servitude of marriage. As expected, the trip doesn't turn out quite as either friend has planned it.<br /><br />The cinematography in this film was absolutely beautiful, with magnificent sweeping pans of the California countryside. As well, I really appreciated how the film, through the eyes of Miles, explored the world of wine and food. It was passionate and interesting.<br /><br />Also, let me add my voice to the chorus of people who were surprised when Paul Giamatti was not nominated for an Academy Award last year. He did a great job in Sideways. What I liked best about Miles was that he was a contradictory character, like so many of us are. He did bad things, like steal money from his mother and lie to his best friend, but he was also capable of great loyalty, self-examination, and devotion. (On the flip side, I felt that Jack was almost a total idiot, with very few redeeming characteristics to his muddy name.)<br /><br />I also liked the way that, although the story didn't end with everything tied up in a nice bow, you definitely felt that Miles was going to be all right, that he was going to make it just fine. Sometimes all people need is one person who really gives a hoot about them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Sideways (Alexander Payne, 2004)<br /><br />According to IMDB, Sideways won ninety-four awards worldwide, and was nominated for over a score more, including Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards. Having now seen it, I cannot for the life of me understand why. This is a romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor funny. Its pacing is interminable, its characters stupid, its script (adapted by Payne from Rex Pickett's novel) an interesting if failed attempt at... something. I could never quite figure out what.<br /><br />Plot: Jack (Wings' Thomas Haden Church) is about to get married, and his friend Miles (Paul Giamatti, recently of The Hawk Is Dying) takes him on the ultimate bachelor party: a week in Napa wine country. There, the two run into Miles' old friend Maya (The Haunting in Connecticut's Virginia Madsen) and her party-girl friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy). Jack, in the pursuit of getting Miles hooked up with the recently-divorced Maya, finds himself hooked up with Stephanie, which leads to a possible crisis in his future; does he want to marry the safe girlfriend at home, or drop everything and ride off into the sunset with Stephanie? And meanwhile, can Miles grow enough of a spine to finally woo Maya, who's obviously attracted to him? Oh, and I should add that all of these characters (save Jack, who could care less) know far more about wine than you or I ever will, and never let you forget it.<br /><br />Now, because it's been addressed in a couple of reviews I've read, I'll start off by saying that my problem with these characters is not that they are, in the main, hateful, depraved beasts. I generally love movies with hateful, depraved beasts as characters (viz., for example, The Sweet Smell of Success). No, my problem with these characters is one that literary types know as the golden rule: these characters, with one exception, do not change. And that one exception is not Miles; he's as spineless at the end of the movie as he is in the beginning. (I hope that's not a spoiler.) Unless he feels there's no chance he'll get caught, Miles takes no initiative unless he's prodded to the point where he has no other choice, from the first scene to the last. As Miles is the center of the movie, that he doesn't change is the cardinal sin.<br /><br />Not that the movie doesn't have other problems. The pacing is constantly undermined by the movie stopping to talk wine. Which, I guess, is fine if you're a wine snob. And yes, I do understand that the wine is being used as a metaphor. I'd find it hard not to; it's constant, heavy-handed, and just as much hammering you with the message as it would be if he just came out with it (as he did, for example, in Election; despite that, Election is by far the better movie. Relatively, of course). I'd say that that makes the movie only worthwhile for wine snobs, but this is obviously not the case, given the number of people who seem to enjoy it. Unless there are a whole lot more wine snobs in America than I think there are.<br /><br />I was planning on going on, but why bother? I'm sure you can tell where I'm going with this. Terrible movie, only worth watching because Virginia Madsen is, in general, the best thing about any movie she's in. Never has that been more the case than it is here. *</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"Sideways" has a lot going for it. Great acting, especially on the part of Paul Giamatti, realistic characters, and a very interesting subplot involving California wines and those who immerse themselves in them -- both as consumers and as students.<br /><br />The film is about a couple of middle-aged guys, one of whom is about to get married, who want to spend a week having a good time before the ceremony. Predictably, this means that the groom-to-be is looking to hook up with as many women as possible before the big day. His travel companion (Giamatti) is a gloomy oenophile who can't get over the fact that his own marriage fell apart. He compensates by crawling inside a bottle -- not as a drinker, but as a wine aficionado. Studying wine makes up for the great hole in his emotional life. The mismatch between the temperament and aspirations of these two men is what many find charming about the film.<br /><br />Still, I found the film disappointing. The gloom and aimlessness of Giamatti's character was almost palpable. And his sidekick's hedonism was less comical than pathetic. I couldn't find it in me to laugh at a man betraying his spouse-to-be so shamelessly, or another man who lived with so much pain. Still, the film was well done, if not the laff-riot it is thought to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Payne's last film, About Schmidt, continued his fascination with American cinema in the `70s by featuring one its biggest (and most prolific) stars, Jack Nicholson. His latest movie, Sideways, continues the road movie motif from Schmidt and combines it with the buddy film. Jack (Haden Church) is a failed actor about to be married. He decides to go on one last week of uninhibited fun with his best friend, Miles (Giamatti), a school teacher and struggling author. They go on a wine-tasting tour through California's Central Coast and squeeze in a bit of golfing as well.<br /><br />Jack and Miles are complete messes as human beings. They lack direction and are hypocrites. Miles says he is an author but his book is going nowhere, while Jack is getting married and proceeds to hit on anything in a dress. They are hardly a sympathetic pair. And yet Payne is able to get a good amount of comedic mileage from the pair. An interesting thing happens during the course of the movie. At first, Miles starts off as an unsympathetic character while we warm up to Jack's funny repartee as the charming rogue. Halfway through the film they flip roles and it is Jack who is exposed as a pathetic womanizer and Miles becomes more sympathetic thanks to Maya's (Madsen) influence.<br /><br />Fresh off the success of American Splendor, Paul Giamatti is one of those actors who makes it look so effortless as he inhabits the characters he plays completely. Giamatti is able to tap into his character's deep reservoir of pain and anger and pull out an incredible performance that is, in some ways a variation of his take on the equally acerbic Harvey Pekar in Splendor.<br /><br />Ever since Ned and Stacey, Thomas Haden Church has been an untapped resource and with Sideways he has finally been given the role of his career. As Miles' crass, philandering best friend, he plays Jack as a middle-aged frat boy who still calls women, "chicks." Haden Church's deadpanned delivery of smart-ass lines works well against Giamatti's uptight straight man.<br /><br />20th Century Fox's recent DVD release includes a modest collection of supplemental material. There is an audio commentary by actors Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church. As a review in Entertainment Weekly has pointed out, this track is almost a sequel of sorts as Haden Church goes into vintage smart-ass mode while Giamatti plays the straight man and tries to keep things on track by occasionally commenting on what we are seeing. Haden Church then proceeds to deflate this by delivering ironic statements like, "Also, I love your head in this scene," in a deadpan style that is very funny.<br /><br />Also included are seven deleted scenes with written introductions by Payne that explain why they were cut. Most of this footage was rightly excised, including a nasty subplot involving a dog being hit and killed by Miles' car.<br /><br />Rounding out the DVD is a theatrical trailer and a "Behind-the-Scenes Featurette" that is pretty standard stuff with clips of Payne and the cast talking about the movie mixed with clips from the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Alexander Payne`s "Sideways" is what is known in the movie business as a "Little Movie That Could," a low budget, independent film without major stars or dazzling special effects that, nevertheless, achieves a measure of success at the box office and, in this case at least, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the year.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Rex Pickett, "Sideways" tells the story of two middle-aged men, Miles and Jack, who head to the wine country of Central California for one final fling before Jack gets married.  Miles is an aspiring writer whose recent failures in life have left him bruised, cynical and deeply depressed.  In fact, he feels like a loser on two fronts, both as an author and as a husband, for he has yet to have a single work of his published, and he has recently gotten divorced from a woman whom he obviously still loves deeply and whom he can't quite seem to let go of.  The one aspect of life in which Miles really seems to excel and in which his passion is given free rein is his connoisseurship of fine wine.  His buddy, Jack, is a has-been TV actor who has spent the last few years doing voiceover work for pharmaceutical commercials.  Jack wants his final week as a bachelor to be a non-stop orgy of wine, women and song, but Miles prefers a quiet week of three parts wine tasting to one part self pity.<br /><br />Like a rare, vintage Pinot Noir, "Sideways" is a film best appreciated by those with a finely developed taste for the subtle and offbeat.  What often happens with a "small" film that achieves an unexpectedly wide crossover success is that it tends to suffer a certain critical backlash from people who go into it with soaring expectations and come out wondering what all the fuss is about.  The ideal way to experience a film like "Sideways" is to allow it to sneak up on you, to let it catch you unawares with its uniqueness and charm.  But since none of us can turn back time to that particular moment of nascent discovery, we are forced to watch it through the filter of our own preconceived notions and expectations.<br /><br />All this is preparatory to saying that "Sideways" is a very enjoyable little film for those willing to give it a chance.  Not only are the premise and the setting novel and unique, but the film boasts some of the finest ensemble acting in any movie of recent years.  Paul Giamatti, long one of our most talented and underrated actors, gives a performance of tremendous understatement and restraint, creating an entire character as much through facial expressions and body language as through dialogue.  Miles isn't even all that likeable at times - he actually steals money from his own mother on her birthday then leaves without saying goodbye - but his lack of self-image, his clear-eyed rationality and his puppy dog vulnerability win us over anyway.  As the playboy, Jack, Thomas Hayden Church reveals a layer of sensitivity buried under all that cold-blooded crassness.  Playing the two women who enter into their lives that week, Sandra Oh and, especially, Virginia Madsen provide a sweetness and warmth that contrasts nicely with these two emotionally stunted middle-aged "losers."<br /><br />In a perfect blending of form and content, Payne and co-author Jim Taylor have created a tasty mixture of revelatory conversation, understated humor and lyrical camerawork.  So sit back, uncork a bottle of your favorite vintage and enjoy the aperitif that is "Sideways."</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of Best Screenplay adapted from an outside source, Sideways turned out to be one of the surprise blockbusters of 2004. Based on the Rex Pickett novel of the same name, Sideways is a clever comedy about wine, life, and a group of friends - each in search of his unique identity. Unlike the plot-driven movies that traditionally dominate Hollywood, Sideways is one of those rare pictures which actually "reads" like a novel. The film resembles Seinfeld in that it's really about nothing, but it's about everything all at the same time. With very little to speak of in the way of plot, the movie relies heavily on the development of its quirky characters, and in this aspect, Sideways is an overwhelming success. Something about this movie (which I can't quite put my finger on) makes me love it, and I'm willing to bet that you'll enjoy it too...<br /><br />Paul Giamatti plays the role of Miles Raymond, a middle-aged, recently-divorced high school teacher struggling to publish his novel, The Day After Yesterday (which is, of course, "today" - but it's not the same). The film begins when Miles picks up his college roommate Jack (Thomas Haden Church) for a one week bachelor party excursion into the vineyards of Napa Valley. With one week left as a single man, Jack is set for a week of drunkenness and debauchery - but Miles stands in his way. Suffering from a mild depression, Miles wants to savor wine rather than chug it, talk to a woman rather than sleep with her, and generally act as a drag on any of Jack's plans.<br /><br />But when Jack pushes Miles to chase after his waitress friend Maya (Virginia Madsen), life takes a turn for Miles. Meanwhile Jack carries on a torrid affair with Maya's friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh), neither of the women knowing of Jack's impending marriage. When the truth about Jack's wedding slips out, the tidbit threatens to destroy each character's relationship with the other...<br /><br />Oftentimes hilarious, sometimes deeply symbolic, Sideways runs the gambit of human emotion. In addition, the lack of a manufactured plot template serves the purpose of keeping the audience on edge. You never quite know what to expect next. Thomas Haden Church (formerly of Lowell Mather fame on Wings, one my all-time favorite sitcoms) shows his diversity as an actor in his fascinating portrayal of the aggressive, hormone-driven Jack. Determined to live out a wild week of drunken sexual conquest before his wedding day, Jack's self-destructive binge behavior stands in stark contrast to the paralyzed, low risk attitude of Miles. Together, Haden Church and Giamatti create an unforgettable screen combination.<br /><br />And it's this powder keg mixture of relationships between Jack, Miles, Maya, and Stephanie that give Sideways its enticing cinematic flavor. Virginia Madsen received her own Academy Award nomination to go along with Thomas Haden Church, but the Oscar nominations could just as easily have gone to Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh. In short, Sideways wanders the hills of California wine country as well as the peeks and valleys of the human experience. It's a film about life and decisions and relationships and happiness and everything else. More importantly, it's one of the most interesting and entertaining films of the last several years, and that's why Sideways is a definite must-see film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>After all the attention paid to this movie in the last year, I finally rented "Sideways."  As a wine fan and a Californian who is familiar with the Santa Barbara area wineries, I thought I might enjoy it.<br /><br />On some levels, this movie delivers.  The cinematography is excellent, and the screenwriters knew their wine.  There are parts of this movie that are really funny.  But the movie never transcends the loathsome, reprehensible behavior of Miles and Jack, the two characters who are supposed to be our heroes.  Their actions near the beginning of this movie do not make them sympathetic.  Rather, they are established early on as pathetic middle-aged losers who deserve any and all of the bad things that happen to them.  Even though Miles makes a stab at redemption near the end, it's too little, too late.  There are some funny moments where we laugh at them, not with them, but then it's time to go back to looking at your watch and waiting for the the movie to end.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / FOX / Region A, B, C(?)<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / BD+ / High Profile 4.1<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />Running time: 2:07:00<br />Movie size: 40,01 GB<br />Disc size: 45,31 GB<br />Total bit rate: 42 Mbps<br />Average video bit  33.08 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 32<br />Subtitles: English SDH / Chinese (Traditional & Simplified) / French / Korean / Portuguese / Spanish<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3661 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3661 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio  Portuguese  768 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br /><br />#Audio Commentary by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church<br />#7 Deleted Scenes (17m:14s)<br />#Notes From Alexander Payne (2m:10s)<br />#Behind the Scenes (14m:06s)<br />#Project Searchlight (6m:34s)</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Sideways" is a movie about a little bit of everything. The title intrigued me. According to Thomas Hayden Church it intrigued everyone and was talked about freely on the set of the movie. Hayden Church said, "The title of the movie is open to interpretation. We talked about it often. You go through a door sideways. Or the little roads that go off to the wineries in the Santa Ynez valley are sideways of the 101. But it's also these little portals that open up, and the experience. These guys are at such a crossroads in their lives."<br /><br />Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) is  recently divorced teacher. He is having difficulty moving on with his life. He wants to take his best friend, Jack, (Thomas Hayden Church), about to be married, on a week's trip to the wine country. Miles loves the wine country and knows it well, as he does wine. Their first stop is one of his favorite wineries, Sanford Winery, located in the Santa Rita Hills. Miles says "Let's hit Sanford First. These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara County."<br /><br />The wine-appreciation theme of this movie made such an impression on its fans in the US, sales of Pinot Noir wines rose by more than 20% over the Christmas/New Year period 2004,, compared to the same period the previous year. Sanford Pinot Noir is very difficult to come by now and everyone makes Sanford Wineries their first stop in wine country.<br /><br />As they wind their way through wine country, Miles stops at his favorite bar/restaurant. Here they meet, Maya, (Virginia Masden) a waitress, and according to Jack, "some looker". It becomes pretty obvious that Jack is out for a last fling, and Paul is shocked and dismayed to find his wine tasting tour may turn into a "love nest".  At one of the wineries Jack becomes smitten with Stephanie, (Sandra Oh) and asks her out. She knows Maya and a dinner date for all four of them occurs that night.  The simple week for two friends has turned into a search and discussion of relationships and what do we want from life?<br /><br />Paul and Jack are buddies. Each is middle aged and searching for themselves and what is missing in their lives. "Sideways".  Paul, Jack, Maya and Stephanie are all in a search. In search of wine. In search of love. In search of themselves. This is a buddy movie that at times is hilarious and serious. Highly recommedned. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>"Sideways" is at once a quirky comedy, and a moving, sometimes painful, drama about two men approaching middle-age, struggling with their identity and uncertain futures. Director Alexander Payne adapted the screenplay with his longtime writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book "Sideways" by Rex Pickett.  They created a well crafted plot, and complex, flawed characters. And the actors provide superb performances.<br /><br />Miles Raymond, (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti), a somewhat nerdy, middle school English teacher and would-be novelist, has been unhappily divorced for two years, and is lonely, perpetually depressed and disappointed by his own failures and missed opportunities. He anxiously awaits a publisher's decision about the fate of his book, entitled "The Day After Yesterday," while he prepares for a much needed get-away trip with friend Jack Lopate. Jack, (Thomas Haden Church), and Miles were college roommates and have maintained a close, if neurotic friendship. Jack, a fading bit part TV actor and total commitment-phobe, is getting married in a week - for the first time. Before the wedding the two 40-something schlemiels take-off on a road trip through California's wine country. Miles wants to give his friend a worthy send-off, a wedding gift, before he finally takes the walk down the aisle. An amateur wine enthusiast and snob, Miles has planned a week of wine tasting, fine food, male bonding and golf. Jack has another agenda. He wants to sow as many wild oats as he can cram into seven days. And he wants the melancholy, unwilling Miles to have at least one one-night-stand. This is so not your father's bachelor party! They travel light but carry some heavy baggage with them.<br /><br />The two travel and taste wine throughout the gorgeous Santa Ynez region. The cinematography is wonderful and some of the rural landscapes resemble paintings. At a restaurant Miles frequents when in the area, they meet waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen), who Miles has long been attracted to. Jack is immediately on his buddy's back to "party" with Maya. His pushy insistence fills Miles with disgust and dismay. Then the men meet winery employee, Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Jack immediately hits on the young hottie and is successful!? However, he fails to mention his upcoming wedding plans to her. After 24 hours he does mention that he loves her and is thinking of moving to the valley, and, perhaps, buying a winery. Sadly he believes every word he says. Stephanie knows Maya, and the four get together for dinner. Later, while Jack and Steph are romancing, Miles and Maya talk about their passion for wine. When Maya asks Miles why he "has a thing for Pinot Noir," his response is sad and self-revealing. "It's a hard grape to grow. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, and ripens early. It is not like Cabernet, which can grow anywhere and thrive, even when it's neglected. In fact, it can only grow in these specific tucked-away corners of the world. Only the most patient and nurturing of growers can do it...to understand Pinot's potential and coax it into its fullest expression." Maya, a wise and sensitive woman, who is studying horticulture at the local university, understands. Her response, a wonderfully poetic monologue about what wine means to her, is mesmerizing. This gem of a scene is one of my favorites in the film.<br /><br />Eventually, after much character development, multiple adventures, plot twists, excellent dialogue, terrific humor, (there is a golf course scene which is hilarious!), many a bottle of great wine imbibed, and intense moments of self-revelation, the two guys, still friends, go home - back to reality. This is definitely a 5 Star film, nuanced, complex, with fabulous depth, seductive and not too fruity! A must see!<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>SIDEWAYS is not your conventional comedy. It is rather a "Serious" comedy with lots of laughs.<br /><br />The movie is about a couple of friends who go on a wine-tasting road trip before one of them gets married. On the way they meet two sexy chicks, Maya and Stephanie, and spend some time with them. On the trip, Maya finds out that Jack is getting married, and thus begins the downward spiral!<br /><br />SIDEWAYS, based on a novel by Rex Pickett, is a good film, but beware, there's full frontal nudity in the last 20 minutes! Also, The DVD commentary is hilarious, and there are two easter eggs.<br /><br />So see this!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I think the previews mis-lead the viewers of this film. I mean no way was this the funniest movie of the year. It's not even that funny. It's well acted though. I don't know why Paul Giamatti (Big Fat Liar, Planet of the Apes) wasn't nominated though. He probably deserved it more than Thomas Haden Church (Wings, 3000 Miles to Graceland ), athough he's great too.<br /><br />  It's about 2 wine tasters and bestfriends who go on one last trip together before Haden Church's character gets married. Church is a jerk though basically and just cares about getting laid before getting married more than spending time with Giamatti. Once he finds someone he doesn't tell her the truth and just uses her for sex. Well yes he does wanna hang with Giamatti and cheer him up. He'd still rather ditch him for a chinese lady he's cheating on his future wife with though.<br /><br />  It's Giamatti who you want things to work out for because he's the better guy . Well although he is a self-centered complainer that steals money from his mother. He still has some heart felt moments and has great chemestry  with Virginia Madsen (Candyman). I don't really know why the movie was praised so much. It's good but it reminded me a lot of Alexander Payne's last film About Schmidt. He goes on a road trip too but without the wine tasting or the sex. The pacing and the style are the same though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>At the risk of sounding like a cheap, sensationalistic tagline, this movie is quirky, kinky, decadent, and just plain perversely funny in a jaded and downbeat sort of way. (In other words, my sort of movie :-). It helps to have a somewhat skewed sense of humor and slant on life to enjoy this film, but if you like movies from directors like John Waters, Peter Greenaway, or Australian director Shirley Barrett (especially Love Serenade), you probably won't be put off by that, not to mention some of the more graphic language and occasional nudity and sex scene.<br /><br />Most of the movie isn't like that, though, and much of it is spent discussing the fine points of wine appreciation, hardly a subject for physical or low-brow humor which the movie has its share of. The subject of wine becomes a metaphor for several of the other themes in the movie, including unpredictability of relationships and life in general, and even the misadventures that befall the two main characters' during their week-long R & R, which seems destined to be an unmitigated but hilarious disaster from the very start.<br /><br />Another thing I enjoyed about it, which is more of a personal nostalgia thing, is that I've visited many of the places in the movie, including Buelton, Solvang, Sanford Winery, The Hitching Post Steakhouse, and others, and it was fun to watch the film and recognize so many of them from my past travels. I'm no wine connoisseur but I've read a book or two on the subject and so was able to follow most of the dialog about wine. :-)<br /><br />Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church as the pair of old college buddies were perfect in their roles and did a wonderful job of acting. I think they played off each other well enough so that I hope the director does a sequel or at least another film with both of them in the lead roles.<br /><br />Although not a film for everybody's taste I enjoyed its skewed and downbeat humor and slant on life and I look forward to seeing what this director does in the future.<br /><br />Also, if you haven't seen Love Serenade but enjoyed this movie, I can recommend that one also. Although not well known it has something of a cult following and until last year was the only movie the director had made in many years.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>This movie is packed full of shock moments. It's a story about a pair of buddies . . .<br /><br />1 actor(Thomas Haden Chruch) + 1 Writer(Paul Giamati)= Nonstop laughs.<br /><br />Constantly these two are bickering while sipping wine and carrying on their vacation just before Miles's friend is about to get married. But on the way they encounter two females that will send their lives into an interesting turn.<br /><br />When it gets right down to it, there is too much Dialogue about wine. You get sick of it after a while. Wine this and wine that. It's silly. But Miles, the character we sympathize with, is obssesed with wine . . . and writing. What follows is the ups and downs of two buddies, one wild and one insecure into a nicely awkward comedy that is Sideways.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>At the beginning, I thought things were moving a tad slow, but by the time the ball got rolling, this movie started to really make me feel along with Paul's character.  He is a great actor in this.  I would rate this more like a 4.5.  The extras contain several things as well, which is always a good feature for DVD's.  This story is depressing to me, but it's really good.  I would certainly suggest a rental for this selection, I know for sure it is at least worth that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>It's not often a film this close to mediocre gets nominated for Oscar consideration. Most buddy films like this one -- including "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion" and "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" -- are viewed as two and a half star films.<br /><br />This one, for whatever reason, was given far more consideration by the Hollywood establishment and was nominated for an Oscar for best picture. Why would that happen? Most people know the films that are most heavily-promoted get the most nominations, meaning this film must have won the promotion award.<br /><br />Also, this fantasy about two middle aged slackers resonated with the wine-drinking establishment in L.A. and probably seemed to them like some kind of reality. This seems reasonable since the characters they projected -- an actor and failing writer -- are the archtype cliches from New York and Hollywood films. These characters are perhaps more representative of the Hollywood establishment than any other.<br /><br />Whatever the case, there is nothing outstanding in this movie except for one funny scene crashing a car. There were some nice scenes and a couple that were funny, but this is a two and a half star film. It is absurd to think this film so magnificent is ranks in league with the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Nominating "Sideways" as best film of 2004 says far more about the Motion Picture Academy membership than it does about the quality of this or any other film released in 2004.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>This was a great little heart-warming picture, full of intelligence and grace, humor and pathos. What a simple idea, strangely not of this time. A classic road picture with two likable types who have nothing going for them. We love them for this finally, as do the gals they meet on their wine-tasting adventure. The actors are very charming and fully realize their parts. I especially liked Sandra Oh, who is passionate and intelligent. The guys are fine, although I wonder about seeing a lot of them - they may be too ordinary to make it in tinsel town. This is a kind of retro-60s film, it seems to me, small, counter-cultural in a way, slightly subversive of the call to success. These kinds of film made my generation love going to the movies. Encore.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>I rushed to see this at the theatre on it's first weekend before I'd hear anyone's opinion on it, and before all the tv commercials came out to ruin it.  I was looking forward to seeing it since all the interviews with the actors made it seem like a great film.  And I did enjoy it, but I thought it was a little long winded.  I thought it was funny and sad at the same time, but I got restless and lost focus on it.  It is a good movie, but didn't quite live up to the hype surrounding it.  The acting was good (maybe not Oscar winning material) but it just wasn't enough to hold my interest.  Sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Many say 'Sideways' is a funny comedy, and that is not without truths.  But for anyone who knows something about so-called mid-life crisis, this film means much more than being a well-made comedy.  In short, 'Sideways' is a bitter-sweet tale about the life -- life with regrets and a little bit of hope -- and as that it is fantastic.<br /><br />Nothing remarkable happens in 'Sideways.'  One English teacher (and recently divorced) Miles (Paul Giamatti) travels with his friend Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) around California tasting good Californian wine, playing golf, and having a double date with two women Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh).  Jack was a popular TV star (and an occasional TV commercian narrator) who is getting married in a week, and for him this is the last chance to be really 'free.'  In the menawhile, Miles has his own concern because he wants to be a writer though none of the publishers he submitted his manuscript wouldn't accept it, not even give a call to him.  And Miles vaguely senses that success is eluding him.<br /><br />Nothing more attractive than the written story, but these characters and their emotions are so real, so amusing and often so painful that the film becomes a tour to get to know these people, whose virtues and even flaws start to look very adorable.  Jack is a hopeless case of womamizer, but we understand his personality, if not tolerate.  Miles ia haunted by the perpetual self-loathing habit, and we know it when he calls his ex-wife, asking if there could be a second chance.  Of course, there is not, we know it, and he knows it.  But he had to phone, and ask, and hates himself for doing that.<br /><br />Though wine plays the integral part of the film, it does so not with some knowledge about vintages, but with a slyly concealed allegory about life.  I cannot reveal the part in detail, but at one scene, which virtually brought an Oscar nomination to Virginia Madsen, Miles and Maya talk about something in the candle-lit room.  Apprantly Miles talks about wine.  But we soon know Maya's answer to him means much deeper Miles initially suspected.  Don't miss this part, for this is one of the most touching moments in the movie history.  Surely Ms. Madsen deserves an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />As every good comedy is ultimately talking about life, 'Sideways' is also about life.  A life that you think could be different, which could be still OK.  This film is such a precious experience to teach us that.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Early one morning while everything seemed difficult and problematic as usual, Miles (Paul Giamatti) wakes up to a neighbor knocking on the door telling him to move his car.  Miles, an interesting character in his own right, suffers internally from his long ago divorce that keeps him in a prolonged depression.  He feeds this depression with his preoccupation of negative thinking, which even oozes from his poor appearance and his untidy tiny apartment.  He is the kind of guy most would steer away from, as his presence provides contagious negativity.  He sees himself as a failed writer that tries to get by in life teaching English while the students probably openly disrespect him.  The essence of his character has all of the negative traits of a lonely middle-aged man that has hit a middle age crisis and believes that there is nothing better for him in life than a bleak, sad, pass&eacute;, and isolated existence.<br /><br />Miles returns to the apartment while being aware that he is behind schedule, as he has over slept.  Over the phone Miles excuses himself, which he probably does frequently, for being late while he still finds a moment to escape reality through the thousands of books that cover most of his apartment.  The apartment alone tells more than a thousand words in regards to Miles' situation in life, as all the books suggest that he must be escaping reality as often as he can.  Besides having a fetish for books Miles also dreams of having his own vineyard, which explains his inclination for wine.  Wine is also the reason for why he has overslept, as he recovers from last night's hangover and begins his journey to meet his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church).<br /><br />These two middle-aged men have decide to venture through the Californian wine land while visiting as many vineyards and golf courses as possible over a period of six days.  The reason for this expedition is Jack's upcoming wedding, as they have decided that Jack should enjoy freedom before marriage one final time.  One striking notion is how Jack could be friends with Miles, as Jack is the polar opposite of Miles.  Jack has a career and options to try new things while being a positive, strong, and confident man who seems to have it all.  Why would a person such as Jack hang out with Miles?  Well, this question will answer itself, as Jack is the kind of guy that most people like to know, but only until the moment his true self appears.<br /><br />Middle-age depression compiled by feelings of unworthiness, poor self-esteem, professional rejection, loneliness, and much more seem to be the reason why Miles welcomes Jacks presence.  After all Miles is the key for Jack to be able to be himself - a first-class jerk.  Jack's persona reveals itself when the audience hears Jack say, ""...I was dying in there." in regards to his new family and wife to be.  This, however, could be Jack expressing his anxiety for the wedding by having cold feet.  Later, in the film, more of Jack's two-facedness will become more consistent which only exists in order to serve his own personal desires without consideration for others.  Jack's career as an actor truly seems to be self-servant for him, as he cheats his way through conversations by deceiving people to like him.  Also, somewhere under this exterior Jack seems to have some form of a confused ego that only lives in the present.  Miles seems to be the only one who is aware of Jack's true nature, but accepts it due to his psychosocial status.<br /><br />Sideways turns into an likable dissection of these two characters, as they will find a crossroad through golf, wine, and women.  On their way to this crossroad Miles will explore his own and other's existence and character, which will give him an opportunity to expand sideways.  Miles realize that he does not have to try to move forward to find what he needs.  Much of this Miles owe to Jack who is the catalyst that pulls him out of his own miserable void.  Yet, Miles does not approve of Jack's methods, which places him in a conundrum.  As an interesting side note, Conundrum is also the name of the publishing company that might publish Miles book.<br /><br />Words such as vibrantly alive and authentic come to mind when listening to what the two main characters say.  This is due to a brilliantly adapted screen play by Alexander Payne who co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor, which originates from a novel by Rex Pickett.  Illustrative, the communication between Miles and Jack displays their friendship by default, as the chemistry between the two transparently exhibits each character's psychology and their interaction with their present social environment.  Ultimately, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church's character contrasts makes the film very absorbing while providing performances of the highest level.  The female antagonists performed by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh help augment the characteristics of these two, in their own way, pathetic men.  This leaves the audience with an authentic tale of existence, hope, and love, which makes it ok to dream while also trying to work toward those dreams.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>See Lost in Translation first and Adaptation with Nicholas Cage.  Sideways just didn't impress me much.  It was cute, but not worthy of all the praise.  Certainly a cliched artsy type ending.  Oh brother, the drama of it.  Oh for the sake of "art".</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Sideways is an entertaining but vastly overrated film about the pleasures of life and wine. A first-rate cast deliver good, but not extraordinary performances in this tale about two men reaching middle age with not much to show but disappointment, who embark on a week long road trip through California's wine country, just as one is about to take a trip down the altar.<br /><br />If anyone in this film deserved an Oscar nomination it was Paul Giamatti, a terrific actor always overlooked by the Academy for his brilliant turns in independent cinema. He is constantly robbed of a nomination, and is once again shut out for this film. Sandra Oh was also robbed, the nomination instead going to Virginia Madsen, an actress I've admired since seeing Candyman, but whose performance I thought was nothing out of the ordinary. She wasn't the problem at all, it was more the fact that her role was very small and she didn't have scenes of pure emotion that Sandra Oh's character had. All the actors were good,if not special, but the wrong actors were nominated.<br /><br />The screenplay, written by director Alexander Payne (Sandra Oh's husband) and Jim Taylor, from the novel by Rex Pickett, is a twist on the conventional romantic comedy. One of its most wonderful qualities is that all four characters are necessary. The women are not plot conveniences, but elements in a complex romantic and even therapeutic process. It is these characters that make the movie so likeable, and different from other romantic comedies.<br /><br />I liked this movie, but wasn't impressed by it. Yes, I was entertained, but didn't leave the theatre a changed man that movies like Million Dollar Baby made me feel. Perhaps I have to see it again to truly appreciate it, but I just feel this was a really good film for the romantic comedy genre and nothing more. I recommend it yes, but beware, it is one of the most overrated films of the year, if not ever. Wine lovers might especially enjoy the dialogue, especially a scene between Giamanti and Madsen, who is the one scene I think got her the nomination.<br /><br />See this movie because it is entertaining, not because you've heard it's a masterpiece and you'll come out enjoying it. Otherwise, I know plenty of people who hated it because it's so overrated.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Paul Giamatti is a guy who is still trying to get over his ex wife who has recently remarried.

I rented this movie, because I can remember seeing publicity photos and/or previews, of the tall actor, with his nose in some sort of bandage. I expected this to be some sort of screwball comedy, with physical comedy thrown in for good measure!<br /><br />Damn, I almost fell asleep.  I am like the review before me; except I was alone.  I kept looking around mouthing the words:  "Is it me?  It's them, right?" as I gestured toward the convoluted conversations coming from my home viewing screen.  Sorry, but watching two white guys discuss wine for 2+ achingly boring hours is not my idea of an award winning movie!  I guess the saving grace is seeing the Asian woman, and imagining the "freaky" activities going on behind closed doors.  But what a schmuck that guy was, as it was the weekend before his wedding.<br /><br />Also, I didn't appreciate how there was no damn explanation of what these two goofballs were doing, driving across California, to various wineries.  What the hell was going on?  This is how some horny white guy spends his last weekend of freedom?  How about living a little, going to a strip club, or even taking in a Broadway show?  But sitting in restaurants, and tasting booths?  Nah ahh!  Homie don't play that.<br /><br />And neither does MC White<br /><br />MC White said: an extra star for the Asian hottie.

Paul Giamatti was a shoe in for oscar gold and deserved that oscar more than any other actor last year (I think that Foxx was a little too over-rated)...regardless though this film was just brilliant, touching and funny and just real all the way around.  Thomas Haden Church was great as was Maddison and Oh, but nobody can touch Giamatti's drive in this film.  I loved his charactor every minute he was on screen.  The film is simple, plot wise that is, but the meaning it carries about love and life and friendship and relationships and starting over and or moving on from the things and experiences that weigh you down is endlessly moving.  Great great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>I always thought that Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen deserved much better careers than they've had so far.  Don't get me wrong; both have turned in solid performances in other projects, but their talents generally seemed underutilized, perhaps because their films are not always top drawer.  Take the scene in "Sideways" where the uncertain Giamatti chickens out of being seduced by the lovely Madsen -- had their performances not been so impeccable, and had the writing not been so dead on, I might not enjoy the film as much as I do.  As it stands, "Sideways" is more a collection of scenes, some good, some great, than a movie, but that doesn't stop it from shining in many moments, including a would-be golf course rumble and the gutbuster where the usually annoying Sandra Oh gets to kick the daylights out of the usually annoying Thomas Haden Church.  And while I could have done without having to see the latter's backside while enjoying the carnal pleasures of the former, I do admire the willingness of the actors to go with the moment in their performances.  "Sideways" suffers from the usual Hollywood overhype -- it's a charming film but not a particularly revelatory or remarkable one -- but adult audiences in middle age or creeping toward it will likely crack a smile and shed a well deserved tear despite themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Paul Giamatti should be an Oscar winner, and not for his nominated performance in `Cinderella Man' but for his brilliant turn as Miles in `Sideways', a performance that was evilly snubbed back in 2004.  In `Sideways' Paul Giamatti is so on point, so in tune with Miles that he becomes one of the most relatable and likable characters of that given year.  We travel with Miles not only through the countryside but through life itself and see his values, his fears, his wants and desires.  We understand him as a person and that's very important for the effectiveness of the film.  Thomas Haden Church's character is far from sympathetic and so it rest firmly on Giamatti's shoulders to keep the viewer caring for the film and the people within.  He does so with warmth and depth.<br /><br />The film follows friends Miles and Jack as they travel the California countryside for a wine tasting extravaganza before Jack gets married the next weekend.  It's supposed to be a vacation filled with wine, golf and male bonding, but thanks to Jack's weak will power Miles ends up spending most his time alone while Jack is out pursuing the attention of single mother Stephanie.  When Miles isn't commiserating over his failed marriage he's slowly but surely forming a bond with Maya, a sweet and gentle bartender who's been on Miles mind for some time.  As their vacation comes to an end and the wedding gets closer Jack must decide how to end his relationship with Stephanie without telling her too much and Miles must find a way to salvage all that's good with his relationship with Maya in the wake of the storm.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church, while playing a character that even I couldn't justify, does so with such dire devotion that you can't help but appreciate him.  He's splendid here and well deserved the Oscar nomination.  Virginia Madsen is so luminous as Maya, I just can't help but fall in love with her.  When I first saw the film I couldn't quite understand how she received the Oscar nomination, but after repeated viewings I was able to see the brilliance in her subtlety.  She was fantastic.  Sandra Oh is unfairly ignored when it comes to praising the actors in this film.  She may not be in very many scenes, but her character is fleshed out well for her lack of major screen time.  But in the end this film begins and ends with Paul Giamatti who is just a revelation here.  He's so extraordinary as Miles that his snub for even a nomination is so disgusting to me.  And for who, Clint Eastwood?  He was already going to win the directing Oscar; did he really need an acting nomination?<br /><br />The film does a wonderful job of showing the strength of true friendship.  Alexander Payne adapted this screenplay brilliantly and directs it with effortless passion and compassion.  I couldn't help but rationalize with Miles mainly because I've had friends like Jack who don't seem to show too much care or concern for your general feelings but in the end you know they love you.  Miles and Jack are so close they cross the line of family and once that happens your friends get away with treating you worse then you'd normally put up with.  We all have our friends we let walk all over us, not because we're weak or spineless but because losing them would be worse than putting up with their quarks.  In the end Jack is a lucky man to have a friend as devoted and forgiving as Miles.<br /><br />I will mention that, although I rant and rave about this film and truly believe it should have walked away with top honors at the Oscars (especially of the five films nominated) I must admit to being the only person in my family to feel that way.  My wife likes this film, but it's nothing she'd rush to watch a second time (I on the other hand have seen it numerous times) and my parents and siblings found it rather boring.  It all depends on your type of film or your type of humor.  I know this is registered as a comedy, but to me it's more of a drama with some funny scenes.  It's very sad in parts, frustrating in others, dramatic and touching and then, yes, funny.  Miles tantrum where he drinks the wine out of the spit bucket is probably my favorite single scene in the film for it perfectly fuses the dramatic tension and sense of total frustration with pure comedy.  Just know that this may not be your cup of tea, but give it a try before you cast judgment.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>This is what Hollywood should be concentrating on!  Character development, on location scenery, great performances and a script that is one of the best I've seen and heard in years.  Paul Giamatti is excellent as Miles, the down on his luck author and school teacher trying to get his life in order.  I think he was robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Thomas Haden Church (Ned & Stacey, Wings) gets the break out role of his career as Jack, the guy who is unfaithful but lovable.  Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh round out the cast to make this movie a true Independent film classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>A cute little movie, but a bit slow. I guess it's meant to be sipped like a fine wine, by people who have lots and lots of time to lounge around watching movies. Like movie critics, who hailed it like it was kung pao shrimp done right (without the green peppers).<br /><br />Calling this movie a comedy is like calling Shaun of the Dead a "romantic comedy with zombies." Sort of. It's more like "a mostly depressing movie with funny bits."<br /><br />Paul Giamatti and his sidekick conjure up two lifelike characters here, one a schoolteacher aspiring to be a writer, the other a second-string actor (with the attendant dumbness, affording us many great/funny moments). You know the basic story, so I'll skip it.<br /><br />I wanted to quit it but also wanted to see what happened. It's funny, it's sad, it's interesting, it's hopeful, and ... it flows along at a pace that apparently enthralls certain circles, for reasons I don't understand (well, maybe I do). But I'm just your average unsophisticated moviegoer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>Sideways is an evocative film about male friendship, relationships, flings, marriage, careers, the approach of middle age, settling instead of realizing your true dreams, and, of course, wine.  Wine snobbishness, wine overindulgence, proper wine etiquette, wine as a prelude to sex, wine as an obsession, etc.  Wine is a character, a driving force in this film.  This isn't a film for everyone, and it most likely has appeal to the age group featured in the plotline.<br /><br />The two male leads are former college roommates and complete opposites-Giamatti is an over-indulging, depressed wannabe novelist who just went through a divorce.  Church is an actor/playboy looking for one last fling before he gets married.  The two take a weekend bachelor party trip to wine country.  At first, Giamatti seems like a loser who is dragging everyone down, but then Church takes over as the jerk, the character we are all supposed to hate for his self-centered, reckless behavior.  The movie explores their friendship and their attempts at relationships with women.  This is a powerful drama with some very comedic scenes interspersed (including the discussion of whether committing suicide with further Giamatti's novel, and the scene in which a naked cuckholded husband chases down the pair, beating on their car).</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church star in Alexander Payne's wise film, "Sideways".  Paul plays Miles, a middle-aged 8th grade english teacher who writes good novels that his agent can't find a publisher for.  Miles is also an amateur wine expert, and enjoys the spirits a little more than is good for him.  You get the sense that much of the unhappiness in his life he has brought on himself from his drinking, and his unhappiness only makes him drink so...  Despite all this, Miles seems an honestly good-hearted fellow and I felt myself pulling for him.<br /><br />Church plays Jack, an actor who once played a Doctor on a soap opera, but now can only get work recording incredibly fast "fine print" material at the end of car dealer ads.  He and Paul were roommates as freshmen in college, and although Paul has grown into a sad, balding geek, Jack retains enough of those good looks that got him on a soap - and he can't help but use those good looks to come on to the prettiest girl he spies in every building he walks into.<br /><br />Jack is now engaged, and Paul wants them to have a final bachelor's week in California wine country.  Paul wants his friend to develop a little appreciation for the wine.  Jack wants them both to meet willing women.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen plays Maya, who is a waitress working her way through Horticulture grad school.  She has met Miles on his previous trips to wine country, but what Miles doesn't know initially is that pretty Maya was divorced last year.  Maya is also an amateur wine expert and everyone in the film can tell that they are soulmates.<br /><br />At another winery they meet Sandra Oh as Stephanie, pouring wine and acknowledging to randy Jack that she is a bad girl and "needs to be spanked".  Jack pours on the soap actor charm and leaves out the fact that he's getting married on Saturday.<br /><br />Without being preachy, the movie provides a stark contrast between Jack, who is interested in having as much hot sweaty bedroom encounters as possible, and Miles, who is dumpy and middle-aged and hesitantly pursues a much deeper relationship with Maya.<br /><br />There are no moments when I laughed my head off, but the clever screenplay made me chuckle appreciatively every couple of minutes.  These people and their dialogue seemed very real and familiar.<br /><br />By the end you hope Jack will have learned a lesson of sorts, and you hope for good things for Miles and Maya.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>If wine quality is a metaphor for the lives of these two protagonists, it must be very, very sour wine.  This movie reflected the lives of two less than admirable guys.  One of them starts out by stealing from his mother, and he goes downhill from there.  He is an English teacher, which I would have thought would be an admirable profession, but he seems to hate it.  He has no admirable qualities, none at all.  He goes on and on about wine, and all that meant to me was that wine aficionados are shallow, empty people who specialize in a knowledge which is trivial at best, irrelevant at worst.  The other guy has a little more on the ball, but his last week before his marriage has been less than exemplary.<br /><br />There is no saving grace in this movie.  It moves, ever so slowly, from one boring situation to another, specializing in the frowns and depression of the would-be author and true-life loser.  If I got one thing from this terrible, terrible movie, it is that I will never have any respect for anyone who talks wine . .<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this one.  The only people who can appreciate this tripe are probably those who will not admit how bad it is  . . . trying to pretend there is something here . . . like the people raving about modern art that they will not admit they know nothing about . . when in actuality it was painted by an Elephant or a Chimpanzee.

Two years into his divorce Miles (Giamatti) has sunk into a depressive funk so deep he is prone towards unintentionally but automatically sabotaging everything around him.  His latest novel is passed over for publication, and nothing is going right for him.  Jack (Haden Church) is a sunny-dispositioned, womanizing, has been soap actor eking out a life doing commercials and out for one last go at bachelor freedom.  Together, they are quite a pair.<br /><br />During the trip they meet and woo local wine country gals Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen, each of them just about as different as the boys.<br /><br />One of the highlights of the film - and not a comical one - is Virginia Madsen as Maya describing why she loves wine - describing the "life" of a bottle of wine in a manner that wine truly and instantly comes alive:  the words and Madsen's delivery of them is nothing less than astonishing, powerfully moving combining the sensual and spiritual.<br /><br />Everything about Sideways resonated strongly, beautifully, sadly and hilariously for me.

And so it was for me with "Sideways." This buddy story of two unmarried men (one newly divorced and one about to be married for the first time) who spend a bachelor-party week in California wine country is competent and smoothly written/acted, but it lacks the pizzazz of a memorable movie.  This film is enjoyable and often funny, but also somewhat predictable.<br /><br />Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) have been friends since college, and they are dedicated friends despite being caught in their own personal dramas.  Miles, a whiney middle school English teacher, is mourning his divorce and hoping that his 750 page novel will be published.  Jack is a former soap opera star now relegated to commercial voice-overs who is about to get married to an Armenian beauty; Jack isn't sure about settling down, so he wants to sleep with as many women as will have him.  Miles knows everything about wine (at least, he thinks he does), and Jack knows nothing and is barely willing to learn.  The two men meet up with Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh), two wine-loving friends who are as different from each other as the guys are.<br /><br />Sandra Oh, in the smallest part of the four, steals the show with her luminous, sexy, no-nonsense characterization of Stephanie.  Giamatti's Miles grows on the viewer despite the pathetic and not always sympathetic nature of his character; the changes in Miles form the core of the film. Madsen doesn't get enough screen time, especially since her seductive monologue about "living wine" is riveting.  Church, on the other hand, plays a jerk, and it's difficult to do much with that kind of role.<br /><br />The film turns on wine, particularly the delicacy of pinot noir, and the wine talk makes the film incredibly pretentious at times. If not for the sweetness of true love and friendship, the movie could have become mired in self-importance. Ironically, Jack's ignorance keeps the tone light and saves the movie from its own snobbishness.  It is Jack's stupidity and single-mindedness that moves everything forward.<br /><br />This film is worth watching for the performances as it is more character- than plot-driven.  As long as you don't expect too much, you'll enjoy this film that melds male bonding with romantic comedy, thus appealing to both genders. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Start with two two-dimensional characters, the neurotic angst-filled aspiring author and the lower-tier TV actor.<br /><br />(The latter, by the way, is played by Thomas Hayden Church, so he's certainly familiar with the territory.)<br /><br />Add a simple plot.  Tour California wine country and get laid as much as possible before the wedding.  And drunk.

Thus, I had to watch it a few times before I could really appreciate this film for what it is...a tale of two buddies in the last days of their friendship before one of them gets married off. First, let me say that if you haven't read the novel and you love this film, then I hope you will buy and read the novel. There were so many amusing scenes left out, which only added to my disappointment upon first viewing...but I understand that they had to cut a lot of things out to keep the film to a decent running time.<br /><br />This film has plenty going for it: a fine cast, a great and complimentary soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, awesome location, and a clever script. Unfortunately, the story shows a rather unsavory side to men, which I hope women won't think ALL MEN have some compulsary need to have one last affair before getting married. Both men are rather pathetic and its surprising that they have remained friends for so long (from freshmen in college through middle age). Paul Giamattie is simply great in his role as an introverted loser who lacks confidence with women and tends to go to the dark side of pessimistic outlook. He has a great sparring partner in Thomas Harden Church, who plays an extroverted, womanizing lout with a diminishing acting career. In the Santa Ynez valley on a wine tasting tour, hanging out at the Windmill Motel near the Danish tourist town of Solvang, they meet two ladies and begin their unique ways of flirtation. Thomas plays the more confident one of the two and quickly has Stephanie (Sandra Oh) wanting to get jump in the sack with him. The scenes between Paul and Virginia Madsen are the best in the film...as their dialogue about life and using wine as a metaphor represents a cool style of flirtation. Paul's character simply is slower when it comes to attracting women, and its interesting to hear Virginia comparing the quality of a wine and when it begins its decline. Is she talking about wine or him? She's brilliant and the best thing about this film.<br /><br />The scene I didn't like, however, comes near the end of their sojourn when Jack (Thomas Harden Church) begs his friend to retrieve an important item left at a one night stand's house. Although that scene was in the book...I was shocked by what they actually show the audience. It does add a bit of humor (on the gross-out side) but I thought it was unnecessary. Because of that scene, I couldn't recommend this film to many people I'd otherwise recommend it to (their sensibilities would not find much humor in it). Other than that...it was a good film. For those who like or love this film, I would recommend you to read the novel by Rex Pickett. It is so much better and you'll gain a fuller appreciation for the characters. Plus, the film made some changes in the beginning and the ending, as well as changing Stephanie from the novel's character of "Terra". So, buy the soundtrack to listen to as you read the novel, sipping a glass of Pinot Noir...and get ready for a belly full of laughs!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Wonderful acting by Paul Giamatti and the beautiful Virginia Madsen highlight this story of two not very likeable guys "last fling" into the California wine country before the less likeable one (Thomas Haden Church) gets married.

Viewers will come to it expecting "one of the best films of the last decade" or a "hilarious" film and be disappointed, which is a shame, because the modest charms it actually has are quite engaging.<br /><br />To wit: This is a film that substitutes quiet charm for laugh-out-loud jokes, wry observations for deep insights into the human condition, and a mellow rambling pace for a plot that pulls the characters (or viewers) along. It is more a mellow afternoon spent at an out of the way winery than it is a glitzy event of a movie.<br /><br />This is definitely worth a rental, but do not go in expecting to have your life changed by "Sideways."

The relationship of these two and the people they meet take twists and turns toward the inevitable. Sort of.<br /><br />The film is set against a backdrop of California wine country and wine becomes a metaphor for their lives. There are some funny, moments - "If anyone orders merlot, I am leaving!" - and touching scenes of life, love, and treachery.<br /><br />warning: male nudity</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I thought this was supposed to be a comedy. It was pretty depressing. And boring. I don't know anything about wine. I don't want to know anything about wine. I want to watch a movie and, if it's a comedy, I want to laugh. I'm glad I only rented this.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>In essence this is a film in which one of the characters learns that " he would not be riding through Paris in a sports car with the wind in his hair." The character is one who has written a novel that he hoped to publish and turn his life around. Instead he now has to retreat from fantasy and to look at his life and start to rebuild it getting a job and trying to enter a relationship. Perhaps more importantly he has to cope with his ordinariness.<br /><br />The action of the film takes place mainly during a week when the aspiring writer takes a university buddy on a week trip to a wine growing area. The author's friend is a former soapy star whose career has been declining probably and his main work is doing voice-overs. Both characters are unattractive being adolescents who have not made the transaction to adulthood. One steals a large sum of money from his alcoholic mother to finance the trip and the other cheats on his fiancee in a way that is almost pathological.<br /><br />After hearing a summary of the plot one would think that the film is a grim affair which might have a week season in one or two art-house cinemas. In fact the film has been one of the most successful low budget films in years. The reason for that is despite the repellent nature of the characters it is hilarious. Each scene is a minor masterpiece either comic in itself or part of the gradual development of the character study of both of the participants.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most bizarre things about the film is that you feel drawn to the two protagonists. Despite the fact that one is a brilliantly drawn pompous wine snob and the other is both superficial and not bright, one cheers for them. Some of the scenes are classics of comedy. The first wine tasting, the preparation for the night out, the later visit to the commercial winery, and the attempt to recover the actor's wallet.<br /><br />It is one of the best films and years and after seeing it one can never attend a wine tasting again without bursting into laughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>First off, I must say that Paul Giamatti is a good actor, He was amazing in Howard Sterns movie "Private parts" but after watching this movie, I only have one thing to say about your average movie goers:<br />THERE SURE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT LIKE BORING<br />C R A P !!<br />Get a life you drama-novel-midlife-crisis-cry-babies, oh and to those offended by the F word. You old prudes, this movie barley had the F word in it. Boo Hoo! WAHH! Why don't you get out more and stop living under the 1950's rock you were born under.<br />  **Oh and Pierpont Snicklefritz, I'm glad you mentioned "intellectually able" because "Obviuosly" is spelled "Obviously" and "suttle" is spelled "subtle" Just goes to show you what kind of people like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AT7W1EXT0PF2Y.html">AT7W1EXT0PF2Y</a><br/><p>Hollywood pabulum is best left in Hollywood. But when Thomas Haden Church is in a movie, any movie, I will see it. Thus I subjected myself to this nightmare. Church played lovable but borderline psychotic moron Lowell, in Wings. He played not-so-lovable and borderline psychotic businessman Ned in Ned n Stacey. So what could I watch and not like him in? Answer: Sideways. Church plays a not-so-lovable psychotic womanizer whose idea of a good time is going out to cheat on his wife as much as possible before their wedding. If there could be a better example of human filth it would be his friend and co-star Miles. Miles is a whiny, spineless, sack of worthless human being. His goal in this movie is to get laid period. Yes, what a wonderful and totally brand-new plot we've been given. So while they are on this mission, they drive through California orchards and drink a lot of wine.<br /><br />Keep in mind how the words whine and wine are homophones. Either one of these two things come out of Miles' mouth whenever he speaks. He's either talking about wine or whining about something or other. What kind of grown man is this fixated on wine? Yes, I like wine, I like to drink it. I don't like to memorize every frikkin kind there is, what years are best, etc. I don't like to stand around sniffing wine, like a cocker spaniel sniffs its urine, I have better things to do.<br /><br />In this ridiculous work of the author's imagination, the wimpy, spineless man gets the girl in the end. There is no character development. He doesn't realize that he's a pathetic fool, improve himself and ultimately win the girl. He stays a disgusting pitiful wretch of a human being and that's fine with her. If I haven't given you enough reasons not to watch this film, by all means read on cause here's the coup de grace. We get to see a nude Thomas Haden Church copulating with a woman in the butterfly position. I DID NOT need to see this. I did not want the image of THC's buttocks forever tattooed on my psyche. Any faith and respect I ever had for THC is nuked to nothingness when he breaks down in the end like a whiny spineless Miles. Do yourself a favor kill yourself if you have to, but do not watch this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>I can't stop laughing at the artwork for the dvd case. Paul Giamatti is a terrific actor, there is NO arguing that. But did the marketing team have so little faith in the ability of this film to move off of shelves without having to virtually, completely alter his visage so as not to scare people away? While all four actors clearly benefit from the work of a skilled airbrush artist, I am in disbelief at how "pretty" Giamatti is made to look on it...so alien, so not him. THAT aside, this is yet another fine film by Alexander Payne, who's now 4 for 4. Great director.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>so-so directing, screenplay, editing. the whole movie is actually quite boring and contrite. there's nothing too excited about it, just a so-so mediocre story. best supporting actor? nahhh. sitting and watching it, felt a bit suffocated and have to surpress yawns all the time. pretty luke-warm, very forgetful.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>This film is one of those movies that are made for people that can understand the deeper meaning of certian subjects & Content, the movie is some what similar to "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zizzou" and "Lost in Translation", Paul Giamatti to me is a alot like Bill Murray other than the fact the Mr. Murray has a bit more of a humorous side, Giamatti in my opinion is one of the most under-rated actors of this decade. His performance in "Cinnderella Man" was oscar worthy as was his remarkable performance the the low-budget film, American Splender. I cannot wait to see the new M. Night Shaymalon film in which he plays the lead role, I believe it is called "Lady In The Water".BUT back to the subject at hand, Sideways follows to very different people, Jack and Miles (played by Thomas Haden Church & Giamatti) and how they spend a week vacation in the wine country of California. Though Jack is planning on getting married when he returns from their trip he hooks up with a young woman who Jack says is quote "Nasty, Nasty, Nasty! Miles!, do you have that condom I gave you?" ( I think you get the picture...), The movie & Jack continuously point out Miles's low self-esteem, bland and depressing attitude toward life & but of corse his major problems with da ladies!, though the movie can make you somewhat depressed for poor Miles it also has a tendencey to throw you off a bit for a good laugh or two.<br /><br />The cinamatography is absolutly stunning, the humor is uncanny, the acting is flawless and the dialouge, direction & screenplay are all exceptional, though the movie can be slow to some with small attention spands and others who have to have either non-stop action or constant humor, I thought it was very good and would recommend it to most. Great Film!<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is very good, but it is NOT an action movie. It really is like a minimalist Broadway show turned movie. It is somewhat of a middle-age coming-of-age-midlife-crisis for single/divorced people, but entertaining. The kind of thing that is just messed up enough that it has to be true.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>This is a big flop, I was disappointed.  None of the characters were likeable and it went too slow.  Church plays a pretty good slime guy you can partially feel sorry for but Giamatti should get the "Dork Actor of the Year" award for this.  How embarrassing, the pathetic novelist who is so unsure of himself, BOO HOO BOO HOO BOO HOO.<br /><br />There was absolutely no moral message in this film, except what NOT to do with your life.  All the characters were quite pathetic and in some cases not very believable.  Thanks for letting me vent.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>This movie is so not funny. Two ugly guys talking about wine? And I so so done with this film when the naked man comes running outside and presses his naked body against the car. The only good part was with Sandra Oh.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>I remember when there was a time we used to watch movies for entertainment, with good editing, good direction & excellent scripts; Alexander Payne did a good job with this movie & went back to the basics to create this masterpiece.<br /><br />The only thing that equally harmed the movie yet made it a success was the hype. A funny thing with hype is that it raises the bar on the quality of the movie which makes it hard to live up to yet with all that publicity the movie has a better success rate. It's a no-win situation.<br /><br />But overall Sideways does come out on top although it's not meant for all audiences (besides the R rating) you need to have gone through the ups & downs of life to experience what Paul Giamatti is going through & me being divorced know exactly how that feels (especially the Xanax phase).<br /><br />Reading some of the earlier reviews, I've noticed reviewers branding Giamatti & Thomas Haden Church, as loosers! Well I don't know about Church but Giamatti is definitely not. There is a thin line between being human with feelings & a looser. People like Giamatti put a lot of emotion & feeling in what they do be it wine tasting, experiencing gourmet cooking or writing a novel so when something goes wrong it sort of eats away at their soul; its more like an amalgamation of midlife crisis, loss & low sense of worth. A deadly combination, whichever way you look at it.<br /><br />There is no shortage of human emotion in this movie although I really thought Giamatti ought to have been nominated for an Oscar as opposed to Church; don't get me wrong I like Thomas Haden Church, I've been a fan of his ever since Wings & Ned & Stacy, he's good, versatile & overall quite believable but I think Giamatti takes the cake in this movie & a great choice for his role.<br /><br />Verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini-plots within the main plot. It strikes a decent balance between good filmmaking & a modern-day romantic comedy.<br /><br />Rating: 4 & ? stars for a well written movie made with a lot of emotion & creditable performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>"Sideways" follows the journey of two middle aged men Miles and Jack as they drive to vacation before Jack walks down the aisle.  Jack determined to have one last fling gives this vacation a more problematic twist.  Miles is a wine expert, and he intises this hobby as he meets a local waitress who he has seen time by time.  Little do Miles and Jack know is that how their female finds will affect them in the next few days and even their lifetimes.  This becomes more than just a journey.  This is a journey of them finding themselves and why their lives are so dramatic.<br /><br />"Sideways" proceeded to win several awards, including two Golden Globes and one Oscar.  It stars Paul Giamotti ("American Splender"), Thomas Haden Church (TV's "Wings"), Virginia Madsen ("Candyman"), and Sandra Oh (TV's "Grey's Anatomy").  This film was well adapted from the book version with its soft-headed humor with a dramatic twist.  This unique storyline combines love, reflection, and alcohol finely.  It contains the style that of old-fashioned journey films and modernizes it with the alcohol hobbies.  This technique combines well with all of the themes and turn of events.  This allows the characters to have a motive to bond so well instead of just cause.  Therefore, this comedy is not just an action comedy; this is a thematic comedy.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen make terrific comebacks in this film in their Oscar and Golden Globe nominated roles (both supporting performances).  Not just did they make comebacks; they performed the best roles in their careers.  Paul Giomatti proves his acting capabilities with the second consecutive outstanding performance in a film (the first being "American Splender").  His performance notes the overall film theme the truest.  Though Sandra Oh didn't receive many award nominations for this film, she still gave great essence to it like her fellow cast members.<br /><br />Such film quality gives "Sideways" the worthiness for becoming a classic in the following years.  It will surely continue pleasing many audiences as it already has.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>Great acting by Paul Giamatti.<br /><br />It's too bad that the Sandra Oh character (asian woman)is not given the same level of character development compared to the other three characters. Not only is Sandra Oh the only "visible" minority in this movie, she is the only character given a minor role.  The role of Oh's character as the asian sex freak is simply used to offset the "deep" character developoment of the other three major characters.  The Sandra Oh role should have been the Virginia Madsen character -- but then again Hollywood seems to be bent on maintaining certain stereotypes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"Sideways" has a fine premise for a movie:  Two friends go traveling in Northern California to celebrate the freedom of bachelorhood before one of them gets married.  Both have their own selfish interests and addictions:  (One is addicted to alcohol [Paul Giamatti]; the other is addicted to sex [Thomas Hayden Church].)  Their passions seem to be their only bond, for they increasingly separate from one another, each to pursue his own obsession.  Their escapades reveal desperation for each and provide some revealing and comic situations along the way.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional.  Paul Giamatti is particularly expert at playing the lonely wino and conniosseur.  We may not always like the characters (and maybe we're not supposed to), but we can find their struggles and the story appealing enough.  The story is complete, unlike some films that only try to illustrate relationships and do little else.  "Sideways" is a worthy trip and a good diversion, but it may require an acquired palette.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Alexander Payne's "Sideways" is no ordinary road-trip film.  Replacing rowdy teenagers with two middle-aged men certainly makes for a different type of viewing experience.<br /><br />Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) head out to California's wine country to celebrate Jack's last days of bachelorhood.  Early in their trip, Jack meets and soon courts the spirited Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who as it turns out is a friend of one of Miles' acquaintances, Maya (Virginia Madsen).  While Jack is only interested in a physical relationship with Stephanie, Miles' time with Maya leads him to reassess his life.<br /><br />"Sideways" is a film that has a charming warmth and humor to it.  Its exploration of friendship through its two lead characters is insightful and ultimately inspirational.  Both Miles and Jack are not idealized males.  They have flaws galore and self-esteem problems.  Yet, both men keep surviving their day-to-day adversities with the help of the other despite knowing they can never truly overcome all of their shortcomings.  Helping to make the film work are a quartet of wonderful performances.  Giamatti is pitch-perfect in his role and he is complemented by attention-grabbing turns by Church, Oh, and Madsen.  "Sideways" is one of those films that makes you reflect on your own life.  It also is a great introduction to the world of the wine connoisseur.  How many films can you say that about?</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Alexander Payne's Sideways is a very funny, but deep movie about two friends, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), who travel up to wine country for a weeklong bachelor party for Jack.  Miles is a depressed divorcee who is an English teacher, but is trying to get a novel published while Jack is a womanizing former soap opera star that is making a living doing voiceovers.  Miles is also a major oenophile and wine plays a huge part in the film.  Miles & Jack go out to dinner at a restaurant Miles frequents while he's in the area and they meet a waitress, Mya (Virginia Madsen), that Jack tries to hook Miles up with.  Jack falls for a server at a vineyard, Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who ends up being friends with Mya and the four have dinner and end up spending time together.  Through it all Miles can't break out of his depression and Jack ends up paying a price for his sexual dalliances.  All four lead actors are excellent, but Mr. Giamatti is the heart and soul of the film.  He gives a brilliant performance and his lack of an Academy Award nomination will go down as one of the biggest snubs in history.  The one problem with the film is that the last half-hour is quite slow and doesn't live up to rest of the picture.  Other than that, Sideways is an excellent film. Mr. Payne's Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar is well deserved as the dialogue is funny, thought-provoking and never dull.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>I had to pause the DVD and pour myself a glass of wine, just to keep in step with these two middle-aged buddies celebrating the demise of bachelorhood on a wine bar vacation in California's wine growing region. Several glasses later, like a back seat rider through philosophical discussions on impending deep middle age, sordid quickie affairs, earnest heartache, hateful fights and renewed friendship alliances, I took my last sip and realized these wine connoisseurs would balk if they knew the cheap wine I had been drinking all evening, and I longed for the mystique and sensation of the fine wine that is the source and nutrient of this film. I thought, "maybe I'll start a wine collection and really get to know wine.", as this film inspires one to do.  ... It is the next morning. I have a terrible headache.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>It's funny what a little imagination will do for a familiar plot line.  The two main characters were perfectly cast.  Miles(Paul Giamatti) who's been in numerous films, finally gets a shot at stardom, Jack (Tom H.Church) I don't think I've seen him in too many movies.  But, they played well off each other. And Virginia Madsen looks terrific, and she also gets a shot at well earned stardom.  Jack is getting married and wants to get laid for the last time. (I guess some things never change) His best friend Miles has a concience (and dosen't like lying about anything).  How these two ever hooked up in college is amazing. Jack is immature and boyish and thinks his obnoxiously charming<br /><br />slimey way will have the effect he wants it to have (and it does) He should just put a post-it on his forehead saying "please have sex with me". Miles is uncomfortable with the whole idea of using the two women they just met just so his "friend" can "get some".  Besides he really likes Maya (Virginia Madsen) and sees a possible future with her.  This is a low-key comedy, but very enjoyable.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>I liked Sideways for many reasons, but mostly because the characters were very believable and honest to me. I have read critics say they were upset about the undeserving happy ending. I'm not sure what movie they were watching but a happy ending is not the conclusion I drew at all. At best, it is a vague and open-ended conclusion. The only thing we might infer is that Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in what should have been an Oscar winning performance, finally begins to realize that he is a worthwhile person and that he has made peace with his divorce and begun the slow move forward. When he opens the forty year old bottle of wine he had been saving for the "right moment with the right person," and drinks it alone, I knew that his character had stopped the self-loathing that had eaten away at his happiness, his confidence, and his self-esteem. He was the right person and that was a powerful statement.<br />As for his sexually compulsive acquaintance, the mere fact that he managed to get away with his debauched and troubling week of infidelity and cruel behavior does not mean that he got the happy ending. Without any sense of the kind of self-actualization Miles went through, this shallow and most likely self-hating person is doomed to continue his need for self-value via sexual conquests until his marriage is ruined or he has the chance to find out the root of his self-destructive behavior. The grin he flashes Miles as he is getting married is all I need to know that there was no epiphany in his tearful plea to Miles at the motel. His future looks far from happy to me.<br />The women both seemed to be far ahead of their male counterparts. Maya, the perfect compliment to the needy and delicate Miles, has already re-directed her life after her deceit-filled marriage ended and it is her steadfastness and her new-found confidence and independence that allow her to re-connect with Miles and give him the benefit of a second chance. The scene between Miles and Maya in which they describe their love of wine is one of the most eloquent I have seen in a movie in a long while.<br />This is a movie of characters. It is a movie about people who are wounded and far from perfect and yet who battle through the misery that life can be. These characters do things that make you angry and perhaps feel pity for them, but don't we all in the course of our lives? There are indeed no syrupy happy endings to Sideways. There is merely the knock at the door and the uncertainty of what will happen next. If you crave explosions, fast moving plots, blood, gore, puerile humor (all of which I can find quite entertaining!), Sideways is most assuredly not any of those things. It is a quiet movie that takes a wealth of empathy and understanding of the frailties of man to fully appreciate. Calling the characters whiny or saying it is boring means you simply didn't get it. Not everyone will. Not all movies are made for everyone on the planet to enjoy either. I enjoyed Sideways and am glad I bought it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I finally got a chance to see this film last night and while I found the story amusing, it wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. First off, this is not a laugh out loud comedy. The humor is very subtle and will likely put a smile on your face rather than making you laugh for all to hear. The acting by the two leads is really good, even if the characters are totally unlikable. I don't regret renting this one, because to me it is better than most reviews here would indicate, but nowhere near the greatness that most movie critics claim it to be. Barely *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Lost in all the hype about Oscar nominations and accusations of overkill is the fact that Sideways is a fun little movie.  It makes no pretention to be anything else.  It is in the style of Bridget Jones (the first one) - two flawed and over-the-top stereotyped guys (in this case) get into situations that lead to comedic results.  What makes the movie good, though, is that the situations and the reactions to them are consistent and grow out of the characters, not because of plot points that must be followed.<br /><br />This is basically a guy's version of a chick flick.  It is probably not a teenager date movie (certainly not for a 1st date).  The audience at which the film is aimed is probably the same as the main characters - slightly balding, slightly pauncy 30-40 year olds (of both sexes).  Okay, only the guys will be slightly balding, but you know what I mean!  The story - two male friends take off on a road trip in a last week of "freedom" before one's wedding.  The best man, Miles, thinks this is a good opportunity to introduce his friend to the fine art of oenology (wine tasting), especially since he will be marrying into a socially elite and rich family.  That Miles is an alcoholic using this as an excuse to go drinking is obvious to the audience, but probably not to Miles himself.  The friend, Jack, wants nothing from the alcohol except as a lubricant to get as much single-guy sex in before he's tied down.<br /><br />There's no way around this description, even though it makes the two characters seem like cads.  They are - not only is Miles an alcoholic (and a petulant one at that), he even steals money from his own mother in one scene.  Jack is an amoral compulsive womaniser who cannot be convinced that anonymous sex is cheating on his fiancee.  Similarly, they lie to themselves, each other, and to the women they meet.  Somehow, though, we immediately care for them and like them, knowing objectively that they are inherently unlikeable.  Part of it is the performances by Giamatti and Church, which are very good.  The other part is the direction and the script - they are written just a little bit over-the-top, which allows the audience to relax and forgive them their foibles.  Well, the guys in the audience will, I'm not so sure of the gals.<br /><br />The women in the film are much more realistic and more subtle.  They provide the solid emotional grounding and realism that offsets the insanity revolving around the two guys.  The film is really about relationships - much is said about the wine, but that's incidental.  The movie's hook could have been anything - baseball, environmental activism, or a motorcycle club.  The characters' relations to each other (and, granted, to the object holding it all together, wine) underpins all the events in the film.  There are poignant moments, but most of the time the film is humourous in its observations about the people, and the humour grows naturally from the characters and the inextricable logic they must follow once they get themselves into the situation they are in.<br /><br />On reflection at the end, you know that in the real world, Miles would continue to be an alcoholic and Jack would promptly cheat on his wife.  But this is a pseudo-fantasy world where the people, if they don't quite live happily ever after, at least are better off then when they started.  And we have spent a satisfying and fun 2 hours with the characters, without having been cheated by a cheap and artificially contrived grand resolution.<br /><br />This DVD edition has some interesting tidbits.  The audio commentary by the two stars is fun, if not particularly informative.  There are some cut scenes, which, on seeing them, were rightfully cut.  But it's fun to see them nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>I will continually stand by my point with two arguments pertaining to this film.  The first being that this fine piece of cinematic brilliance should have won an Academy Award this year.  The Academy should not have just handed Alexander Payne the award for Best Screenplay (as they did Sophia Coppola), but instead awarded him top honors.  This was more than just a story about a famous singer, or an aviator, or a suffering boxer, but instead a story about the human spirit, the bond of friendship, and the power of wine.  To me, all very symbolic of being a human being.  The second argument that I have is that Paul Giamatti was, literally, robbed from being involved with the Oscars this year.  His performance was the strongest that I saw last year, and the strongest that I have seen so far this year.  He brought his character to life, giving us this sense of "every man" coupled with that oh-so-familiar feeling of loss and frustration.  We have all been there, we have all seen the effects that it can have on us, and I truly think that Giamatti best embodied that sensation.<br /><br />With that grumbling aside, I strongly think that this was an amazing film by any standards.  The performances, like wine, were rich, subtle, and just some small scents of fruitiness.  Alexander Payne has proven, with this film and his previous outings that he can capture the American spirit while also showing us a world that is originally not seen in other films.  I cannot remember the last film that I saw where wine was nearly the central character and the surroundings just happened to be quaint little bits of wine country.  The cinematography was beautiful and breathtaking.  For any of us that have never been to that side of the world, Payne gives us that glimpse and creates that sensation of excitement.  After seeing this film, I want to go there, I want to smell what Miles smelled, while racing through the vineyards.  You know that a film has been successful when it actually creates a stir in your body to want to visit that place and experience it yourself.  Payne not only miraculously showed us a beautiful part of our country, but also brought forward the passion for wine.  Wine enthusiasts could only have written the speeches that Giamatti delivers.  While I know that Payne did not do this all his own, you could almost taste the wine that he, Jim Taylor, and Rex Pickett tasted while they were writing.  It is one of those rare cinematic moments where the wine just seeps from the edges of your television, and you instantly fall in love.<br /><br />So, you have a brilliant mind behind the camera giving the direction, you have a passionate subject that explores one of America's pastimes, what else is there to rave about this film.  Well, as if I didn't semi-mention it already, how about the acting?  Could anyone else have put together a stronger cast than Payne did?  Would anyone else have seen Giamatti as the lead and thought that he could handle the pressures of a leading man?  What about Thomas Haden Church?  Did anyone think that this material would put his name into the Oscar scrapbook?  Then there is Madsen, who literally ventured out of the dark to do this project, and she proved that she is ready for Hollywood.  To say that the acting in this film carried this picture would be bad, because every element co-existed together perfectly, but the acting was a notch above your normal field of Hollywood movies.  Giamatti was, well, a genius and I will forever wave my fist at the Academy for forgetting him.  He couldn't have carried this film on his own, thanks to Oh, Church, and Madsen, these four prove they were the power behind this movie.  They were jaw-dropping pieces of perfection.<br /><br />Overall, as if you couldn't tell already, I thought that this was one of the best cinematic outings to come out of Hollywood this year.  Payne, unlike his early work with Miramax, had complete creative control over this project and he proved that he could handle a balanced story, with complex characters and plenty of wine.  His passion for our American landscape shined brightly through this film as it did with About Schmidt, as he toured us through some unknown nooks and crannies of our nation.  He proved that he could bring some lost nobodies out into the mainstream light and prove that he could bring the best out from them.  He proved, to the film community, that he is ready for bigger, bolder projects, and I have no doubt in my mind that we will soon see his face with a "Best Director" Oscar right next to it.  Alexander Payne is one of Hollywood's most underappreciated secrets, and it is about time that he is unleashed onto the world.<br /><br />Bravo Sideways, Bravo.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I read reviews where people said the characters are unlikable. My wife dropped watching after 20 minutes saying two main characters are jerks and she doesn't feel any empathy for them. Well, all I can say - don't stop watching after the beginning - this movie really deserves to be seen. Giamatti's and Church's characters may not be role models but they are truthful and full of life. This is very true-life film in general. The genre is hard to define, it's just a movie about life.<br /><br />Characters are very vivid, situations are real, relashionship is full of nuances, "Sideways" sometimes are extremely funny and very sad also. You really start feeling compassion towards the characters especially if you try to imagine yourself in their shoes. And especially if you're a man. Because practically Giamatti and Church personify here two types of men that exist on our planet. So anyway you can identify yourself with one or another. Both are lonely although differently, both are struggling to find themselves in life although again their lives and nature are very different. They try to find love and some meaning as all of us so I can't imagine this movie leaving someone apathetic. It's really touching and although it's not a tear-jerker sometimes you feel like crying. And don't be ashamed of it - it's a real man's movie and those will be real man's tears.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>It's humorous, if not disturbing, to see all the moral proclamations against this movie. I suppose if you are anal- retentive, and a curmudgeon at heart, then this film will not appeal to you. However, if you want a real film about real people in hysterically funny circumstances, then you shall be pleased. Great writing and superb acting by a stand out cast make this a perfect movie to own.<br /><br />In fairness to the nudity issue: There really wasn't enough. If we're gonna sit through MC Gainey taking his clothes off, couldn't we have gotten a little more off Virginia Madsen?</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>A funny, troubling, and warmly engaging road movie about the twin horrors of aging and regret, Payne's romantic comedy would be an altogether different movie without the shlubby presence of Giamatti, brilliant as the cranky, self-hating wine snob who bonds with Madsen over their love of Pinot Noir. Miles, of course, is too dismayed by hopelessness to receive Maya's good vibrations, while the painfully immature Jack (hilariously played by "Wings" veteran Church) has his hands full with feisty beauty Stephanie, clueless that he's soon due to walk down the aisle. Oscar winner Payne has a sure hand in "Sideways," and a unique way of blending comedy and poignant storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Miles Raymond and his friend Jack are both losers in their own, very different ways. But they were roommates as college freshmen, and so Miles takes Jack on a tour of California's wine country a week before his wedding in a sort of two-person, weeklong bachelor party of wine-tasting and golf. Miles is a clinically depressed, misanthropic, divorced, alcoholic middle school teacher whose novel has been rejected. He oozes self-hatred and is utterly endearing. Jack is a back-slapping, good looking hunk of a bit-actor who wants to bed a few women before he settles down to marriage. The plot revolves around the two women they meet on their trip, Stephanie and Maya, and the consequences for all involved. Side-splitting humor and deeply human poignancy combine in this travel narrative. I loved Paul Giamatti (Miles) in American Splendor, and he is every bit as good in this film. His character is developed more than Jack's, but perhaps Jack has little character to develop? This movie has received uniformly great reviews (a notable exception being one in the New York Times).</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>Believe all the hype that you have heard on this film it is absolutely wonderful in so many ways.<br /><br />Meet Miles (Paul Giamatti) and his engaged friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) as they embark upon a last effort at freedom before Jack heads down the aisle. Miles is a hapless writer struggling to overcome a breakup with an old flame and Jack is every woman's worst nightmare...that really stupid, overly sexy man who lies like a fiend! The friends end up going for a tour of wineries, Miles is obsessed with Pinot Grigio and Jack with sex. As they spend a week together things start to unravel because of lost dreams, new lives and selfish indulgences that lead to broken hearts along the way. The boys meet a couple of bright and wonderful women who add to the fiasco. A waitress (Virginia Madsen) coming to terms with a divorce and a new way of life describes wine as only a true poet can. While a wild and exuberant wine pourer (Sandra Oh) indulges herself in more than one area. So it is a week of laughter, disappointment, rage and discovery for all the parties involved. But the wine is the true star!<br /><br />This film is written lyrically and it flows like the wine which remains its sub-textural subject. It deals with the complexities of relationships the same way that wineries deal with their crops, some are quick and tart while others have to sit before they build their full bouquets. The acting is phenomenal offering both comic and emotional depth in each of the characters. Madsen is luminous and has the best lines; her character probably the best soul. Giamatti is subtle yet hilarious as the unconfident man with a heart of gold. Church makes women swoon and then cringe but he also makes viewers laugh out loud. And Sandra Oh has the best revenge scene ever filmed....you go girl! Together the blend has an essence of vanilla, a touch of oak and absolutely no horrible aftertaste because it is aged and cared for just like a fine body of wine shelved sideways.</p></br></body></html>

The dark script and characters are still fantastic this time around, but it's almost an exact copy of the one that came before. The last horror film I remember that followed almost scene for scene from the source material was Psycho, and we all know how that turned out. At first I was trying to think of a reason why they would remake an already good/great movie so soon, but I guess they thought most audiences in the U.S. wouldn't want to read the subtitles that the foreign version had to offer.<br /><br />The story involves a 12-year-old vampire girl who befriends a neighbor boy, while her loving "father" has to kill people and bring home blood for her survival.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz is even more impressive here than in her breakout role as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. There is just something hypnotic about her acting. When she is on screen, your eyes are transfixed. I can see a Jodie Foster like career for her, if she doesn't go the Lohan way. Kodi Smit-McPhee was up to the challenge as well. They share some great chemistry. You rarely see one good child actor performance in a movie, let alone two. Richard Jenkins didn't have a major role as the father figure of the vampire girl, but he fit the mold nicely.<br /><br />I liked the atmosphere and creepy visuals even more in this version. The kills were also more quick, brutal and bloody. Some people seem to be complaining about the CGI (which isn't used much anyway), like when the vampire climbs up a tree, but I hardly noticed. The music was okay, but could have been more memorable. I liked the way Blue Oyster Cult's "Burnin' For You" and The Greg Kihn Band's "The Breakup Song" were put to use.<br /><br />Let Me In is easily one of the top five films I've seen this year. I think you will enjoy it more if you don't see the original first, but they are both equally great (maybe a slight edge to this one, especially if you don't want to read), so I'll let you decide. You're welcome.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I loved LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, as it was, and pretty much expected the Hollywood version to suck air by comparison. The truth is, it doesn't. I did prefer the somewhat subtler delivery of the Swedish film, but on the whole LET ME IN managed to retain much of the eeriness of it's predecessor, and Chloe Moretz, Kodi-Smit McPhee, and Elias Koteas were superb. Either film is far beyond some of the more recent editions to the genre, with none of the cloying after-taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Let Me In comes from Matt Reeves...the Director that gave us 2008's Cloverfield? Wow...Reeves goes from a shaky camera to a steady hand at a solid film! Let Me In is the best vampire movie that I've seen in a very, very long time.<br /><br />Granted, Reeves didn't have much work to do other than transpose what was already done in Sweeden in 2008 by Director Tomas Alfredson with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In</a>. Let Me In is basically a redo of the former albeit Americanized. But unless a redo is done "Right", it can easily flop. But flop Let Me In does not with some class acting by kid actors Chlo? Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee.<br /><br />And they call it...puppy love. A bullied recluse of a boy with a single parent goes gaga when a young girl moves into his neighborhood seemingly with the same reclusive traits and a single parent. But when the girl turns out to be a vampire (oh, am I really giving anything away there to anyone reading this?), does it freak him out or draw him in?<br /><br />A vampire that does not have human "familiars"--people who assist vampires by night and more importantly watch over the vampire "nest" by day--is at great risk to being hunted and killed while the sun shines. Dracula's Renfield was a familiar but not referred to as one in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199564094">the novel</a>. In fact, I can think only of two modern day Hollywood creations that use the term familiar, those being the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFWAYU">Blade Collection</a> of films and the TV series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECQ4AS">Supernatural</a>.<br /><br />Let Me In is a terrific tale that intertwines a love story, everyday childhood bullying, vampires and their "familiar" relationships. It's one of the most unique takes on the genre that I've ever seen; it is done with gruesomeness, grace and compassion. Move Let Me In to your Cart and add it to your collection. Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I appreciated the American version of Lindqvist's novel. I saw the original Swedish version and it was compelling. I noticed some differences, especially in the final scenes. Aside from the CGI effects, which were fine, director Matt Reeves seemed to find two ace young actors that had a chemistry that was unsettling. Pre-pubescent love? Kodi-Smit McPhee is a fine young actor, with insight and passion for his character, delivering a most natural angst and desire for a friend. He is bullied, mercilessly, as many are, at school. His family has fallen apart, and you never see his father or his mother's face. He is isolated. In comes Abby, played by the very brilliant Chlo&eacute; Grace Moretz. Suspicion ensues, trust sorta happens, and they end up friends. There's a lot more than that, but I can't blab too much. You may already know this, but it's well put together by Mr. Reeves, and I admire this re-imagining of a fine film. McPhee and Moretz are magic together. The original Swedish "Dragon Tattoo"  films were fine. And I plan to see Fincher's re-imagining of those, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>American moviemakers don't have an especially impressive track record when it comes to adapting hit foreign films for stateside audiences (who generally avoid like the plague anything with subtitles).  But with "Let Me In," a remake of the highly acclaimed Swedish film "Let the Right One In," Hollywood finally gets one right.  This somber and chilling tale of a friendless, put-upon 12-year-old boy who becomes romantically (albeit platonically) involved with the vampire-girl next door emerges as a sort of antidote to the far more crowd-pleasing and commercially successful "Twilight" series, providing a more subdued and thoughtful variation on the same theme.<br /><br />Transferring its setting from Scandinavia to an equally frigid and snowbound Los Alamos, New Mexico, the remake remains true to the core elements that made the original such a quality film in the first place:  its artful tone, its unsensationalistic approach to its material, and its incisive look at what it means to be a misfit in a world in which conformity is prized above all else - and never more so than during adolescence.  For Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) are both outcasts from society, Abby quite literally since her condition makes it impossible for her to interact with others in any kind of meaningful way (except to devour their blood).  But Owen is no less of an outsider, since his diminutiveness, shyness and dreamy nature make him an easy and perpetual target for the town's bullies.  It's no surprise, then, that Owen and Abby eventually reach out to one another for love and acceptance, despite the seeming impossibility of their relationship.<br /><br />As a horror film, "Let Me In" doesn't hold back from showing us the requisite gore and grue that comes with the genre, but director Matt Reeve's script is far more concerned with the interaction among characters and the exploration of theme than it is with piling up easily achievable gross-out moments.  For instance, the gruesome task of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival helps to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.<br /><br />Smit-McPhee and Moretz are both superb as the inter-species Romeo and Juliet, and there's a fine supporting cast to boot.<br /><br />In this case at least, "Let Me In" is a command well worth obeying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>First, could I just mention how neat it is to see Hammer Films fronting a horror flick again? Second, this American remake of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is actually really good. I do have a preference for the Swedish adaptation, partly because it was the original film, partly because I still regard it as the superior film. Thankfully, director Matt Reeves did make sure to get novelist John Ajvide Lindqvist's blessings. Moments into the American version, that sinking feeling I had going in dissipated, never to return.<br /><br />The plot, if you haven't heard yet, tracks the bond formed between a lonely, mercilessly bulled boy and a vampire girl who moves in next door. It's sweet, yes, but horrifying. LET ME IN is one of the best horror films I've seen in recent years. It is stunningly atmospheric and stark and melancholy, graced with soulful acting by the two lead children, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz. These two kids are heartbreaking. One of the most striking elements is the film's deglamourizing of vampirism. "Abby," eternally twelve years old, leads a a bleak, nomadic existence. Her predations reduce her to this feral, primal ghoul, and it's ugly to see, and shocking. It's indicative of Smit-McPhee and Moretz's extraordinary performances that you still find yourself rooting for their relationship to work out, for things to turn out okay for them. Never mind that Abby requires human blood to sustain her.<br /><br />It's obvious that Matt Reeves is drawing metaphors between vampirism and adolescence as a torturous existence. It's true, though, that real horror originates from close to home, when it's grounded in reality. Even more terrifying than the vampire element are those three kids who relentlessly victimize Owen in school. The score realizes this and introduces this really ominous beat whenever the trio converges on Owen. Sue me, I couldn't wait for them to get their violent comeuppance. And that's the twisted bit about this film, really. It makes you care about Owen and Abby and even about Abby's "father," who is a serial killer (played by Richard Jenkins, excellent).<br /><br />Horror cinema and artistic merit are barely nodding acquaintances, but both converge in this movie. LET ME IN stands out from the pack, draws your eye like a bare-footed child on a chilly night. Or blood spilled on the snow banks of wintry Los Alamos, New Mexico. It fills you with creeping dread and leaves you with a bittersweet aftertaste. The love story is unconventional but hauntingly moving. Abby confesses to Owen, "I've been twelve for a very long time." As the cycle begins anew.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus material: Audio Commentary by Director Matt Reeves; "From the Inside: A Look at the Making Of LET ME IN (00:17:05 minutes long); "The Art of Special Effects" - goes into the components that make up the film's various CG-rendered sequences: the tunnel kill; Abby scaling the exterior hospital wall, Abby hurdling a fence, etc. (00:06:30); "Car Crash Sequence Step-by-Step" - if you've seen the film, you know the one (00:05:36); 3 Deleted Scenes with optional Director's audio commentary, including one fairly disturbing scene which reveals how Abby was herself turned into a vampire (00:05:09); a trailer gallery; and a poster & still gallery. And there's also a mini comic book insert from Dark Horse Comics, the first issue in a four-part mini-series which is the "official prelude to the film."</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Owen is a boy that doesn't seem to have that much in life. He is bullied and not really seen by his parents, leading him to dream of other things. Amongst those dreams is something dark and hard, allowing him to see himself sticking a knife into those who pick on him. He also looks out his window and sees other people and there he envisions himself with another role. This play and this want leads him to see a 12 year old girl named Abby, whom he seems to like right away. Never mind the fact that she smeels different and never mind the fact that she doesn't wear shoes in the winter or know what a rubix cube is. she is something that he desires and that sees him as someone. She smiles after a time and she gives him advice, telling him to hit those who hit him harder than he dares. Still, she also says she cannot be his friend because she is not a she at all.<br />what does all this mean? Is Owen finding love or another dark hole? The questions and the answers are what makes Let Me In so good and then some.<br /><br />When it comes to Let Me In, the book and the foreign release are already in the books. They are good, too, adn they have a lot to bank on. Still, this release adds more, and makes its own remarks. Whether it is on the man that Abby lives with or the way things transpire with the acid and the man, it all takes its own shape. Even if you have seen it you will see more, and the more is great. The hospital, for example, shows you more of Abby and the first attack shows you more as well. you also have a new way of "collecting," and a new presentation.<br />It all changes.<br /><br />I personally thought this was good and that it was its own thing. It had its own comments and its own style, making it make its own way forward. From the special effects window to the way the people are seen, there are changes and there are staples that are either needed and stay or that are played with and go. The people that live across from here are changed and yet they are still there, and these things are good and they leave other ways to see. I also like the way everything rounds to a close, with it changing and yet keeping things open, allowing it to be more. I like this as well, and I like the way that it is all seen. It makes a great dynamic and a horror movie, playing to all those invovled. It really deseves a watch.<br /><br />I admit I was afraid of this at first. I learned quickly, however, and this was good. It said that I would want to see and I did, and that left things in a nice place. It also left me with a 4.5 - 5 star movie, and a shocked look on my face. I expected good but not this. I am pleased and then some.<br /><br />Thank you.</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>Let Me In or Let the Right One In, take your pick.<br /><br />I am a firm believer that remakes, unless made superior to the original, are patently redundant, especially when there is no perceptible difference between the two.  Except for the cast, language, and a title improvement, there isn't much of a variation between these two films to warrant a remake.<br />A glutton for punishment, I've watched both (and given both away afterwards).<br />I found both films haunting and was overwhelmed by a lingering sadness from each.  I preferred the American title only because it made more sense.  I also loved the score by Michael Giacchino in the American version.  I thought the cinematography by Greig Fraser was brilliant.  The cast couldn't be improved on, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Elias Koteas were all heartbreaking in their performances.<br />Now comes the dilemma.  On one hand, I applaud the artistry that went into both films but on the other hand, I can't say I actually enjoyed watching either, nor do I ever want to see either of them again.  So how to I rate this version?  It's well made but I didn't like it.  It's one thing to appreciate art for what it is, quite another thing to have it hanging in your home.  In this case, I'll err on the side of art.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Let Me In might be the surprise film of the month.  The description didn't seem particularly enticing because it didn't reveal very much, but none of that matters now.  I made the decision to watch the movie anyway and it paid off wonderfully.  It's about a little kid around 12 who gets picked on by bullies at school and after school when it's dark and cold outside, he frequently meets up with (and eventually befriends) a demon girl his own age who has a craving for blood unbeknownst to the boy.  They hit off a friendship that's one of the more unusual ways to develop one, haha.<br /><br />What makes Let Me In work so well is how it perfectly blends sad emotions with just the right touch of orchestration in the soundtrack, and combines these feelings with the surprise and gruesome factor of the horror genre with tons of bloody, violent and unpredictable murders thanks to the demon girls neverending pursuit for blood.  Seems like a bad combination on paper doesn't it?  Well somehow, I loved it.  It's an odd combination, and at first I wasn't sure it'd even work but after watching the entire thing, I'm left to believe the writing is top-notch, intelligent and compelling.  The storyline flows with such ease that the only time you're really lost is right after the boy meets the demon girl and the girl ventures on her own for a little while.  However, everything eventually falls into place and makes sense.<br /><br />The bullies are exceptionally vicious and unforgiving, but that just makes the ending even better.  That basically covers what the film is about.  Might have to turn the volume up high however, because there's tons of whispering between the boy and girl.  It's really amazing just how much of a connection the two of them have.  I highly recommend Let Me In.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>I've watched the original movie "Let the right one in" and this Hollywood version. This one is more terrifying because of bloody scenes and explicit killings. For example, the scene where the girl jumped down from the tree and bit the woman's neck.<br /><br />There are also some very disturbing scenes. For example in  the locker room, the bullying was so rough that Owen.... Moreover, I was very uncomfortable after finding out that a child did all the killings.<br /><br />I think it's worth watching once for curiosity.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>LET ME IN (2010) is a nice, simple title for a relatively nice, simple vampire-horror flick. It is based on the Swedish novel and film "L?t den r&auml;tte komma in", by John Ajvide Lindqvist ("Let the Right One In", 2008, dir. Tomas Alfredson: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAC">Let The Right One In</a>, see my review.)<br /><br />Do not confuse it with the little-known LET ME IN of 2000 - about which I can discover nothing. This, set in Los Alamos, New Mexico in 1983, this story is about poor young Owen (a spectacular Kodi Smit-McPhee). Owen is nearly 13, he's bullied severely and his mother is a religious drunk. The poor boy is turning scary as a result, a bit like seeing Hitler in the making, and it is revolting to see him practicing ... well, I'll leave that for you to discover.<br /><br />Into his life comes 12-year-old vampire Abbey (the equally talented Chloe Grace Moritz), a girl who is at once charming, somewhat naive or dull, yet she writes with something like Mark Twain's handwriting and expressions. She cannot answer Owen when he pointedly asks her if she is a vampire, and there are other things even a regular 12-year-old girl ought to know. Perhaps it's all the hiding in the dark all her undead afterlife. It seems she is nearly 150 or something to that effect. As I understand it, the original character is meant to be 200 years old.<br /><br />LET ME IN has a powerful supporting cast: Elias Koteas as the detective investigating murders, Richard Jenkins as Abbey's boyfriend (c'mon, she's a vampire, they met when he was a kid and he loves her). The boyfriend is committing the murders to get Abbey her blood. Aside from the bone-crunching savagery of Abbey when hungry, there is too much Hammerblood and gore for my taste. That's right, I said Hammerblood!<br /><br />But then, this is a Hammer Films production (via Overture Films for Starz). Odd that I recall my first Hammer film, DRACULA (1958) which catapulted Christopher Lee to international fame. Other Hammer films are the backbone of horror in today's world. What angers me about this film - and the reason I starred it so low - is because I'm tired of all this kidsploitation. These children are too young to be handling roles of such weight and horror.<br /><br />Recently I read an interview with Werner Herzog in "Archeology Review" magazine. He mentioned his old complaint, that we do not have symbols or images worthy of our level of intelligence. He not only means cinema: his grandfather was a prominent though not too well known archeologist. Herzog says that film and advertizing, for example, simply dried up long ago. We are presented no challenges, no context, no feeling and no imagination. The errors in this film came to mind when I read the Herzog interview - it was not a chance occurrence.<br /><br />Screenplay writer/director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD, THE PALLBEARER) does himself some credit here, neither reveling in nor shrinking from the challenges he places on his young actors' thin shoulders. He captures a silent atmosphere which I like to call "atmosfear" - but the Swedes are better at this in general. (They are also wizards at inserting a prominent cop character in every film they produce, which is the one thing lacking in the original film, ironically enough.)<br /><br />LET ME IN compensates with its eye-popping, slick special effects, which really impressed me. There is an auto accident filmed from inside the car, and how they accomplished this horrific and realistic crash effect is beyond me.<br /><br />In his review, Roger Ebert expressed some confusion about some things, namely why there was snow in New Mexico (it does snow heavily there, Roger) and he stated that this film is a scene-for-scene remake of the Swedish original. I have to DISAGREE, as I disagree with the director's Swedish angle. However, it is almost a scene-for-scene remake. We always ruin Swedish masterpieces by remaking them. We need to stop the remakes - but this made me itchy to see the original. I have now seen it and LOVED it.<br /><br />The half-right, half-wrong era is amusing. The makers clearly did not live through or pay attention to the early 1980s. While some details are spot on, others are pathetic. Why set the film in the early 1980s? - my guess is to make forensics and detection a lot harder. Vampires are like to get dealt with rapidly in the 21st century, I guess.<br /><br />So, is this film about the true nature of evil, the nature of being undead and not really loving it, pure voyeurism as Hitchcock always contended was the goal of film, or is it simply Hammer Films trying to hammer a new stamp on cinematic history? If any of these is true, Hammer had better start doing a lot better than this. I deduct one star.<br /><br />The amazing soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is one of the best I have ever heard and melds Foley art with music in an eerie aural confection. There are a few good 1980s songs here, but I wonder at the dates. If there were a way I could get the Giacchino soundtrack without the 1980s radio chatter, I'd get it for its creepy beauty alone.<br /><br />Now that I have enjoyed the original film, may I recommend you get that, and forget this unless you're hardcore about inadequate, rushed remakes. Also I have to ask: why do we keep remaking these great Swedish films within a year or two? Why remake them at all?</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>Yowzah! Beware of who you invite into your home - you never know what kind of monster may be standing on the threshold.<br /><br />Chilling vampire tale starring children although the bullies are almost scarier than the vampire. SUPERB casting in all the roles.<br /><br />I've seen the original Swedish version, too <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>] and I actually liked the U.S. version much better.  I liked the actors in the U.S. version much more.  I do have to say that in most ways the U.S. version stayed very true to the Swedish version.<br /><br />This was probably the scariest and most realistic vampire film I've seen to date.  And the most original.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>Twelve-year-old Owen is mercilessly abused by his schoolmates.  He is befriended by a strange neighbor, Abby, who doesn't wear shoes in the snow; Abby has been twelve years old for a very long time and keeps insisting she's not a girl.  Abby is a vampire who feeds on her neighbors.  Victims of child abuse, Owen and Abby form a romantic bond that will eventually have tragic consequences.<br /><br />  "Let Me In" is a horror film that I would've enjoyed more if I hadn't already seen the original Swedish version "Let the Right One In."  "Let the Right One In" is a superb psychological horror film centered around lonely, troubled adolescents who can empathize with one another; based on the best-selling novel of the same title, it has developed a worldwide cult following.<br /><br />  The acting in "Let Me In" is superb.  Child stars Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz give excellent performances.  However, the real surprise came from Richard Jenkins who gave an award-winning performance as the mild mannered music professor in "The Visitor."  Coincidentally, in "The Visitor," Jenkins befriends and aids two illegal immigrants.  In "Let Me In," he befriends and protects the vampire Abby and is even forced to kill for her.  These scenes were quite shocking.  From the commentary, we learn Jenkins performed all his own stunts.<br /><br />  The plot for "Let Me In" is very similar to the one for "Let the Right One In."  Much of the dialogue, especially from Owen and Abby, was verbatim.  The major difference was the introduction of the policeman who replaces the role of the nosy, vindictive neighbor in "Let the Right One In."  The policeman made "Let Me In" more realistic; however, viewers developed a liking for the policeman's character.  The outcome of his investigation draws sympathy away from the children who are made to look more like evil villains rather than the ill-fated victims of the novel's intent.<br /><br />  Despite the fact that "Let Me In" is a low-budget Hammer production (famous for their classic horror films of the late fifties to early seventies), the special effects are quite awesome.  The extra features on the DVD are required viewing.  They display the computer graphics used when Abby viciously attacks her victims and climbs trees, fences and hospital walls.  The elaborate car crash sequence was filmed outdoors using a cameraman mounted on the vehicle who was actually driving it; the scene was also filmed on stage in front of a blue screen and the vehicle was attached to a giant chicken rotisserie that spun it around and around.<br /><br />  The commentary from Matt Reeves (visionary director of the innovative, groundbreaking "Cloverfield" - a gloomy, claustrophobic monster film as seen from the lens of a home video camera) is interesting and informative.  I was never bored.  It was unbelievable to learn what was actually filmed at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and what was created by computer graphics.  For example, remember when Jenkins attacks the boy at the railroad tracks?  The train never existed.  Also, from listening to Reeves, one learns more about Abby's background and why she keeps telling Owen that she is not a girl when he wants to date her.  One must watch the deleted scene titled "Be Me."  Actually, the entire film is about Owen empathizing with Abby's plight.  She kills in order to survive; however, Owen can't judge her because he fantasizes about killing Kenny and the other bullies.<br /><br />  The viewer learns there are numerous instances of child abuse in "Let Me In."  Owen seems to suffer the most in the film.  He is psychologically harmed by his parents' divorce and is bullied at school by Kenny.  Kenny is bullied by his older brother; therefore, he relieves his pent-up anger and stress by abusing Owen.  Many years ago, Abby was forever physically traumatized by an elderly nun.  Now she is forced to feed on the blood of others.  "Romeo and Juliet" is a novel read by Owen and his classmates which is apropos to the film.  A tragedy, "Romeo and Juliet" mirrors the doomed romance of Owen and Abby; eventually, it will lead to tragedy.  The commentary suggests that Jenkins' character was once a twelve-year-old boy who developed a friendship with Abby.<br /><br />  With the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, I read the full color miniature comic book, "Let Me In: Crossroads," that was included with my copy of the DVD.  It has good illustrations.  The first of four in a new series, this comic is a prelude to the film.  Taking place in the farming community of Wellsville, Indiana, it gives Abby's guardian/protector a name, Thomas, and depicts more of Abby's vicious quest for blood.  Fans of the film may want to read this comic book series from Dark Horse Comics and Hammer.<br /><br />  I would've enjoyed "Let Me In" more if Matt Reeves had made it more different from the Swedish film "Let the Right One In."  My dad said the same thing.  While watching the opening scenes of "Let Me In," he asked, "Didn't I see that boy and girl in another film?"  I told him we had watched "Let the Right One In," which has the same plot.  Reeves should have taken into consideration the fans who had already seen "Let the Right One In."  Also, the gory finale of "Let Me In" would've been more enjoyable if the bullies hadn't turned the lights off in the pool house.  If it hadn't been for the commentary, I wouldn't have known exactly what had happened.  "Let Me In" is gorier and has superior special effects than "Let the Right One In."  However, the latter came first and has the element of surprise.<br /><br />  I have no regrets watching "Let Me In."  I feel that I learned a lot more about the relationship between the vampire and the boy.  In order to learn the complete story, I feel compelled to read the novel "Let the Right One In" by John Ajvide Lindqvist.  According to Matt Reeves, the film would have to be a miniseries in order to give justice to the highly involved novel.  I have read Lindqvist's novel "Handling the Undead," which is an expertly written psychological horror novel focusing on people's reactions upon learning their loved ones have returned from the grave.  "Let Me In" is required viewing if you want to delve deeper into the mystique of the Swedish horror sensation "Let the Right One In."<br /><br />Joseph B.

The film's acting is truly terrific even by Elias Koteas who plays the police officer in this movie and there's some good gore effects that are well done, it's also a kind of retro movie that takes you back to the 80's as there is even some pop songs from that time like David Bowie's Let's Dance and it's a very respectable remake that does things as both the same (But not all the way like that horrible Psycho remake) and new in some parts. It's by far one of the best horror remakes of all time as it earned it's critical acclaim, watch both films of Let The Right One In and this one at the same time to see how good both are. I applaud writer-director Matt Reeves of "Cloverfield" fame of doing a terrific American rendering similar to how "Magificent Seven" was a great American remake of "Seven Samurai" or "Fistful of Dollars" was a terrific American/Italian/Spanish remake of "Yojimbo".<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives off quality flawless picture and sound like you would see in a theater with good extras like audio commentary, featurettes, car crash sequence step-by-step, poster gallery and trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Let Me In deals with both one boy's need to find acceptance, friendship and love, but also the darkness surrounding vampirism. Owen is a young boy who feels a sense of alienation at home with his parents having marital problems. He is also is the target of bullies at schools. He internalizes ideas of revenge with his tormentors at times when alone. Drawn to his next door neighbor, Abby, he strikes up a friendship with her and they begin to pal around. It becomes clear to Owen that Abby is not like other children. She doesn't seem to have knowledge of simple everyday things, and is seemingly never around at school, which gives Owens clues that there is something shady about her. He also overhears what appears to be verbal abuse in her home next door. A string of bizarre murders leads one policeman to believe some cult is responsible. As Owen longs more and more for friendship, he gets closer and closer to Abby, even while he suspects she is in some way connected with the murders.<br /><br />A remake of the recent Swedish film Let the Right One In and based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, Let Me In is a well-thought out, intelligent horror film that has the right balance of mood, plot and gore. Although it has elements of violence and gore, it doesn't overdo it to the point of making this the focus. There's a real understated quality to the film, especially the dialogue between Owen and Abby, but it works here because both characters are trying to channel acceptance from each other and understand their conflicted inner worlds. Both leads (Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are solid in their roles as the two friends.<br /><br />I haven't watched the original film yet, but looking forward to checking it out after seeing this. Unlike many horrors films of today, Let Me In actually makes you feel a little bit for the characters and engages you in their story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Let Me In is one of the most beautiful films of the year, and probably the best remake that I have ever seen. It is based on the Swedish film, Let The Right One In, which was released two years ago to monumental acclaim from both critics and art-house audiences alike. This touching story, concerning a young man's crush on a 12 year old vampire named Eli, captured the hearts and minds of everyone who was lucky enough to see it. If Ingmar Bergman were to direct a vampire-themed film, it would look a lot like this. However, one should not think of the film as yet another entry into the recent "vampire" craze. It is much more than that. This is the film that Twilight only wishes that it could be.<br /><br />The remake deviates structurally from the original, only in that the opening is a bit different, and a few minor characters have been altered or dropped altogether. The integrity of the storytelling remains intact, and as a result, much of the remake resembles the original in all of its snow-drenched glory.<br /><br />Kodi Smit-McPhee plays Owen, a lonely young man who is constantly bullied at school in the most brutal fashion. He spends his evenings at home playing with knives, and spying on the attractive neighbor next door. In addition to these disturbing quirks, he has an almost addictive fondness for Now and Laters, and constantly eats the candy throughout the film. Chloe Moretz plays Abby, a young girl who moves in next door with a man that we initially assume is her father. The two meet on the playground one night, and bond over the intricacies of a Rubick's Cube. Soon, Owen develops a crush on his new friend, oblivious that Abby is really a vampire, and that her "dad" is in fact a serial killer, who creeps out into the night, stalking and killing random victims in order to bring buckets of blood back to Abby, in order that she will survive.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an older cop tries to figure out who the mysterious killer is, as the bodies continue to surface. As far as Owen is concerned, the bullying still continues at school, but with a little advice from Abby, and a little bit of weight training, Owen realizes that he can stand up for himself in one of the film's most shocking - and darkly comic - sequences. It doesn't take long for Owen to realize who and what Abby really is. In all of his fright and confusion, he decides to stay by her side, and as a result, Abby vows to protect Owen in the only way that she knows how.<br /><br />As I said, this is one of the best films of the year. Both of the leads deserve Oscar nominations for their layered performances. The cinematography is breathtaking. The score is beautiful, although there are moments in the film that could do without a background score. This is my only criticism of this otherwise perfect film. Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) has crafted a worthy tribute with Let Me In.<br /><br />It is worth mentioning that this film is rated R, and while the film centers on two adolescents, it is not a film for the 12 and under crowd. It is much too disturbing at times, and the language is pretty rough. I would also encourage Twilighters to see the film, so that they may have a clear example of a film (Let Me In) and a product (Twilight).</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but this one really had me.  It's the most engrossing horror film I've seen in years.<br /><br /> Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a lonely kid, mercilessly bullied at school, whose parents are divorcing.  One winter night, he meets Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), a girl who has just moved into the apartment complex and never wears shoes.<br /><br /> Abby is a vampire, trapped in a child's body, and her "father" (Richard Jenkins) is actually her protector.  Not only does he go out and kill people so that Abby can have blood, but when she does the dastardly deed herself, he disposes of the body.<br /><br /> Both friendless, Owen and Abby bond and it is a relationship that endures even after the young man learns the truth about the strange girl.<br /><br /> Adapted by director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD) from a Swedish novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, LET ME IN is both a horror film and a heart-wrenching tale about the pain of adolescence.  Abby may kill people in order to survive, but she is also a victim.  She didn't ask to become a vampire.<br /><br /> The picture is dark and violent, though much of the blood-letting (wisely) happens off-screen.  It is also a love story that will haunt you long after the movie ends.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I adore the Swedish film Let the Right One In and I was highly skeptical about the idea of an Americanized remake. The original was such a poetic, touching film I wondered how anyone could hope to improve on it. When it was announced that the director of Cloverfield was behind it and the title had been dumbed-down for American audiences (I realize that translations being what they are, the title may be appropriate, but you can't deny it sounds like a dumbed-down version of the original), I lost all faith in it until director Matt Reeves cast two of the most talented child actors working today. Whenever a film is remade, I watch it and judge it on its own merit. When reviewing a remake I don't like to compare it with the original, but I found it impossible to not break my own rule several times here.<br /><br />The setting is Los Alamos, New Mexico, 1983. Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a 12-year-old boy, seemingly with no friends, frequently bullied at school, and with no supporting parent figure to come home to. One night, outside his apartment building, Owen meets a young girl named Abby (Chlo? Moretz), who has just moved in next door with a mysterious man that Owen assumes is her father (Richard Jenkins). It's no spoiler to tell you that Abby is a vampire.<br /><br />Character actor Elias Koteas plays a policeman, who is basically a composite character of several minor characters from the Swedish version. While it's not a shot-for-shot remake, Reeves sticks very close to the Swedish film. Since I've never read the book, I can't be sure that additional elements in this film are Reeves' own ideas or simply ideas taken from the book so I ask you to forgive me if I credit him with something that should be credited to the novelist John Ajvide Lindqvist.<br /><br />So, what has changed? Obviously the setting has moved from Sweden to New Mexico. Some of have commented that since Reeves didn't differentiate from the look of the Swedish version this change was pointless. I'm not offended by it as it doesn't change the story at all. The characters names have changed from Oskar and Eli to Owen and Abby. Once again, I find no quarrel here as their names aren't intact but their character is. Owen and Abby don't differ very much in character from their foreign counterparts and I like that Reeves didn't attempt to tweak with the characterization. Structurally, it's been altered too; the opening scene is changed, which seems to just be a way to capture the attention of an American audience quicker. Let Me In begins with a bang, while Let the Right One In draws you in as it progresses. The bullies portrayed here are much more loathsome, as they appeared more childlike is the Swedish version. Rather than show Owen's father as an alcoholic (do we need another alcoholic father in American movies?), Reeves largely removes his involvement and in a brilliant creative flourish chooses to illustrate Owen's disconnected relationship with his mother by obscuring her face whenever she's onscreen. The look of this film is a bit more monotonous, while scenes with the father (called H?kan in the original, but anonymous here) are played out with more suspense. There's an impressively shot car crash that, in context, I thought worked much better than the "entering the bathroom in defeat" scene from the original. In one moment where Owen simply finds a picture, Reeves adds a much deeper level to the relationship between the father and Abby.<br /><br />Reeves does use a bit more CGI, but he doesn't overuse it. I think Reeves knew he couldn't make the scene where Abby meets a victim under a bridge any more poetic, so he attempted to make it, at least more, creepier. I did not approve of the decision to give Abby such a vampiric look when she feeds. The look was much more subtle and effective previously. Also, the pool scene was executed (no pun intended) much better in the original as it was simultaneously horrifying and darkly humorous. Here, it's just a dark scene (but not in the sense that it's not well-lit). Despite these changes (and despite your feelings on these changes), Reeves doesn't keep the beauty and poetry of the original intact but brings his own poetic beauty to it, really proving his merit as a capable director.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the acting, beginning with Richard Jenkins. This is a highly underrated character actor who has appeared in a lot of movies (including such cinematic fecal matter as Step Brothers, among other things), but he's rarely given a role that allows him to really shine. With hardly any additional screen-time than his foreign counterpart (actor Per Ragnar), Jenkins gives a much creepier, more effective, and ultimately more sympathetic performance. He brings new life to this character that simply wasn't present before. Beyond those two performances, I will not compare any others. McPhee does a convincing, identifiable interpretation of his character and gives a performance that is more emotionally mature than you'd expect from someone who is fourteen (at the time of this writing). Moretz is a revelation in what is arguably her most mature role yet. At thirteen (as of this writing), Moretz has racked up an impressive filmography and, as Abby, she demonstrates that she's an immensely talented actress, capable of conveying emotions way beyond her years. If acting is her passion and she sticks to it, I can see her making real waves in the film industry and being the recipient of many film awards as she gets older. I don't recall seeing a performance by a child actor that impressed me this much. While many will compare her performance with Lina Leandersson's, I encourage those people to look at Moretz at face-value. This is an actress of infinite talent.<br /><br />Let Me In was released to theatres in October of 2010, only four months after the third film in the Twilight Saga became a box office phenomenon. Unlike that film, Let Me In underperformed at the box office. It's a tragedy that such emotionally retarded films like Twilight do phenomenal business at the box office but something this poignant makes no impact. I mention this because fans seem to flock to human-vampire romances, yet the lesser one makes 10x the money. Let Me In is a love story, but not in any traditional, straight-forward sort of way. This adolescent love story has no kissing, no physical intimacy, and no dreary, contrived romanticizing yet is more poignant, romantic, and sweeter than Twilight while simultaneously achieving more emotional resonance than that saga could ever hope for. The fact that Moretz and McPhee, at 13 and 14, bring more pathos to their "romance" than the entire adult cast of Twilight says a lot about the childish idiots that populate that movie.<br /><br />It's a remake, yes but it's one of the best horror films and one of the best vampire films to come out of Hollywood in a while. Let Me In is an admirable film that would be much more respected if it wasn't a remake. Few remakes live up to the original film while almost rivaling it as successfully as Let Me In does. Those not familiar with the original Swedish film should seek it out, but whether you're a big fan of the original or were completely unaware of it's existence I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by this film.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Matt Reeves' "Let Me In," an American version of a Swedish film (English title, "Let the Right One In"), succeeds brilliantly where so many American reworkings of European films fail.  Far from a pale retread or an empty star vehicle, "Let Me In" may be the most intelligent and thought-provoking vampire movie ever.<br /><br />The film is set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the early 1980s.  Not only does the name "Los Alamos" set an ominous tone from the outset, but the time period is a good one for alienation and abandonment (as well as some pretty good tunes on the soundtrack).  Divorce was growing more and more common, but it was still one of those issues that carried a fair weight of shame.  Naturally, our hero is a kind, meek boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of "The Road") whose parents are divorcing.  Owen's mother appears to be the short straw in the broken marriage as she's a bit of a religious nut who drowns her agony in wine before she falls asleep on the couch.  Owen's dad seems decent, but he never gets closer to Owen than a concerned phone call.<br /><br />Owen is alone in a cold world.  Friendless and an only child, he's bullied at school by three bigger boys.  The bullying scenes are handled extremely well - they are just as uncomfortable and riveting as the more bloody action scenes the movie has in store.<br /><br />Alone, that is, until the mysterious Abby arrives.  Abby (Chloe Moretz) is either attractively mysterious or mysteriously attractive - she walks through the snow without shoes and doesn't get cold.  Her melancholy dad (Richard Jenkins) is a melancholy, tortured soul, for reasons the movie makes painfully clear.  Jenkins, one of our most under-rated actors, does a magnificent job with his few lines, including his weighty admonition to Abby, "Please stay away from that boy."<br /><br />Owen eventually learns that Abby is a vampire, but he doesn't care - she is kind to him. In a weaker movie, Abby would become Owen's guardian angel, dispensing comeuppances and one-liners while allowing Owen to become his school's alpha dog.  "Let Me In" has another message - there is a high price to be paid for being a vampire's friend.  Indeed, Abby's dad really isn't her dad, but instead someone who knows all too well what's in store for Owen should he get too close to Abby.<br /><br />Violent without being a bloodfest, scary without resorting to the "jump-out-from-behind-the-door" cliches that the "Scream" franchise mocked so well, "Let Me In" is a true horror movie.  The movie's final scene, innocent enough on its face, sends chills down your spine as you realize the lifetime of horrors that await.  It's not perfect, but after the years of "Buffy," "Twilight," and other campy vampire stuff "Let Me In" represents a triumphant return of horror to the vampire genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I'm a huge fan of the original LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, so I fully expected LET ME IN to be bloody awful. Fortunately, I can report that this film is one of the best remakes I've ever seen! The reason is that they kept the heart of the story in tact, while making slight changes here and there, resulting in a low-key reboot that simply brings the wonderful tale to a wider audience. The success of this movie rests solely on the shoulders of the principle characters (played by Chloe Grace Moretz and Kodi-Smit McPhee). These two recapture the same magic / chemistry that made the original so special. I can now watch both versions with a sigh of great relief...</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Let Me In (Matt Reeves, 2010)<br /><br />While Let Me In didn't garner anywhere near the critical or popular success I thought it would when it came out late last year, the months between its release and the end of 2010 seem to have allowed it to simmer beneath a lot of surfaces, and over the past few weeks I've started hearing Oscar buzz about it, along with the refrain "better than the original." I certainly wouldn't go that far--the original, Let the Right One In, was hands-down the best film of 2008, whereas Let Me In has a great deal of competition for that spot. And yet there is a great deal to like here, and while I did find myself picking it apart in a number of places, I can't deny it's one of the best horror films to come out of the Hollywood machine in the past decade, a feat which is even more impressive given how horribly Hollywood tends to treat its remakes.<br /><br />Plot, in case you missed the original (go see it now, I'll wait) and didn't read the book (which you should also do at your earliest convenience): Owen (The Road's Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a bullied twelve-year-old with delusions of grandeur, parents going through a divorce, and very little hope of anything interesting happening in his life. Until, that is, Abby ((500) Days of Summer's Chloe Moretz) moves in next door with her odd guardian (The Visitor's Richard Jenkins). The two of them begin a hesitant relationship, though Abby warns Owen away repeatedly; still, she seems desperate for human contact, and Owen's passivity draws her; she offers him advice on how to deal with the school's idiot bullies. Meanwhile, a serial killer gears up in the area. You don't have to be a genius to know what's coming, especially since everyone and their mothers has already spoiled it for you, including the film's tagline: Abby is a vampire, and everyone knows it except Owen.<br /><br />High point: Reeves (Cloverfield), working with John Ajvide Lindqvist on this adaptation, stuck a lot closer to the book than did Let the Right One In (which, interestingly, Lindqvist also wrote the adaptation for); within the first five minutes, you understand Owen is a pretty deeply disturbed individual, whereas in the original film he's pretty much the quintessential nice guy who's guaranteed to finish last. Low point: there's still a lot of deviation from the source material, and some of it comes off quite odd. It's obvious they were planning on including a lot more of the book, but veered off at the last minute. (Why is Owen's father even in this movie? And while it's obvious on one level what Abby means when she says "I'm not a girl", there's a scene about two-thirds of the way through the film with a photograph that tells me that Reeves and Lindqvist were salivating to include the book's huge, huge plot twist in that regard... which then disappears, never to be seen again.)<br /><br />High point: Smit-McPhee and Moretz are very good actors, probably as good as Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leanderson (Oskar and Eli in the original). Low point: everyone else in the movie either comes off as cardboard (Cara Buono, playing Owen's mother, is a prime example, or the bullies) or doesn't get nearly enough screen time to really let their talents come forth (Jenkins, or Elias Koteas as the investigating officer).<br /><br />High point: whereas the original film focused almost solely on the romance angle (it would be really, really tough to even call Let the Right One In a horror film were it not for the "what happens if I don't invite you in?" scene... oh, more on that next paragraph), Let Me In definitely wants to play in horror movie territory, and it does it passably well--though this is a horror film in the vein of such recent faves of mine as Shallow Ground and Deadbirds, where if you come expecting ultragore, you're bound to be disappointed. Low point: a lot of what's missing from the book is the themes and scenes that really drive the horror angle home. Most notably absent is Abby's/Eli's sociopathy; it's never less than obvious in the book that all she really needs Owen/Oskar for is as a replacement handler. She wants to break through that wall inside her that keeps her from having friends (and lovers, one assumes; the pedophilia aspect of the book is touched on here, but only barely, in one brief scene, and you probably wouldn't even notice it had you not read the book), but she's incapable of doing so. Here, Abby seems... well, a more normal, well-adjusted kid than Owen, which is odd when you consider the fact that Abby is a couple of centuries older than you are. Also missing are the neighbor who owns the basement room (and whose mother, in the novel, is having a burgeoning relationship with the Elias Koteas character), the barflies who provide a major subplot (though the main pair are kind of remade here as a yuppie couple), and, as noted above, Owen's dad, who is mentioned once briefly, then appears in a phone conversation, and... that's it. And I'm just scratching the surface.<br /><br />High point: what gore there is in this movie is really nicely done. (The goriest scene in the film is, ironically, also its funniest; Richard Jenkins knows comic timing.) Low point: if you're going to blow one of the gore scenes, the one to blow is not the iconic "what happens if I don't invite you in?" scene. Oh, god, what a letdown. If you have seen this, see the original if only for that scene, if you haven't, to show how effective a minimal special effects budget can still be.<br /><br />So yeah, not as good as the original film, which was as good as (though a different beast than) the novel on which both are based. But still, in most cases the good outweighs the bad here, and if you compare it to the other horror movies that came out in 2010--at least those I've seen--it stands head and shoulders above the crowd. Worth your time. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Let Me In" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Twelve-year old Owen is viciously bullied by his classmates and neglected by his divorcing parents. Achingly lonely, Owen spends his days plotting revenge on his middle school tormentors and his evenings spying on the other inhabitants of his apartment complex. His only friend is his new neighbor Abby, an eerily self-possessed young girl who lives next door with her silent father. A frail, troubled child about Owen's age, Abby emerges from her heavily curtained apartment only at night and always barefoot, seemingly immune to the bitter winter elements. Recognizing a fellow outcast, Owen opens up to her and before long, the two have formed a unique bond. When a string of grisly murders puts the town on high alert, Abby's father disappears, and the terrified girl is left to fend for herself. Still, she repeatedly rebuffs Owen's efforts to help her and her increasingly bizarre behavior leads the imaginative Owen to suspect she's hiding an unthinkable secret.<br /><br />The cast led by Kodi Smit-Mcphee (as Owen) & Chloe Grace Moretz (as Abby), who, both give, excellent performances, is excellent!

This is one of the best horror films of the year, if not, the best. It is also one of the best films of the year, so far. This is also an excellent remake that is faithful to its original, "Let The Right One In" (2008).</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Seeing Let the Right One In two weeks before Let Me In makes for an interesting comparison. The original film, Let the Right One In, was an adaptation of a book that had complicated, uncomfortable themes that made it a challenge to adapt to the big screen.  This gave the Swedish film some rough edges: a prelude to a retrospective montage that never happened, Eli's androgyny, and the potentially unpleasant relationship between Eli and her "ghoul" (to use a Vampire RPG term).<br /><br />The androgynous nature of Eli changes her interactions with Oskar.  The mysterious relationship between Eli and her guardian let the viewer come to his or her own conclusions. Although Let the Right One In wasn't perfect, its flaws made it a better film. Let Me In smoothes over all these rough edges, for better or worse.<br /><br />The beautiful and deadly Chloe Grace Moretz (excellent as Hit Girl in Kick-Ass and equally breathtaking here) is Abby, an unearthly little girl who doesn't seem bothered by the cold, loves puzzles, and whose appearance veers from pretty to bedraggled. She befriends outcast Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, just as vulnerable here as he was in The Road), who dreams of stabbing the bullies who harass him.<br /><br />The subtle but important difference between the two films pivots on what the bullies call Owen (Oskar in the original): "little pig." In the American version, Owen is called a little girl.  The gender appellation shifts the movie's focus from two lonely souls finding each other across the gulf of death to two Romeo and Juliet-style prepubescent tweens discovering romance. This doesn't lessen the emotional impact of Let the Right One, but it does change the film's tone significantly.<br /><br />With the exception of the cat sequence, which is missing entirely from Let Me In, Let the Right One In has creepier special effects.  Whether it's Eli/Abby's eyes flashing like a cat, the wreck of Hakan/Thomas' (Richard Jenkins) acid-ravaged face, or Virginia's (Sasha Barrese) horrible conflagration, Let Me In's digital effects look subpar in comparison. For some reason, all of Abby's attacks are handled digitally, which makes them surreal.<br /><br />Even the ending, which is almost a frame-for-frame reproduction, lacks the gut punch of the original by ratcheting back the gore. Let Me In fixes many discrepancies in Let the Right One In, but in doing so seems to be embarrassed by its Swedish roots.  But if you've never seen the original, Let Me In is an excellent substitute.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>It's rare when a Hollywood remake of a widely acclaimed foreign film is as good as the original.  (Just look at what happened to THE VANISHING!)  Matt Reeves, whose previous film CLOVERFIELD was a hit, adapted the Danish coming of age vampire thriller LET THE RIGHT ONE IN and made a nearly perfect Americanized film that has a heart of pure horror.  I usually hate vampire films for a lot of reasons but I love this moody, atmospheric dream that treats desire and alienation with a delicacy that makes real the sacrifices we choose to make for even fleeting intimacy.  Set in Los Alamos, Colorado -- a community with the highest IQ per capita -- the story has a bullied, frail 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) befriending his strange next-door neighbor, Abby (a terrific Chloe Moretz from KICK ASS).  Their outcast bond fortifies Owen to stand up to the bullies.  But when Owen confirms his suspicions that Chloe has a big secret, it's too late; his fate is sealed.  This beautifully acted, visually rich, stunning and tragic love story is perfect in almost every way.  Sadly, it was little seen in theaters and deserves to be rediscovered for home video.  The always fine Richard Jenkins co-stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>The most memorable horror movies of all time are infused with real emotion - the gripping terror of a mother watching her child descend into monstrosity (The Exorcist); the growing fear of a beautiful young wife that she is surrounded by evil (Rosemary's Baby); the devasting loneliness, and ultimate revenge, of a sad high school wallflower (Carrie).  Let Me In is the first honestly terrific horror movie to come along since these classics.  The spooky beauty of this film - from its artfully shot locations, its lush musical score, to its mesmerizing performances - is only one of its many assets.  Most importantly, Let Me In tells an original story and draws you in to the world of two children, both of whom must deal with extraordinary pain and alienation.  The potent mix of spine-shivering terror and lump in your throat works magic in this, a most unlikely entry into the vampire catalog; you won't soon forget Abby once you've let her in.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>After all the romantic fluff and angst of the "Twilight" movies, "Let Me In," a remake of the Swedish film "Let the Right One In," puts the vampire back into its traditional cinematic conventions even though director Matt Reeves transplants the location to New Mexico in 1983.  The title relates to one of the ground rules of vampirism:  vampires must be invited in before they can pounce.<br /><br />Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz, "Kick-Ass") meets Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee, "The Road"), the product of a broken home and the victim of brutal bullying at school, in the courtyard of their apartment complex.  They both appear to be twelve-year-olds, but Abby says they can never be friends.  Her behavior is odd.  She walks in the snow barefoot and never goes to school.  Still, the two form a bond against the background of a series of gruesome murders.<br /><br />Horror movies seldom achieve the level of "Let Me In."  It all comes down to a solid script with believable performances.  I have no problem with screenwriters and directors tweaking the vampire legend to give their movies an interesting spin.  What bothers me is a vampire that is more yuppie sauntering around in daylight than nocturnal bloodsucker.  In this film, Abby follows in the grand tradition of vampires.  Her evident victim, Owen, actually encourages her friendship and she soon becomes his protector.  But what will eventually happen to Owen?<br /><br />Ms. Moretz is very good as Abby -- charming, creepy, scary, sympathetic, savage as the plot dictates.  She sells her character.  Director Reeves wisely duplicates the frigid atmosphere of the Swedish original.  The graphic scenes are shot with a minimum of light to keep them both frightening and mysterious.  Often, American remakes of foreign films fall short, but "Let Me In" retains the bleak, haunting mood of the original while pepping up the pace and incorporating more action.  It is a well-made movie worth your attention.<br /><br />Bonus features on both the R-rated Blu-ray and DVD editions include audio commentary with writer/director Matt Reeves, making-of and art of special effects featurettes, unrated deleted scenes, and a step-by-step look at the creation of one of the movie's action sequences.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>The past few years the vampire film has changed from what began as a horrifying creature to a seductive animal, followed by more creatures and finally with the TWILIGHT films a vampire more interested in seduction than say draining blood. All that changed with a well received Swedish film called LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.<br /><br />As with most movies that have success that come from foreign markets, Hollywood made the decision to remake it as an English language film in the hopes of attracting a wider audience. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. For me, this one works and works well. And for viewers who would rather not follow subtitles this movie should do the trick.<br /><br />Directed by CLOVERFIELD director Matt Reeves it's not so much a remake of the movie as it in an interpretation of the book. Reeves has gone on to say that he spoke with the author and found that his take on the book was what the author was attempting to discuss which was going through the awkward teen years set in a vampire story. It clicks here and Reeves does a great job.<br /><br />Set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, we find ourselves in the midst of winter. Young Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a small boy prone to being bullied while at school. Living with his mother (a woman trapped in her own problems with a failed marriage, devout religious follower and alcoholic in training) Owen leads a lonely life. There are no other kids in their apartment complex and he spends most of his time sitting on the frozen playground outside in the snow. Until a new neighbor shows up.<br /><br />Rarely seen this new neighbor moves into the apartment next door and at times Owen can hear conversations through the walls. The only person he sees is an older man (Richard Jenkins) who goes in and out of the apartment. Then one night Owen meets Abby (Chloe Moretz) who lets him know up front that they can't be friends. But friends they do become.<br /><br />Owen confides in her about the bullying at school. She advises him to just take the bully on up front, that he'll back down once Owen lets himself stop being pushed around. She also lets him know that if need be she'll be there to back him up.<br /><br />What Owen doesn't know is that Abby is a vampire. The man she lives with isn't really her father but the man who takes care of her, supplying her with fresh blood that he extracts from victims he kills and then drains. When a draining goes wrong, Owen can hear two voices arguing, neither of which sounds like a child. Due to this accident, Abby is forced to go out and feed on her own.<br /><br />Owen and Abby become close friends. Both lead lonely lives but find comfort in one another's company. Each is the companion the other thought they'd never have. But would this be the case if Owen truly knew what Abby was?<br /><br />While this story unfolds the police are searching for the savage killer on the streets. The bullies continue to give Owen a hard time as we wait to see if he calls their bluff. And the time draws near where we discover if Abby will reveal herself to Owen or not. And if she does, what will be his response?<br /><br />The surface of this movie is a horror film with a few gory moments tossed in for those fans but a more horrifying tale that smolders beneath. It's less about the attacks and bloodshed of the vampire and more about what it takes to survive, especially while being 12 years old for so long. Gone is the romantic adolescent version of vampirism and in its place a deeper story of what it's like to be lonely in the middle of a world full of people.<br /><br />Each actor does a fantastic job, most importantly the two young leads. For either of them to carry the weight and depth of their characters is something worth watching, for both of them to do so is amazing. Jenkins does a good job but is relegated to little in this film. And Elias Koteas as the detective searching for a killer does a tremendous job.<br /><br />It seems that many horror fans have taken a liking to blood drenched horror that offers multiple mutilations these days. For those that like something to think about, that plays as much with your mind as it does your stomach, this is a movie that will whet your appetite. The pacing may be slow, but there's a reason for that. This is a story that unfolds rather than slaps you in the face. And a good story at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>LET ME IN is more accessible than its Swedish original. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  It's also more a love story than just a straight up horror movie, although the horror there.<br />Set in a hauntingly beautiful winter in New Mexico, the movie centers on a bullied 12 yr old boy who befriends his new 12 yr old neighbor, a strange 12 yr old girl who walks barefoot in the snow.<br />The cast is perfect:  Kodi Smit-McPhee, whose angelic facade hides inner anger and fury; Chloe Moretz, glowing in quiet despair; the excellent Richard Jenkins, burdened with guilt; and Elias Koteas as the persistent detective.<br />LET ME IN is a good vampire story, just a tad slow, but a smartly made movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The cynic in me hates the reasons for recreating one of 2008's greatest films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAC">Let The Right One In</a> or L?t den r&auml;tte komma in, an absolutely perfect romantic horror film that didn't need to be remade at all, much less only two years later.  The reasons are simple; the American audience that fills up theaters is much less likely to show up to a film that is in Swedish and lacks the special effects hooks and quasi-starpower of this remake.  Regardless if it is a remake or not, Let the Right One In is a superior film and I preface this review of its Americanized remake with the highest recommendation I can possibly give to the original.  However, do not let this play down entirely the fact that Let Me In is overall a terrifically disturbing and enjoyable horror film in its own right.<br /><br />The film takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico and follows a sad twelve year old outcast named Owen (called Oskar in the 2008 movie).  Owen is neglected by his selfish parents and abused, sometimes brutally, by his peers at school.  He's easy to like but has some quirks that really put his relationship with the audience under scrutiny.  Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who won't get the credit his co-star Chloe Moretz will get in many circles but deserves it just the same.  Owen gets a new neighbor in Abby (played by Moretz, who was great earlier this year as Hit Girl in the super hero action comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG983M">Kick-Ass</a>), a strange girl who doesn't wear shoes in the snow and seems altogether careless about her appearance.  Owen and Abby grow to have a wonderful relationship and although the film's sense of romance didn't hook me in as deeply as the original film did, it still works.  The major obstacle to Owen and Abby's budding friendship is simple; she is a vampire.  The supporting cast is great here and the although Elias Koteas's character was not present in the 2008 film, he is a welcome addition if only for the fact that this guy is a such a fantastic actor.  Richard Jenkins, an actor who dominated every frame of another great 2008 film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015OKWKI">The Visitor</a>, plays the role of Abby's "father" and protector.  He is, as always, amazing.<br /><br />I have to give director Matt Reeves (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OQG">Cloverfield</a>) credit for giving this story the respect it deserves.  He is a very good filmmaker and knows how to make an audience uncomfortable while also connecting to the characters.  He loses some points for taking on a project that either he or the producers merely intended to cash in on, and despite having some meticulous aesthetic strengths he only imitates the over powering atmosphere of the original film.  I don't like some of the special effects used for Abby, in particular the obvious use of CGI, but others will.  I didn't like that the film pulled some punches in areas that might make a more broad audience uncomfortable.  On the other hand I thought that one scene in particular was actually an improvement from the original.  Still, the original can't be touched and shame on them for trying.  But in the end this is a very good horror film by any standard and you should see it before Halloween, because it will be much better than the other garbage you'll be asked to see through endless obnoxious advertisements in the coming weeks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>The blood sucking and vampire aspects of the movie blended well with the loneliness and helplessness of a young child. You would walk out of the movie believing that the helpless child viewed impoverished and strange people as vampires and benefited from their greater suffering in alleviating his.<br /><br />The mother of the child remained anonymous and faceless. The father remained remote and disinterested. Thus, the lone child has to face life by making his own image of what life should be. His neighbors are isolated and remote. His only encounter was a girl who has no traceable past, does not know her real age, never went to school, poor, and expresses strange senses of never feeling cold. In the school, the lone child is bullied by ruthless kids and could not gather his strength to ward off aggression.<br /><br />The movie then shows multiple murders by the father of the neighbor and impoverished girl. It was not clear whether those murders were mere speculation by the lone child after he grew up or were mere guessing to frame the strange and secretive neighbor.<br /><br />"Let me in" sounded mutual. The lone boy needed someone to talk to and share. The strange and impoverished neighbor has something to offer. She advised the feeble and defenseless boy to fight back when others bully him. Thus, the two kids could share, one was desperate for friendship, the other for normality. The strange neighbor girl sounded as an extraterrestrial creature within the norms of the lone boy. His mind perceived her as the savior vampire who could help him fight back the aggressors. The perceived vampire permeated into the mind of the lone boy as the savior in moments of extreme fear. She sucked the blood of others, climbed trees and buildings faster than chimpanzees, but harbored love and friendship towards him.<br /><br />How such scenario related to the the year 1982, New Mexico, or to Ronald Reagan's presidency, is obscure to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>If you think you are going to sit down and watch a movie about a Vampire I believe you already have a preconcived idea in your head as to what you will see.  Watch out with this film, because that is not what is going to happen.  I noticed in reading other reviews that the word, "Haunting." was used often and I have to say that word does sum up this movie.<br /><br />We meet two young people, Owen  is the first.  He is a young boy whose parents are getting divorced and of course that is causing trauma to him.  He is also having a terrible time in school. He has no friends and has been singled out by a bully whose cruelity has not limits.<br />Abby moved into his apartment complex and Owen soon makes friends with her.  However, Abby is not the normal 12 year old, no she has a terrible secret.  Soon the two become close and Abby shares her secret with Owen and his life changes forever.<br /><br />I am not going to go into the storyline but I am going to tell you that it definitely twists around in ways you cannot imagine. You are taken into the world of a Vampire and than thrust back into the world of a sad young boy and girl. You are never told Abby's past so you wonder how her trip into Hell began.<br /><br />The movie is both dark and mysterious, tender and frightening and left me feeling unsettled as it had no conclusion - only what you presume will be a dark future. Again, not the normal Vampire movie of the past we have grown accustumed to,  but one that  delivers not what you would expect, and perhaps that is what will make this movie a success.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>On a First viewing, LET ME IN, is very varied; not in quality so much as in content. The screen-writers marry the alienation of being bullied with the variation of the vampire theme, and somehow try to make that alienation come out the same. The only way you can come to this conclusion is if you listen to the commentary and see the special features, and they are quite good.<br />  What is amazing is that the scarey scenes are almost totally digital, and the bully scenes are far too reminiscent of how I was treated myself by bullies. It really is a case of you have to see the film, AND hear the commentary to know what the movie covers and ALSO what the movie does not cover; and the film makers are very open about this aspect of the film. As some commentators  have indicated, the subtlties and nuancies of the original film and book are way out of the league of the english film, but it would seem that the author  of the original book is happy that his own story in fiction has made it out so far, so I suspect those that are motivated may go to read the original book in translation.<br />  The film is chilling and suspenseful in a broad sense, but not as scarey as I would have hoped for, especially given the scope of the subject matter. Its a bit odd that so many people who all agree that the exorcist is so scarey can't aspire to try and out scare people by out doing the exorcist in a "better" way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Let Me In is a surprisingly well made remake of the Swedish film "Let the Right One In". Mostly because the direction, locations, camera shots and the atmosphere all feel about the same. The movie is good because the Swedish film was and because this is pretty much the same movie. Yet, I never felt bored watching it and was about as entertained by it as I was by the Swedish version.</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>I'll admit that I went into this film expecting just another stupid vampire film.  Like zombies in video games, every big film these days just has to have vampires and it's all thanks to Twilight and Friends.  It has become the comedy staple of many satires (including the horribly made Vampires Suck) and online parodies that makes any member of the general audience just roll their eyes when they hear about a film coming out about vampires.  Because of this established norm, my friends and I scheduled a movie night hoping to heckle or "riff" the hell out of Let Me In just like we had done with Sharktopus the week prior.<br /><br />When the credits rolled and we all looked at each other, we made the startling observation that we had not really done any riffing at all.  We got a few jabs in early on during the opening scene in the hospital (they were Dirty Harry references BTW), but they quickly began to trail off as the film went on.  We began to get drawn into the film and soon the entire audience, myself included, just watched the film intently.  We enjoyed it, thoroughly and couldn't believe what had just transpired.<br /><br />The film has a very basic premise, forbidden love between a bullied preteen kid and a girl vampire (this ISN'T a spoiler as it's written in the description and on the back of the box).  It kinda reminds me of any Disney film pertaining to forbidden love but much, much, MUCH more graphic.  Definitely not for kids (the falling body parts in the pool at the end of the film put this one over the top for an "R" rating).  The love part isn't overdone like it is in Twilight and the characters are real people, not hairless musclebound teenagers that use any excuse to take their shirts off.  It's a cute little love story.<br /><br />Now, normally I am very black and white on villains, killers, moral vagrants, etc. in that I believe one must atone for their mistakes in one way or another.  However, despite the vampire character randomly attacking and killing innocent people, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her since it's in her nature.  She is no more guilty than an alligator taking a victim that got too close to the water in a swamp.  It also adds to the character development of both the boy (I never could remember names) and the vampire as they struggle with this horrific truth and try to go on with their lives.  It kept us reeled in.<br /><br />Now, I did not see the original so I cannot comment on whether it is better, worse, or about the same.  While I never pass up a good foreign film such as Das Boot, My Sassy Girl (the Korean version), or any good anime, this one slipped under my radar.  Sorry.<br /><br />All in all, I was very impressed with this one.  I might actually show my girlfriend this one and that's a big deal since I've only shown her my favorites.  Well worthy of viewing for anyone... except children.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>This is one of those rare Hollywood remakes of a good Euro film - in this case the Swedish "Let the Right One In" - that is actually better than the original.  While I liked the original 2008 film, I thought it left too many questions unanswered which drew away attention from the main story.  This includes the controversial vampire he-or-she question.  More on that later.  This film which was brilliantly directed and written by "Cloverfield's" Matt Reeves, smartly avoids the question for the most part.<br /><br />The best thing about this sweet, tender, violent, bloody movie is the 2 young leads.  Both should go far and I expect Chloe Moretz will break a few hearts along the way.  The film does closely follow the predecessor and even repeats some dialog word for word.  Transplanted to remote Los Alamos, New Mexico, the film works on every level.  At times you forget you are watching a "vampire movie", but instead watching a budding young love relationship.  Don't get too comfortable however, there's enough blood to go around.<br /><br />Finally, this question from the original movie of whether Abby (this movie) ne Eli (Swedish) is a boy or girl.  This film wisely removes the question.  The original leaves it open for discussion.  My research comes up with numerous theories, none of which made much sense to me.  Since this is an adaptation from a book, I checked it out.  In the book, the author says Eli is an androgynous boy from centuries ago castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman.  Yeah, that won't work for us Americanos.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer is flawless with beautiful dark night scenes and clear view of blood splatterings.  The Dolby True HD 5.1 surround is perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>One of the best movies I saw last year was "Let The Right One In", a Norwegian vampire movie that was bleak and arty and basically about the morally ambiguous relationship between two twelve-year-old kids. I walked into this one five minutes late, which I normally don't do, but I thought it would be okay because the credits usually eat up five minutes anyway. But in this case, the movie had started already, at a scene that I knew was halfway through the film. I thought to myself "did I come in one hour and five minutes late instead of just five minutes late?" But what the director does is he starts at an important scene from the middle, then jumps back two weeks.<br /><br />The film is a very faithful remake of the original, and it's always interesting to see how the director's going to stage any given scene. The one thing that is very different is that neither of Owen's divorcing parents are ever seen; the father is only heard on the phone, and the mum, who he lives with, is only seen from the shoulders down, heightening the sense of Owen's isolation and loneliness. No adult befriends Owen, and his classmates are either indifferent or hostile. Owen's moral lapse comes out strongly in this film, and he's so happy to finally have a companion that he forgets that Abby is a heartless killer.<br /><br />One complaint is the soundtrack, which is too moody, and when it turns moody it projects that something bad is going to happen. I don't remember much music in the original at all. But since its intention is to make the viewers tense, it sure does its job well.<br /><br />Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, the young boy who was in The Road, and he was 13 at the time it was filmed. Abby is played by Chlo? Grace Moretz, who was Hit Girl in the movie Kick Ass, and she was also 13 when the film was made. Both actors have been working since 2005 and have been in a bunch of films!</p></br><a href="../users/AH1OH4PWR7NV6.html">AH1OH4PWR7NV6</a><br/><p>I really thought this would be a good horror movie I could add to my collection.  Sadly, it is just a good movie with some gore in it.  A bit predictable as well.  Thankfully it is not a sappy movie like "Twilight" and unfortunately not scary like "A Haunting in Connecticut."  So what, the vampire child gives the wimpy kid some advise on dealing with bullies, it really did not work.  And as predicted, she comes to his defense in the end.  Stephen King added his two cents "the best horror movie in 20 years."  Really???  It is just a good story.  Some of the reviews on Amazon say that the American remake has more special effects.  If that is true, then I won't waste my time watching the original.  Kids are great in creepy movies and have the potential to make the movie that much more creepier or fun.  This movie failed at both ends.  It was just a good story with an open end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>A shy boy (Smit-Mcphee) befriends the new girl (Moretz) and discovers a horrifying secret.  After a lifetime of bullying Owen (Smit-Mcphee) meets a mysterious new girl named Abby (Moretz) who teaches him to stand up for himself.  Having never seen the original (Let The Right One In) I went in expecting a vampire thriller.  I had high hopes for this one but it was not what I expected.  It wasn't terrible, just slow.  I may not have paid attention as much as I should have but it seemed like there was no real plot.  As far as I can tell it's a movie about a shy boy making friends with a vampire and trying to co-exist.  This is one of those movies that is OK while watching it but almost instantly forgotten when it's over.  Don't go in expecting the "Twilight" vampires.  This is pretty graphic, with seemingly random killings.  If vampires actually did exist this is what I imagine that they would be like, hidden and trying to fit in.  I give it a C.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - No</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Hackneyed vampire story with a script and directing that was predictable, disjointed and lacking in creative storytelling that, sadly,  was potentially possible in this unique juxtaposition of two misunderstood needy lovers. Opportunity missed! Instead we just get shallow personifications of characters such as parents, guardians, caretakers, professionals and teachers that are presented as incompetent expendable meals that have no more depth than a shadow. These people were given such small stereotypic roles that we seem to care little whether they die or do nothing all film long. Just not real! The rest of the unreality of this film was the heavy reliance upon ripping people apart which, again, did nothing to advance our understanding of our misunderstood protagonists.<br /><br />Two stars for the cinematography and Chlo?'s presence. Although, wasted in a movie where her talents were diminished by very fakey blood; CGI teeth; bare feet endlessly filmed (another reason why Americans need to wear sandals more often) and posing for the camera with "the look" punctuated by limited scripted lines that seemed almost tritely comical. She needs a new agent.<br /><br />You would think that a nearly 1000 year old 12 year old vampire would have experienced love at least once in that long life span. Also, you would think that raiding blood banks and hospital blood freezers would be a whole lot quicker and safer source of hemoglobin (you know - AIDS; other viruses and pathogens would be screened out). Also, what does a Rubik's cube have to do with innately primitive blood hunting savagery - there's  just not a whole lot of abstract creative intelligence transfer between the two activities.<br /><br />Conclusion: Just a poorly thought out and directed script.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Horror fans around the world cried foul when the phenomenal Swedish vampire tale LET THE RIGHT ONE IN was scheduled for an American remake within one year of its DVD release. Thankfully, writer/director Matt Reeves manages to pull together an equally beautiful film that retains the heart and soul of the original in its overall mood and aesthetic. LET ME IN follows Owen, a shy boy who is constantly tormented by his peers. When a strange young girl moves in next door, the two bond out of their shared loneliness to form a close friendship. What Owen doesn't know is that his new playmate is an ageless vampire, and that she is sustaining herself on the blood of their neighbors. Reeves uses the same drained color palette and restrained shooting style that can be found in Alfredson's film, filling each scene with cold blues and muted browns in order to give LET ME IN a bleak but timeless look and feel. Its story and characters share the same level of warmth and depth from before, brought over from the portion of John Ajvide Lindqvist's original screenplay that was left intact. This would have meant nothing without the stellar leads played by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz, who bring the characters to life with a pair of incredible performances from such young actors. With few exceptions, LET ME IN also remains as subtle and effective as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, however there are a few moments that have been cheapened through the unnecessary use of computerization. These minor trespasses are easier to overlook when Reeves has gone to such great lengths to honor and respect the film's source material. In the end, LET ME IN proves to be one of the most confident and skillful remakes to come out in recent years, yet it still begs the question "Why?" when so little has been changed. Still, it more than serves its purpose in retelling the same exact story for lazy American audiences that can't be bothered with subtitles.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>"Let Me In" - 4 1/2 = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />"Let Me In" (2010) is the American remake of the Norwegian original, "Let the Right One In" (2008). It is about how two misfits find each other. Owen, (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is terrorized by bullies at school, & fantasizes about revenge by playing out his fears when he is alone. His parents are divorced, & Owen just seems to not fit in anywhere, at school or at home. The other, Abby. Abby has just moved in next door, with who Owen at first thinks is her father, Richard Jenkins (who's role is called, "the Father"), who actually is not Abby's father at all, but day time protector & provider of food, namely, blood, for Abby is a Vampire. She needs someone to watch over her during the day & to go out hunting for her at night, though you'll see later in the film, that Abby is perfectly capable of hunting down her own food. So the film starts.<br /><br />"Let Me In" is a tragic horror film, the tragedy of loneliness, the tragedy of being stuck with who you are & what you are, of not fitting in. For Owen, it's loneliness, being weak, being an outcast. For Abby, it's being a Vampire & knowing she'll never stop being one. Abby will continue to live on, while one human companion after another takes care of her needs. It is the tragedy of knowing that the one person she selects as her companion will eventually die, & before he does, she'll have to find another to replace him. For her companion, it is knowing someday all this will happen, & when it does, the pain of desertion, replacement, the pain of knowing it is over. Both film's orchestrate these themes well, but I feel the remake does a better job of it. The acting, directing & editing seems to be quite a bit stronger, & the cast is perfect, but at the same time, the original film is dubbed, & that can contribute to how well a film seems acted & translates it's story to a foreign audience. In this case, the American version seems more intimate, tragic,  just by facial expressions & body language alone. This is especially evident in "the Father" character. Richard Jenkins exudes tragedy in just about every scene he is in. His eyes speak a million atrocious tragedies that he has committed. His eyes speak a great sadness in knowing his time is about over. His, is a greatly improved role & performance over the original. Same has to be said about Owen's part, Kodi Smit McPhee was born for this role. His eyes speak great sadness, but also, great fear, the fear of the world. His counterpart, "Oscar," in the original film, shows much anger, but his role & performance is nowhere as deep, as sad, as multi-dimensional as Owens. Chloe Grace Moretz, as Abby, brings more tragedy & sadness to her role than her counterpart, "Eli," in the original. This can especially be witnessed in scenes with "the Father," especially the hospital scene. Both movies had the same scene, but the American version just takes it so much deeper. You can feel their pain, you can see their pain. In the original, it seemed just like a repeated scenario for Ali. There was a little sadness, but then it was all over in a blink of an eye, without much remorse, not so with the emotional punch of the remake.<br /><br />Both films are horror films, but here, the American version has the edge again. When Abby hunts her prey, she is absolutely feral, she looks the part, due to superior make up. She moves like the part, due to superior special effects. She is the part, as she ravenously feeds on her victims. One thing though that is missing in the remake, is the more overtly sexual relationship between Ali & Oscar, where it is only hinted at in the remake, the original is fairly frank about it, especially in the scene that Ali puts on Oscar's mother's dress, & he peers in to the room, there is a quick flash of frontal nudity. There is also a scene with a long kiss between the two.  Europe has a more worldly view on sexuality between children, where America does not blink an eye seeing a child frenetically feeding off her victims, but would be uncomfortable viewing a long kiss, let alone, nudity, between the two child actors.<br /><br />Another very important part of these movies are the bullies of both Owen & Oscar. The original film bullies were just weak, as compared to the brutal masochistic nature of the American film. There is a scene where both Owen & Oscar get whipped with what looks like a metal radio antenna. In the Norwegian film, as Oscar gets whipped, it looks more like love taps when compared to the American film, as Owen gets flogged, brutally flogged, you can feel every lash of the antenna. Another is where Owen gets whipped in the face with a towel in the boys locker room after gym class. You can feel that towel whipping his face, then if that is not enough, the bullies knock him to the floor & beat on him until he urinates in his pants out of terror. Yes, there is no comparison of the bullies here between the two films, the American version wins hands down, plus Owen is terrified even to make eye contact with his foes, where Oscar seems to be oblivious of them half the time.<br /><br />Both films are very good to great additions to the horror genre, they add depth, terror, horror, sadness, & loneliness, to a rather oversaturated time for Vampire movies, that are frankly, quite lame by comparison. A drop of fresh blood, just when the Vampire movie needed it the most, in this post "Twilight" era.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for "Let Me In" is impeccable, worth picking up!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A remake of a Swedish horror film, a boy is being picked on by bullies at school and he encounters a young girl who just moved in next door. She is not really a girl, but a vampire who has befriended the boy. The girl needs blood to stay alive, creating a need for the man she travels with to take the lives of local residents. This is a very effective horror film that does not deluge the viewer with violence, but engrosses the moviegoer in the developing relationship at the film's core, and the fate of the schoolyard bullies of whom the boy is fearful.Very similar to the original, which is also good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Most child actors make their big break starring in children's movies.  Chloe Moretz has done the exact opposite; though she has a string of children's movies on her resume already, she has made her name among the American movie-going public by starring in a bloody horror flick and a vulgar, bloody action flick; both of which are rated R.  And to her credit, both of these movies are probably among the best releases of 2010.  This one, a remake of a Swedish film of a similar name and plot, has Chloe portraying a 12-year old female vampire who develops a relationship with a bullied boy in a small town somewhere in America during the dead of winter.  Her acting is quite impressive, with scenes of romance, action, suspense and drama mixed together.  Her acting is accompanied by good acting by the rest of the cast, most of which, like her, are relative unknowns in Hollywood.  The movie itself is scary and entertaining to watch.  Overall, one of the better films of 2010.  One final comment about her breakout role; she is following a successful path; Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore and Christian Bale made their names by starring in rated-R movies as children.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CMGIQZ1OAA2.html">A18CMGIQZ1OAA2</a><br/><p>what can i say. i didnt know what to expect with let me in.  i love vampire movies of all kinds.  im even a twilight geek (this movie is not like that just incase your anti twilight or pro twilight, its a horror movie. gory and not the least bit funny or magical).  when abby and her "father" come in town like a gusty breeze in the night, they have "laying it low" written all over them.  the neighbor boy in their aparment complex sees them though. hes being brutalized at school by a band of bullies. way past the point of a shove in a hallway. though she fights it abby forms a friendship with the boy and later go steady.  but see abbys not really a girl. shes a blood thirsty vampire who frankly looks like the little girl from the exorcist and turns into a primal blood lusting animal if she doesnt get fed. when shes ok shes a kid tho frankly wants to be a kid.  she knows she cant be. to my that was a hard sadness in the movie.  though your seeing innocent people getting murdered throughout the movie at the same time your constantly reminded that she doesnt like it and that she is very much "cursed".  another hard part is that most of the people who are killed are teenagers and most of them arent bad people.  just a nother movie to remind me you gotta look in the backseat before you get in the car.  just like the old urban legend. there may be someone back there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>The whole vampire phenomenon is completely lost on me.  With that I went into "Let Me In" with complete trepidition.  The Stephen King seal of approval didn't help.  Now I can see why King calls this the best horror film in twenty years.  Not as a knock on the film, it plays like a middle school version of "Carrie".  Director Matt Reeves expertly establishes time and place by placing the film in 1983 snow-swept Los Alamos, New Mexico.  This creates a claustrophobic feeling that enhances the fright factor.  He's ably abetted by the terrific performances of his juvenile leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee as the tormented young boy and Chloe Grace Moretz as the ageless vampire trapped in a twelve year old girl's body.  Smit-McPhee and Moretz, belying their years, make the love between their characters palpable and believable.  You'll shed a tear from time to time even if one of the lovers would rather cut your throat than embrace you.  I find it interesting that Reeves juxtaposes their relationship with that of Romeo and Juliet.  It's kind of an apt one that would almost portend doom for the most unlikely pairing.  "Let Me In" caught me completely by surprise and is easily one of the best sleepers of 2010.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>...that I would see the day when I watch and enjoy a vampire romance. One of the most despised genres in my book!<br />Ok, it is more horror than romance, and the romance is of a very tender age of 12 years, and stays appropriate to the age. No Lolita vampirism here, no precocious liberties either. More holding hands and shy smiles.

The story features two very lonely children who form a special bond over the span of about two weeks; it actually seems like love at first sight, or as close to it has the children are capable. The whole plot revolves around the protagonist Abby - a vampire - and her willingness to allow another to see her as she is. It takes time, but eventually Owen, her meek neighbor, finds himself friends with a blood-sucker.<br /><br />The movie is slow. I think it serves to add a bit more tension and creepiness. Of course, this may set off some viewers. There is very little CGI and the special effects are used to show the story, not to shine a light on the gore The acting is beautiful and haunting, and you can quickly see how the film may end. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the best use of dull color light and empty space to push the loneliness that much further. Predictability aside, I come away from watching the film seeing how two very different people can find trust and love, despite their difference.<br /><br />Do take note of the R rating. The movie puts the spotlight on the 12 year old actors, but this is not a kid's film. For every bit of violence that occurs off-camera there is a bloody scene to follow it up. The film also deals with Owen being abused horribly by fellow students.<br /><br />By far, this is my favorite vampire movie since the Lugosi original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>"Let Me In" is the Hollywood remake of "Let the Right One In", a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but both the original film and remake managed to handle these multiple themes in a credible manner.<br /><br />The remake is not exactly faithful to the original, and viewers who have watched both will notice the differences such as the opening scene, the changes in characterization for some of the minor characters, etc. For the most part though, the remake focuses on the essential parts of the story just as in the original and makes for riveting viewing. This is not the movie to watch if you're looking for pretty vampires smooching around, or a splatterfest with non-stop action. There's hints of a romance, slowly simmering, a mixture of Gothic and sweet teenage love, and there's also lots of blood, but by no means does this movie careen along - it takes its time developing the characters, drawing viewers into this strange, dark world where nothing is at it appears, and focuses viewers' attention on the two main characters.<br /><br />The story is of teenager Owen [Kodi Smit-McPhee] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Owen doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Owen meets a strange girl named Abby [Chloe Moretz] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Abby has just moved into the apartment next door to Owen's with a man Owen thinks is her dad. Despite Abby's words, the pair are drawn to each other, and form a real friendship. For a while at least, Owen remains blissfully unaware of the dark secret hidden by Abby and her `dad'.<br /><br />"Let Me In" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Owen and Abby manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role. The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire. Abby is a young-looking  yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />"Let Me In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see. The film is rated R, with Spanish subtitles, and English subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired. The film is in color, and the running time is 115 minutes. Special features include an audio commentary with director Matt Reeves; a feature titled From the Inside: A Look At The Making of Let Me In; The Art of Special Effects; Car Crash Sequence Step-By-Step; Deleted Scenes; Trailer Gallery; and, a Poster Gallery.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>For the record, I was absolutely opposed to the idea of an American remake of the remarkable existential Swedish chiller "Let the Right One In."  A contemplative look at friendship, loyalty and forging connections, this vampire film eschewed conventional horror to work as a thoughtful character study.  With much quiet and intimacy, this was no ordinary blood bath--this was a serious attempt to conceptualize vampires in a modern context.  Sure, there were moments of genuine creepiness and scares, but there was much more underneath the surface.  Mainstream American horror films seldom do subtle and/or understated themes, so I prepared for the worst when Matt Reeves' "Let Me In" was announced.  But, to my astonishment and delight, Reeves understood what made the original unique and special.  With full integrity intact, this remake is supremely successful.<br /><br />The story centers around an awkward and lonely youth (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who spends many nights in isolation.  One night, he's approached by an enigmatic new neighbor (Chloe Grace Moretz) of similar age.  Although she seems equally alone, she proclaims that they can't be friends.  However, the two seem drawn to one another and, in fact, start to become close.  But this tentative juvenile romance has one striking difference--Moretz is a vampire.  Her dietary needs are met by Richard Jenkins who seems to be part guardian, part accomplice, part slave.  When bodies start to be discovered and Moretz's daily routine gets interrupted, things start to spiral out of control.  Are our young couple doomed?  And can Smit-McPhee accept the truth of his new friendship?<br /><br />Part of what makes this film so great is the attention to character.  The film is infused with a genuine melancholy and sadness--and the only respite from the gloom is in the friendship the two characters create.  She needs the human connection, he needs her strength--and together they grow stronger.  Their bond makes them both better for it as he struggles with bullying at school and she struggles for survival itself.  Underplayed to perfection, Moretz turns in her second tremendous performance of 2010 (this is world's away from the over-the-top, but terrific, Hit Girl).  And Smit-McPhee is a revelation as this role fits him to a tee.  The quiet interplay between the kids is fascinating, believable, and heart wrenching.<br /><br />There are still some good scares, however, for those that groan at the idea of a pre-teen love story.  Jenkins carries the bulk of the action as he finds likely victims.  One sequence, shot entirely from the interior of a moving car, is one of the most spectacular action set pieces of the year.  And a moment in the pool is wickedly effective for how little it shows.  In truth, I absolutely loved this film.  It balances the various elements with precision.  Moving and thoughtful, this isn't your run-of-the-mill vampire story!  About 4 1/2 stars, I'll round up for this actually being a successful remake of an already great film.  KGHarris, 3/11.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>After seeing the original foreign version of this story called LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, I was prepared for another over-produced, over-wrought American version...but I am pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />In fact, I think I like this version better.  Set in a dark, wintry New Mexico with 80's songs playing just within hearing, this story about a lonely, bullied young boy who befriends a mysterious barefoot girl knows what needs to be done to tell a good story while not wallowing in gory excess.  Which is not to say there's none, but it's always just the right amount that the effects never overwhelm the story.  One definite improvement: I loved the attacks, which are so jarring as they come from a sweet little girl.  They also lend a poignancy to the scenes where she's trying to just find someone to connect with.<br /><br />One thing I would've addressed: was the little girl's "father" in the first half of the film once a child with her who ages as a human?  Kind of a dovetailing moment that could've been underscored a little clearer.<br /><br />But I'm quibbling.  An excellent horror film for all the fans who are tired of the mindless gorefests we have to endure these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>This is simply an awesome twist on the Vampire theme, very cool movie if you're in the mood.

The original film was based in Blackeberg, Stockholm but the in the American version the action has shifted to a small town in New Mexico. Director Matt Reeves has chosen the year 1980 as the year in which things unfold, this has to do with the Reagan American thought process of the time of good and evil, communism. There is Owen (Kodi Smith- Mcphee) who is fighting his own fight with the school bullies, he is terrorized every day. He is lonely and friendless, it is during this time that a young girl Abby, a 250 year old vampire, according to the original book (Chloe Grace Moretz) moves next door to him and they begin an unlikely friendship which will change their lives forever.<br />I would not go in to details about the films pace and events as I think it would give away the story but this is in short, a very remarkable film about loneliness, finding friendship and companionship in the most unlikely places. The pace is slow and the director has not relied on sounds and CGI to bring the story to life. The horror is very subtle and the acting is amazing, two gifted young children have given such a good performance that it would give many grown up actors a run for their money. The cinematography is splendid and so are the other supporting actors. Nothing has changed from the original film; the soul is still intact only the setting has changed with a few minor changes. I highly recommend this film 4 stars. 6/20/2011</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>I had seen trailers and was expecting some garbage, boring movie. Even the cover for the movie didn't catch me. Anyway, somehow I added it to my wishlist. I got the movie and months later finally decided to try it. I had been expecting worse, so when I saw that it was almost two hours long, I sighed. I wanted to make it quick and watch some other movie. I had been skipping a first few parts in the movie, because I found them uninteresting, boring. Because of pathetic little boy and his miserable life. Anyway I skipped a little in the movie. Until the girl came into the picture. Then it just caught me. I was watching it with questions on my mind, I was hooked by how good the movie actually was. It was thrilling and entertaining and bit of drama as well. I was  upset when it actually ended. I wanted to see a little more. But I am amazed and surprised and pleased by the whole plot of the movie. I didn't expect to see that, but that was just wow, nice work!</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Let me make this clear: This film is good, but the original (Swedish version) is GREAT! I would highly recommend the original ("L?t den r&auml;tte komma in"; US translation <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAC">Let The Right One In</a>), directed by Tomas Alfredson, over this remake. The original delves more into the supporting characters whereas this focuses mainly on the boy (Smit-McPhee) and girl (Moretz), but still doesn't quite catch what the original does. Nevertheless, Moretz shines in this film and with her roles lately (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG983M">Kick-Ass</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97F6">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XUG">(500) Days of Summer</a>), she's proving to be quite the young actress! This film proves that she can do drama with the best of 'em! Reeves does great with the directing but the screenwriting adaptation is something to be desired. Like I said, if you haven't seen the original and you're not up to reading subtitles in the original, then this will do. Otherwise, I highly recommend the original. Nevertheless, a great horror film that is more suspense thriller but still gives a good uneasy feeling.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>It's rare that a remake equals the original but whether or not you're more of a fan of the original movie "Let The Right One In" or the remake, both films offer a unique creepy film about Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee from "The Road")who finds himself bullied, alienated from his peers and his own family as he is caught in the crossfire of divorce. He befriends a new girl named Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz in a marvelous performance)who is a vampire and while Owen suspects something is off with the girl he bonds with her immediately inspite of the hositility of her "father" (Richard Jenkins of "The Visitor" and "Six Feet Under" fame). There's not a huge deviation in the basic plot but the interpretation and portrayal of the characters brings a different element to the story.<br /><br />Perfectly cast, "Let Me In" captures the odd vibe of the original film while adding its own textures. Director Matt Reeves in adapting the novel and original screenplay turns the story some what on its head by telling it in flashback form. Set during the certainty of the Reagan presidency in the 1980's, "Let Me In" also nicely captures the atmosphere of innocence and cynicism that existed pre-9/11.<br /><br />"Let Me In" is a nice return to form of former horror stalwart Hammer Films. For those folks NOT familiar with Hammer, the original studio produced a series of horror classics but then drifted into cheap, unimaginative sequels that sullied their name.<br /><br />"Let Me In" receives a marvelously creepy looking home video transfer. Where the image is soft it was an intentional choice and, for the most part, the images are crystal clear and sharp as a vampire's tooth.<br /><br />There are also some really cool extras for fans who like those sort of things including a commentary by director Reeves who doesn't shy away from discussing the marvelous original film. Reeves discusses differences between the two films including scenes he included from the original novel that didn't appear in the original Swedish filmLet the Right One In [Blu-ray].<br /><br />We get a number of very good featurettes including a making-of, visual effects and car crash sequence featurette that give us plenty of behind-the-scenes info. We also get a picture-in-picture "dissection" of the movie including footage exclusive to this feature as well as some recycled footage from other featurettes. We also get deleted scenes including the scene that played on the internet and was in some trailers of Abby being turned into a vampire. This last deleted scene is presented in HD but most are in SD.<br /><br />The Swedish original is a marvelously creepy mixture of character study and horror film. Although the remake is less subtle in some ways than the original film, director Matt Reeves ("Cloverfield") expands on the characters in some unique and subtle ways missing from the original film as well.

Time to graduate from grade school and move right in with the upper class. Let Me In is the vampire movie that real vampire movie fans have been wanting for years. (Before I continue I just want to apologize to the fans of Twilight. I mean no offense. I'm only saying, in a humorous way, that Let Me In is in no way Twilight.)<br /><br />Some of you may already know this but Let Me In is a remake of a Swedish film "Let the Right One In." For those of you who may have seen this I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Let Me In. With the exception of a few scenes, Let Me In stays true to the original. The few scenes that were changed were mostly do to cultural difference or confusing segments. Let Me In is neither better nor worse, it's just an Americanized version of a very good movie.<br /><br />For those who didn't know of or see the original, you're in for a treat. I wouldn't call this a horror film, but more of a dramatic thriller. It follows a young boy named Owen, a skinny, shy, socially awkward twelve year old. His young life is in shambles: his parents are divorcing, he doesn't have any friends, and he's being bullied in school. The only thing in his life that makes him happy are Now & Laters. But then Abby moves in next door, a mysterious young girl who finds Owen just as curious as he finds her. They slowly strike up a friendship, and through her Owen starts to take a little bit of control in his life. Yet something doesn't seem right about Abby, and Owen must decide if he wants to let that get in the way of his friendship with the young girl Abby.<br /><br />Let Me In doesn't pull many punches in terms of content. It is brutal and bloody. It has quite a few mature situations. And it carries with every scene a brooding and dark atmosphere. I guess that's to be expected though when it comes to real vampire films.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this movie to any fan of quality horror or thriller films. It's a solid addition to a very small line of movies (that being good, mature vampire films). And, if you're sick of those sparkling-chested, sun-walking, baseball-playing, emo-vampires from "other" movies then you'll love Let Me In.... (Again, Twilight fans, I'm sorry....)</p></br></body></html>

He's extremely skilled with actors, and I remember him way back when making a little movie with Michael Imperioli, the fellow who plays Christopher on The Sopranos, and Mira Sorvino from ROMY AND MICHELLE's HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.  In addition I believe his previous films featured the very last screen appearances of both Gregory Hines and George Plimpton, so you know he's used to working with the best.  Most of all, we remember Gary Winick for making TADPOLE, which if you remember was all about a very young boy who wanted to date a 40 year old woman, and how our bodies are wired to pick up romantic signals from even the most unlikely people.  Winick finds a sweet brand of comedy from all this, and you can see it in the might-have-been troubling scene in 13 GOING ON 30 in which Jennifer Garner goes over to pick up a 13 year old boy in a restaurant and is only stopped when Judy Greer tells her, "Do you want to go to jail!"<br /><br />Both Garner and Greer make great impressions.  Garner is all over the place with her acting, but most of the time she successfully channels an adorable young girl.  The scene where she sings LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD at a slumber party is worth the price of admission, and you'll like the end credits in which the slumber party girls' singing is mixed into Pat Benatar's robust MTV version of the number.  Judy Greer has a difficult part to play too.  Everyone loved her on TV, playing Kitty on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, Jason Bateman's secretary who despises him, and she is lovely here and you can see how she has a great future playing the girl you love to hate.<br /><br />But most of all you will come out of this fantasy feeling a little bit better about yourself and about the choices you have made and have yet to make.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In 1987, after a disasterous thirteenth birthday party, Jenna Rink wishes she could just be 30 years old and skip the next seventeen years.  A sprinkle of pixie dust gives her that wish, and when she awakens, she quickly finds out that her with has come true.  The year is 2004, and Jenna (Garner) is an editor for Poise magazine and best friends with Lucy (Greer), the popular girl from her teenage years.  In a panic, she seeks out her childhood best friend Matt (Ruffalo).  Unfortunately for her, their friendship ended badly years ago.  Reluctantly, he agrees to help her, and Jenna soon discovers feelings for him that she never had before.<p>Yes, we have seen this movie before.  Big, anyone?  But what this movie has that really makes it enjoyable is Jennifer Garner.  She imbues thirty year old Jenna with the spirit of a thirteen year old.  Her channelling of her inner child is what really makes this movie work.  Also, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  After all, the "time travel" is accomplished with pixie dust.  This is a sweet and funny movie that shows Jennifer Garner can do comedy as well as action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I'm glad that I went to the theater to watch this.  I love the story.  I enjoyed the 80's theme that the movie had going on.  Jennifer is great in her role as Jenna.  It was also nice to see Mark Ruffalo (I've never seen him in any movie other than this..I like him now, he's great) This has a lesson to it: If you wish for something, you might get it..and then you may come to the realization that it's not what you really want.  I've seen the comparisons to other movies, but I do think this has some unique qualities this time around.  See this, it's a nice, light story to fill the heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Okay, let's forget BIG.  Sure 13 GOING ON 30 may be the distaff side of Tom Hanks' biggie, but on its own, it's an enjoyable, well done and involving comedy.  It's fun to watch; Jennifer Garner is marvelous as its heroine, and underrated Mark Ruffalo is just right as the cast off boyfriend who finds out the torch is still lit.  While using the magic dust as an incredible device, we still enjoy watching Garner as she has to adapt her 13 year old mind to the 30 year old she has become.  Garner demonstrates a keen understanding of this and does extremely well in being both the teenager and the grown up girl who got what she wished for, but at what expense?  the 80s soundtrack is great, and I had a good time watching the dancing to THRILLER.  I never liked the song that much but the way it is used in this movie, along with another classic LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD, is brilliant.  Judy Greer is fine as the still vicious Tom Tom; Andy Serkis is a joy out of the Gollum make-up; and West Virginia native Samuel Ball (from my neighboring community of Inwood), plays the brainless but hunky Alex very well, including his ridiculously foolish strip act.<br /><br />13 GOING ON 30 is predictable and at times a little mawkish, but I found it delightfully entertaining and think it stands on its own in spite of its comparison to BIG.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This is a light romantic comedy with no big surprises.  What's special about it is its really fine acting, its excellent sense of comedy and, most of all, its positive message.  It starts out with a 13-year old girl who wants to be popular.  She's had a cruel joke played on her and she takes it out on her male friend who adores her.  She wishes she were "30 and flirty" just like the women in the fashion magazines.  And with some incredible "wishing dust" - there she is.<p> <p>Flash forward 17 years.  Now, our heroine, played by Jennifer Garner, is 30.  By some magic formula that only Hollywood can understand, she has forgotten the past 17 years and is, in fact, a child in an adult's body.  Not only that, but she has an important job at the very fashion magazine that fired her imagination when she was 13.  And her co-worker and rival is the very same nasty girl who created havoc for her as a teenager.<br /> <p>With the help of her overweight and motherly secretary (who is a fine character actress but whose name is not even listed in the credits), she looks up her old guy-pal who she treated so badly so many years ago, played by Mark Ruffalo.  He's now a photographer and also engaged to be married. Naturally, the plot thickens.<p> <p>The film moves at a rather frantic pace and I found myself laughing out loud.  How it all turns out is predictable but charming.  And the message is that past mistakes can be corrected and everyone can live happily ever after.  Recommended for all, but particularly recommended for romantic comedy fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then I would give "13 Going on 30", a female variation of "Big" , an "A" for effort but a "C" for execution.  It is enjoyable enough but after your done watching this confection is "So what?".  Jennifer Garner is utterly charming, as always, as Jenna, the teenager who desires to be an adult.  That said, even an actress as adept as Garner cannot overcome the lightweight script.  Garner, unlike Tom Hanks, has to hone her chops as a comedienne to carry a starring vehicle.  I'm optimistic that in the future that as she is given more opportunities(and better material) that the sky will be the limit for Garner.  Mark Ruffalo seems to fare better in this film, but the demands on him are not as great.  Special note should be made for young Christa Allen who plays Jenna at 13 and does an outstanding job.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>This is definately better than the film that sparked it.  This film moves much faster and it is more bright and fun.  Jennifer Garner is a great actress and she truely shows it in this film.  She is laugh out loud funny, but she can bring you back down and be dramatic and pitiful.  Hopefully she will follow in Tom Hanks footsteps.  Mark Ruffalo did a good job, and for all you fans of reality TV, he bears odd resemblence to Survivor: All Star's Boston Rob.?  The film also had a great soundtrack.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves to have a great time at the movies.  This is definately the best comedy of 2004.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>13 Going On 30 was a movie that surprised me. Plot has been fairly well covered by the Amazon reviewer as well as all the other reviewers here...no need for a play by play. It caught me off guard because it was so sweet, yet funny. I think it was the Amazon critic who said it was like a girly version of the movie Big. Jennifer Garner is terrific in this. She's adorable and all her facial expressions remind me of the wonder and curiousity of a 13-year-old girl's world. I remember being that age too, and wanting to be all grown up. The movie reminds us all that we shouldn't be in a hurry to grow up and that all things will come in due time. It also reminds us to be careful what we wish for and to treat people the way you want to be treated. Don't think it's all about the morals though. It's so much fun, and I love when they do the Thriller dance. If you're not convinced, rent it first, but I loved it so much I had to have it on my DVD rack.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>An outstanding romantic comedy, 13 Going on 30, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a 13-year old girl who has her wish fulfilled and wakes up seven years later in the body of her 30-year old self!<br /><br />13 Going on 30 is based on the hit 80's movie "BIG" starring Tom Hanks, and it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner (who is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!), Mark Rufallo, Andy Serkis, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's (young and adult alike) every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.<br /><br />In short, 13 Going on 30 is a movie definitely worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>"13 Going on 30" is a slightly-above average tween-targeted romantic comedy/"Big" rip-off/star vehicle for the up-and-coming Jennifer Garner.  I suppose that there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching the adorable Garner pretend, and quite believably I might add, to be a teenager.  For "what it is", "13 Going on 30" is a cute, enjoyable comedy that just may bring some tears to your eyes during its surprisingly emotional climax (depending on your personal life, I suppose.)  Despite the hokey musical montages and some inevitable chick-flick "cheesy stuff", such as a bunch of adults joyfully dancing to Michael Jackson's "Thriller".<br /><br />Anyways, it's not like my opinion, or any professional opinion for that matter (not that I'm a professional by any means!) matters when it comes to this sort of movie.  "13 Going on 30" is the kind of movie you're going to see despite the reviews just because you love chick-flicks.  Or maybe your daughter will drag you along to see it.  Or maybe you're a big Garner fan.  Or a Mark Ruffalo fan.  Or maybe you're just feeling nostalgic for more innocent times.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I absolutely loved it !!! I think I could watch it over and over. Jennifer Garner is AWESOME in this movie !! So Believable !! I laughed until I had tears in my eyes. Those of you who grew up in the eighties will definitely relate to this movie. I LOVED the part where they danced to "Thriller" - LMAO !!!</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>I try to be unbiased when reviewing movies. When I watched "13 Going on 30", I tried to avoid obvious comparisons to 1988's "Big". Both movies are about an adolescent who wakes up suddenly being years older. So what? There are only so many stories out there. And, "Big" is about a guy, while "13 Going on Thirty" is about a girl. It's a given that women are more accepting of "Guy things" than men are about "Girl things".  Thus, the derisive term `chick flick'. [The idea of a `guy flick' is socially okay.] It occurs to me that Hollywood has a harder time of making a movie that appeals to women that it does to men. The era of women picking what movie to see is long gone.<br /><br />The truth is that "13 Going on 30" is not a very good movie. It has a few brilliant moments, but it bypasses some really interesting themes to settle on a very predictable love story between the two main characters.<br /><br />The story starts with a nerdy girl looking forward to her thirteenth birthday party. The equally nerdy boy next door is there to help her. The `cool' teens she invites conspire to ruin her big event. Crushed, our heroine [Jennifer Garner] wakes up to find herself 30 years old, just as she had `wished' she could be. She discovers that she is an editor at a trendy fashion/style magazine in Manhattan. The boy next door is now a photographer, while her childhood nemesis [the one who ruined the party] is a co-worker and rival.<br /><br />Ms. Garner, who also stars in the hit TV series, "Alias", is the main reason to see the movie. She is bright, funny, likeable and attractive. She is the driving force in all the memorable scenes. In the old days of Hollywood, she would have been groomed as a star, ala Carole Lombard, Doris Day or Rosalind Russell. In today's world, she is an actress who takes a movie role or two in her `summer vacation' from her TV work. Perhaps when her series ends, she will become a formidable movie presence.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>After total humiliation at her thirteenth birthday party, Jenna Rink wants to just hide until she's thirty. Thanks to some wishing dust, Jenna's prayer has been answered. With a knockout body, a dream apartment, a fabulous wardrobe, an athlete boyfriend, a dream job, and superstar friends, this can't be a better life. Unfortunetly, Jenna realizes that this is not what she wanted. The only one that she needs is her childhood best friend, Matt, a boy that she thought destroyed her party. But when she finds him, he's a grown up, and not the same person that she knew. Jennifer Garner sparkles with charisma and sizzles with charm. There's great chemistry amongst the cast, and all of them makes this light-hearted tale work. A delightful and sweet fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>Oh those RomComs...how I secretly adore them. Well... maybe not so secretly.<br /><br />In '13 going on 30', Jennifer Garner plays Jenna, a 13 year old girl stuck in a 30 year old body. When Jenna was 13, she made a wish to be `thirty and flirty' since she just saw that statement on her favorite magazine `Poise'. With a little help of some magic dust her friend Matt got her for her 13th birthday, her wish comes true and she's now a 30 year old woman. And it's not like it was in `BIG' with Tom Hanks. He was older the next day. She is actually older, 17 years later.<br /><br />Within those 17 years, she's made a lot of money doing the job she loves, and she's lost a lot of friends, and has become, well, just a very bad person.  And this is what I really enjoyed about the movie. Unlike `BIG', we get to see how her life has become and we get to enjoy seeing the surprise with her. Watching the mostly sweet 13 year old Jenna see how mean she has become was fun to watch. Also it was a lot of fun to see how people reacted to her now that she was this new nice girl. Also seeing a grown woman acting like she was 13 was pretty funny also. I actually enjoyed the scenes where she was drinking the non-virgin pina coladas. When she took out the piece of fruit and dropped it (and it landing into someone else's drink a floor below) actually made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Another thing that made me really like the movie was the 80's references. I love me some 80's. So when the movie starts off and has all  the 80's music going with the old videos playing (like Rick Springfield's `Jessie's Girl'), I was having a good time. Also later at a party, Jenna starts a `Thriller' dance, and though it was awkward at first, it was still kind of fun to watch. And it sounded pretty good on the hard floor they were on.<br /><br />The only real bad thing I would say with '13 going on 30' is that you have to throw the word `believable' out the door once you start watching it. There are many things in the movie that really shouldn't make since or should really be weird. Once she's in the future, in my opinion, she should remember everything since she's the same person. It's not like `Back to the Future' where there are two Marty McFly's. She's the one and only Jenna, but she doesn't. Also when she gets kissed by older guys, it's kinda gross if you think about it. Cause she's 13 ya know. Kinda icky, but I just don't think about it like that.<br /><br />In the end, I would say definitely watch this movie if you like the RomComs and you haven't seen it. Guys, it's funny. Girls, it's sweet.<br /><br />P.S. - In the 80's I was in single digits, but I loved Michael Jackson. He was the man back then. When `Thriller' came out it was the first tape (I had the record to) I owned. I remember moon walking (at least my version of it) in my red Michael Jackson jacket with zippers all over it, blue jeans, and cowboy boots. That tape was amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I think this is a really good funny movie! Jennifer Garner is extremely sexy in her role! She plays a woman named Jenna who wakes up the day after her 13th birthday party, and she's 30! She's confused at first, but soon adapts to the idea. Her childhood friend named Matt has become engaged to someone else. She works for her favorite magazine, Poise. Jenna tries to track down Matt, and realizes that they've stopped being best friends. She tries to help make everything right. If you love comedy and chick flicks, you'll love 13 GOING ON 30!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>I saw this movie and it was funny and romantic. A whole story was good.<br />I laughed and I enjoyed the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is an absolutely charming and delightful comedy with an excellent cast. Do not, however, see this film unless you are ready to suspend disbelief. After all, the premise of this film is that a distressed thirteen year old girl suddenly finds herself propelled into the future and into the body of her thirty year old self.<br /><br />Jenna Rink is a typical teenager, a little gawky, a little insecure. She pals around with her uncool best friend, Matt Flamhaff, but, at the same time, is trying to make it into the cool six chicks clique at her school, a nasty little group of teenage hotties who use Jenna for what they can get from her. They agree to come to her thirteenth birthday party, if she will do a class report for their leader. She agrees.<br /><br />Matt is the first guest to arrive, and he gives her a little, doll sized dream house that he has made for her, replete with magic dust. When the other guests arrive, they soon depart with the needed report in hand, after playing a very mean trick on Jenna and leaving her desolate. A set of circumstances causes the magic dust to fall upon Jenna, just as she makes a wish that finds hers transported into the future and into the body of her thirty year old self.<br /><br />Jenna discovers that she now has every thing for which she had dreamed when she was thirteen. She also discovers how she has changed, and it is not a change for the better. She turns to Matt, whose friendship, she is shocked to find, has been lost somewhere along the way. Jenna then sets about putting to right what went wrong. Of course, there are any number of humorous incidents that arise out Jenna's current situation.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner is sensational as a thirteen year old girl trapped in the body of a thirty year old woman. She infuses the role with just the right amount of innocence and joyous abandonment that teenagers often exude. Kittenish and coltish all at once, her charm is infectious. Mark Ruffalo is perfectly cast as the grown-up Matt. He exudes sensitivity and niceness, all rolled into one very compelling package. One cannot help but like both characters tremendously.<br /><br />This is an entertaining film for those who enjoy light-hearted fantasy films. This film has been compared to the film, "Big", and while there are some similarities between the two, this film stands on its own two feet and deserves its own accolades. Deft direction by Gary Winnick and excellent performances by the entire cast make this film a comedic gem to be enjoyed by those who like a charmingly realized film.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>FIRST THOUGHTS: Jenna learns that there is truly NO PLACE LIKE HOME, but is it too late? Can Jenna have her cake and eat it too and if she does, what will happen to her?<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: COOL AGE APPROPRIATE FILM THAT DEALS WITH REAL ISSUES<br /><br />Well done age appropriate comedy that underscores the universal frustration and impatience that teenage girls are known for. However, this movie's theme is about doing something about it, and to that end the film takes Jenna on a magical mystery time voyage which lands her right where she thinks she wants to be ---- 30 - COOOOOOL & HOT!<br /><br />But is that exactly what she wanted?<br /><br />THANKFULLY THERE'S MORE ---- IT'S ABOUT SELF-AWARENESS<br /><br />There is a price to pay for this jump to age thirty, and as the movie progresses, Jenna becomes more aware of that and more importantly; MORE 'SELF-AWARE' IN THIS LEARNING PROCESS! Exactly what Jenna discovers in this process is what the film is all about.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is a well done fantasy that literally every girl has probably contemplated at one time or another in one way or another. This film brings that universal theme all together so that it does seem to resonate in similar but personal ways for different viewers.<br /><br />-----*- THE CAST<br /><br />Jennifer Garner - Jenna Rink<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo - Matt Flamhaff<br /><br />Judy Greer - Lucy Wyman<br /><br />Andy Serkis - Richard Kneeland<br /><br />Kathy Baker - Beverly Rink<br /><br />Phil Reeves - Wayne Rink<br /><br />Samuel Ball - Alex Carlson<br /><br />Marcia de Bonis - Arlene<br /><br />Christa B.

"13 GOING ON 30" is definitely one of the better teen flicks out there, and it nicely melds fantasy with a girls viewpoint into a somewhat familiar though original story.<br /><br />IN GOOD TASTE WITHOUT PATRONIZING OR CONDESCENDING TO TEENS OR PARENTS<br /><br />For parents, this is both an enlightening film, and a kind of time-capsule that is executed with surprisingly good tastes. An ideal film for parents to see with teens without the cringing discomfort that some films yield when viewed with the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Despite the unoriginal premise (the movie Big recast with a woman), 13 Going on 30 is a very entertaining movie and this is due in large part to its star, Jennifer Garner, who brings to her role loads of charm. This movie is the perfect vehicle for the actress because it allows her to break away from the action hero persona that she cultivated with the T.V. show Alias and Daredevil and prove that she can do a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Garner, with her warm, disarming smile has a wholesome, girl-next-door quality that is quite endearing. She's beautiful but not in an unattainable way. She also has natural comedic ability, for example, in one scene, Jenna livens up her magazine's boring party with an impromptu dance to Michael Jackson's "Thriller," inspiring others to get up and dance as well. Garner also has a very expressive face that is perfect for the broad comedy of this movie. She is willing to take risks and make fun of herself. She is also willing to put herself out there and is not afraid to appear goofy and this only makes her that much more appealing.<br /><br />13 Going On 30 is the victim of the dreaded double dip. If you already own the Special Edition version of the movie, the two new extras hardly warrant a re-purchase. Also, if you already own the previous edition you might want to hold onto it as the audio commentary by director Gary Winick and the commentary by producers Gina Matthews, Donna Arkoff-Roth, and Susan Arnold is not on this edition.<br /><br />New to this edition is "Fashion Flashback: Into the 1980s" that features teen models gushing about how much they love the "retro" look of the `80s. It tells you what to look for and where to track down "authentic" clothes of that era.<br /><br />"Making of a Teen Dream" takes us through the making of the movie in a fun, breezy way that is customary of most press kit type featurettes. The cast speak admiringly about each other in this self-congratulatory extra.<br /><br />There is a "Bloopers" reel, a collection of blown lines and other assorted goofs that are quite cute.<br /><br />Also included are two music videos, one for Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield" and another for "Jessie's Girl" by Rick Springfield that allows you to immerse yourself in pure `80s cheese.<br /><br />The most enjoyable extra is "I Was A Teenage Geek." The cast talk about what they were like in the `80s. Everyone tells amusing stories of what they were doing in high school with photos of what they looked like at the time.<br /><br />There is also an "Alternate Beginning and Ending" that features different actors playing Jenna and Matt when they were kids. The scene is about the same length as what is in the movie but is edited differently. We get more detail on Jenna's desire to be one of the popular girls. Thankfully, these were not used.<br /><br />Finally, there are 15 deleted scenes with more footage of Jenna and Matt at the magazine party and so on. These scenes flesh out the relationships between the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Although this movie is often inaccurately referred to as a girly version of Tom Hanks BIG the movie is actually so much more and so much better. Whewreas in the previous movie Hanks character stays in the 1980s when he receives instant adulthood, in this movie an element of time travel is involved when 13 year-old Jenna goes to sleep in 1987 and wakes up all grown up in 2004.<br /><br />The movie is all the better for this plot device, we get to see where most of the characters from 1987 are now, and the implications of the decision Jenna makes at the beginning of the movie. Its both piognant, romantic and funny in its execution and you would be pressed to find a truly more involving comedy drama in recent years.<br /><br />Carrying the movie is star of television show ALIAS, the impossibly beautiful and talented Jennifer Garner. She proves that her entertaining turn as Sydney Bristow was no fluke by ably showing of her comic timing and delivery. Not a slam-bang comedy of the Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler vein this movie is more subtle and less in your-face.<br /><br />As a 32-year old who remembers 1987 well the pop culture references to that era in the initial scenes were drenched in nostalgia and as someone who has chosen a similar career path as Garner's character it is even more involving and interesting. Without giving too much of the well crafted story away, this movie makes you reflect on the decisions you make and the impilcations each decision makes. In this sense it is like the recent Kutcher movie THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT although far more entertaining and light hearted.<br /><br />This movie is well recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I was rather pleasantly surprised by this film.  Obviously, the storyline is by no means unique, and I've seen too many films featuring kids and adults miraculously switching places to feel all that confident about going once more into a similar breach, but 13 Going on 30 is actually, well, delightful.  I'm a big Jennifer Garner fan going all the way back to her role in the short-lived Time of Your Life; by and large, I think she did a wonderful job in this role.  It is certainly a different Jennifer Garner than we see on Alias, and it certainly appears as if she relished a role in which she got to be silly and whimsical.  I would have to credit Mark Ruffalo with an even more impressive performance, though, as his was the subtle glue that held the fantastical elements of the plot together.<br /><br />Young Jenna has just turned 13; already unhappy with the way she looks and anxious to be popular, she suffers an embarrassing indignation which has her fervently wishing to be 30.  Thanks to some wishing dust on the model dream home her obviously infatuated by "not cool" friend Matt built for her, she gets her wish.  I thought the early scenes featuring 13-year-old Jenna reacting to the instant passing of 17 years and adjusting to her new, uh, accessories was a little awkward, and a certain lack of continuity in regard to her reactions to new stimuli popped up sporadically as the film progressed.  One minute she's acting like a young teenager, and then she will suddenly seem to have grown up into her new age to a significant degree.  Anyway, she discovers that all of her dreams have come true: she was popular, and she has become mighty successful in life - actually sitting atop the fashion magazine she was addicted to as a kid.  Before long, though, she begins to see that having it all isn't all it is cracked up to be.  This grown-up body she inhabits is actually a rather empty shell of a not so nice person.  She learns that she has done some rather nasty things over the course of the missing 17 years.  The only person she can turn to is her friend Matt (Mark Ruffalo), but the two have gone in very different directions over the years.  In the process of trying to save her magazine, Jenna learns that the dreams of childhood don't turn out the way you thought they would and other obvious life lessons, etc., etc.  You can probably guess what happens at the end.<br /><br />The film does succeed rather well as a comedy; the Thriller dance scene, while uncomfortable to watch, is indeed quite silly, and some of adult Jenna's interactions with young teens also play well.  I also loved the fact that the movie helped take me back to the 1980s, to some degree.  There are some classic 80s tunes on the soundtrack, and beginning the film with the sound of the Go-Go's definitely qualifies for a star in my book.  That being said, I have to say that I don't remember some of the awful hair-dos of the film actually existing in the late 80s - certainly not among the girls my eyes gravitated toward in those halcyon days of youth.<br /><br />In the end, this is basically your silly, entertaining, feel-good comedy, and it stars one of Hollywood's most attractive, talented actresses.  It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, and that is a big reason why it works as well as it does.  It is by no means a must-see, but I do believe it is a film you cannot help but enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Jennifer Garner is wonderful in 13 Going on 30 ! She is so believable as a young girl who wakes up to find she's turned 30 over night.<br />  The storyline and script are really funny and enjoyable, with a very heart-warming ending. This is a great movie for a Mom and young daughter to go see together - both will be able to relate to it.<br />  Even the guy I dragged along, said he was amazed at how good the movie was.<br />  Also, if you are into 80's music - this is the movie for you ! The soundtack is Excellent !</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is an absolutely charming and delightful comedy with an excellent cast. Do not, however, see this film unless you are ready to suspend disbelief. After all, the premise of this film is that a distressed thirteen year old girl suddenly finds herself propelled into the future and into the body of her thirty year old self.<br /><br />Jenna Rink is a typical teenager, a little gawky, a little insecure. She pals around with her uncool best friend, Matt Flamhaff,  but, at the same time, is trying to make it into the cool six chicks clique at her school, a nasty little group of teenage hotties who use Jenna for what they can get from her. They agree to come to her thirteenth birthday party, if she will do a class report for their leader. She agrees.<br /><br />Matt is the first guest to arrive, and he gives her a little, doll sized dream house that he has made for her, replete with magic dust. When the other guests arrive, they soon depart with the needed report in hand, after playing a very mean trick on Jenna and leaving her desolate. A set of circumstances causes the magic dust to fall upon Jenna, just as she makes a wish that finds hers transported into the future and into the body of her thirty year old self.<br /><br />Jenna discovers that she now has every thing for which she had dreamed when she was thirteen. She also discovers how she has changed, and it is not a change for the better. She turns to Matt, whose friendship, she is shocked to find,  has been lost somewhere along the way.  Jenna then sets about putting to right what went wrong. Of course, there are any number of humorous incidents that arise out Jenna's current situation.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner is sensational as a thirteen year old girl trapped  in the body of a thirty year old woman. She infuses the role with just the right amount of innocence and joyous abandonment that teenagers often exude. Kittenish and coltish all at once, her charm is infectious. Mark Ruffalo is perfectly cast as the grown-up Matt. He exudes  sensitivity and niceness, all rolled into one very compelling package. One cannot help but like both characters tremendously.<br /><br />This is an entertaining film for those who enjoy light-hearted fantasy films. This film has been compared to the film, "Big", and while there are some similarities between the two,  this film stands on its own two feet and deserves its own accolades. Deft direction by Gary Winnick and excellent performances by the entire cast make this film a comedic gem to be enjoyed by those who like a charmingly realized film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>When this film came out back in 2004, I felt it was a fantastic romantic comedy. Romantic, charming and enjoyable.<br /><br />With two great performances by Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, there were many things that made this film so enjoyable.  From the beautiful locations the film was shot in New York, a funny but touching storyline but also that 80's style, may it be the clothing or the music of that time and with one of the most memorable dance scenes in a film with everyone jamming to Michael Jackson's "Thriller", "13 going on 30' is all out fun!<br /><br />Here we are five years later and with two DVD releases, the popular romantic comedy will now be released on Blu-ray.  So, I'm sure many of you who owned a previous version of the film on DVD maybe wondering, if this Blu-ray release is worth it?  Read on!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"13 going on 30' is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Video quality is clean and the film looks very good.  But picture quality is not super colorful  in terms of eye popping visuals but overall, this film looks even greater on Blu-ray.  Personally, I think this is the test transfer we will probably see of this film for years to come.  Also, with so much outdoor shots featuring both Garner and Ruffalo with their characters in different parts of New York City, Blu-ray definitely enhances the city compared to the DVD version.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD for English, French and Portuguese and 5.1 Dolby Digital for the other language tracks.  The film is primarily dialogue and I don't recall hearing any uses of the rear channels for any outdoor ambiance for audio.  The music definitely comes out clear and pronounced and livens up the room.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"13 going on 30' is literally packed with special features.  Many of these were featured on the "Fun & Flirty Version" DVD but one featurette is exclusive to Blu-ray:<br /># Director's Commentary - This commentary features Director Gary Winick.  Winick is one of those director's that you would love to hear his commentary because he expresses his true emotion of his feelings of the film, which parts of the film he would love to have reshot and really, getting good insight on the film.  Especially the "Thriller" dance scene to the final ending.<br /># Producers Commentary - This commentary features Susan Arnold, Donna Arkoff Roth and Gina Matthews.  Each of these three women giving their tidbits of the film, working with Director Gary Winick and working with the talent.<br /># Alternate Beginning and Alternate Ending - This was surprising because the characters that played Jenna and Matt were different actors and I am so glad this beginning and ending was not used in the final cut of the film.<br /># Deleted Scenes - A total of 18 deleted scenes featured.<br /># Blooper Reel - This is a fun blooper reel of the whole cast.<br /># The Making of a Teen Dream - This was the original featurette featured on the DVD versions.  This was all about the making of the film and interviews with the director, producers and cast.<br /># Making of a Teen Dream: Another Take - This is exclusive to the Blu-ray and features more content such as Jennifer Garner actually having to do a slumber party with the 13-year-olds  as part of her research for her character.<br /># I Was a Teenage Geek Featurette - This interview features the main actors and actresses of the film talking about their high school life with high school photos and all.<br /># 1980s "Fashion Flashback" Featurette - This is more or less a fashion flashback photoshoot and dressing up people with 80's fashion.<br /># Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield" Music Video<br /># Rick Springfield's "Jessie's Girl" Music Video<br /># Video Gallery - A photo montage from scenes in the film<br /><br />The disc is also BD Live Enabled.<br /><br />"13 going on 30' is just  a fun romantic comedy that I have enjoyed countless times.  Not because I'm a child of the 80's but I really enjoyed the charming performances by Garner and Ruffalo, the overall story, the music and the awesome shots of New York City.  Everything came together for this film.<br /><br />Although considered as a "date film' or a "Girl's Night Out" type of film, as a guy who enjoyed the film, you can't help be touched because of Ruffalo's portrayal of Matt.  Guys get dumped or rejected by girls.  That close bond you have with a female friend in high school or friends period, not always last through adulthood.  And for Matty, you can literally sense the pain this guy goes through of having the girl he cared for (and eventually hurt him and abandoned him) in high school coming back to his life (especially when he's about to get married).  So, there are many aspects that a guy can relate to in this film.<br /><br />But was this film perfect?  Not really.  For music, by 1987, Michael Jackson's "Thriller", Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield", the Go-Go's "Head over Heels" and even Rick Springfield's "Jessie's Girl" were old news and were released way before 1987.  Music by that time was all about Bon Jovi, the Beastie Boys, Prince, The Jets and LL Cool J.  But of course, people who didn't grow up during that time period probably wouldn't know that, so I guess it's not really important.<br /><br />If you own the DVD, is it worth owning on Blu-ray?  Of course, the Blu-ray version is featured in 1080p and the audio is featured in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This is probably the best video and audio quality we will ever see of this film.  But are there considerable difference from the DVD version.  Not really.  You're only getting one extra special feature on the Blu-ray versus the "Fun & Flirty version" on DVD.  But if you don't own this film on DVD or if you have only the first version of the DVD, then this Blu-ray release is definitely worth it, especially if you enjoyed the film.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this film a lot.  I enjoyed it back in 2004 and continue to enjoy it now even after watching it several times.  "13 going on 30' is a romantic comedy that can be watched and enjoyed for many years to come.  Definitely check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Jennifer Garner gives a delightful, star turn performance in the comedic-fantasy "13 Going on 30". Jenna (Christa B. Allen) hates being a tween. When her 13th birthday rolls around, she's excited and invites her best friend Matt (Sean Marquette) as well as the girls from the most popular click at her school to her party. There's no adults allowed so, of course, it'll be the best 13th birthday bash ever. Not really. Before the party Matt gives her Jenna's dream house in miniature with figures representing Jenna, Rick Springfield and, of course, Matt. Oh, he also includes some magic dust so she can make all her dreams come true.  Lucy the "leader" of the click ditches her and embarrasses her. Jenna's angry and kicks Matt out of the house. As she settles into the closet where she's put her wrecked dream house, she wishes for nothing more than to be 30 not 13.<br /><br />The next morning Jenna (Garner) wakes up in a strange bed with a strange man. She doesn't quite understand what's happened. Yesterday, she was 13 and now she's the co-editor of  her favorite fashion magazine. It seems strange particularly when she discovers that Matt's no longer in her life and everyone generally regards her as a supreme bitch.  She's confused not sure she's happy and misses Matt (Ruffalo). She looks him up in Greenwich Village and discovers he's a talented photographer who hasn't seen her since her temper tantrum 17 years before. Gradually, she discovers what she really wants is what she has denied herself; Matt and a life where she didn't turn out to be a nasty person.<br /><br />Despite all the extras that crowd on to this single dual layer disc, "13 Going on 30" looks terrific. Overall, the picture quality is stellar and the 5.1 sound makes you want to dance along to the music from the 80's no matter how bad it really was.<br /><br /> Boy did this girl go shopping. Included in this bag of treats from the most fashionable haunts of Hollywood are 18 deleted/extended scenes, a blooper reel, two vintage music videos that play prominent roles in the film (although Michael Jackson's "Thriller" is missing). The two featurettes are the most fun. We get to see the stars of the film when they were 13 and get their take on how geeky they were when they were that age. It's charming and fun to see Jennifer Garner in her band uniform and Ruffalo going on about his bad fashion sense. We also get a "Making of" featurette which is pretty good and gives some insight into some of the complex themes buried beneath this busy comedy. The most fun, though, are the last two features. "The 80's Outfit Challenge" allows you to piece together the "ultimate" outfit based on the standards of the time. We also get "Then and Now" which compares current modern conveniences to their 80's counterparts. The blooper reel isn't bad but it doesn't have the bust-out-loud quality that many of these do.<br /><br />With two excellent commentary tracks featuring director Gary Winick and producers Susan Arnold & Donna Arkoff Roth (both the daughters of film people-Arnold is the daughter of director/producer Jack Arnold while Arkoff Roth is the daughter of z-movie king Samuel Z. Arkoff), the commentary tracks are more than a cut above the norm with fun, witty asides and interesting insights into the making of the movie, Garner's performance and other tidbits.<br /><br /> A very funny comedy of errors, "13" excels primarily due to Garner and Ruffalo's strong performances and the able support of Judy Greer and Andy Serkis. Ironically, "13" has the same weaknesses as "Big" did with a story that's a little too familiar and pat in its conclusion. Still, it's a fun entertainment that will keep you chuckling.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit famously quipped, "Dying is easy; comedy is hard."  Jennifer Garner has enjoyed phenomenal success starring as Sydney Bristow is the superb action series ALIAS, but comedy acting is much more difficult than performing an action role.  The question with this film was whether Ms. Garner was going to be able to make the transition to comedy.  The verdict?  Quite well.  I don't want her to quit ALIAS, but I hope she takes another stab at comedy at some future point in her career.<br /><br />The movie is basically BIG meets A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  A thirteen-old-girl, who like all teens yearns desperately for a host of things that seem important at the time.  After a particularly humiliating birthday party, she yearns to be thirty, and she gets her wish.  Jennifer Garner does a fine job of playing a thirteen-year-old girl trapped in a thirty-year-old's body.  She suffers by comparison with the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks in BIG, but who wouldn't (I'm not aware of any comic actor ever who would have been more delightful in that role than Hanks).  But as the film goes along, it transforms from a female version of BIG to A CHRISTMAS CAROL, with Garner's character Jenna learning what a terrible person she has become, cut off from her parents, without having talked to her male best friend in seventeen years, ruthlessly stealing ideas from other people in her job, cheating on her boyfriend, sharing company secrets with another company, and just generally living a pretty rotten life.  Of course, we all know from the first seconds of the film that Jenna will get to go back and do her life over, getting it right this time.<br /><br />There are a few scenes that are a bit too precious that I think could have been dispensed with, such as thirty-year-old Jenna giggling with a bunch of young teenaged girls, telling them about her kissing a guy.  But there were also a lot of fun scenes, and if as a whole it stretches credulity, this can be forgiven because the movie never pretends to be anything other than a fun time.  I especially enjoyed some of the scenes were grown up Jenna gets incredibly embarrassed by grown up behavior, such as when her self-absorbed hockey-playing boyfriend does a strip tease for her.<br /><br />I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo as Jenna's thirteen-year-old male friend all grown up, and it was fun to see Andy Serkis in a role without CGI masking him (he memorably played Gollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS) playing Jenna's boss.  The cast was not an especially strong one, but it was up to the task at hand.  The two main performers-Garner and Ruffalo-acquitted themselves well, and the teenaged actors playing them were convincing as younger versions.<br /><br />This is not one of the great films ever made, but it is a very pleasant one.  I recommend it for an evening when you want to kick back, turn off your brain, and pass a pleasant couple of hours.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>We rented this one quiet evening as a diversion and exected nothing more than a retread of Big.  Well, it kinda is and it kinda isn't.  Garner acccepts more quickly the adult role than Hanks' character did and the plot here revolves more around making a better adult of herself than she became when she wished for it.  Garner is charming and is really responsible for keeping the film alive.  Ruffalo is fine - but it's not a role that showcases the guy's talent.  No real belly laughs, but a sweet story that deserves a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>I was never a fan of Jennifer Garner so imagine my utter surprise when 13 Going on 30 turned out to be a great film. Yes, this is another one of those body switch movies (think "Big," "Vice Versa," "Freaky Friday," etc.) in which a child magically occupies an adult body and wonders what to do with the situation. The director, Gary Winick, came out of Sundance with "Tadpole," a well-meaning but overrated film in which a 16-year-old boy is seduced by a 40-year-old woman, and some of us wondered how well that plot would have worked with a 16-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man. Could it even have gotten made, let alone Tadpole's PG-13 rating? Well, now Winick finds out, by supplying a 13-year-old girl with a 30-year-old body and a boyfriend who's a professional hockey star. Their make-out scene is funny yet disturbing. And the film did manage a PG-13. But is it technically statutory rape when the 13 year old occupies a 30 year old body? Hmmm.<br /><br />The plot of the film isn't anything special. Hell, it's been done countless times before, and I rolled my eyes at the beginning of the trailer, but then, my curiosity got the better of me and I am glad it did. The plot has never been executed in such a charming way as this (perhaps only in the Freaky Friday remake). Thanks in part to director Wick, and to Mark Ruffalo, the film has an independent feel that is very beneficial and greatly enhances the story. A few minor plot holes and rushed ending don't hurt it as much as it would hurt other films. I hate to say this but that has a lot to do with Garner, who is terrific in her role. I was surprised to see the King of Independent films, Mark Ruffalo, in this, but he was absolutely perfect. This movie made me realize why I love him so much as an actor. The underrated and unappreciated Judy Greer is also in the mix. Her role is a tough one to explain, but she is as fantastic as in her first starring role in Jawbreaker. (She was also the ONLY redeeming quality in the awful The Village).<br /><br />Effortless and adorable, 30 is a lovable New York romance with the right amount of whimsy and magic. It made me smile through and through, even as obvious plot questions picked at my brain and unrealistic problems stacked up like cars on the interstate during rush hour. That is all forgiven because the cast is so charming and the characters well-written. Plus, who can forget the "Thriller" scene. 30 might not stay with me longer than a week or two, but it certainly was fun while it lasted.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>Although the premise of this movie is far fetched it works because of its sweetness and fantasy.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner plays a woman who gets transported from her 13 year old birthday party straight into her 30's, by passing all the joys of childhood and puberty she finds that she has turned into a horrible grown-up in more ways than one. Garner is pure innocence and absolutely infectious in this silly role that few actresses could have pulled off so well. As a modern woman sophisticated enough to be an editor for a fashion magazine in New York she fumbles about as the transported child/woman and causes quite a havoc in her childish wake. The pranks and gags are funny especially the constant references to that great old era "the 80's", completed by the "Thriller" dance remake that will have you dancing or laughing or both!<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo is cast as the love interest for Garner. As her childhood best friend he has become lost in the shuffle of Garner climbing to the top and he gets lost far behind. But as the child/woman Garner finds all that she missed along the way and the puppy love begins. Ruffalo is a great guy, not too macho and not too pretty so he manages to come across perfectly as the best friend that waits patiently in the wings and he is adorable.<br /><br />This movie works for adults as well as teenagers and is a pleasant film to watch. If you know the 80's it is filled with funny nostalgia and great music. If you skipped your childhood bent on success this film will encourage you to find that playfulness and inventiveness that so many adults lack. Colorful and fun this movie ROCKS with plenty of magic dust to take us all back a few years to the land of enjoyment.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>By now, many or most people would have seen the movie Big and the like.  This promised to be just like those types of movies where someone wishes to be older or younger.  This was a really well done version of that genre and extremely well acted by Garner.  She was amazing as a 13 year old in a 30 year old's body.  She made you really think that she was in fact still 13.  Don't let the premise put you off watching this refreshing and funny film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>This is the chick flick that I will have no reservations recommending to other "chicks" of my generation (ahem, those of us who can remember dancing to Rick Springfield and "Thriller").  No doubt some will complain that it's too derivative of an earlier kid-grows-up-suddenly film, others will grouse about the simple plot and lack of smut (as if that's a necessary ingredient to enjoy a film, hmmmm).  I say just enjoy the trip down memory lane to what it was like when we were thirteen, idealistic and joyful for all the right reasons.<p>Garner plays the fabulously chic Jenna Rink, editor of a major fashion magazine in NYC who apparently woke up one morning with amnesia for the past 17 years of her life (actually, it's a bit more complicated than that, involving some kind of mystical wish fulfillment of her geeky 13-year-old self to be "Thirty and Flirty", but anyway...).  From her point of view, she was thirteen one minute, and the next minute she's woken up one morning to find herself thirty years old and possessing everything she had always thought she wanted; a cool job, a fashionable wardrobe, a gorgeous body and a designer wardrobe that Carrie Bradshaw would kill for.  After she gets reoriented, she starts to enjoy herself, but only for a while because she is starting to find out things about her grownup self that aren't at all nice.  For one thing, she has cut her family out of her life to climb the corporate ladder, and for another, she has managed to alienate her only real friend in life, Matt - former boy-next-door/pal who had a secret crush on her.  This new life is shallow, mean-spritied and empty.  How can she "fix" it now that she has thrown away everything that she used to hold dear?<p>I have an immense new respect for Jennifer Garner.  In this film 13 Going on 30 she proved to me that she is not just another beautiful starlet cashing in on her look of the moment, but a real actress who can rise to the challenge of comedy.  It mustn't be easy to play a 13 year old in a 30 year old's body, but Garner pulled it off fabulously.  She was totally convincing as a kid who just wanted to have fun and make friends with the jaded, stuffy adults in her new world.  Yes, the plot is something like another film starring Tom Hanks, but the sheer girliness and `80s nostalgia of Jenna's situation was a unique take on the story that had me involved completely.  Garner somehow has that magical ability to be funny and vulnerable even while she's drop dead gorgeous (note, IMHO most drop dead gorgeous actresses rely on their looks more than good acting, so this is a high compliment coming from me).  Okay, I'm sure the writing had something to do with it, too.<p>Leave the guys to their guy stuff (unless your guy happens to think Jennifer Garner is hot!) and round up your girlfriends to see 13 Going on 30.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>In an age where girls are being bombarded by the culture we live in, that deems a girls worth solely on her looks. This film goes beyond that and is a positive message for girls to be who they are, not what the world wants them to be . but shows that being nice and respecting yourself , family and others is the  right place to be. that's what i got from it anyway. Great film, But i think the artwork for 13 going on30 is fun but lacking i prefer the special edition artwork better.  Jennifer Garner is just wonderful in the role of Jenna Rink and Mark Ruffalo does a good job as Matt. If you like this film you ought  to check out.( Just Like Heaven) it is also Excellent.  This Film is PG-13 For some profanity,  some sexual content. This film is not for young children as the case implies , but you can choose for yourself, that's a parent's job.  Oh this film is in HD so the colors just pop out at you it's great. it works on regular tv but in HD it comes alive.<br /><br />Highly Recommended Film.<br /><br />P.S. What's funny about the clothes in this film are that Kids of the 80's like myself included wore alot of that stuff acid jean, the works, my sister had those belts it makes me laugh. Micheal Jackson was a big thing so was Madonna and Prince, Journey , The Cars, OMD, Depeche Mode, Human League , Huey Lewis And the News, Midnight Oil and The list goes on.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />It's 1987 and Jenna Rink is a pubescent teen deeply unhappy with the state of her life.  Unable to fit in with the "in" crowd, Jenna makes an idle wish on her 13th birthday that she could instead be a 30-year old woman already living the life of glamour and independence she feels she so richly deserves.  Through some magical fluke, she achieves her wish, waking up in 2004 in the grown-up body of a successful fashion magazine editor.  The problem is that she is unable to remember the seventeen years that have elapsed since Madonna was in vogue and the hip kids were still strutting their stuff to the heavy dance floor beat of Michael Jackson's Thriller.  As a result, Jenna has to spend a large part of the movie trying to piece together the events that have brought her to where she is today.<br /><br />"13 Going on 30" is one of those high-concept romantic comedies that succeeds or fails based on its ability to transcend the confines and restrictions of its particular gimmick.  Happily, this movie is quite effective at doing just that.  Although the screenplay touches on the expected conflicts Jenna has coming to terms with a world filled with unfamiliar devices such as cell phones, it also explores the more personal aspects of how a 13 year-old would deal with the grown up issues of dating and sex.  In addition, Jenna also has to contend with the fact that she doesn't really much like the kind of person she's become - a conniving, status-seeking, career-drive snob - and looks for ways to turn back the clock and make amends for her actions.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner sparkles as the older Jenna, and Mark Ruffalo is, as always, compelling and charming as the sensitive boyhood chum whose love for Jenna has never faded.  They alone make the occasional plot hole and narrative contrivance forgivable.  The film also boasts a soundtrack chock full of nifty '80's songs, every other one of which seems to feature Belinda Carlisle in the lead vocal.  It's hard to argue with a movie with taste like that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;13 Going on 30&quot; proves that Jennifer Garner is going to be a star mainly because her performance carries us along through the flaws in the screenplay by Josh Goldsmith &amp; Cathy Yuspa and Niels Mueller (guess who had it last).  Having been the killjoy Hannah on &quot;Felicity&quot; and only pretending to have fun as Sydney Bristow on &quot;Alias,&quot; Garner has a blast as Jenna Rink.  As a 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen) dreams of being one of the popular kids but she wishes to be &quot;thirty and flirty.&quot;  At her birthday party she is the target of a cruel prank by Tom Tom (Alexandra Kyle), the leader of the Six Chicks, the ultra cool snobbish girls that Jenna desperately wants to join even though her best friend and neighbor Matt Flamhaff (Jack Salvatore Jr.) points out that would be mathematically impossible.  Totally embarrassed Jenna snaps at Matt, makes her wish, and has it fulfilled by virtue of magic dust (What?  You wanted hard science on how this happens?).<p>The next Jenna knows it is seventeen years later and she has, apparently, everything she ever wished for (breasts) and more (a job as an editor for &quot;Poise&quot; magazine).  Her best friend is Lucy (Judy Greer), who turns out to not only be Tom Tom grown up but another editor at the same magazine.  Jenna immediately tracks down Matt (Mark Ruffalo), who is also all grown up, except he remembers everything that happened since the last time they spoke: the day of her 13th birthday party.  At that point we know that two things are going happen.  First, despite having the knowledge and experience of a 13 year old Jenna is going to be a success at her job.  Second, despite having the knowledge and experience of a 13 year old Jenna is going to end up making out with Matt (but not the naked guy in her apartment).  <p>Yes, we have seen the idea of a kid in an adult's body from the original &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; to &quot;Big&quot; to the recent &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and a dozen other movies in between.  The lack of originality does not bother me with &quot;13 Going on 30,&quot; but the lack of creativity with this script does.  Excuse me while I rant for a while, because I really wanted to enjoy this movie.<p>First, Jenna was out of date by the time she was 13 back in 1987.  &quot;Thriller&quot; came out in 1982 and five years later young Jenna is making sure she has all of Michael Jackson's zombie moves down on the dance floor (you have to admit that this movie takes spontaneous group participation to a new level: instead of everyone bursting into a well known song this time around it is doing all the dance moves from a music video that is twenty years old).  Rick Springfield's big hit, &quot;Jessie's Girl&quot; was a hit way back in 1981, while Pat Benatar's &quot;Love is a Battlefield&quot; was big in 1983 (Note: Sometimes I tell viewers to be sure and watch the end credits; this time I am telling you to stay and LISTEN to the entire end credits).  They make such a point of Jenna being 30 in the year 2004 that it makes tying the starting point to 1987 problematic.  Gee, do you think that maybe this script was written four or five years ago?<p>Second, leaping forward 17 years into the future presents Jenna with only one point of confusion: her cell phone.  She has no problem walking in high heels, no other technological problems confront her, Eminem is the only new name she is confronted with, and if you really want to pick nits she never notices that the World Trade Center is missing.  Okay, that is really quibbling, but they really should have been able to come up with some creative ways of her dealing with the brave new world in which she finds herself.<p>Third, Jenna only succeeds in her job because the screenwriters wrote a scene in which everybody acts like she succeeded in doing her job.  I thought the joke of &quot;Magazine Publishing for Dummies&quot; was good (I looked, Amazon does not sell the book), but that is still a kid's mind in that gorgeous body.  Jenna needed to come up with a great idea and she did not even come up with a good idea.  Meanwhile &quot;Poise&quot; has been scooped six months in a row by a rival magazine and the board is just starting to become concerned (when Bruce Springsteen showed up on the cover of both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; that was a bigger story that this).  If I could talk about how that subplot plays out I could double the length of this rant with all the holes in that one.<p>What holds &quot;13 Going On 30&quot; together is Garner's performance, which is far better than this script deserves.  In a film like this there is always a moment when the main character has the chance to put things to right.  When we get to that moment in this film it is disappointing because they should have been able to come up with something better.  But then, we never really understood everything that happened to turn Jenna into a big success after her 13th birthday so we cannot expect the film to really connect the dots at the end either.  The result is an unsatisfying film that fortunately will not start Jennifer Garner's rising star one whit.  In fact, she is going to pick up momentum off of this one, she shines that much.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>13 Going on 30: 3 out of 10: First of all I would like to throw my full weight behind any effort to give Jennifer Garner a special Oscar for best performance in a pretty bad movie. She is delightful and plays the character better than written.<br /><br />In addition I would like to absolve any of her co-stars from any possible negative career ramifications due to their appearances in this film. They also did a fine job. And last I would like security to please apprehend the writers and director whom I see sneaking out the fire escape.<br /><br />Okay the director gets community service for making some pretty obvious soundtrack mistakes for 1987 (he highlights as the supposed geeky underground song Burning Down the House which was featured in as a jock anthem in Revenge of the Nerds three years earlier and as MTV fodder he highlights Thriller from 1983 which was already in the Halloween ghetto mix by 1987.) The writers get life in prison without parole. First question. Have they ever worked in any office anywhere, let alone a supposed fashion magazine? They get so much wrong I don't know where to begin. Second though Garner's performance is great her character is a mess. She finds older guys icky in one scene and is attracted to them in the next and then back to icky. She handles her cutthroat business environment with more maturity than most thirty year olds let alone thirteen year olds.<br /><br />Instead of going into a Being There Chauncey kind of vibe where Garner's character's inane utterances are taken as genius the film actually makes her more proactive than either her shy thirteen year old self would be or her cutthroat thirty year old self was. No working woman clich&eacute; is ignored and the less said about the sappy and ridiculous ending the better.<br /><br />The whole body swap time travel deal was actually the most believable part of the film. Certainly more believable than a doll house building, fairy dust collecting, fat boy next door growing up to be a thin straight single guy living in Greenwich Village or more than one drunk person remembering any of the dance moves from the Thriller video.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It is a pity that with rising star like Jennifer Garner '13 Going On 30' could have been a much better film. I don't care if the film is predictable. I don't care if the film is virtually a retread of superior Tom Hanks film `Big.' No, but I was hugely disappointed by the film simply because the director - whoever he is - misses every opportunity to make the heroine more interesting, more charming, and most of all, more believable.<br /><br />Jenna Rink, a slightly geeky 13-year-old girl living in the 80s, wakes up to find that she is now a 30 year-old woman living in the year of 2004. This is the meaning of the film's title, I think, but this is also the weakest part of it. Think about this. At the age of 30, Jenna finds that 17 years later she is the editor of one magazine Poise, she is friends with Madonna, and is living with a hunky popular professional hockey player. And she is living in New York City while her mentality remains that of 13 year old. And no one suspects the truths while watching Jenna suddenly start to act strangely (to them).<br /><br />OK, but you might say, how about `Big'? Yes, Tom Hanks managed to live as an adult after being turned into an innocent one. But he was working for a toy maker, if I remember correctly, and that setting sounds reasonable, and his acting is so believable (and he got an Oscar nomination.) But if you ask me to believe a 30 year-old-woman can suddenly start dancing to the Michael Jackson song `Thriller' and turn a dismally bad party floor into a great success, you are asking too much from me. You may get a few laughs seeing it, but you may also feel embarrassed seeing Jennifer Garner doing a zombie dance.<br /><br />I'm not complaining about her or the familiar premise of the film (of which script comes from the writer team of `What Women Want').But unlike that Mel Gibson/Helen Hunt romantic comedy, the title '13 Going On 30' is not exactly accurate. Jenna, as you see, should still remain a 13-year-old girl living in the 80s, but the same Jenna apparently has no trouble dealing with a cell phone, showing no surprise using it. But at the same time Jenna does not get the sexual nuance of her supposed boyfriend's remarks about `play the game.' I don't point out these inconsistencies one by one. In short, the film suggests she thinks like a 13-year-old girl trapped inside the body of a 30-year-old lady, but in fact she often acts like a 30-year-old woman trapped inside the body of the same age. These gaps are only damaging the film because as far as the characters go, it is the smallest details that really matter in this kind of comedy based on strange situations. Watch another body-switching film `Freaky Friday' in which everything fits in the right place and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />Finally about the actors. Many seem to be praising the acting of Jennifer Garner. I beg to disagree. It is Mark Ruffalo as Jenna's long-estranged love Matt who is really the best thing in this film. He represents a mature man with sound judgment and good-natured personality, and he does it without making the film too sentimental. You immediately realize that he is the man Jenna should have loved, and you understand why she is attracted to him. The only thing I cannot understand is, how come he is attracted to Jenna, whose behaviors are either childlike or childish, and always impossible..</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>It does happen a few times when just the acting on screen overwhelms me to the extent that I want to forgive the movie of a few flaws(big and small) I never saw this movie in the theater because I thought it's a chick flick and that's all about there is to it. I was right about one thing though. It is a bit of a chick-flick with a message quite conveniently one of it's own. I've often felt dumbstruck by the many questions I've left unanswered from my high school life. Not everyone lives a life full of victories.<br /><br />I liked the character of Matt(Mark Ruffalo) a lot in the movie because I felt I could relate to him. I run into a lot of Matts in my life and a seldom do I realise what makes them be. I also realise High School is one time of your life that haunts you everyday with all of it's good and bad attributes.I'm not gonna waste my time relating the story to you. What I loved most about this film was a certain song "Vienna" that plays in the film. Jenna Rink is confused,terrified,panic stricken and she searches for a home in her parents bed. Now that to me was one outstanding moment in the film.<br /><br />What I disliked about the film,if I may talk about it , were the last ten mins and the extremely fast forwarded fairy tale type ending.But the entire movie makes up for it.<br /><br />DVD features-<br /><br />Absolutely awesome menu that makes sure you watch the movie more than once. (perhaps make other people watch it) Good subtitles when you miss out on a great lyric to a song playing. Very nicely done,indeed.<br /><br />Please Read,I suggest this movie to all those people who can look beyond themselves to look at a part within themselves.I can probably try but not put in a better way. Enjoy whatever works.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>I've never been a fan of movies like "Big" or "Freaky Friday"; where you have children living in adult bodies and vice versa. I also try to steer clear of "chick flicks" as often as possible.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when watching "13 Going on 30", which is an absolutely irresistible feel good movie with great performances, a well written script, and some excellent direction.<br /><br />12 year old Jenna Rink (Christa B. Allen) just wants to be popular. I mean... what teenage girl doesn't?? However, she hasn't quite made her mark yet; but that is hopefully about to change. Her 13th birthday is coming up and she's invited the most popular click in school "The Six Chicks" to her party. Of course, none of the sought after Six Chicks (lead by snooty blonde Lucy: aka "Tom Tom") really want to go, until Jenna promises them that she will write their upcoming paper that is due in class. Jenna does have one lifelong friend in next door neighbor Matt (Sean Marquette), who harbors a secret crush on the young Jenna.<br /><br />The day of Jenna's 13th party has arrived, and the basement downstairs is all set up in innocent teenage party fashion. Matt arrives with a hand built dollhouse (complete with wishing dust) for Jenna. Then the "Six Chicks" show up, along with the most popular boys in school; and our Jenna is on Cloud 9... briefly.<br /><br />In typical childhood game fashion and at Tom Tom's suggestion, Jenna is blindfolded and lead to the closet, where she awaits a secret kiss from the boy at school she has a crush on.<br /><br />Well the whole thing goes terribly wrong, sending Jenna in a tailspin where she eventually wakes up 17 years later in her New York apartment.<br /><br />Hilarity and romance ensue for the remainder of the picture.<br /><br />Jenna soon realizes that she eventually became the leader of the "Six Chicks", that she still works with Tom Tom as an editor for her favorite fashion magazine. She also comes to find out that she essentially got everything she wanted as a young teenager. In the process, she learns that as an adult, she has turned into quite the "BIT*H", and has alienated everyone around her; including Matt for several years, her parents, and her fellow co-workers.<br /><br />It's all about rediscovering yourself as an adult with childlike eyes, as Jenna gradually finds out what she has become, and then does everything she can to change into the person she now feels she is inside. All the performances are great in this movie; from the young Jenna, Matt, and Tom Tom: to the now older versions of Jenna (Jennifer Gardner), Matt (Mark Ruffalo), and Tom Tom (Judy Greer).<br /><br />Jennifer Gardner is absolutely irresitable, charming, comedic and loveable as Jenna Rink. If your not a fan of hers, you more than likely will be after this movie.<br /><br />This is simply a great feel good movie, worthy of more than just one viewing. However you would categorize a film like this (i.e. "chick flick", romantic comedy) one thing is certain: "13 going on 30" is sure to wrap you around its finger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>On the surface, this movie may seem like just another fluff movie. However, giving this movie its fair chance, we soon learn that it is anything but that. Basically, as the movie starts, we are introduced to the 13 year old Jenna Rink. She is unpopular and unhappy. More than anything, she wants to hook up with the 6 'cool girls' in the school. Her friend Matt tries to explain that to her that there really isn't much to admire or envy about the  '6 cool girls.' Matt seems like a nice of enough person, but Jenna doesn't have her eyes on him. Rather, she is after the popular Chris Grandy. After reading some teen magazines, she decides she wants to be '30, flirty, and thriving' just like the people in her magazines. Well, somehow, she gets her wish and 17 years fly by. Not only is she 30, but she has a high paying job that she wanted, and her best friend is (or was)Tom Tom  the leader of the 6 cool girls. She is understandably confused at first, but she soon becomes happy over her wish coming true. To some extent, she is still talking and acting like a 13 year old, but it does make sense. Well, soon the "Bedazzled" formula comes in. (If you saw that, you know as Frasier made his wishes, the devil or Elizabeth Hurley threw some unwanted element in.) Garner's movie is more profound. Jenna gradually realizes that even though she has gotten her wish, she doesn't like the person she has become. To be sure, she 'supposedly' did bad things in the missing 17 years she had no control over. But even in the time as a 30 year old she DID have control over, she gets notably shallow and self centered. Possibly, the most profound aspect of this film is that it exposes the hypocrisy of society. Remember, the magazines Jenna was reading as a 13 year old, filled her with the desires for the wish. And even after Jenna got the wishes that society filled her with, she was really unhappy with herself when she realized the kind of person she became. And the even worse price she may have to pay is Matt. Matt was never really popular, but he held to his important values even though they didn't make him popular. Jenna has lost his friendship; he has gotten engaged to another woman; while he to a generous extent finally forgives Jenna, Jenna realizes that they have become so different. Also, Jenna may have gotten the best friend she wanted. However, she eventually learns that being friends with 'whoever is cool' may not be real. They may be willing to drop you when they realize that your friendship is more dangerous or possibly less beneficial to them. One of the most powerful elements in this movie is that the company Jenna works for is in trouble, and the key to saving her place of employment may directly parallel what Jenna needed to resolve with herself. In all honesty, there isn't a dull moment. And you do walk away feeling like the time spent was enriching as well as entertaining. (RARE FEELING AFTER A MOVIE THESE DAYS!)</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Jennifer Garner, of Alias and Daredevil fame, takes charge of this cliched family comedy about a geeky teenager named Jenna Rink that is unsatisfied with her life.  She is tired of the jokes and the unpopularity, and desires to be "thirty, flirty, and thriving".  Her dream is about to come true.  Due to a incident with her friend Matt and some biological "wishing dust", Jenna is transformed to her life 17 years later.  Unfortunately, it isn't what she dreamed it would be.  She has lost touch with her friends, family, and is an untrustworthy person in the office.  She loves to drink, cheat, and lie.  This is not the life she imagined.  Now Jenna has the chance to make it all change and to live the life that she has always dreamed about.  Will she have the time to change everything or will life's little consequences keep her from changing her future?<br /><br />This film failed on many levels.  Not only were we forced to watch an actress that couldn't quite nail her part, but we also had to listen to her attempt a high-pitched voice throughout the whole hour and a half.  We are left with themes left unexplored and a mismatched message sent to our viewers.  Jenna, before her change into a teenager, was a very sinister woman.  What happened to this woman?  Did she just suddenly disappear when "teenage" Jenna awoke?  I needed more answers to this question, yet none were provided.  Secondly, I was not impressed with the message that was made during this film.  What I witnessed was a woman that could not handle the stress of "real life", so she attempts to find an alternate route using "magic dust".  This is pathetic.  I realize that a message needed to be created, but it should not have been this far based from reality.  There were no connections made to any of the characters, the emotion was drab, and the acting was well below expectations to say the least.  The only redeeming factor in this film is Mark Ruffalo who gives the best performance by just wandering through this open void known as 13 Going on 30.<br /><br />Overall, I say skip it.  Hollywood has been producing these carbon copy films for years and unless we begin "skipping" them soon, we will be forced to watch them again and again and again.<br /><br />Grade:  * ? out of ****</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>13 Going on 30: 3 out of 10: First of all, I would like to throw my full weight behind any effort to give Jennifer Garner a special Oscar for best performance in a pretty bad movie.

They also did a fine job and deserve our praise. Last I would like security to please apprehend the writers (Josh Goldsmith & Cathy Yuspa) and director (Gary Winick) who I see sneaking out the fire escape.<br /><br />Okay first the director is sentenced to community service for making some pretty obvious soundtrack mistakes for 1987. For example he highlights, as the supposed geeky underground song, Burning Down the House is used though it was featured as a jock anthem in the movie Revenge of the Nerds three years earlier. In addition, and even more inexplicable, as MTV fodder he highlights Thriller from 1983. By 1987 Thriller was already in the Halloween ghetto mix.<br /><br />I'm afraid the writers on the other hand get life in prison without parole. First question I would ask either of them. Have they ever worked in any office anywhere, let alone a supposed fashion magazine? They get so much wrong with that one small detail I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />Second, though Garner's performance is great, her character is a real mess. She finds older guys 'icky' in one scene and is attracted to them in the next, and then she is back to 'icky' with hardly an explanation or even an indication that the character herself notices. The she bizarrely handles her cutthroat business environment with more maturity than most thirty year olds let alone thirteen year olds.<br /><br />Instead of going into a Being There, Chauncey kind of vibe where Garner's character's inane utterances would be taken as genius; the film actually makes her more proactive than either her shy thirteen year old self would be or her cutthroat thirty year old self is. No working woman clich&eacute; is of course ignored and the less said about the sappy and ridiculous ending the better. Poor Miss Garner is all over the map with this film.<br /><br />The strangest part of 13 Going on 30 is that the whole body swap, time travel story line is actually the most believable part of the film. Certainly more believable than a doll house building, fairy dust collecting, fat boy next door growing up to be a thin straight single guy living in Greenwich Village or more than one drunken person remembering any of the dance moves from the Thriller video.</p></br><a href="../users/A29COAL60SB48B.html">A29COAL60SB48B</a><br/><p>I'm used to watching flashback movies (such as "Peggy Sue Got Married") where the characters are reminiscing about the 1950's and 1960's.  Even when watching "Big" in 1988, the premise on which this movie was based on, the main character was from a time that I didn't know.<br /><br />I felt so old watching "13 Going On 30" because I could very much relate to 1987, being 11 years old then, and I kept thinking, "That hair and makeup is so on target."  I remember wanting to skip over the horror and confusion of the teenage years myself then - skip past those annoying cliques and raging hormones - and just become an adult.  I also remember those cheesy hairstyles and the corny music (I rolled my eyes at the continuous stream of those god-awful 80's tunes, although the Go Go's "Head Over Heels" as the opening song was a great fit).<br /><br />No need to rehash the plot (the female version of "Big," with '90's references thrown in) but Jennifer Garner was cute in her role as the adult Jenna Rink, who realizes, how many people she hurt on her way to number one (including the very magazine she worked for - she was sabotaging her own magazine by continually supplying a stream of ideas to their main rival magazine).  Mark Ruffalo played the adult Matt, Jenna's former boyfriend, a guy who she carelessly tossed on her way to popularity.<br /><br />For those who expect that Jenna and Mark will meet again as adults and everything will turn out great because she went from being a teenager to an adult overnight are in for a surprise.  While they got themselves reacquainted as adults, in the end, Matt decides to marry someone else, telling Jenna, on his wedding day, that "you can't turn back the hands of time."  The damage that she did to him was irreversible (as it is in real life).<br /><br />Matt gives Jenna the dollhouse he built for her when they were teenagers and, going to the back of the house where he's getting married in, the wind blows the remainder of the wishing dust on Jenna, transporting her back to 1987, and the party she left while she was blindfolded in the closet (waiting for one of the popular guys to kiss her, a trick played on her by the clique she wanted desperately to become part of).<br /><br />She returns to the party, seeing what happened to her as an adult, kisses Matt, ditches the clique, and Jenna and Matt wind up marrying and moving into their house, after all.<br /><br />Too bad real life can't mirror celluloid.  If only it were possible to see what would have happened in the future ...</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I didn't think this movie was very good. It was a light comedy and had a few chuckles but mostly it was just nothing special.

So its then the movie Big without Tom Hanks regurgitated for a girl but not as funny or origional. Jennifer Garner is just not a good actress. She isn't horrible but she is just not that good.

Did you take horrible school photos? Did you have to stuff your bra? Did you have a ruffled skirt, and wore massive scrunchies in your hair? Did you want to be in with the popular crowd, but knew you couldn't stand a chance? Did you have a best male friend, who secretly fancied you?<br /><br /> OK, I didn't have the latter, but the rest was/is me! That's one of the reasons this film struck a chord with me. I was the young Jenna in this movie. But I'm 10 years off 30, and have no plans of getting there anytime soon!<br /><br /> Jennifer Garner in the movie is wonderfully dorky, awkward, but so great! She plays the part brilliantly, and still manages the guy - despite managing to chat up a thirteen year old halfway through.<br /><br /> There are a few minor problems with this otherwise great movie. Jenna is 30 in 2004 - so when she was 13 would have been 1988? Yet the most popular tracks for the movie (Pat Benatar's &quot;Love is a Battlefield&quot; and Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot;) are both from 1983, five years before. Someone didn't do the research on popular music from 1988. The tracks they could have had in the movie could have been George Michael's &quot;Faith&quot;, Tracey Chapman's &quot;Fast Car&quot;, INXs' &quot;New Sensation&quot; and heaven forbid we remind everyone who grew up in the 80s, Debbie Gibson.<br /><br /> The scene where they all dance to &quot;Thriller&quot; looks a bit awkward at times (Jennifer Garner's smile sometimes seems rather fake, as it doesn't reach her eyes) but was pure class - even though NO ONE would dare admit to knowing the moves. (I don't even remember the song)<br /><br /> Mark Ruffalo was fantastic as the best male friend that had such an obvious crush on Jenna, but she was too blind to see it. And instead fancies the most popular guy in school (isn't that how it always works?) who later turns out to be a fat, balding, taxi driver.<br /><br /> The movie has a very sad ending (albeit happy), so bring out the tissues! It's a great movie overall, Jennifer Garner is pure genius as the female 'Big', and the overall awkwardness of her is well done. Worthwhile having.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>The highlight, of course, is the exuberant "Thriller" dance number. But let's not twist this, there are many moments worth watching in 13 GOING ON 30. Above all, you're dragged along in the wake of Jennifer Garner's charm and the infectious joy with which she plays Jenna. Not that she's produced a lot of stuff on the silver screen, but 13 GOING ON 30, breezy and laugh-out-loud funny, is without a doubt my favorite Jennifer Garner flick.<br /><br />It's all about wish fulfillment, and, because we've already seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC4ZF8">Big (Extended Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMCW">Freaky Friday</a>, we already know that the inherent lesson here is that be content within yourself and also that there's no place like home. It's a given that Jenna Rink will learn this lesson in due time, but not just yet. Because that would deny us the pleasure of watching then 32-year-old Jennifer Garner go thru her silly shenanigans. So, first, whilst being doused in magic dust, thirteen-year-old Jenna, experiencing a disastrous birthday, wishes that she were "thirty and flirty and thriving." She then wakes up to find herself in a beautiful 30-year-old body. What's more, she now resides in New York City in her own posh apartment and holding down a gig as a big-time fashion magazine editor.<br /><br />The movie then shows us obligatory (yet wickedly humorous) scenes of Jenna striving to act mature, and not quite getting there. I got a quick chuckle from a brief shot of Jenna scoping out "Magazine Publishing for Dummies." Plenty of fun call-backs to 1980s pop culture, to a time when people really were that into Rick Springfield and where "Everybody Wang Chung tonight" kind of meant something. Me, I barely remember Razzles, let alone that they're both a candy AND a gum.<br /><br />And then, as they're wont to do, the movie gets a bit serious (but, thankfully, not too serious). We learn that the woman Jenna had become is not a nice person. We also learn that the magazine she works for is suffering an alarming decline in popularity and in sales. Tons of pressure on Jenna, regarded as a bright star in the world of haute couture periodicals. Will Jenna get her act together? Will she make amends with her estranged former best friend Mattie, played, by the way, with down-to-earth appeal by Mark Ruffalo?<br /><br />It's key that Jennifer Garner is not at all afraid of looking silly and awkward here. It's key that she's a good enough actress that we come to care for her character. And it's important that Ruffalo is around to provide grounded support and that dang good romantic spark. Meanwhile, subtly duplicitous and a bit buggy-eyed, Judy Greer is pitch perfect as Jenna's current best friend. And, yes, I dare you high school graduates of the '80s to not get all nostalgic when the soundtrack kicks up. I can't believe I forgot how much I liked Billy Joel's "Vienna Waits for You." I've never really been a fan of Pat Benatar's "Love Is A Battlefield" but the movie's use of it as an anthem is pretty well done.<br /><br />I've been digging Jennifer Garner since her superspy days in ALIAS, and when 13 GOING ON 30 came out, I figured this was just the stage to propel her to bigger and better things. But, for some reason, she's kept a low profile in the years following 2004, excepting all the trashy Bennifer media blitz (yet another reason to dislike Ben Affleck). Thankfully, her recent good turns in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">The Kingdom (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CQNTK">Juno (Two-Disc Special Edition with Digital Copy)</a> have gotten her back on track. But, while she's shown off her dramatic skills in these other roles, to me, she was still never better than when she was "thirty and flirty and thriving." A totally endearing performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ.html">A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ</a><br/><p>Jennifer Garner returns to the big screen for this naughty and nice comedy about making the things that went wrong in life right.<p>THE STORY<p>As a young girl Jenna Rink just wanted to be popular and to grow up to be "30, flirty and thriving."  On her 13th birthday she managed to get the "popular girls" at school (and of course they were mean) to come to her birthday party and she choose them over her best friend Matt.  After making a wish with the "magical wishing dust" Matt gave her for her birthday Jenna wakes up 17 years later, "30, flirty and thriving."  As Jenna adjusts to her new world she learns that growing up to have everything she wanted isn't all it's cracked up to be as she finds that while clawing her way to the top she in fact lost everything that really matters to her in life.<p>THE COOL STUFF<p>Overall, the "life lessons" Jenna learns are some pretty darn valuable and deep stuff so kudos to the writers for writing out a deep but yet funny story.  Jennifer Garner's portrayal of a 13 year-old trapped in a 30 year-old body was just AWESOME as she had all the "little" things down pat from facials to movements.  Contrasting it with Tom Hanks' "Big" I'd say Garner wins hands down in performance.<p>BEST SCENES<p>1. The Pajama Party<p>2. "Thriller"<p>3. The photo shoot<p>4. Jenna makes things right at the end<p>THE VERDICT<p>A funny AND sophisticated comedy?  Who'd have thought?  If you're a Garner fan or a chick flick fan you KNOW you'll see this one.<p>Highest Recommendation</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>I have to admit it, 13 Going on 30 won me over. I know it's just a twist and apparent rip-off of Penny Marshall's classic, Big but this film is sweet and funny thanks to Jennifer Garner. I also think Mark Ruffalo is one of the best new actors to emerge in the last few years, he is so real and vulnerable, I just adore him! This film is fun for the whole family, it's charming and entertaining. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>jennifer garner plays her role just right. great innocence, great drama, great love. it's like she wishes to be 30, then she is and she doesn't know what to do. she a grown up growing up. then she finds out that the real adult world is cruel and backstabbing, and what you need is true friends, and hers is her true love, but he's getting married. so she wishes she can just go back in time. how ironic, but greatly played out. romantic, laughable, and very entertaining. i do recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>CAN JENNA HAVE HER CAKE AND EAT IT TOO?<br /><br />BACK TO 'OZ' SENTIMENTS? --- Jenna learns that there is truly NO PLACE LIKE HOME, but is it too late?

I really don't expect much from 'these kinds' of movies, so occasionally one of them does take me by surprise by being fantastic (i.e. - Freaky Friday last year, which would have made my Top 10 list had I not seen it so late). 13 Going on 30 gets really close to "fantastic" in quite a few moments, but has enough uneven little slips of narrative to put it in "cute" category. But let's get this straight - it's cute as hell, and enjoyable too. I'm not going to sit and rehash the plot because just about everyone knows that it's loosely based on the concept of Big - but the movie takes an added step in a great direction by forming that setup into an often intelligent meditation on those moments in life that everyone wishes to "redo." <p>  Jennifer Garner is cloying in the movie's opening stretch, but then settles perfectly into the role of Jenna, a 13-year-old girl who wishes to be 30 and then magically zooms ahead 17 years. Mark Ruffalo is great as usual in the role of Matt, a former childhood pal who resurfaces after all those years. I want to sit and nitpick on a few moments of the movie that had me rolling the eyes and I want to say that there's better stuff out there right now, so don't waste your time...but 30 really pulls out the stops and makes it totally worth it in the end. You don't have to be a 14 year old teeny-bopper to enjoy this movie either - anyone can identify with that age-old sting of regret. This movie will surprise you with its intelligence, its humor, and its ability to leap over a few flaws that you'll forget by the credits. Of course, guys, you can just stare at Garner's perfect body the whole time if all else fails. Jennifer Garner: A+++; The Movie: B</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Sweet movie. THe characters make this movie such a hit. The ending is perfect!</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>Wow!  I loved this movie cuz it avoided the sterotypical pitfall of having the hero be this cutsey nice girl all grown up, but actaully turn into the (b)itch that we all love to hate, in her future life.  And then they turn it around and show it from the perspective of the young girl still being "nice."<br /><br />This angle shows her as she should have been, but living through the mistakes she made as a child and young adult.  What a great learning tool for our young coming of age sisters and daughters.  I love how the "pajama party" is at her house, in the building with all the young girls. That was cute and fun!<br /><br />And the ending was such a cool surpirse, it gave me goose bumps!  I'm not kidding!  I really liked this film.  I think you will too.  Please rent or purchase it from Amazon.com.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>I hadn't seen this movie until a friend brought it over during our very impromptu 'girls night off'. It was so much more than I had expected and so much better too!<br /><br />Impatient to grow up in 1987, 13 year old Jenna Rink (Jennifer Garner) ultimately gets her wish. She then wakes up to discover that she is THE Jenna Rink---rich and connected magazine editor of 'Poise' magazine.<br /><br />In addition to being the same magazine that she had poured over as a kid, Jenna goes wild to learn that she is personal friend with Madonna of all people and owns a super cool loft packed with awesome clothes and has a very hunky professional athlete boyfriend! She's convinced that life cannot get any better.<br /><br />Upon further examination however, Jenna discovers material riches don't cover for emotional absence. Her successes came at the cost of abandoning family and friends The people who are around Jenna regularly tell her what they think she wants to hear and aren't actually her friends.<br /><br />Garner does a good job with the scripting material that she had to work with--the scripting holes are not her own fault. However, people at the magazine...etc don't seem to question why this allegedly high-powered and together power player is suddenly so spacey. If New York's publishing environment remains very cutthroat and the fictional magazine in this film was well-established, the company should have noticed something.<br /><br />The most solid character is the 'adult' Matt Flamhaff  (Mark Ruffalo) Jenna's childhood friend who is no where near as financially rich, but is emotionally happier having never forgot who he was or what he believed in.<br /><br />According to the film back story, Matt and Jenna had been friends, but drifted away. However (in one of the alternate realities ala 'Back to the Future') there is a very happy ending for the both of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL: NICE AGE APPROPRIATE FILM THAT DEALS WITH REAL ISSUES<br /><br />Well done age appropriate comedy that underscores the universal frustration and impatience that teenage girls are known for.

If more of the comedies I saw were half as good as this one, the percentage of comedies in my viewing regimen would skyrocket.<br /><br />(...) After a disasterous birthday party for the (...) Jenna, a wish she makes to be all grown up comes unexpectedly true as she wakes up the next day 17 years in the future (the current era instead of the 80s where the film started out) as a 30 year-old in a new city, with a new life.  She's living the kind of life she dreamed about as a kid, but apparantly has taken some paths to get there she wouldn't have expected: Jenna can't remember anything at all about the past 17 years.  Characters from her younger life are in different roles in her grown-up life than she would have expected as well; some that she would have thought would still be big parts of her life are absent, while people she never got along with are now her allies.<br /><br />  Jennifer Garner should have gotten an award for this; she plays the role of a character who's thirteen and thirty simultaneously to absolute perfection, and shows a tremendous comedic flair light years ahead of many higher-profile comedy movie mainstays.  It's in the top three or four films in the 'laugh-out-loud' category of the 2000s, is a brillant romance, and is more deeply moving and affecting than the vast majority of 'serious-minded' dramas.  A dream movie for romantic comedy fans; should appeal tremendously to all who enjoyed "Amelie", the 1980s's two "Mannequin" movies, "Soapdish" and "Serendipity".</p></br></body></html>

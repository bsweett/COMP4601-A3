Romero was going to go back to the well of the living dead another time he was going to come up with something different.  What "George A. Romero's Land of the Dead" (the director's name goes up top so you know this is not merely another remake of one of his zombie films, like last year's "Dawn of the Dead") offers is two variations on the familiar theme.  The first is in this brave new world humanity has found a way of perpetuating the old divide between the "haves" and "haves not," even when there are all those zombies out there suggest it should now be "us" versus "them." Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) has set up Fiddler's Green, a luxury high rise on an island between a couple of rivers (think the location of Three River Stadium in Romero's old stomping ground of Pittsburgh even though the movie is shot in Toronto).  There the "haves" live while the rest of the island has the "have nots," some of whom are hired as mercenaries to go out into the world and bring back "necessities."  Apparently money still matters in the "Land of the Dead," or perhaps people are merely trying to hold on to the old way of life, because the poor are not listening to those advocating going and taking away from the rich.<br /><br />Consequently, humanity has found a way to survive.  You can compare the more active approach of "Land of the Dead" with the mall rats of "Dawn of the Dead," who found a passive means of existence.  Kaufman has built Dead Reckoning, a gigantic armored vehicle that leads foraging parties out into the world.  These parties are led by Riley (Simon Baker), whose primary goal is getting everybody back alive, which does not always happen.  That is because he works with Cholo (John Leguizamo), who has a different idea of necessities, one attuned to the fine tastes of Kaufman.  Both men believe they are on their last mission at the start of this 2005 film, Riley because he will have now earned enough to pay for a car to get out of town and Cholo because he believes he has now earned the chance to move on up to Fiddler's Green.  Both are wrong and that sets up the conflict to come.<br /><br />This is where the second variation comes into play.  Kaufman not only created a high rise where the "haves" are protected from that "have nots," some of whom actually help the "haves" have even more, but the entire island is zombie proof.  This forces Romero to change the zombie part of the equation, and so we are introduced to Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), who runs a gas station and has a moment akin to when the ape looks at the thigh bone in "2001: A Space Odyssey."  Just to help us along the voice over at the start of the film warn us that if the zombies ever develop anything approaching rudimentary thinking skills that would be a bad thing, a very bad thing indeed.  So, of course, that is what happens.  After all, if you can have bad humans, then you can have good zombies (Joss Whedon has convinced me being dead does not make a character inherently bad).<br /><br />Having a zombie to root for is quite a different experience, but Romero also delivers on the guts and gore when the zombies go into their patented feeding frenzy.  The narrative can offer all the sly social satire it wants, we watch these movies to be disgusted by the bloody scenes of cannibalism.  The people Romero hires to do makeup and special effects are clearly on the cutting edge when it comes to this type of work.  Even when you watch the DVD special features and you see what they are doing in bright light most of it will still creep you out, so the scenes in the film shot at night or in the shadows with the liberal application of blood and other things it is even worse (which is a good thing in a zombie movie).<br /><br />The bottom line is that Romero delivers just what his fans want with this movie so that there is not a problem with failing to meet expectations.  No, "Land of the Dead" is not the best of the bunch, but for my money nothing will surpass the original "Night of the Living Dead."  The important thing is that here we are four films into the series, limiting ourselves to just the Romero helmed ones, and the series is certainly going a lot strong than the other comparable horror series, all of which have been abandoned by their creators (which is either a cause or effect).  Final Note: Look for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright of "Shaun of the Dead" fame as the photo booth zombies in one of the classic cameos of the early 21st century.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Land of the Dead has to be the worst out of all of Romero's "Dead" films. There is no plot hardly at all, and a lot of plot holes at that. Why are the zombies after Dennis Hopper? How do they know who he is? Those are just a couple of question out of the movie that are left unanswered. The only reason to watch the movie is to see zombies eat and destroy, but how many movies have we seen that are like that? This movie offers nothing new and is the same old thing that has been done a million times. We have even seen a zombie figure out how to use weapons on Day of the Dead, so zombies using weapons on here was nothing new either. Good special effects and a cameo by Tom Savini are the only thing that this movie worth watching. Everything else is very forgettable and not really worth watching again</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>GOing into this movie I expected a well done Zombie movie, since it was helmed by the master of all Zombie movies George A. Romero.  However, I very disappointed.  This film seemed to be more of a way to cash in on his past work.  There is no character development in this film.  The good guys aren't very sympethicly good, and we don't learn anything new about why or how the zombies are the dead alive. And why they are starting to act like they use to when they were alive.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>And gorefest.  George A. Romero has come back with a slick horror film with some clever ideas in it.  Though the story itself is not original, Romero successfully gives several twists to it, making the whole film good, solid entertainemt with his trademark satires (which are greatly helped by dark humor).<br /><br />Unlike the last year's remake of 'Dawn of the Dead,' the film avoids the humans vs the undead formula.  Instead the humans are living in a sanctuary city 'Fiddler's Green' where Dennis Hopper's magnate Kaufman virtually reigns (like exectives in black suit), and mercenaries are hired to 'pillage' food, drink, and other things from the towns outside where the zombies roam in the traditional way (oh, and this time, they don't run.)<br /><br />[REVENGE OF THE ZOMBIES] we learn that one zombie 'Big Daddy' couldn't stand it.  Believe it or not, he starts to learn how to use weapons, and leads a troop of fellow zombies to Fiddler's Green. Besides this gory battles between humans and zombies, there is a conflict between humans (well, that's the new part) between a hard-nosed mercenary Cholo (John Leguizamo) fed up with the life of doing dirty works, Kaufman (with Hopper's usual mannerism as baddie), and another mercenary and our reluctant hero Riley (Simon Baker).  Asia Argento and Robert Joy also appear, offering help to Simon Baker's character.<br /><br />The script is fine, if not superb, but anyway Romero is a great storyteller, so this story will do.  He also knows how to entertain and surprise us with timely editing and occasional sly humor, so even when the familiar gimmicks are employd (like a zombie hiding somewhere and coming out suddenly, or the camera panning to and fro suggesting something is hiding there), the results are different, mostly better than imitators' tricks.<br /><br />Prodution designs and photography are both good, and some scenes are really memorable (my favorite: 'scared' zombies). But probably the success of the film is due to the good acting from Baker, Joy, Argento, Leguizamo and Hopper.  Considering the numbers of the people (or extras) eaten by the zobmies, surprisingly many main characters survive in the end, and this may suggest the studio is considering a sequel.  If so, I heartily welcome the decision, and am ready to see it.  And thank you Mr. Romero, this is what we wanted to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>So what's George Romero, writer and director of Night of the Living Dead (1968), Dawn of the Dead (1978), and Day of the Dead (1985) been doing for the last, oh, 20 years?  Well, not a heck of a lot, according to his credits...a few films here and there, a couple of remakes, and so on...but would he ever return with another film in the `Dead' series?  That's what most of us wanted to know, `most of us' being fans of his past work...rumors swirled for years, perpetuated by the fan rags and later websites, but there seemed little in the way of any real concrete information...until, I believe, the summer of 2004, when the deal was signed between Romero and Universal to make another `Dead' film...for better or worse...written and directed by George Romero, Land of the Dead (2005) features Simon Baker (L.A. Confidential, The Ring Two), John Leguizamo (Super Mario Bros., Romeo + Juliet), and Dennis Hopper (Speed, Waterworld).  Also appearing is Asia Argento (B. Monkey, xXx), Robert Joy (Ragtime, Amityville 3-D), and Eugene Clark (Turn It Up, Wilder).<br /><br />As the story, set in the present, begins, we learn the living dead phenomena has spread worldwide, forcing people to seek refuge within outposts, some utilizing geographic boundaries such as rivers (such as the one in this film) to maintain a perimeter from the hungry dead, or `stenchers', as they're referred throughout the film (presumably because they smell bad, a result of the rotting flesh and poor hygiene skills).  Within this one particular enclave, there are two classes, the wealthy, which populate a shiny skyscraper called `Fiddler's Green', and the laborers who live in the slums around the building (they basically do all the day to day work to keep Fiddler's Green running).  I suppose the zombies themselves could be considered a third class, sort of the disenfranchised rabble, but anywhoo...the city seems to depend on raiding parties that scour the surrounding, zombie infested small communities for supplies, with a fellow by the name of Riley (Baker) overseeing the operation, his second in command being Cholo (Leguizamo).  Turns out this is both Riley and Cholo's last foray, as Riley is planning on heading north, while Cholo, sort of a lacky for the man (the man being Mr. Kaufman played by Hopper), is planning on taking residence in the opulent Fiddler's Green community.  Well, events conspire to spoil both men's plans, as Riley's deal falls through, and the slightly sleazy Cholo's given the runaround by the bigoted (among other things) Kaufman (heck, even I knew the brown skinned Cholo had no chance in hell of gaining entry into the highly exclusive community).  Anyway, Cholo hijacks the Dead Reckoning, a heavily armored, packed with weapons (including missiles), battle wagon designed by Riley to not only defending the city, but also assist in the raiding parties in dealing with the zombies (think of it like that personnel carrier from the 1986 movie Aliens, only bigger, but not as sophisticated).  Cholo now threatens to use the weapons against Fiddler's Green, unless Kaufman pays up, but Kaufman has other plans as he makes a deal with Riley to take Cholo out...oh, by the way, the zombies have begin to develop rudimentary cognitive abilities and are mobilizing, preparing to march on the city...<br /><br />If you're just interested in the bloody entrails spewing, bone gnawing, flesh peeling (there's a particularly memorable scene where a victim gets his face peeled off), blood spurting, limb-rendering gore often found in movies like this, then this is definitely a solid four star film.  The special effects teams did really amazing work with not only the make up, but also the nastier bits, many of which I've already eluded to...I've seen worse (the 1980 film Cannibal Holocaust, for one), but the visceral action is still pretty heavy duty here, especially for the uninitiated...and I do believe `Unrated Edition', which has about four minutes of extra footage, features extended sequences of these grisly scenes, pared down for the theatrical release.  Now on to the stuff that didn't suit me...I guess it was sort of natural to expect an evolution of the zombies (or else a gimmick to differentiate this film from the others), in terms of them developing very simplistic, cognitive skills, but I didn't swing that way...zombies have always been a mindless automaton horde with one goal, to eat the flesh of the living.  They're not good, they're not evil, they just are...inuring them with certain sensibilities, as was done here, seemed wrong, unnecessary, and pointless.  Romero's `Dead' films have generally stuck to a formula, featuring imagery reflecting the quasi-sociological atmosphere of the time, but here seems more obvious than before, as the undead begin to organize, ultimately revolting against the unjust treatment heaped on them low these many years...rise up my desiccated, rotting brethren, and fight the power!  Fight the power and eat the brains!  Whatever...I don't mind that filmmakers infuse their own ideas and beliefs into their stories, but find a way to do it so it doesn't screw things up.  Everyone's got an agenda, just be wary how you foist it upon your audience.  As far as the characters go, the only one I cared for was Asia Argento's as Slack, and that was only because she was very easy on the eyes, and not because hers was actually an interesting character.  Did anyone like Simon Baker's character?  I thought he was annoying, wishy washy, and I doubt he would have survived as long as he did in a world populated with the undead.  Supposedly he was responsible for the vehicle Dead Reckoning, a highly sophisticated battlewagon, yet he's unable to secure a simple automobile to leave the city.  This guy seemed hardly the hero, but more like a secondary character, one who dies a nasty, hurty death early on...as far as Leguizamo, I'm still hurting from that role of his as Luigi Mario in Super Mario Bros. (1993).  Some wounds never heal...Hopper plays his role surprisingly subdued, which was a refreshing change of pace from his normally overblown, over the top villain characters seen in films like Waterworld (1995)...oh wait, Hopper also appeared with Leguizamo in Super Mario Bros., as King Koopa...the nightmare continues...overall I enjoyed the film, and the action was paced well throughout, the effects amazing and brutal, with the story lacking, and the characters disposable.  My favorite scene had to be the zombies rising from the river...very spooky.  As far as my rating goes, 3 stars for the film, and one extra for the special features and a decent effort put forth.<br /><br />I won't go into all the special features included with this release, as the Amazon website details them well enough, but I feel I should warn people there are a number of different releases available for this film, primarily fullscreen and widescreen, and the Amazon website doesn't do that great of a job differentiating the two for the causal buyer.  If you really look, you can determine which version is the widescreen, but the fullscreen version isn't as clearly defined.  I've listed as much as I know below...<br /><br />ASIN: B000B2YR7Y (97 minute Extended version Fullscreen, aspect ratio 1.33:1)<br /><br />ASIN: B00005JO16 (97 minute Extended version Widescreen Anamorphic, aspect ratio 2.35:1)<br /><br />ASIN: B000B2YR7O (93 minute Theatrical version, aspect ratio unknown)<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />If I learned anything from this film it is zombies like fireworks...and a zombie growl is actually a form of communication.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Like many of the other reviewers, I am a longtime fan of George Romero's zombie flicks... I first saw "Night Of The Living Dead" in 1975, and have been a devoted enthusiast ever since.  I think the sequels are good, too, and each followed up on the subversive political satire of the original.<br /><br />However, I also have to count myself among those who found this fourth Romero flick to be a bit, well, "dead."  I really wanted to like it, and rented it despite the numerous well-reasoned, well-balanced reviews by other Amazon customers who panned it...  Sadly, it's true: the script is weak, the action is flat, and the theme -- that the zombies, having proved capable of learning and adaptive behavior in the previous film, are now able to organize themselves as a coherent social force -- isn't explored in a terribly interesting way.  Much of the dramatic heft is given over to two terrible hams, Dennis Hopper and John Leguziamo, and although the "good" good guys have some likeable characters, there's still not much in the way of compelling character development.  Perhaps in another five years Romero will come back yet again with a film in which the zombies have established a new civilzation and become a political force to be reckoned with, and that could be a cool story... But Romero might do well to hire an outside writer (Joss Whedon, perhaps?) who could bring a little more life into the series.  This film was the first real dud.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>It took 20 years for us Romero fans to finally witness firsthand the long-awaited fourth 'Dead' movie. Romero had been rumored to be considering it for many years, and up until now we had wondered if he would ever make another film. Well wait no longer fans...we now have this fourth entry in the 'Dead' film series, and was it worth the wait? You bet!<br /><br />LAND OF THE DEAD takes on the premise of picking up slightly where DAY OF THE DEAD left off, but really it has its own beginning and end. The film opens with the squad of militants left killing off the mindless zombies and dumping them in the garbage. Many of the dead are now walking the streets, but there's something very different about them now...and the lead Zombie (played in awesome fashion by Eugene Clark) is getting smarter. We see the zombies watching fireworks in the sky which seems to distract them so these militants can kill off the zombies one by one. Many of the survivors are now in an enclosed city run by the corrupt Mr. Kaufman (played by the as usual good Dennis Hopper, who seems to inhabit villain or corrupt roles with such gusto. Bravo Mr. Hopper!!), and the zombies roaming the streets in the wastelands of suburbs are starting to evolve. This was one of the best elements of the movie...giving the zombies some type of personality...they now realize their fate and what they have to do. It really makes the film quite interesting and a little bit creepier than most other films of this day and age. The zombies proceed, following the lead zombie, to infiltrate the city and eventually start killing off the population one by one. The gore in this uncensored version is absolutely creepy and you will cringe every time a zombie rips flesh, tears off a limb, or rips off a head. It almost looks realistic. There is more gore in this one then there was in DAY OF THE DEAD. The fast pace time of the movie (at 97 minutes long) also helps to make this a very entertaining and creepy entry in the DEAD film series. The ending was actually kind of smart too, but I don't want to give it away to anyone because you'll enjoy it yourself. Let's just say the zombies aren't completely killed off by the end and there is a destiny for them. Most of the actors, especially Leguizamo, Simon Baker, and the sexy Asia Argento, are all on their game here. Watch for a surprise cameo from none other than make-up stalwart Tom Savini...<br /><br />George Romero continues to impress to this day, and LAND OF THE DEAD just further cements his status as an essential director in the horror film genre (and more specifically, the zombie genre). LAND OF THE DEAD presents a much different picture than DAY OF THE DEAD...and it's a great film that will continue the resurgence of horror films today.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I had read many negative reviews of this film (by horror film junkies and longtime Romero fans), so I wasn't expecting much.  Lo and behold not only is this a very good film, but it's a worthy follow up to all of Romero's dead films.  Perhaps many people were disappointed by this film because Romero took the Dead films in a different direction here.  He didn't make a nostalgic film or anything like that.  He made a very vivid, bleak, unforgiving, gory (warning for gorehounds...the gore is not "fun" gore), and intense.  I think it's an excellent film.  It's occasionally heavy handed (Hopper's character is obviously a stand-in for the Bush administration, which Romero admits in the commentary), but it's extremely watchable and a worthy entry into the zombie series.  It also has some of the best acting of the entire series.  Simon Baker and John Leguziamo are superb here, playing characters that seem like real people instead of horror film characters.  Asia Argento, daugher of Dario and longtime friend of the Romero family, isn't really given anything to do here.  She's nice to look at, but that's about it.<br /><br />There are many memorable scenes here, especially the shot where the zombies cross the river.  It's reminiscent of a shot in Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls (a film Romero saw when it came out and that he deeply admired), except this time it's in color and there's CGI used in it (very good CGI).  All of the performances here are very sincere, and that helps a lot.  There's no tongue in cheekness here.  Romero takes a very somber tone with this film and keeps it until the end.  I think it's one of his best films.  It's not as good as Dawn (my favorite) or Night, but it's better than Day of the Dead (which is very underrated in my opinion) and it deserves to be talked about in the same breath as Romero's other works.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Land of the Dead reminds me of everybody who's doing something only maybe not the most efficient way, then here comes this other guy and he goes "oh, you want to do this?" and does it perfectly. Well maybe not perfect but this film looks at films like the Resident Evil's, 28 Days Later, and the Dawn of the Dead remake and goes "step back and learn". So we have this film which may not be the most family fun, but rent with a few buddies and you'll have a good time, nothing more.<br /><br />I haven't watched the previous 3 so I can't comment on those. But in this one, many humans now live in cities with water on all sides and electrified fences all around. A team gets sent to get supplies now and then(why they don't just take them all at once is beyond me). Only something peculiar happens: one of the zombies, nicknamed Big Daddy can actually think, well sort of. It's more like a case of deductive reasoning and nothing more. He sees something and learns what it is, he goes "ooh, I see" and off we go.<br /><br />Part of the team is a man named Cholo, working for another man, THE man in the city. Only Cholo's not getting paid so for revenge he decides to hold the whole city for ransom or he'll fire missiles from a big truck known as Dead Reckoning. Sent by the man to get him is Riley, pretty much the designer of the truck. So it's basically a race to get the truck then turn around to save the city.<br /><br />If there's one thing you can count on in a zombie movie is gore and with this unrated edition, it's got it in spades. Faces' get pulled; tongues, arms and heads get ripped out; even a belly-button ring gets yanked out. If you're not into gore or can't stomach, stay away from this. There's a big gap where the "story" takes over but once zombies hit the city it's pretty much carnage right through.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not into horror films. Quite frankly, a lot of them are stupid and trying to do something which they're not doing in the end. Gore is meant to create disgust, a sense of "eww, did that head just get pulled off?" but what it's supposed to do is freak you the **** out. That's me so other people might find that freaky but me personally I like it when a horror film gets under my skin and creeps me out. Of course with a film like this, it's supposed to be carnage candy so you just go along with it.<br /><br />If you're big on horror, gore, or just the zombie films in general, you'll dig this. If you're like me who's into films like Seven or Aliens where the gore is more implied rather than shown in all it's glory well stay clear.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>Unlike Night, Dawn or Day of the Dead, by the time we view Land of the Dead the zombies are in control of most of the world. Well there's one fairly large city surrounded by high walls where some humans live, there's a leader named Kaufman (Dennis Hopper, "Speed"), who has his personal soldiers that keep people in line. This city is like any post apocalyptic place would be, there's the usual upper class, middle class and lower aka poor class.<br /><br />People are tired of Kaufman's reign of tyrany and there's a movement brewing to overthrow his control of the city. But despite all this the humans are surviving, however the zombies have a plan thanks to somehow gaining some intelligence and have a leader of sorts who gets the masses together to march on the city, break in and feast on the population.<br /><br />I've already put more effort into the description of this film than the filmmakers put into the movie itself, cause its a pretty boring, the acting is ok I guess, though seeing Hopper in crap like this is just sad. The zombies aren't even worth rooting for in this flick, its clearly obvious where its going from the first few minutes, there's zero tension or scares and the scenes near the end with some kind of truce between the good guys and the zombies is just laughable. * out of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though zombie fans might consider it a point of honor to watch this film, everyone else should probably look elsewhere; Land of the Dead is by no means a bad movie, but it lacks the flair that characterized Night/Dawn/Day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>While speed zombies have become the rage, in such films as the recent remake of Dawn Of The Dead and 28 Days, in Land Of The Dead- the fourth of what is now a tetralogy of original Dead films by George Romero- we are back to the slow moving ghouls of old, although they are showing signs of evolving intelligence, if not fleetness. That said, it is clear that Romero has run out of ideas, and his attempts at social commentary in the original Night Of The Living Dead and original Dawn Of The Dead (both have been remade) have gone pallid. Those two original films were unique, in that they rose above their horror genre and zombie subgenre to become great films, much in the way Alien and Aliens transcended the horror-sci fi ghetto and the first two Terminator films did the same for cyborg-time travel flicks. But, there must be some sort of rule that allows only the first two films of such genres to become classics, for the last original zombie film from Romero, 1985's Day Of The Dead, was horrible, and this film, while a little better, is still nowhere near passable. Romero, in fact, has seen subsequent generations of zombie enthusiasts pass him by.... The film is the most impressive of his zombie quartet, due to CGI, but the actual dead look the least scary of all the zombies. The DVD comes with a number of featurettes, but the Romero-led commentary track talks of mainly minor film details, in an in-jokey way, and little of the mythos, so is rather banal, which recapitulates the almost generic feel that this film has, as if Romero was told some backers wanted a fourth film, gave him lots of money to make it, and then he was stuck with figuring everything else out, especially a script, so took the money and ran, and merely stole from his earlier films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Zombie films have always had a rich history. What most people don't know is that the true origin of zombie films began not in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead, but in 1937 with Revolt of the Zombies. There are reasons however why people don't know this, and it is because Revolt of the Zombies was a terribly boring and convoluted movie. When George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead hit in 1968, it was groundbreaking and a true horror masterpiece, and a few zombie movies spawned from it in the '70s. But, in 1978, zombie horror truly hit its stride with the sublime Dawn of the Dead by George A. Romero. The film changed the face of horror films forever, and spawned a series of George A. Romero spinoffs (Return of the Living Dead 1, 2, and 3, Day of the Dead 1 & 2), some good ripoffs (Evil Dead 1 & 2, Zombi 2, and Cannibal Apocalypse) and some not-well-received movies. Zombie films went into a deep coma sometime during the late '80s and remained there for several years. Then, in 2002, the Resident Evil film put zombie horror back on the map and returned with a triumphant bang, which over the years has seen two other Resident Evil films, 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, House of the Dead 1 & 2, the Dawn of the Dead remake and many more. Land of the Dead came around sometime in the summer of 2005, it's most certainly not Romero's best work, but as a zombie horror fan I loved it. It was gory, it was more story-focused, and it was action-packed.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: It's a post-apocalyptic world, there are zombies everywhere. The only place to live is a s***hole called Fiddler's Green... well at least for poor people it's a s***hole. The rich are greedy and rule over it along with the military. For everyone else it's nothing but a place of gambling, cheating, and prostitutes. The story is focused on a survivor named Riley, his friend Charlie, and a few other survivors. The story also wraps itself around the zombies because the zombies in this film are rather smart, and can communicate with each other, work together, and form a rather terrifying army of the dead. So when the dead learn to get smarter and use weapons they slowly travel to Fiddler's Green to feed on the living.<br />STORY: It's nice to see that zombie films are actually trying to make use of story that actually makes sense. No surprise considering when Resident Evil came out it put all zombie films to shame when it came to story, even to this day. The story is not without its share of problems mostly over the fact it gives no explanation as to how exactly did the zombies come to be. Am I still supposed to assume they came from Hell?<br />GORE: This film really shines in the gore department. Limbs being ripped off, internal organs being ripped out, eyes being ripped out, arterial spray, people being torn in half, my personal favorite when a zombie grabs the upper lip of a victim and then rips the skin off of his face, and so much more.<br />MUSIC: Sets the eerie mood, but more could have been done with it. It definitely can't compare to the music of Resident Evil.<br />SCARE: If you don't watch horror films often, you might get scared. I didn't, almost nothing scares me these days, especially considering the fact I watch almost nothing but R-rated films.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: If you're someone like me or my Amazon friend J-Train, and you can almost never hate a zombie movie, you'll love this one. It provides plenty of gory fun and it actually has a story that feels like it means something.<br />OVERALL: You must watch this if you love zombie films, it's not the best one ever, but it will keep you interested. If you like George A. Romero, chances are you will like this film.<br />THE GOOD: Good gory fun, a story that means something.<br />THE BAD: Story has problems, music has problems, and it is not the best work of George A. Romero.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Well the long awaited new installment in George Romero's famous "Dead" trilogy is finally here! They tried to update it and I think it fails in many respects. While Dawn of the dead is one of the best horror films ever made and Night of the Living Dead way ahead of its time, here it just seems laughable because it is not scary. It not only compares poorly to other films in the series, but it appears Romero is washed up. If they polled people on what scared them in the year 2010, I bet that "zombies" wouldn't be near the top of what scares people. But the wait finally is here, but what a disappointment. Shaun of the Dead was a much better zombie film in many respects. Romero fails to tred any new ground as a director. While zombies were pretty much an American thing, the Italians took to new levels (see Lucdio Fulci, et al). That cycle pretty much ended with Cemetary Man.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Thirty-six years after shocking audiences and changing the face of American horror with "Night of the Living Dead," and 20 years after his ambitious but budget-starved third installment "Day of the Dead," George A. Romero returns to the genre he indelibly re-created with the fourth (and surely final) film in his series. This time he has the budget to see his grand vision to the screen.<br /><br />A pocket of mankind has found refuge in a (literally) gated community, a veritable feudal kingdom called Fiddler's Green where class structure is strictly enforced by its corporate despot (Dennis Hopper). The rich and powerful live in luxury in a glowing glass tower while the underclass is confined to the slums. A militia keeps the poor contained and the city protected from "the stenches" (as the rotting undead are called).<br /><br />Riley (Simon Baker), the leader of the raiding party that scavenges zombie-infested towns for supplies, is fed up with the inequity. No rebel, he's about to abandon the city for the zombie-less frontier of Canada when he's drafted for one last assignment. His second in command (John Leguizamo) has stolen the raiding party's armed and dangerous tank and holds the city for ransom.<br /><br />To complicate things, the zombies are evolving. They start to learn, to communicate and to organize, and they target the great glass tower as prime noshing grounds.<br /><br />If Fiddler's Green is America's class disparity through Romero's satirically warped looking glass, then the zombies are the Third World scratching at the borders. Yes, you can only take the metaphors so far, but loaded dialogue like "We don't negotiate with terrorists" is constantly delivered with more gusto than necessary (Romero's direction of actors isn't particularly delicate).<br /><br />Romero embraces the advancements of make-up effects, animatronics and computer-generated imagery enhancements, but at heart he's an old-fashioned storyteller who relies on simple devices. While there is no shortage of slow, shuffling zombies pulling fresh meat from the body human in inventively gory flourishes, the scenes of mass chaos as mankind devours itself -- class conflict gone cannibalistic -- are what define the film.<br /><br />The social commentary isn't subtle, but Romero delivers the goods so effectively that many won't even notice.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Here's the problem. Romero allows a remake of Dawn last year that takes the zombies to a new level: they run, they seem a little smarter, and (yuck) they can give birth. Then this year, in Land, the zombies seem to have forgotten how to run but now they are even smarter than in the Dawn remake. Oh well. Land was still good fun.<br /><br />I thought that the 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead was terrific, as was last year's Dawn of the Dead remake. Land was fun, but it was a step away from the realistic situations predominant in the more recent versions of Night Of and Dawn. (Wait a minute...realistic situations...the walking dead...???)<br /><br />Anyway, Land of the Dead is certainly not a continuation of last year's Dawn. It's George Romero's take on what happens to some far-fetched Dennis Hopper owned "city" well after the zombies have taken over the rest of the world. John Leguizamo and Simon Baker are two mercenaries that run a gang of zombie killers with access to an awesome battle machine and a ton of firepower (these two guys and their gangs running the "military" of the city as opposed to the city police/military running it themselves make you need to go even further for that extra grain of salt).<br /><br />A "smart" zombie leads an angry mob of other zombies to Dennis' city, John Leguizamo turns on Dennis and Simon finds some good guys to try to make it all right in a world gone bad.<br /><br />I was entertained and would not suggest anyone interested in the genre pass on Land of the Dead. And beware...what George seemed to lack in a more believable plot line he made up for in going for the gross out.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>. For once in one of Romero's Dead flicks we get to see many of the main characters live. I liked the characters in LOTD a lot. I think that this film had good to great acting. It was definitely funny, I thought that Dennis Hopper was a scream. He did an excellent parody of the stupid rich CEOs that try to control our lives. The heroes were as well developed as the previous films in the series. I mean, do we really know that much about the other characters in the other dead films. If I recall, not really. In the other films, just when the audience gets to know and like a character, they usually get bumped off. At least with LOTD, there is a possibility that these guys have a real chance to live past the credits and into the next film. That is, if Romero wants to use some of the same characters in the next Dead film. As for the explosions, violence, nudity, and all the other fun stuff, it fits because it reflects our times. With the exception of the nudity and hot lesbians, tune into the news and you get to see the violence and explosions every night. Romero is just thrusting that point in our face so that we open our eyes to that. The violence in the film is not pretty and for once I felt sorry for the zombies. They had a right to be pissed, and Big Daddy, the lead zombie, was right in rallying the troops.<br /><br />Well, if I said too much, I didn't mean to bore anyone. But I'm sick of certain people ripping this film. If you don't like it, fine. Instead of sitting at your computer typing, make a better movie. Go on, give it a try.<br /><br />I'm porbably going to see it agian just so I can watch the part with the Naval Ring.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>First of all, let me say that it's pretty much essential to have seen the other Romero movies leading up to this one (NIGHT, DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD).  Not because they are so plot heavy that you get lost if you skip one, but because there are two "progressions" you need to follow to fully enjoy these movies.<br /><br />First, we see the actual progression of low budget film making.  Unlike "indie" films, where directors make small movies with small stakes with small budgets, the "DEAD" movies are large scale movies made on a small budget...hence, low budget.  An "indie" film usually has enough money.  A low-budget film requires the filmmaker to accomplish something big on a shoestring, requiring a different type of problem solving.  The first film was black and white and contained its themes within a small house.  DAWN was contained mostly in a mall, but we got glimpses of the outside world and the growing catastrophe.  DAY was confined to a bunker, but again the global scale was growing.  And now the new film in state-of-the-art stock with CGI backgrounds takes the low-budget to the next level.  You are actually seldom aware the budget is low.<br /><br />And you get to follow the track of Romero's particular vision.  There's a million ways the same basic scenario could play out.  The dead are coming back to life and feeding on the living.  If they bite you...you will soon be a zombie.  Only way to kill you is to shoot or severely damage your head.  That's it.  How that idea would unspool for humanity is the fun of all this.  Romero brings to LAND OF THE DEAD a unique vision of the evolution of this scenario.  A lot of time has passed since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the surviving humans have developed some pretty sophisticated survival techniques.  That's fun to watch.<br /><br />But the zombies who remain have changed a bit themselves.  Their urges are the same...but now they actually have some semblance of organization.<br /><br />It's fun to watch these two sides cope with the changes from the others.  For the zombies, they can't get at the humans with much ease anymore, and thus need to reinvent themselves.  For the humans, who now live in an insulated society (dominated by a crazy Dennis Hopper...ain't that perfect!), they must cope with the warring factions developing between themselves...a conflict which threatens to allow the zombies the room they need to reemerge from obscurity.<br /><br />Some have said the movie is too slow or too hokey.  Or that the dialogue is bad.  Have you watched the other movies that you revere so much???  They have pretty bad dialogue too.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is 2 hours and 15 minutes, and many of the scenes of "mall life" drag on needlessly.  DAY OF THE DEAD is horrifically acted.  Yet we all love those.  And they are good, because the dialogue isn't really what we watch for.  It's the fascination with this primal conflict...and frankly, it's the gore.<br /><br />LAND OF THE DEAD doesn't have the huge amounts of gore that DAY OF THE DEAD had, but there are some "clever" moments of gore, and naturally it's far more realistic when we see it.  And it also has a few actors who can act.  Simon Baker is a credible "hero" in my opinion, John Leguizamo always has a bit of charisma, even when he's sorta slumming, Dennis Hopper never fails to bring a smile to my face...cuz when he overacts, it's SO fun.  And even Asia Argento brings a nice feel to her cliched role.  It's time for her to have an actual "role."<br /><br />Anyway,  I enjoyed the movie.  It's not a "classic" like the first two, and no, it doesn't have the outstanding flair of the recent DAWN remake (a movie I highly recommend), but it does offer familiar pleasures for fans of the genre.<br /><br />Despite all the nay-saying, I still say "yes."</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>This one's at least just as gruesome, gory, and gross as any of the other Dead movies, but also I think a little more creative, with some interesting developments.  Especially developments of and by the living dead - taking up weapons, for instance.  It seems the dead are learning to live normal lives, while the living do so in sin.  I didn't see the previous movie in the series, so I don't know how much of the background and characters were already established, but I picked up enough to understand it all.  Dennis Hopper controls a city protected from the dead, living high in a ritzy skyscraper.  Patrols go out to bring in supplies, fighting zombies along the way.  They have an armored vehicle, which is stolen by one of the men Hopper betrayed.  Another is sent to recover it, and has plans of  his own.  But none of that reallly matters, as the dead are picking up weapons, learning, and closing in.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>It's been quite a while since horror visionary George Romero last graced horror fans with a film, and it's been 20 years since his last "Dead" film, 1985's terribly underrated Day of the Dead.  But now, with the recent success of more mainstream aimed zombie flicks like 28 Days Later, the Resident Evil films, the excellent spoof Shaun of the Dead, and even the big budget remake of Romero's own Dawn of the Dead, the climate has never been better for the zombie horror master to show us all how a zombie movie is really done.  For the most part, Land of the Dead is a thoroughly enjoyable horror romp that despite it's R rating, still provides the gut ripping gore that Romero fans would come to expect.  The story involves a team of mercenaries led by Riley (Simon Baker), who are employed by a millionaire socialite (Dennis Hopper) in this post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland where the remaining humans are barricaded from the hordes of hungry undead outside.  However, the zombies seem to be communicating and learning on a primative level, and are led by the hulking "Big Daddy" (Eugene Clark).  Things get even more complicated when the rightfully disatisfied, and ever politically uncorrect named, Cholo (John Leguizamo) ransoms the tank like vehicle "Dead Reckoning" (which was Romero's original title of the film) as the zombies close in for the kill.  While there had to be cuts in order for Land of the Dead to sustain it's R rating, there is still plenty of gruesome deaths and excellently designed makeup, courtesy of Greg Nicotero and co.  The cast does solid work, led by Baker, Leguizamo, and Hopper, along with Robert Joy as Riley's dim witted but faithful follower, and Asia Argento as a sometimes hooker who joins up with Riley's crew.  What hurts Land of the Dead the most is that Romero goes for the "cheap scare" routine more here than he ever did before in any of his other films.  Not to mention that there are a nice amount of plot holes, and the lack of character development (something which helped make the original Dawn of the Dead such a masterpiece) is quite lacking.  In the end though, Land of the Dead is pretty much everything that a Romero fan could hope for, and with cameos from Nicotero, FX legend Tom Savini, and Shaun of the Dead star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, this is a horror fan's delight.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Kaufman (Hopper) is a very wealthy man who owns a high-rise in zombie-free Pittsburgh called Fiddler's Green.  All the privlidged live there, while the rest live on the streets.  Riley (Baker) and Cholo (Leguizamo) are two of Kaufman's henchmen.  Their job is to journey outside the city and bring supplies back while avoiding the zombies.  They are two sides of the same coin, Riley wants to help people and Cholo wants to help himself.  Both manage to anger Kaufman though.  Riley saves a woman (Argento) from being thrown to the zombies, and Cholo's ambition marks him as a threat to Kaufman.<br /><br />Cholo steals Dead Reconing, a armored vehicle capable of doing some serious damage in the wrong hands, and Kaufman must ask Riley for help.  After all, Riley created Dead Reconing.  This involves leaving the city again to find Cholo.  Of course the zombies are not helpful as they stalk the living and find out that perhaps thay can get into the city after all.  All to this the beginnings of thought abongst the undead, and there is a whole lot of trouble brewing.<br /><br />This is the fourth zombie movie from George A. Romero, creater of "Night of the Living Dead".  Those with a fondness for zombie movies will not be disappointed, although I found it inferior to last year's "Dawn of the Dead" remake.  There are lots of zombies and clever deaths, and the story takes us down a somewhat new path in the zombie genre.  Dennis Hopper is great as the Trump-lik Kaufman, and he steals every scene that he is in.  The rest of the cast gets the job done, but they are nothing spectacular.<br /><br />"Land of the Dead" gives you exactly what you would expect, and perhaps a bit more.  There is some commentary on the world today, but not enough to interfere with a good old fashioned zombie movie.  I recommend to fans of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"George A. Romero's Land Of The Dead" is excellent! The directing and screenplay by Romero is excellent. George Romero, is back in the zombie genre that he created after 20 years. This is his first studio in 15 years. This time, Romero has made the zombies smarter and it, unfortunately, works. The cast led by Simon Baker, Dennis Hopper, John Leguizamo, and Asia Argento is excellent. The music by Reinhold Heil & Johnny Klimek is excellent. The cinematography by Miroslaw Baszak is excellent. The film editing by Michael Doherty is excellent. The casting by Marci Liroff is excellent. The production design by Arvinder Grewal is excellent. The art direction by Douglas Slater is excellent. The set decoration by Marlene Puritt is excellent. The costume design by Alex Kavanagh is excellent. The zombie make-up effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is excellent. This is one of the best zombie movies in recent history, which includes "28 Days Later" (2003) and last year's remake of Romero's "Dawn Of The Dead" (1979).</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Is it just me or do zombie movies get tiresome pretty fast? Same thing over and over again, such as, numerous headshots and feasting scenes. I respect George A. Romero and his films, but enough already with zombie flicks. Now as far as these "Dead" flicks go I would rank this one right at the top with Dawn of the Dead. I enjoyed the excess gore, the solid acting, and the great zombie makeup. I didn't really have much to complain about other than the fact that all these zombie films seem alike. Worth seeing if your a fan of the genre or want to see how the only person qualified to make a zombie picture still has the stuff when it comes to the genre he created with Night of the Living Dead.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>The movie was a really good effort and I would recommend it. The movie did cause me to jump out of my seat 2 times and I mean literally.  I mean, if you are a fan of these movies, you expect it, but these 2 still shocked me enough (even though I'm sort of shell shock having seen so many horror movies!)</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>Director George A. Romero's last film, Day of the Dead, was put out 20 years ago and since then fans have anxiously been awaiting the next chapter in his zombie saga. 2004's remake of Dawn of The Dead was enough to suffice our flesh-eating needs for the time being, but offered nothing new to the story. And now Romero returns to the silver screen with Land of the Dead, and although isn't bad for a zombie flick, it just feels like there should be something more to it. What has Romero been doing for the last twenty years? His time obviously wasn't completely spent working on this.<br /><br />I don't want to sound like I'm totally dissing on this movie because I'm not. There's a lot of interesting, fresh and new ideas that were put into Land of the Dead. What's different about "Land" that seperates it from the earlier films is that by this time, the zombie epidemic is now established, and people have found a way to live (but dangerously) in a world overrun with zombies, unlike the earlier films which covered the time when the zombies first started taking over the world and covered people's reactions to it. Another thing that's new is that by this time, the walking dead have started to develop early signs of emotion, the use of weapons, and the power of working together. They even learn to swim. Seeing all this was very cool, but I feel that most of these ideas weren't developed to their full potential. Maybe we'll see more of that in next film, hopefully before the next twenty years.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me about the film was it's rather anticlimactic ending. When the end credits rolled I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. It seemed the movie ended abruptly and left me feeling somewhat satisfied, but wanting so much more.<br /><br />So all in all, I do recommend seeing Land of the Dead because I've noticed very mixed reviews for this one, so it's hard to say if you'll like it or not. I, personally liked it and I'm sure when the DVD comes around I will have no choice but to buy it, but I feel like 20 years in the making, Land of the Dead should've offered just a little bit more, and I see it like lacking in the charisma that the earlier films had.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Oh, I get that this is really a metaphor about the working class getting back the wealthy and powerful who don't care how the other half lives.  It just isn't done very effectively. There is very little story and not much characterization either.<br /><br />The effects are truly grossly spectacular, though, especially when the zombies are chowing down on those still living.<br /><br />I recommend the remake of Dawn of the Dead and the original Night of the Living Dead, as well as Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead, if you really want to see a good zombie movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>After my second watching of the film I realized what was wrong. No purpose, nothing to think about. The apocalyptic aura wasn't there. Questions of interest were missing; how many outposts of survival are there?, do we still not know the cause?, is their any government left and what are they doing?, any militery anywhere? Etc.<br /><br />  The new zombie makeup was good at times but it looked too strained(figure that out). I understand the zombies have somewhat "evolved" but many of them moved too much like the living(even in gesture and emotion)to work for me. It's not a good idea at all to have a zombie acurately firing a gun of any kind. Big Daddy did nothing for me, because even in a far fetched zombie movietheir has to be some creepy believability. His makeup did not look real. Some totally decrepit zombies looked very mechanical(like a Halloween decoration). Sometimes the acting was decent, but wheres the interesting dialogue?. Regarding the plot, I think Romero got too caught up in trying to interject the Bush administration parallel(as he stated it was about)that he lost an opportunity at a better storyline. Every time I heard someone say," Get Dead Reckoning, I need Dead Reckoning" or something to that effect, I'd think that sounds so scripted.<br /><br />  I know pureists think it is sacreligious to say Dawn of the Dead 2004 was a better movie(which is beyond closeminded), but it was (except you don't have to be bit to become a zombie, just die). It was definetly filmed better. Romero created some moments in Land of the Dead(which is a terrible title) but you need more than gore to get an exciting and pondering horror flick. On this kind of movie, I can't go any deeper then that.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>First came the spotlighted Night where the pandemic began and where we saw the reactions of a microcosmic arena that spoke on the impact aimed at the greater human whole. Next came a beautifully-rendered overview of the contagion that crushed entire populations and the illusion they called safety, ultimately showing consumerism for what it was in the face of such a terrible tragedy and that caused people to second-guess the cost of shiny baubles while vacuum-sealed off in a consumerist mall Mecca. Next came the picture of desperation as a small group tried to accept how devastating an all-out plague could be while fighting to both find a cure for it and to understand it more aptly, with experimentation leading to our first glimpse of the not-as-monstrous Bub and how viewing zombies as less-than-terrible can turn spectators into monsters of their own. And now, in a world populated by walking teeth and pulses that are sometimes more horrible than the pulseless, we find ourselves in the aptly-titled Land of the Dead.<br /><br />In Land of the Dead we are looking at a community and the establishment of a hierarchical setting, where people still wait on other people and where currency in the form of protection and status still reigns supreme. We see the human condition in that, seeing how the world has changed and how it still remains polished and pampered and understandably contemptuous. You now have the establishment of a small city, complete with the totem of "have" and "not-so-much," and you see how the place is still powered. I liked the fact that the movie went into detail with specific things like this, showing how raiding small towns can be profitable and how fireworks can be just as powerful as a rocket launcher when looked at the right way. While many movies stop at the zombies and the search for the perfect cranial shot (and that is not necessarily a bad thing), these pieces of the overall portrait add a little something extra. And then there's the zombies and the questions that are asked about them.<br /><br />One of the things I REALLY enjoy about the Romero titles is that they take the time to ask questions instead of presenting a nightmare scenario and a sense of terror. While Romero said that some of these issues people point out in the beginning were actually accidents and that he never meant to become a spokesman on relevance hiding behind an undead mask, the movies themselves show how Romero explores different scenarios and how there is thought put into the "why" that most spectators eventually hope to ascertain. I really like the fact that the Dead movies did this and decided to look at the zombie and ask about their behavior, wondering what happens after the dead become something never encountered. I thought that Day of the Dead was where he really seemed to say that he had a feel for the human element and started digging deeply into the "what" of the zombie, distinguishing Romero from many people making undead films in the process. Land of the Dead goes that route as well, postulating about many things included in the zombie dossier that includes their attachment to particular places (as seen in Dawn of the Dead), their attachment to particular items (as seen throughout all the movies), how much of their behavior is an aftereffect triggered by some subconscious clue versus them actually trying to do things (like a zombie trying to understand a gas pump, zombies playing with musical instruments or picking up items like a gun and actually utilizing it), and many more subtle behaviors that are interesting when examined. I think that's the beauty of the Romero projects; he has been building on a foundation created in the first movie and we, as an audience, benefit from that because he doesn't create sequels. Sure, we see society unhinging more and more and we see the way the government falters and how it has band-aids in its stead. We also have the staples of undead films, violence and weapons and commentary on the human condition, but we also have something else that remarks a little on something that feels somewhat like a glimpse into the psychology of the undead. To me, that is a beautiful thing to watch.<br /><br />Different people have different opinions and some people hope for something that will be like the early additions to the Dead series when, in actuality, that could be a step sideways instead. I can understand the want for something of that caliber, and sometimes I think Romero is possibly a victim of his own name. Still, Land of the Dead is a great title and deserves the attention of the zombie lover. They walk slow, think slow, chew slow, and sometimes make the squeamish think about the reality of teeth and the slow grind being eaten by undead multitudes would amount to. I personally love that and the "sky flowers" and the enigma that is the undead mind, thinking the answers could come from no better source than the eye of the Romero himself. Given a chance I think that many others would add this into their collection, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The dead are mad as heck and aren't going to take it anymore! When we last caught up with George Romero's "Dead" films, "Day of the Dead" focused on the military trying to train the zombies for combat and experimenting on them. Romero takes the next step introduced into a world divided by the dead and the living each sharing space reluctantly with the other. That is until a gas station attendant zombie shows an inkling of intelligence and decides to go after the living in a sealed off skyscaper while those less fortunate live on the streets of the sealed off metropolis. Run by Kaufman (Dennis Hopper in perfect looney mode), the city is supplied by "employees" who can't live in the beautiful people's skyscraper. These scavengers led by Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo) pillage the landscape around them for essential items for the wealthy. Riley has a conscience decides he will no longer lead the crew of his "tank" Dead Reconkening and work for "the man" anymore. Cholo, on the other hand, keeps doing Kaufman's dirty work in hopes that he'll be able to buy his way into the wealthy paradise.<br /><br />As usual Romero has lots of gore but, more importantly, there's a sly political and satricial message at the heart of the movie. Romero who has been an independent filmmaker his whole life probably identifies with Riley and thinks of the film studios as Kaufman and his denizens. It's a much broader metaphor though as it can be used to look at the disappearing middle class and the disintegration of the class system in America. It's a fun ride with some of Romero's most accomplished filmmaking. Working with a budget of around $20 million Romero manages to do the same kind of work as was seen in the remake of his "Dawn of the Dead" last year. Interestingly, the more films Romero makes in his "Dead" series (and this probably going to be the last or at least next to last because of his age), the more milage he gets out of the inspiration for the entire saga--Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend" which was turned into the low budget horror movie "The Last Man on Earth" with Vincent Price (and the campy "The Omega Man" with Charleton Heston).<br /><br />Outstanding effects are nicely off set with strong performances by the cast including Asia Argento (daughter of Romero friend and Italian horror film director Dario Argento) as a former hooker named Slack who is almost fed to the "stenches" (as the city inhabitants refer to the rotting zombies)in a bizarre scene that satrizies "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome". Romero hasn't lost his touch and although this doesn't have quite the revolutionary punch of "Dawn of the Dead" or "Night of the Living Dead" it's an improvement on "Day of the Dead" as well as most of the horror films out there.<br /><br />The DVD has a very nice transfer and with the exception of an occasional bit of digital shimmer, the film looks as vibrant and alive as the bright red gushing blood. This is much more an action adventure movie than the previous films in the horror series and provides a nice bookend to the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" (even if it isn't related). Sound is pretty lively with a nice 5.1 and DTS mix that will have you looking over your shoulders for the undead.<br /><br />Extras include a lively commentary by "Dead" director Romero, producer Grunwald and editor Michael Doherty. There's also a number of featurettes on the making of the film but my personal favorite is "When Shawn Met George" about when Simon Pegg and Edgar White (star & writer and director * writer respectively) of the comedy/horror film "Shawn of the Dead" met Romero and appeared as extras in "Land of the Dead". We get to see how they're made into the undead and the first meeting between the three of them. "Undead Again" provides a glimpse into the making of the film. "Green Screen to Finished Screen" gives us before and after comparisons between the raw footage and the finished footage with optical effects. "Storyboards and Final Scenes" looks at the storyboards inserted as PIP with the finished product. "Scream Tests" opens with a very funny outtake featuring dancing zombies from the CGI footage for the film. "Scenes of Carnage" is pretty self explanatory. "Bits and Pieces" are scenes that were cut. Although none of the featurettes are quite as exhaustive as those provided as extras for the three disc set of the original "Dawn of the Dead". There's also some other extras including a behind-the-scenes "A Day with the Living Dead".<br /><br />Could "Dead" have been more? Sure. There were some missed opportunities here regarding the life in the tower but then that would have been a completely different movie. Romero's done a terrific job given the limitations of time and budget.  Deftly balancing satire, horror and humanism, Romero makes one of his best films in years. I'm hoping this does well at the box office so that Romero can get financing to continue to examine the post-stench world a bit more. Oh and it's a Romero rarity with an ending that's actually more upbeat than I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>We should have known that if George A. Romero was going to go back to the well of the living dead another time he was going to come up with something different. What "George A. Romero's Land of the Dead" (the director's name goes up top so you know this is not merely another remake of one of his zombie films, like last year's "Dawn of the Dead") offers is two variations on the familiar theme. The first is in this brave new world humanity has found a way of perpetuating the old divide between the "haves" and "haves not," even when there are all those zombies out there suggest it should now be "us" versus "them." Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) has set up Fiddler's Green, a luxury high rise on an island between a couple of rivers (think the location of Three River Stadium in Romero's old stomping ground of Pittsburgh even though the movie is shot in Toronto). There the "haves" live while the rest of the island has the "have nots," some of whom are hired as mercenaries to go out into the world and bring back "necessities." Apparently money still matters in the "Land of the Dead," or perhaps people are merely trying to hold on to the old way of life, because the poor are not listening to those advocating going and taking away from the rich.<br /><br />Consequently, humanity has found a way to survive. You can compare the more active approach of "Land of the Dead" with the mall rats of "Dawn of the Dead," who found a passive means of existence. Kaufman has built Dead Reckoning, a gigantic armored vehicle that leads foraging parties out into the world. These parties are led by Riley (Simon Baker), whose primary goal is getting everybody back alive, which does not always happen. That is because he works with Cholo (John Leguizamo), who has a different idea of necessities, one attuned to the fine tastes of Kaufman. Both men believe they are on their last mission at the start of this 2005 film, Riley because he will have now earned enough to pay for a car to get out of town and Cholo because he believes he has now earned the chance to move on up to Fiddler's Green. Both are wrong and that sets up the conflict to come.<br /><br />This is where the second variation comes into play. Kaufman not only created a high rise where the "haves" are protected from that "have nots," some of whom actually help the "haves" have even more, but the entire island is zombie proof. This forces Romero to change the zombie part of the equation, and so we are introduced to Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), who runs a gas station and has a moment akin to when the ape looks at the thigh bone in "2001: A Space Odyssey." Just to help us along the voice over at the start of the film warn us that if the zombies ever develop anything approaching rudimentary thinking skills that would be a bad thing, a very bad thing indeed. So, of course, that is what happens. After all, if you can have bad humans, then you can have good zombies (Joss Whedon has convinced me being dead does not make a character inherently bad).<br /><br />Having a zombie to root for is quite a different experience, but Romero also delivers on the guts and gore when the zombies go into their patented feeding frenzy. The narrative can offer all the sly social satire it wants, we watch these movies to be disgusted by the bloody scenes of cannibalism. The people Romero hires to do makeup and special effects are clearly on the cutting edge when it comes to this type of work. Even when you watch the DVD special features and you see what they are doing in bright light most of it will still creep you out, so the scenes in the film shot at night or in the shadows with the liberal application of blood and other things it is even worse (which is a good thing in a zombie movie).<br /><br />The bottom line is that Romero delivers just what his fans want with this movie so that there is not a problem with failing to meet expectations. No, "Land of the Dead" is not the best of the bunch, but for my money nothing will surpass the original "Night of the Living Dead." The important thing is that here we are four films into the series, limiting ourselves to just the Romero helmed ones, and the series is certainly going a lot strong than the other comparable horror series, all of which have been abandoned by their creators (which is either a cause or effect). Final Note: Look for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright of "Shaun of the Dead" fame as the photo booth zombies in one of the classic cameos of the early 21st century.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Well, ladies and gentleman, it's happened. The series has definetly tanked. This movie started out as a bunch of people, very few, who are left in the world as the dead have apparently inherited the earth. The rich live in mighty sky scrapers while the poverty stricken masses are huddled at the bases. Then, as if by some weak giveaway that they were running out of ideas, one character demands that he be let into the rich buildings or he'll blow them up. Not only that but he wants money. And a lot of it. Quick question: What's the point of asking for money when the dead have taken over the earth?!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I have rented out this movie last week..........thank god. The gore level is the highest I've encountered in some time and at the risk of offending the Fangoria subscribers, which are legion, is gratuitous beyond words. It's not that I was either offended or disgusted by anything I saw, but I was, however, taken aback by the excessiveness of it all. The clever dismemberment quotient was taken to an all time high, with everything from spring board heads tethered to the body by a strand of flesh, to the drawbridge decapitation, to the silhouetted arm given the human wish bone treatment, to the countless zombie crushing's all courtesy of Dead Reckoning, etc.<br /><br />At first it's nostalgic and one hour later it's just plain irritating. Something working in the film's favor is the idea of the evolution of the zombies from shuffling, mindless, eating machines, to beings with a sense of recall and memory and developing motor skills and something working against it was the lead zombie's constant howling-as-command; that was a royal misstep and in the end only manages to detract.<br /><br />Nevertheless, in the hands of a lesser experienced (and talented) director, that could have proven to be a death trap, but Mr. Romero's talents (the aforementioned howling not-with-standing) keeps it reigned in pretty tightly and doesn't allow it to become a parody of itself. Dennis Hopper is his usual wooden self (the man is incapable of registering any emotion) and the rest of the cast was seemingly into the fun of it all, especially John Leguizamo. Simon Baker was somewhat detached, but he is, after all, playing the ultimate cynic and self-preservationist. Ms. Argento, however, left me cold, alas and no amount of cleavage and tattoos can make her believable as hooker turned zombie hunter.<br /><br />The premise of the film, as a whole sort of works and the sum is, ultimately greater than its parts but it felt so restrain and needed to be more fleshed out. The characters could have elevated the film into the Romero zombie franchise. Being that this particular film was awful George Romero will still maintain his many fans others might not understand why but horror buffs will.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>George Romaro returns to his core as the true zombie director, though he changes his style a little bit, his directoral skills are still apparent as he makes a very un-scary but fun bloodfest, I got a kick out of John Leguizamo being one of the stars and watching him be in something thats not unrelentlessly serious (Romeo & Juilet, Summer Of Sam & Moulin Rouge), Romaro still writes some pretty cool dialouge as well as shows that he has a few fun ideas up his sleeves after all, I wouldnt say I was impressed just because it is by far the  worst installment of Zombie series that he has created (which is really not saying alot).<br /><br />For Some reason I cant stop looking at "Land Of The Dead" as some what of a parody of the films that he has created before. I have to admitt that one of my favorite parts of his zombie movies overall is that the humans have to outsmart the zombies, not beat them through brute strength, so of course I really dont like that in this film the zombies's had reasoning power and even somewhat of a brain. oh well this film is good for a laugh or two and I would recommend it to Romaro fans even though the film is very different from his others, not to shabby<br /><br />Grade: C</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>The latest thing in zombie stories and movies is to have them thinking.  Stephen King, Brian Keene, and George Romero are all on board.  You can practically see the reeking dead studying their thumbs like chimpanzees who have suddenly figured it all out.  Well, that's cool.  Romero's turning however indicates the real stamp of approval.  As horror buffs know everywhere, his "Night of the Living Dead" is an enduring classic. And it's a classic for good reason, with its underlying satire of American life in the 60s. The irony of the one real hero in the movie, a black man, being gunned down by rednecks, struck a chord that rippled beyond the genre of horror.<br /><br />Romero followed up with "Dawn of the Dead", which was also pretty good.  It didn't have quite the punch of "Night", but it had a bigger budget, and the zombies attacking the local shopping mall was funny - in a way that "Night" was not.  We recognized ourselves stumbling past all the shops with glazed eyes.  Then came "Day of the Dead" which was simply bad - and boring.<br /><br />Zombies kind of went into hibernation, or retreated into all kinds of forgettable horror movies - some of them made by Disney.  They were becoming poodles.  Then came Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of "Dawn of the Dead." But Snyder did something different.  He looked underneath the zombie hood, and tweaked things, added fuel injection.  Suddenly zombies were track stars.  They could move and munch.  As good as Snyder's effort was (and it's very good), at its heart, "Dawn" is an homage to Romero.  There is nothing really new in the film as far as new satire goes.  It's still a mall, a reference point for the Dead.  One difference, is that Snyder actually went out and got some good actors to "flesh" things out a bit.<br /><br />Well, it's 2005, and Romero still has something to say through rotting zombie gums.  "Land of the Dead", because of its sharp satire, is indeed a worthy update on "Night."  Time has indeed passed.  The rich live in towers (vertical gated communities), while the little folk are serving them below as soldiers and servants - or, are zombies living in small towns, being ripped off by marauding survivors in night attacks.  Romero returns to his black man as hero, but with a twist - since he is now a zombie (Eugene Clark as "Big Daddy").  And Big Daddy is an interesting twist, in that he seems to be learning how to fight - and teaching others, the Way to fight back.  He actually cares, in that cold dead zombie brain, about his community.  Big Daddy tries to save other zombies, and he cries in rage when they are killed.  In contrast, his counterpart, Kaufman (Dennis Hopper --Romero also assembled himself a good cast for this latest installment), in his high tower overlooking his safe area, could care less about his community.  All he cares about is money and power - and a good cigar.  Romero's critique of modern America, with its widening gulf between rich and poor (what used to be middle class), couldn't be more on target.  What follows is what you pretty much expect: extreme gore, the march of the inexorable dead, some funny moments, and a strangely hopeful ending - for perhaps men and zombies?  Well, I guess we will just have to wait and see.</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>I like Land Of The Dead and also I like the Urated Director's Cut, too. However, this is Romero's weakest story of his Dead Saga. The story was good, but not a masterpiece like his last 3 Dead films. Big Daddy {Clark} is a cool character, but Bub from Day Of THe Dead was a better character.<br /><br />This film didn't end like a Romero film, to me, the ending was weak, but I'm not gonna say for those who didn't see it.<br /><br />But, I do like a lot of the characters in this films. The action and gore scenes are definitley cool. And like I said, the story is good, it's just weak compare to the other Dead films.<br /><br />If this was done by another director, it would be a more than very good. But, this is Romero's work, and it's kinda weak for his style. It is worth buying and it's very good to watch many times over.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>George A. Romero is back doing what he does best! Directing Zombie flicks! This is my 3rd favorite. The zombies have evolved and have become smarter since the outbreak in the original. The poor people are living on the streets and fighting back against the zombies. The rich and powerful people live in a huge skyscraper called Fiddler's Green. Mr. Kaufman is the main boss who has extreme power over everyone. Riley, Charlie, and Cholo take a huge tank called Dead Reckoning and kill zombies and raid towns for supplies. When Cholo wants a room in Fiddler's Green and Kaufman turns him down, Cholo and his team steal Dead Reckoning while zombies are taking over the town. Kaufman asks Riley to get Dead Reckoning back. Riley, Charlie, Slack, and Pillbury retreive Dead Reckoning with no intentions of giving it back to Kaufman. The zombies start eating the townspeople, showing some awesome zombie gore! If you love zombie flicks, and George A. Romero, you'll love LAND OF THE DEAD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>After the events of "Day of the Dead", a community of humans live in a secured city where they are safe from the zombies outside. The ruler of the city who is a wealthy and greedy tycoon named Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) wants to have control of the city to himself with the upper class citizens in nice buildings and poor people on the streets, two renagades named Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizomo) with a team and two friends Slack (Asia Argento) and Charlie (Robert Joy) would sometimes go outside the city for survivors and destroy zombies but unknown to them, the living dead are evolving and might have a plan to get into the city.<br /><br />After years of rumors of a 4th entry in the Living Dead series, George A. Romero finally delivers a spectacular, entertaining and gory as hell entry that might surpise fans of the trilogy. Too bad it didn't too well at the box-office, luckily i saw this at a theater and loved it! it's got new life on DVD and cable even among some fans of Romero's zombie series. Tom Savini does an amusing cameo as the blade biker from "Dawn of the Dead" (1978) and this movie is loaded with gore but more in the unrated cut, it's good bloody fun for zombie fans that i recommend.<br /><br />The Unrated DVD contains more violence then the theatrical cut and good extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, storyboard comparision, music video, and 6 featurettes.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie, and I eagerly waited for it when I heard that Romero was getting another chance at the genre he created.  The movie is good, but not all I would have hoped it could be.  Since it has been so long between dead movies, I was hoping for more to the story.  It certainly has promise, but doesn't feel completely fleshed out.  If rumors are true, and this is part of a new trilogy, I may have to update my review.  Right now, it didn't leave me completely satisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>All three of the previous Romero "Dead" flicks offered something interesting and unique, and in this regard Land of the Dead succeeds.  A lot of interesting ideas are put onto the screen, but ultimately the movie doesn't end up being terribly memorable.  By no means is this a poor film, but it lacks dynamic and has more in common with the Dawn of the Dead remake than any of the original Romero films.  The characterization, so integral to the enjoyability of Night, Dawn, and Day, has been to some degree short-changed.  Dennis Hopper's tyrant is enjoyable enough, Asia Argento is tough enough, and Jason Riley is stolid enough, but the audience never really gets in under the proverbial skin of their characters.  Again, mediocre but not exceptional.  One could argue that humans are not the point of Romero's movies, zombies are, but that wouldn't be quite true: all the "dead" movies are about how the humans react to the rising of the dead, and characterization is essential.  The undead are quite good, and I liked how they united under the leadership of one exceptional zombie to invade the human compound.  The organization of the city was good, the class conflict handled reasonably well, the acting competant and the special effects/makeup superlative.  However, the lack of characterization coupled with a subpar ending (although in fairness "Day's" ending wasn't spectacular either) make this a two and a half star effort in opposed to a three.  **1/2</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>Romero fans and zombie fans will probably be torn into at least two camps in regards to how they liked Romero's latest zombie epic.  Particularly, I think the turning point will be the fact that, as has been spoiled by numerous sources, the zombies are evolving.  But this has at least been subtly hinted at before because in Day of the Dead you not only had a zombie that could think but it was one that could speak as well.  Personally, I think the idea of "evolution" is an interesting and good step in the right direction.<br /><br />But the best part of this movie, besides all of the fun gore and scares, is the fact that even today Romero has kept a firm grasp on his satiric style.  In Land of the Dead, the rich elite live in a tall ivory tower called Fiddler's Green, a bastion of light and beauty in an otherwise decimated world.  Commercials tell the poor and destitute people living the streets outside of Fiddler Green that this is the place to live.  The commercials are like the carrot on a stick concept, held there to entice the citizens into doing things for the rich elite on the offchance that maybe, just maybe, they too can become one of the elite.<br /><br />This concept is taken much further, however, as you have the concept of money still alive.  Truly, in a society as decimated as theirs, what good is the green stuff?  But, they still hold onto it as if their society were what it used to be.  Scenes of people window shopping inside Fiddler's Green, the elite living as if the world outside wasn't dead, and Dennis Hopper's Kaupfman saying lines like "we don't negotiate with terrorists" just compound the satire.  It's fantastic and as satiric as Romero's earlier works.<br /><br />Also in keeping with Romero's earlier works, the zombies retain a portion of what they used to be in life.  It's as if they are trying to be human again.  Just like in Dawn of the Dead, and the zombies who stalk the malls, the zombies in Land of the Dead are all questing to find that human quality.  In fact, it's kinda humorous that the zombies start marching on Fiddler's Green as if they too want to join the elite in it's Ivory Castle.<br /><br />One reviewer here has commented that the movie doesn't look "as sharp" as some of the latest zombie movies and that the way it looks is from long ago.  Romero has always been an independent type director.  This movie is his most expensive film, granted, but in today's society of $100-200 million dollar movies, Land of the Dead cost only 15-20 million.<br /><br />What us zombie fans have come for though, is of course the zombies.  Again, Romero did not fail as he has created zombies with character.  From the zombie band desperately trying to play their instruments, to the gas station zombie who is the first to evolve, all have more character than seen in the majority of zombie films.  My personal favorite is the nearly headless zombie.  You'll know what I mean when you see him.<br /><br />Basically, this is Romero at the top of his game in my opinion.  It isn't as gory as the Dawn of the Dead remake, nor is it as scary or intense as some of the zombie movies out.  But, what it might lack in scares, it makes up for in intent.  As far as that goes, Romero is still the king.  Here's hoping it sells well so they make the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>The gore comes in many, disturbing, enticing, entertaining ways: More thrill scenes than I can count from memory. It does tread down that boring road of exploring zombies, who deny the belief that the walking undead is unthinking (come on, give me a break, who gives a crap!) I wanted more of a message about todays twisted politics. By the way, he did attempt to have a back story, with that of the rich above and the poor below*cliche. Hooper was miscasted as the corrupt leader, shouldn't we have a man beaming with power and authority, not the causual "zombies, they freak me out" guy? I couldn't care less what happened to anyone in this movie, so when their lives came were at risk, I was like, "Ho hum, okay okay, next." But it is a movie you have to see for yourself, I'm not attempting to drive away sales from this movie, especially since Romero is the one who "created" this genre. I have a deep respect for his trilogy, and I would hate for this to be his last film. But, on the other hand, enough with the "raaahr", zombies(thinking).</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>.....and thats it. It was'nt spectacular or nothing amazing, not even great, but it was good. I am a big fan of Zombie movies and have 40 or so on DVD, so I would consider my judgement pretty solid. Having the original Night Of The Living Dead, dawn of the dead ( the Original) plus the 4 disc box set, day of the dead ( 2 disc edition) and the new crappy/garbage Dawn Of The Dead ( not done by Romero ). I am a fan of Romero Zombie flicks. I would like to do as best as I can and go threw detail about what ever I can.<br /><br />The Acting- Well for 15 Mill you kow what your getting, ofcourse its good.<br /><br />The Gore- Was definitly there and I was definitly happy, if not for a worlld wide release probably would have been bloodier. Also like the fact that they show the Zombies feasting on people plenty of times. Which is what Zombie flicks these days forget to do ( EX. 28 days later and Dawn Of The Dead 2004 ).Thats what really makes the Zombie a Zombie.<br /><br />The Scenery- Well done. This whole movie takes place at night which I love. To make a Zombie movie, the only way is to do it at night. The scenery is pretty creepy. the way they divide the land is also well done kind of like the zombies on one side and  the other community of people. You are Either rich( high Class) or poor ( low class )no inbetween.<br /><br />Spcl FX- They are excellent, my personal favorite is the girl in the soccer jersey, she plays an excellent Zombie make up and acting, she does great, the Butcher is also good. Big Daddy's make up is horrible. He dont even look like a Zombie except for some rotted teeth. but overall the Fx are excellent the Zombies all look good the gore fx are all good and to an extent very real looking.I dont know who did the effects, I thought it was KNB but when reading the credits it says Greg Nicotero , so im not sure either way the effects are top notch, besides a couple animated parts.<br /><br />BIG DADDY -  The most annnoying , all he does is grunt moan and cry, yes cry in his own way. He walks like a person, acts like a person and doesnt even look like a Zombie. My girlfirend and i were watching and after seeing hima couple times she was like " he dont even semm like aZombie, and that he is annnoying ", which besides her and me plenty of people think so, read the reviews. he is I guess you could say the leader and genius of the bunch.<br /><br />Zombies_- NO THEY DONT RUN, THANK GOD. They are not as slow as the orignal Zombies, but still are very slow but can move slightly better. Now what is pretty cool is the idea that these Zombies are starting to understand how to do thinnks at a real level that they are getting intellegent after being around so long, watching and learning. Makes it a but more challenging for the people that live in the city.<br /><br />The plot- Very good and solid like th idea's that Romero has and uses. Does a great job.<br /><br />Directing and Editing- is all done great also no complaints.<br /><br />The Ending- Well I wont spoil it and say what happens, all i know is there will most likely be another part, probably called "World of the dead"or maybe even just "Dead Reckoning" and I say Dead Reckoning because the way the movie ends , when you see you will understand. Basically one of the last lines of the movie made by Riley is pretty silly and i was just not really understanding why he did what he did, but overall not a bad ending I think it should have been a bit different or maybe better but it was still ok.<br /><br />  Basically Horror movies in general have changed these days. Its hard to find a real good one. The new generations are coming up and in much of a sense things have to be made to appeal to the newer set of fans while occasinallly not forgetting about the old school fans of 70's and 80's horror like myself. While IMO horror was at its best, as soon as the 1968 NOTLD was made that opened doors for everything and everyone. And with no question marks Romero does satisy everyone , I know i was satisfied.<br /><br />Its a movie well worth to see and when it comes out on DVD I will own it becuase it is a Romero Zombie flick, and will have to complete my set, plus dont get me wrong definitley worth the buy and the money for me atleast. If you are a die hard fan of Zombie flciks and have seen them all( from Romero to Fulci etc...) basically you will understand and appreciate where Romero is coming from and what his ideas are. and they are definitly good. I still love the stupid mindless slow moving human/flesh eating Zombies ,but times are changing so must everything else. Go see "Land of the Dead"  you should enjoy it, I did.<br /><br />This is the longest review i ever written.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>By no means is Land of the Dead classic. Dawn of the Dead made you care about the characters so much, yet Land of the Dead never really makes you love the characters. The main character, Simon Baker, looks good for the part. He does an okay job. His weird sidekick does an okay job as well, yet his part seems unnecessary. Asia Argento seems to try a little too hard to be a tomboy. John Leguizamo does a good job, and he seems to be the only character I cared about by the end. Dennis Hopper does a great job.<br /><br />The script is about all these people living on an island. They try to coexist, yet unfortunately some social unrest makes every angry. John Leguizamo decides to take action, and the rest is the plot of the movie. The weird thing about the script is the fact that the zombies now have the ability to do much more than before. One of the zombies develops the mental capacity to work a gun, much like Bub did in Day of the Dead. That same zombie has the power to lead the people into the city. Other zombies have the power to hide perfectly, and then jump out unexpectedly. You would think that the zombie would just strike when he sees the person, but for some reason they wait.<br /><br />I wouldn't say the movie is great, but it definetly has some fun parts. The violence is brutal in the uncut version. It is by far the most brutal yet. People's corpses get mangled into pieces, and it happens often. If you can handle it, it's good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I love zombies.  I own Resident Evil 2 and 3 for my Sony Playstation, and now I've grown to love zombie movies as well.<br /><br />Land of the Dead is a pretty good zombie movie.  It's graphic, bloody, and creative in that people turn into zombies and die differently each time.  However, there was actually very little bits showing people turn into zombies, which is a negative.  The story was more about, if a zombie bites you, you have to be killed immediately.  If they would have shown more people turning into brain dead, moaning zombies, it would have appealed to me more.<br /><br />The unusual thing about Land of the Dead is how the zombies actually walk around with a spark of intelligence and continue to act almost human-like.  Maybe that has something to do with bad acting, though.  If you can't moan like a zombie, get off the stage.<br /><br />The film started out slow.  It just didn't start out like a very convincing zombie film.  That all changed about halfway through, when the people were on the run.  This is when the zombie outbreak got incredibly intense.  It's worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I've seen all of George A. Romero's zombie movies, starting with Night of the Living Dead (NOTLD), and found them a little boring.  To be fair, this is because everyone's been ripping off Night of the Living Dead since he created NOTLD, so what appears to be tired zombie fare to my jaded eyes is actually what Romero started.<br /><br />Zombies in Night of the Living Dead are slow, shambling, recently dead people.  There are no running zombies here.  They can spread their contagion with a bite. The only way to stop them is by blowing their brains out (or stabbing them in the brain, or setting their brains on fire, you get the idea).  This traditional zombie trope has been done to death (pun intended), such that it's become a bit difficult to take slow moving zombies seriously.<br /><br />Zombies were originally conceived as allegories first, horror monsters second.  The strength of Night of the Living Dead wasn't just the terror of cannibalistic strangers assaulting a home; it was the threat of the unwashed masses overwhelming the middle class.  The zombies in Romero's movies are slow, but they are relentless, and their numbers are legion.  Never mind that you can outrun them...eventually, they will catch up to you. Who's worse: the zombies outside or the people who will do anything to survive on the inside?  We know Romero's answer.<br /><br />This class warfare was further explored in Dawn of the Dead, where we had the comedic "shopping zombies."  The film established that zombies struggle to recapture their old life, shambling aimlessly about in shopping malls...sort of like what they did when they were alive anyway.  Dawn of the Dead posited: Are zombies any different from uninvolved and unaware living citizens?  We know Romero's answer.<br /><br />By Day of the Dead, we had the other side of the coin.  The previous films followed the travails of pockets of civilization and their struggle for survival.  In Day of the Dead, humanity's last hope is sequestered in a military installation.  There, scientists struggle to discover a cure, wage a philosophical (and sometimes physical) battle.  We're also introduced to Bub, a zombie who can learn.  Can the lower classes become better through education? We know Romero's answer.<br /><br />Land of the Dead is the fourth movie in the series, and this time there's far less claustrophobia.  Whereas the first three movies centered on human protagonists holing up in a farmhouse, mall, or military base, the humans in Land of the Dead live in a city.  And this city has the full range of human triumph and misery, from its slums to a glittering tower known as Fiddler's Green. Lorded over by Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), it's a microcosm of society: white socialites in suits dine at the top of the tower while the poor mingle in all manner of vices, many of them supported by an easy supply of non-humans: the zombies.<br /><br />But even the most powerful city has to be powered somehow, and ruthless scavengers (who drive an armored tank known as Dead Reckoning) stock Fiddler's Green.  This miracle of modern technology has a front-mounted gatling gun, missile launchers, nightvision, and armor plating.  It's just what you'd want if you were fighting zombies.  Riley (Simon Baker...wait, not that Simon Baker) lead his team, along with his cheeky second in command, Cholo (John Leguizamo).  Charlie (Robert Joy), who is mentally disabled and disfigured, follows Riley around like a puppy.  He also happens to be a crack shot.  There's also an ex-hooker named Slack (Asia Argento) who provides an audience point of view to the whole situation, but seems primarily to be there as a thank you to her infamous horror movie producer father, Dario Argento.<br /><br />The opening scene, wherein Riley and Cholo demonstrate different interpretations of the term "critical supplies," sums up the movie's ethos very quickly.  Cholo thinks booze and smokes are critical because they might gain him some influence with Kaufman, maybe even letting the mercenary move into Fiddler's Green.  Conversely, Riley wants to get antibiotics for the sick child of his friend.  Both men believe it will be their last mission amongst the "stenchers," the phrase the humans use for the zombies.<br /><br />But there's more to the zombies than meets the eye. A former gas station attendant turned zombie, Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), is a "zombie lord" of sorts.  He is self-aware and capable of learning, just like Bub.  He remembers parts of his old life and, more importantly, sympathizes with his zombie brethren.  When they are wounded, he is outraged.  Most frightening of all, Big Daddy can teach the other zombies what he knows.  It doesn't take long before he leads a zombie rebellion-straight towards Fiddler's Green.<br /><br />When Cholo discovers that his boss will never give him a place in Fiddler's Green, no matter how many troublemakers he murders (along with the zombies), things turn ugly.  Cholo steals Dead Reckoning and drives off with the intent of holding the city hostage until he gets enough money to start his own city.  Ironically, Riley has the same plans, but discovers his car is stolen...because Kaufman wants him to stay.  Kaufman then promises Riley his freedom if he steals Dead Reckoning back before Cholo blows up the whole city.<br /><br />Land of the Dead is surprisingly engaging; it's probably the first pro-zombie movie ever, casting the undead as sympathetic, pathetic, and clearly underclass: they are butchers, musicians, and yes, gas station attendants.  And as the zombies become more self aware, they lust for what the humans already have...more than just flesh, but their homes.  At first, fireworks awe the stenchers.  But eventually, even that is not enough to preoccupy them.<br /><br />Romero knows his zombies well and films them in all their alternately gory, comedic and yes sometimes-beautiful glory.  We watch zombies from a God's-eye view, when they look only like everyday citizens, wandering about.  We see zombie and anguished citizens alike in a writhing pile of corpses and teeth.  Everywhere, Romero never lets us forgot that if you squint your eyes just enough, a zombie looks just like a person.  And if you can confuse the two, maybe things aren't so black and white as life and death, "living" and "stencher."<br /><br />The parallels to modern day are a bit more subtle than say, Revenge of the Sith.  But they're still there.  Kaufman "refuses to negotiate with terrorists." The zombie life seems almost idyllic before the tank-like Dead Reckoning invades from Fiddler's Green, blowing the zombie-citizens to smithereens. It becomes rapidly apparent that Romero wants us to see the zombies not just as undead foils or evil monsters, but as people. And if they are capable of thought, then do the supposedly civilized humans have the right to shoot them in the head and take their resources?<br /><br />We know Romero's answer.<br /><br />Land of the Dead is a traditional zombie film with a lot to say.  Kids accustomed to the 2004 Dawn of the Dead-speed of horror will undoubtedly be disappointed.  But for adults who want a bit more from zombies than just dead people, Land of the Dead is lively indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I'm not into the zombie craze, but I usually enjoy watching the movies. Return of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead (both the original and the remake), and Shaun of the Dead are always great to watch straight through. Land of the Dead, not so much. Boy, was I disappointed by George A. Romero's latest work. There is plenty of good ol' zombie gore, but that's the only interesting aspect of the entire production. In my opinion, this has to be the weakest zombie movie by the grandmaster of all zombie flicks. The political undertones are really out of place in the midst of all the blood and guts. The characters are not interesting enough for me to care about (except Charlie and Cholo). The music was pretty good, but not very memorable. I did like the cinematography, as well as the gore (congratulations to the makeup department). In the end, I guess I didn't really hate the film, but I didn't like it, either. Land of the Dead is one that I didn't really enjoy watching, but thankfully it isn't really that terrible.<br /><br />Grade: D+</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>I've got two reviews, Soldier. You can smoke 'em if you got 'em while you read:<br /><br />REVIEW#1: Is the "Zombies-crashing-through-the-barricades-haul-your-a**-into the Dead Reckoning NOW, Soldier!" version. "Land of the Dead" is some seriously bent, proudly trashy, flamboyantly bloodthirsty good times---nothing profound, not a zombie epic, perhaps---but it's like a big, juicy steak. If you like a nice saucy side of carnage with your Zombie Apocalypse, you've come to the right place, pardner. Chow down!<br /><br />REVIEW#2: This one assumes you've barricaded the gun-shop and you've got some good hunkering-down time.<br /><br />Alright, think about this one: the Zombie Apocalypse has arrived. Maybe it was some green goo that hitched a ride on the new Neptune XIII probe that just crashed to Earth.<br /><br />Or maybe it was some weird cosmic dust that passed through the atmosphere; or maybe it was a biochemical spill the Military didn't quite cover *all* the way up. Maybe, just maybe, some wild-eyed eco-freaks got a little too rowdy in the Monkey House section of the local Super-Dooper-Secret Biowarfare Research Laboratory.<br /><br />Maybe, even, there's just no more room in Hell. And, well, you know the rest.<br /><br />Who really cares about Cause, when the Effects are shambling all over town, trying to take a chunk out of your hide when all you want is a little peace, a little quiet, maybe a halfway decent smoke break.<br /><br />So anyway, you're a total uber-bada**, let's say, or maybe a survivalist, or you're just packing heat and keeping a cool head when things go south and the Dead Rise and start looking for some truly 100% American ground beef. You rally some bikers and soldiers and street thugs and seriously scared civvies to your side, you build up an arsenal (the Zombies aren't gonna use shotguns and M-16s, anyway), and you clear out some space. Make a safe zone.<br /><br />Soon you begin to realize it might be a juicy idea, once you've got some breathing room, to fortify central Pittsburgh, barricade the bridges, trip-wire the whole area, spike with some guard towers, and settle down.<br /><br />And when the smoke clears, you and your main Posse---the guys with you from the start, or maybe just the really scary critters---you start thinking: Hey, we made this place. We've got a little fortified City. As for Law & Order---well, the Constitution, the President of the USA, even the old US of A herself---all that has gone the way of the Dodo & the T-Rex.<br /><br />You're the Law, the Big Kahuna, the A-Number One. You set up your digs in the most lavish downtown skyscraper you can seize, fortify it, trade in the kevlar and camo for some Armani suits, and dispatch the peasants (all the scared normal folk who don't want to be eaten, ie, outside Fortress Pittsburgh) to the dead zone to bring back food, booze, guns, and cigars.<br /><br />As for your Living Large skyscraper---Fiddler's Green---, whaddya do? You do what any power-hungry dictator would do, given half a chance: you Charge Admission.<br /><br />That, zombie-hounds, is the guts and glory of "Land of the Dead", the blood-and-guts return of the Grandmaster of the Zombie Splatter Spectacular, George Romero. It's a wild world of Haves & Have-Nots, but this time the Rich *are* just like us. They're still human; the Have-Nots, on the other hand, just want some flesh for chow. So yeah, it's very Biblical: the Meek have inherited the Earth, along with a very nasty appetite.<br /><br />Throw in evolving zombies, a not-so-subtle post-9/11 subtext, bottle-rocket pacing, a storehouse of quotable quotes (from Dennis Hopper's "Zombies..they give me the Creeps, Man" to the hulking Manolete's "So let's DOOOOO some-THEENG"), a scantily clad Asia Argento in a cage with two really hungry zombies, and a class-clambering John Leguizamo and a full-bore rampaging Dennis Hopper---and you've got good times.<br /><br />It's too short by far, and it could have reached for more---but Romero has conjured up a brazen, bloody, irreverent, wantonly trashy, and totally politically incorrect helluva ride.<br /><br />This one is way overdue.

However I really tried to take this movie seriously, but instead than scare me it made me laugh at times. This film is basically a campy b-movie with average FX and no characters charisma. Overall: FAIR</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>Y'know, to read some of these reviews, you'd think you're in a film class somewhere, discussing theme in Greed or Citizen Kane. People: it's a zombie flick! If the pontificatiors would take the time to really learn about George Romero, they'd realize he'd be laughing like hell at all the analysis people attempt on his Dead films; they try tp pull them apart like the zombies pull apart some victims. Watch the extras, for God's sake.<br /><br />Yes, there's no doubt Romero injects social commentary in all his films, but especially the Living Dead series. He admits it readily and also explains that he never attempts to make it obscure or hidden, but totally accessible to anyone open to catching it.That's part of the beauty of the whole Dead series; they're simplistic horror films with some wicked comedic twists on one level, politico-socio comment on another. And unlike so many art-film wannabes, both levels are right out there; no digging necessary at all.<br /><br />While Land, granted, isn't equal to George's Dawn (the remake may have had a good cast and interesting new elements, but it still paled next to the original)or the film Day was initially intended to be, it's still an enjoyable romp that has the master's hand all over it, and that proves that the inventor of the genre is still it's best interpreter. And despite the Dawn remake and 28 Days' super-speed zombies, George proves again that the original official ghoul shuffle is still the best and most effective.<br /><br />Bottom line: don't try to dissect this. Just enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>George Romero returns to his living dead zombie world.  The film opens well after the advent of the Zombies.  A section of city bordered by rivers has been walled off from the hungry corpses.  But in this haven there is a vast class distinction with the upper crust living in the towering Fiddler's Green while the rest are in squalor.  [...]  With the survival of the living hanging in the balance and power slipping into the wrong hands the story really works.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, you will probably like this one.  The gore factor is high but not as blatant as in some movies of this ilk.  It is an odd movie because you find yourself wanting the thinking zombie to continue to solve problems.  I don't know if it is because it means that death and zombiedom might not be final or what, but it is a strange feeling.  Good acting by the cast also helps the movie succeed.  All in all I had a fun time watching it and was surprised at how good it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>This is an unnecessary movie really. It beats me why Romero felt like making another zombiemovie after I watched it. The story line of the dead picking up some human tricks like shooting guns looks very silly. I think last year's remake of Dawn of the dead should have been a nice conclusion of the zombiemovies for the next 10 years. This movie isn't even scary anymore...it is like watching an action movie with zombies. Was this Romero's attempt to show everyone he still can make a better zombiemovie then any other director? If so, he shouldn't have bothered. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>Finally, I ran across a film that is a true account of everyday life that shows zombies wandering the Earth.  Some Zombies are screaming about global warming, while others listen to junk bands like modest mouse.  Others even think that movies like crackback fountain are true.  George Clooney should be in this film because he is perhaps on of the best zombies to ever walk the earth in the last 20th century.  This film has Dennis Hopper in it, and we know he is not a zombie, so it is nice to see a human playing the role of a human.<br /><br />The movie is a wonderful showing of how the zombies that wander this planet continue to rule it.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>George A. Romero's 4th addition to the DEAD saga "LAND OF THE DEAD" turned out to be everything i expected it to be "A DAMN GOOD ZOMBIE FLICK" plenty of blood & gore,some sly & sarcastic pokes at the modern day hollow human culture & plenty more blood & gore! Thats all i expected & the zombie maestro delivered & then some!</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>I've seen it twice now and the first time I saw it as a Romero-fanboy. The second time it was with a more critical eye. I have to say that overall the film succeeds in what Romero was trying to accomplish. This is especially true in the fact that the film was his very first studio-financed zombie film. That shows in the overall look and pace of the film. I can't fault Romero for that since it allowed him to make the film when no one else would dare touch him with a 100-foot pole. The uncut and unrated DVD will probably show the definitive Land of the Dead, but as a theatrical studio film this fourth entry in the Dead series succeeds more than it failed.<br /><br />First, the gore-factor in the film is more than I thought the MPAA would have allowed Romero, Nicotero and the boys at KNB FX would get away with. I think I can see where a few Romero-fans would have been disappointed in terms of what was showed after Romero's last two: Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. Those two films raised the bar in terms of gore and splatter on the screen. This is especially true with Day of the Dead. But for an R-rated film Land of the Dead matches and surpasses what Saving Private Ryan showed in terms of on-screen carnage. The second time I saw the film I could tell where Romero had to pan or cut away before the gore became too over-the-top. Another trick I saw him do was (which I was prepared to look for after Greg Nicotero's AICN interview) was to have zombies walk across the scene in front of a feeding frenzy to minimize some of the effect. I am anxious to see what they cut-out to gain the R how it'll fit with the overall look and feel of the film when its put back for the DVD.<br /><br />Second, the story itself is typical Romero in that it was a reflection of what he sees going on in the world at this moment, but with zombies to complicate things. To say that Romero is not a huge fan of the current administration is an understatement. Right from the beginning Land of the Dead is a commentary on Bush and company's approach on the War on Terror. Romero also uses the film as a way to point out the widening gap between the class structure in the United States. He's pretty much sledgehammer-like in his commentary. There's Kaufmann and his elite caste (which seemed to be white and affluent) living their life as if the zombie apocalypse that forced them into Fiddler's Green never occurred. Then you have the other castes which includes not just the grunts who are doing the dirty and dangerous jobs to keep everyone at the Green provided and satisfied, but the people who are deemed not Green-type: people who do not have the wealth and correct racial make-up. Then to complicate things there's an even larger caste just waiting to come in just beyond the electrified and guarded fence and the riverbanks. Romero's a child of the 60's revolutionary movement and his past zombie films' message points this out. This time around it comes out with less subtlety but with more force as if Romero knows that his kind of filmmaker are a dying breed and that this may be one of the last times he can send his message across through his film.<br /><br />Finally, we come to the characters and most especially the zombies themselves. The zombie make-up effects done by Greg and KNB are to-notch and raises the bar on make-up effects overall. The zombies they've come up with look like what zombie would look if they've been moving around for years out in the elements. A few seem to have a much intact and less decayed look while some look to be more like walking, dried-out corpses. Either way Nicotero and team made great use of make-up and judicious use of CGI to give the zombies their best look to date. The human characters are pretty much sketched out according to who the good guys and bad guys would be. Riley as the main human hero is serviceable and Hopper as Kaufmann is less over-the-top than what most people would be used to when they think Dennis Hopper. In fact, Hopper portrays the ruthless Fiddler's Green executive with a certain Rumsfeld-esque and Cheney-esque approach. This is a person who thinks that people should be glad that he's in charge to make their lives easier and safer from not just the zombies but from each other. He's a poster-boy for the mindset that if the populace is entertained and placated with the trappings of the old life then they wouldn't complain of the problems that exist outside their borders. Sounds similar to a certain mindset a certain nation is in right now.<br /><br />I must point out a couple of standouts in the film in the supporting characters of Charlie and Pillsbury. They're the comedy relief but not in the rip-roaring laugh-my-ass off funny, but in the way veterans of a war will joke and act to keep themselves sane and on the straight and narrow. Charlie seems to be the Lenny to Riley's George and the chemistry between Simon baker and Robert Joy works. Pillsbury was just on time with what little dialogue he had but right from the beginning the audience liked this character and I'm sure joined me in hoping he didn't become zombie-chow.<br /><br />The zombie-hero characters are a little harder to describe. I know of people who were tuned off by their continuing evolution to something resembling human instead of the flesh-eating corpses that they were. Big Daddy's introduction as the de facto leader of the zombies in the film seemed abit rushed, but unlike some I thought his evolution was a continuation with what Romero began with Bub in Day of the Dead. One thing that I noticed that few missed was the fact that even though Big Daddy was still a zombie who was smarter than most he never partook in any of the flesh-eating from beginning to end. The same goes for the handful of zombies who really began learning from Big Daddy's example like The Butcher and Softball Player (number 9 as she is called in the credits). the rest of the zombies mimicked what Big Daddy was doing, but in the end their primal instinct to feed overrode whatever residual behavior they were learning. I thought this was something lost to most audiences and almost lost to me until I saw the film a second time and things began to click into place. There will always be zombies that gorehounds love for their ability to just feed-frenzy whenever they catch a living human, but interspersed among them will be the evolving "Bubs" who seem to want to be left alone. Does this mean that these "Bubs" will stop feeding on humans probably not, but they're not as mindless and emotionless as the majority of their brethren will remain as.<br /><br />Overall, the film is an entertaining one if seen as a stand-alone. It's not as scary as the previous three in the series, but the films have progressively been getting less scary since Night of the Living Dead. The film seen as part of the series succeeds in continuing Romero's vision of what the zombies are. That they're not the real monsters in his film but just a reminder that they really are just us and their ability to collectively work together has always been their secret to always succeeding in finding a way into whatever defense humans have put up to keep them out. It is this working together that the surviving humans cannot learn and thus leads to their downfall. The title fits in that the land really belongs to the zombies now and the surviving humans are just temporarily living in it. I am not too big of a fan at what one of the characters did in the end, but it does show that with an evolving enemy out there the old ways of dealign with them may have to end and a new one found if humanity is to truly survive. I would give this film an overall score of 9 out of 10.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Ah, it's finally come. I should open saying that I, like many of you, am a ravening Romero fanboy, and this was probably the second most anticipated film release yet to occur in my life. (And arguably, it should be number one. The actual #1 is 'Kill Bill, Vol. 2', which is, naturally, something of a cheat as it is the second half of single film, which is gonna severely increase the desire to view it.) But, though my anticipation was great, my expectations weren't actually all that high. For one thing, I'm sufficiently cynical that whenever I get really excited about something, I get really worried that it's not gonna be very good. Also, I'd read the script online, and although it clearly had the potential to be a very good movie, it certainly wasn't anything particularly remarkable or revelatory. Mind you, I certainly didn't think it was gonna be bad, but I was expecting something earth-shattering either. And, it wasn't earth-shattering, but it was excellent, and surpassed my expectations. It does little to stir the human soul, I suppose, but it offers plenty of gruesome action along with the best looking zombies ever and a script that is a cut above what you'd usually see in this sorta film. All in all, I'd say 'Land of the Dead' is about as good as you could reasonably hope.<br /><br />One of the most impressive things about the original 'Dead' trilogy is how different the three films are. 'Land of the Dead' continues this trend, and it very unlike the 3 prior films, and is really about as original as one could reasonably expect a new film to be, while still remaining within the traditional zombie movie format. (Some professional reviewers disagree with me, but they don't spend nearly as much time watching zombie movies as I do, or you do, most likely.) This is the first genuinely post-apoclyptic zombie movie I've come across, in the sense that it is a zombie infested world in which a new human society has developed. This may not be the most remarkable twist in the world, but, again, it's about as big a one as your likely to have while remaining within the confines of the genre.<br /><br />The plot centers around the crew of Dead Reckoning, a custom-built battle vehicle used to scavenge supplies from the zombie filled world. Riley is in command of the vehicle, an antisocial type who simply wishes to flee from both humans and zombies, and live in the frozen north. Cholo is second in command. He's something of a firebrand, compared to the controlled Riley, and he wants to buy his way into the Fiddler's Green, a high-class, privileged tower amidst the ruins of Pittsburgh. Kaufman, owner of Fiddler's Green, however, isn't interested in money alone, and wishes to keep lowly sorts like Cholo out of the Green. Enraged by his rejection, Cholo steals Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy the Green if he doesn't pay a large ransom. Not wanting to pay up, Kaufman hires Riley to stop Cholo, and bring the vehicle back. Riley has no love for Kaufman, but if Cholo goes through with his plan, a lot of innocents will be killed, and Riley sees this as his opportunity to flee the city. Meanwhile, one zombie called Big Daddy, enraged by the wanton slaughter of his fellow zombies in a recent raid, notices the grand tower at the center of the city, and heads of towards the living community, leading a pack of zombies, who are apparently rather inspired by his atypical drive and direction.<br /><br />Though this film is moderately budgeted by mainstream standards(somewhere between 15 and 20 million), LotD has by far the highest production values of any Romero film. Despite the limited budget, Romero creates a full, convincing post-apocalyptic world, with a nice battle truck. (A truck which easily could've been very lame) Also, the zombie effects are the best you've ever seen, with easily the most varied and detailed faces around. Since this takes place years after the apocalypse, the zombies are in various states of decay, some fresh and mangled, some ancient and emaciated. Most impressive is one of the lead zombies, #9, who has her cheek ripped open, exposing her back teeth. It's a clever effect, and extremely realistic. Though many idiots whined about how the film was gonna be rated R, apparently unaware how much more lax the MPAA is compared to 20 years ago, this film more than delivers in terms of graphic violence. In terms of sheer volume, LotD is comparable to `Day', and it easily has the most flesh-eating of any of the Dead films. The gore is approached in a different way, as we don't watch a single character be mutilated to the extent they were in the prior two, but the sheer volume of effects is extraordinary. The natural effects are great, though the bites aren't quite as cool as they were in `Day'. There is some CGI, which is too bad, but it's pretty much unavoidable. As Nicotero mentioned in an interview, you can't just stick a squib on an actor's head anymore, and it would be totally impractical to put a squib on a stuntman every time someone had to get shot. The CGI is generally excellent, though it falters in one scene where a zombie's head is scissored off.<br /><br />As the synopsis would suggest, this film falls into the action-horror category, rather than just pure horror. It doesn't completely abandon horror for action, however, like so many recent zombie movies have. Unfortunately, Romero relies to heavily on jump scenes, as zombies constantly leap from around corners or where ever. This is probably my biggest beef with the film. Fortunately, the jump-scenes usually aren't all there is to it: Once the zombies appear, they have to deal with them the way they typically did in the earlier films. Romero shoots the action and horror scenes old-school: keeps the damn camera still, lets you see what's going on etc. Mind you, I really like flashy camerawork, but this new school of camerawork ain't flashy, just incoherent and stupid.<br /><br />Much has been made of how some of the zombies are smarter now, but this isn't really that important to the film. All that really matters is that one of the zombies becomes smart enough to actually actively attack the humans, rather than just wandering around, and the other zombies follow him. Yeah, the zombies pick up and use tools sometimes, but they did that in earlier Dead films as well, and their use of guns is utterly minimal. For the most part, these zombies behave precisely like your traditional Romero zombies. Well, towards the end it suggests that some zombies have  become intelligent enough that they're beyond eating people.  This is a little strange, but there are still plenty of mean, stupid zombies to go around.<br /><br />While reading the script, it looked as if the characters would be a bit to cliched, but this proved not to be the case. Cholo looked like he might be too wild and uncontrolled, but Leguizamo holds back a bit with him, and makes him more real and naturalistic than he might have been. Similarly, Riley is basically your typical jaded soldier type, but Baker plays him more like a normal guy than an action hero. Hopper is typically known for being wildly over the top, but he plays Kaufman very low-key, as he should. Overall, the acting is very solid, though not much is typically asked of them. Special note should also go to Robert Joy as Riley's sidekick Charlie, a dimwitted sharpshooter. He's kinda used for comic relief, but he's endearing rather than obnoxious, unlike most sidekicks. These characters generally aren't terribly deep or complex, but they usually seem surprisingly real, like they did in Romero's earlier Dead films. (And unlike they usually do in this sorta film, where they often just go to the movie store, and buy a crate of `Generic, Clich&eacute; Characters, 10 Count'. I'm looking at you, `Dawn of the Dead 2004'.) Unfortunately, Romero makes a few attempts at quips and catch phrases, most of which are quite lame. But, this sorta thing comes with the territory, and it isn't a big deal.  When I read the script, much of the dialogue was kinda hokey, but it plays better when you  actually see it.<br /><br />Well, I guess that's it. This is just a very finely crafted zombie film, which finds a distinct niche in a very crowded subgenre. A fine return to the genre.<br /><br />Update for DVD: The DVD itself looks very nice. (I really don't have that much of an eye for this sorta thing, however, so if others see some flaws they may be right.) As anticipated, the new cut isn't much different.  There's one new scene, about 3 minutes long, involving Cholo dealing with a suicide in an apartment.  It's a reasonably effective scene, and one of the more horror oriented sequences, but it hasn't really got anything to do with anything else in the film, however. (Which is why it was cut in the first place.)  It's got a bit more gore, with many shots extended slightly, and a few new things. (Such as one person getting their eye bit off, and Mouse getting ripped apart and disemboweled etc.)  Some people have been acting as if this version is way gorier, which is isn't, but it's got some notable additions, and further cements this film's position as having the best combination of quantity, quality and variety, when it comes to gore.  (Other than 'Day of the Dead', probably.  It's a tough call.)  I listened to the commentary, and it was acceptable, but not fascinating, and not nearly as interesting as Romero's ones generally are.  But, oh well, it's a fine DVD.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>The world is taken over by zombies but a greedy rich man has a secure building that he pays soldiers to protect while his rich friend and he live the good life.

The basic subplot is the inherit evil in class systems and looking down on others because you think you are better.<br /><br />Good zombie flick but you better not be grossed out by gore if you want to watch it. I liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Land of the Dead is the first in a proposed new Zombie trilogy from the man who started it all, George Romero.  The very first thing that is evident in this film that is different than Romero's first three "dead" films is the budget.  The success of films like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake made this film bankable to Hollywood execs and certainly gave Romero far more to work with than he ever has before.  Better special effects, better make-up, superior acting.  Some are criticizing the film for a lack of a storyline but it's no different than any of the other dead films...it's human's against zombies.<br /><br />Land is sort of Dawn of the Dead remade and expanded.  Instead of a handful of humans being trapped in a mall, there are now thousands trapped in a city.  Only they don't think of themselves as trapped and life goes on as the city is protected by electified fences, walls, and rivers.  Social commentary has always been a big part of the Dead films and Land is no different.  The wealthy are still the "haves" and live in the prestigious Fiddler's Green Tower filled with luxury apartments, shopping, and hotels.  It's run by Kaufman played by Dennis Hopper.  If there is a story complaint it's that there's no backstory to the characters.  Just who is kaufman?  Why is he in charge of Fiddler's Green?  Is he a Donald Trump?  A former Mayor?  This is left without explanation.<br /><br />So even in this post-apocalyptic world overrun by Zombies, there is still a very tangible class system.  Those not wealthy or socially acceptable enough to live in the tower must make do on the streets.  Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo) are a couple of hired bandits for lack of a better word.  Rily has built a massive battleship on wheels called Dead Reckoning which they use to venture out of the city into the heart of zombie land to acquire food and other supplies.  Both men have their own plans of what they want to do with their lives.<br /><br />This sets up a bit of an out of place side story where Cholo steals DEad Reckoning and threatens to blow up the tower and Riley has to get the vehicle back.  Meanwhile...the zombies which began to start learning how to reason in Day of the Dead have advanced led by a black gas station attendant named Big Daddy who eventually leads the zombies to the city.  Someone commented that it was stupid for Kaufman to try and get out of the city with loads of money since the entire social and economic system has broken down.  But that's entirely the point of Romero's satire...even when money no longer matters, people still die or kill for it.<br /><br />This was a far more gruesome film than the Dawn Remake.  Heads explode, bodie parts are torn off, and guts are yanked out with regular frequency.  The makeup is vastly superior to the Dawn remake where the zomibies moved too fast to get a good look at them and the original Dawn where all the zombies looked powder blue.  And thank you George for not making your zombies run fast!<br /><br />Land continues to progress the story started in the original film as each successive film shows the zombies more and more in control of the world.  This is our first glimpse at the big picture and we wind out that the plague was world-wide in scope.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with excellent special features and the film had a cameo by Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright which is captured in one of the featurettes.  So maybe Land of the Dead wasn't the deepest story...it's a great Zombie film and who needs much more than that?</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Recent years have seen a resurgence in the zombie film with the good (28 Days Later), the bad (Resident Evil) and the funny (Shaun of the Dead), but all of them pale in comparison to George A. Romero's trilogy of zombie films. The first two have been remade already, most recently it was Dawn of the Dead and both failed to build on or even recapture what made Romero's films so great in the first place. They seem to only be in love with the gore and miss (or just didn't understand) the socio-political message of them. The good news is that Romero is back with a new zombie movie that has been years in the making but it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />Romero has crafted a very smart horror movie which is something of a rarity these days what with all of these lames remakes littering the landscape. Land of the Dead has all of the requisite gore (and the unrated version has even more) while actually trying to say something. There are plenty of powerful images, like the undead rising out of the water at night (a nice nod to Carnival of Souls, one of the films that inspired Night of the Living Dead) or zombies crashing through the posh apartment complex and feasting on the wealthy. Like with his other zombie films, Land of the Dead is a commentary on the times in which it was made. And for that alone, his movie is a refreshing breath of fresh air.<br /><br />"Undead Again: The Making of Land of the Dead" is a promo puff piece as the cast and crew gush about Romero who looks like he is having a blast getting to play with a significant budget and working with name actors like Dennis Hopper. Unfortunately, the more substantial making of doc that aired on IFC is absent from this disc.<br /><br />"A Day with the Living Dead" features actor John Leguizamo taking us on a tour of the set and shamelessly mugging for the camera.<br /><br />"Bringing the Dead to Life" takes a look at how all of the nasty gore effects are done. Make-up guru Greg Nicotero demonstrates why he is probably the best zombie effects guy since Tom Savini. Nicotero went all out with this film to create some truly astounding (and unsettling) effects.<br /><br />"The Remaining Bits" is a collection of deleted footage that is only just little bits of business amounting to three minutes. While hardly essential it would've been nice to know why it was cut.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Romero, producer Peter Grunwald and editor Michael Daughtery. Romero delivers a typically low key track. He's not quite as chatty as he has been on other commentaries but this is a newer film and he doesn't have the same kind of distanced perspective that he has on his other work. This results in several brief lulls between insightful comments.<br /><br />"When Shaun Met George" chronicles the classic meeting of Romero and Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright who made Shaun of the Dead, an excellent satire on Romero's zombie movies. This is an amusing featurette that follows the boys as they film their cameo for the movie, showing their transformation into the undead and basically living out every fanboy's dream.<br /><br />"Scenes of Carnage" is a brief montage of some of the film's most gruesome scenes scored lovingly to classical music.<br /><br />"Zombie Effects: From Green Screen to Finished Scene" shows a few scenes before CGI was added and after. It was used mostly to flesh out the backgrounds in the scenes, making them look more elaborate or amping up the gore a bit more.<br /><br />"Bring the Storyboards to Life" cuts between storyboard drawings and the final version or a few sequences in the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Scream Tests: Zombie Casting Call," a pointless clip showing the early CGI tests of zombies dancing around a la the undead in Michael Jackson's music video "Thriller."</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>George Romero is a pretty decent guy, no doubt about it, and as far as directors go he can be pretty damn good (just take a look at the original NOLD), but when it comes to screenwriting...man, forget it. The guy just can't cut it. He (badly) needs a real writer.<br /><br />First of all, this movie is a mess, and you got noone to give a hoot about, noone to relate to. Why? Poor writing. Mindless killing and things being blown up every few minutes just does not make for a compelling film--in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Also, this whole message thing is a bit tiresome as well. Look, George, we know you're a Lib and got the (dated) ponytail thing going, fine, but why do we have to have all this anti -Repulican stuff shoved our way?<br /><br />What you don't seem to realize is that quite a few of us don't trust either the Left or the Right. Get it? Both sides have an ax to grind and (therefore) are full of it. Most people go their OWN WAY--as I always have.<br /><br />Please, PLEASE--spare us the heavy-handed political claptrap--especially in a silly zombie flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>This film didn't quite impress me on a grand scale, because the story and the performances were mediocre. I must give credit for the special effects and makeup team, because this film is visually engrossing and gorey consistently, and it goes beyond the level Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later has achieved. Though I find that this film got a bit tiring for me after seeing so many repetitious gun shots at zombies and zombies eating humans. It's not a scary experience, but it's more gruesome. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead more, because I loved Sarah Polley. With this film, John Leguizamo is more outstanding,  and Dennis Hopper is rather low-key for a villian. Anyways, if you want to see lots of bloody killing and explosions, then this is going satisfy your craving, and it might even lessen your appetite if you were eating during this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>I'll never understand how a zombie's body can function, it's dead.

This movie was very dumb, but with a group of friends it is fun to see the bad make up and death scenes.

Never the less, he is back, and thank you Mr. Romero. People ask why do the roaming zombies not look all that bad when all their victims get ripped to shreds? Go back to the original, "Night", some freak radiation problem,(their only guess), and the dead emerged from their graves, in tact, and fresh. Many graveyards in the country. My problem, in a world gone mad, one building, Fiddler's Green, is the place to be. What is money worth, what do these people do for a living? Just a bunch of rich people exploiting their money, for what? Useless in a zombie world. They have to hire renegades for supplies....for money? Why? Where they going to spend it? The renegades just loot stores, money is worthless. They just want in Fiddler's Green, not going to happen. Social satire is abundent, exspecially when the dead break into Fiddlers Green. For a sec, its back to the glory days of "Dawn of the Dead", except then, they were trying to survive, now, people want into the so called prestigios tower and off the streets, and the better life, does it really exsist? Great gore for horror fans, fast paced, zombies start to get smart, like Bub in "Day of the Dead", using weapons, mumbling directions to each other, but otherwise, where is this film really meant to go? Dennis Hopper and his briefcases of money............what, open up a diner for the undead? "Dawn of the Dead is the best, surviving with what you have, and if greed takes over, you will be punished. Some trivia, Tom Savini, fx God of "Dawn" and "Day" makes a cameo as Blade. I do love how Romero keeps his zombies slow moving, instead of track runners.Also George quit smoking while filming "Day of the Dead", that didn't last, hard habits are hard to break, keep thrilling us George, we love you. People don't knock the effects, alot better then the bluefaced zombies in the origial "Dawn". I think they are quite brilliant myself, good job, Greg Nicotero.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Romero does it again he always captures society in every era, and shows it falling apart like only he can.

It just seemed like a couple of good actors came together with a bunch of what seemed to be brand new actors and had someone role a camera while they were practicing their lines.<br /><br />So the movie starts out with these cops driving around in an armored bus with guns and stuff on it.  They go around killing zombies.  I really don't know what else to say.  Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and I wish I could say he was the best part of the movie, but everyone was too horible to say that they helped the movie at all.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a movie that makes no sense, has no character development, but does have some really good gore, then you should check this out.<br /><br />And at the end of this, am I supposed to believe that the head zombie guy just became smart all of a sudden and figured out how to blow stuff up?</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>In this movie we once again have a horde  of Zombies who have developed "intelligence" or something akin to this.This was George A. Romero's first mistake. I don't know about you but when I go to see a zombie movie I expect them to be brain dead and eating living human flesh. Even "Shaun Of The Dead "  realized this. So now you have "smart zombies' who organize an uprising against the Upper Classes. I seem to recall  reading about something like that in one of my Sociology Classes at College. It seems that Romero wanted to make a movie which included "Social Satire And Commentary" but all he has done is put too much plot in the way of a (potentially) good Horror movie.Watching this movie made me wonder if Romero has been reading too much Karl Marx? Just a thought. As the man once said 'If you want to make entertainment spend 20 million bucks. If you want to send a "Message" go to Western Union". I give this movie 5 stars because somehow Mr. Romero has managed to live off his reputation alone for the past 30 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>Even though this movie had its strong points, and also Romero's best zombie movie due to its updated special effects - it is still not the greatest zombie movie of all time.<br /><br />Hands down, that belongs to either the newly-remade Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later.

He's a silly man.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The dead are coming for you, but this time they have a plan.  They move forward with ruthless abandon hacking, grabbing, and tearing for whatever human they could possibly gobble up without personal greed and share their victims with their fellow dead.  Blood is gushing, entrails are flowing, and flesh is torn off between decaying teeth.  It is obvious that George Romero has not lost his touch with the splattering gore even though his Night oft he Living Dead (1968) was very timid in comparison with Land of the Dead.  However, the first three zombie films by Romero got increasingly bloodier and visually more disturbing from which the audience can deduce that this film will out do his previous films.<br /><br />By building on previous films Romero continues to tell the bloody tale where humans must find a way to to survive among an increasing number of hungry dead.  The story takes place in present day, years after the outbreak that murdered millions of people, where an enclave have barricaded themselves from the zombies.  This enclave periodically sends hired soldiers to search for equipment, food, and other necessary items for healthy living.  When these soldiers drive out on their missions they bring a tank the size of a semi with high tech equipment called the Dead Reckoning that serve as a tool against frequent zombie attacks.  The story begins where Riley (Simon Baker) is on one of these gathering missions where he detects some zombies communicating in a small abandoned town, which troubles him.<br /><br />Riley is the commander of the group and it is his last day working for the enclave's military force gathering items.  Nonetheless, he still demands that his group follows the rules of engagement, but he has trouble controlling the unruly Cholo (John Leguizamo) who often does as he likes.  It is also Cholo's last day working outside the enclave.  The two are polar opposites where Cholo is an attention seeking egoist with the behavior of a thug who could care less about people while Riley is a caring loner with natural charisma that easily gains followers including Charlie (Robert Joy) and Slack (Asia Argento).  An obvious tension exists between the two, as Riley follows his own way while Cholo is a mere lap dog for Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) who is the powerful despot of the enclave for which they work.<br /><br />Cholo desires to move into the luxurious Fiddler's Green within the enclave, an immense skyscraper for rich and powerful, which has all the necessities and comforts people can dream of in order to forget the unforgiving world outside.  He has saved up all of his capital in order to leave the poverty outside the Fiddler's Green, but Kaufman enlightens him that he is not a desired element within the luxurious society.  In rage Cholo escapes the enclave, as he also steals the Dead Reckoning and threatens to blow up the Fiddler's Green unless he is paid five million dollars.  Kaufman requests Riley's cooperation to prevent Cholo from destroying Fiddler's Green and bringing back the Dead Reconing.  In the middle of the blackmailing situation it seems as if the zombies have begun their own siege of the enclave, as they seem both motivated and organized when they devour those who oppose them.<br /><br />Land of the Dead has some captivating similarities with Dawn of the Dead (1978) when Romero offered an intriguing illustration of commercial society and philosophical existentialism through some survivors in a shopping mall.  Here Romero offers a clever societal criticism where he openly displays humanity's inability to cooperate, as greed and other personal desires prevent people from creating a safe society.  In the light of the thinking human, the zombies are brain-dead creatures, a mere shadow of what they were when alive.  However, Romero leaps and crosses the borders to displays how selflessly these flesh desiring dead approach the living sharing their entrails with a common goal despite being unable to form complex thoughts.  He even suggests through the comparison between the humans and the zombies that mankind's ability for complex thoughts and problem solving might also be humanity's demise.  In addition, Romero displays the other side of the coin, as cerebral activity on a high level can also be a useful tool for continued existence in peace.<br /><br />George Romero finds an adequate amount of financing for this film, which means that he can go beyond what he created in the previous films.  For example, the gore ceaselessly continues until the final scene and he could hire a cast with proven talent that could strengthen subplots through terrific performances.  Romero could also be more inspirational in his way of creating the horrifying scenes while many of these scenes also offer subtle and dark humor.  One of the more amusing scenes is when two zombies play wishbone with a human hand and none of the zombies win.  Overall, Romero does a very good job bringing this story to the audience, as it offers much fright, entertainment, and some interesting notions to ponder in the light of the rivers of blood that leave the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>I really wanted to see this movie when it came out in theaters, as I have become quite the George Romero enthusiast over the past few years and there hasn't been a new "Dead" movie in almost 20 years (if you exclude the remakes). But unfortunately, it dropped out of theaters just as fast as it arrived. But here, it arrives in all it's "Unrated Director's Cut" glory. It's surprising this movie didn't do very well, afterall, it was obviously only greenlit after the runaway success of zombie flicks such as last year's flacid remake of "Dawn Of The Dead," "28 Days Later" and to a lesser extent, "Shaun Of The Dead" (whose creators appear in this movie). Don't let the box office disappointment steer you away from this flick though...<br /><br />"Land Of The Dead" is 100 percent George Romero. All of the elements that made the original "Dead" movies such classics are carried over here. Great characters, original and thoughtful story, loads of action, and let us not forget: gore galore. The special effects truly steal the show here, as this is hands down the goriest movie I have seen in a long time (although, I'm sure much of it was trimmed down in theaters). The effects look real, unlike most newer horror flicks, and are a refreshing throwback to the 70's and 80's. As for the cast? Dennis Hopper, John Leguizamo, Simon Baker, Asia Argento. What more can I say? Dennis Hopper is great as the greedy, self-appointed leader of a new society, John Leguizamo is perfect as the badass rebel looking for a way out, Simon is his opposite, the sympathetic hero and Asia (whose father, Dario, has close connections with Romero) plays the strong female bit, and a semi-love interest to Baker's character. The story picks up exactly where "Day Of The Dead" left off. Now that the Dead (or "stenches," as they are referred to) have pretty much overtaken Earth, the upper-class citizens (i.e. those with money) have holed themselves up in a giant complex that serves as a new world, while the rest of the population are forced to fend for themselves on the street. There are obvious political undertones in this film that reflect on today's society (the supplemental material on the DVD further confirmed my theories) and in typical Romero fashion, it is pulled off very maturely, while still managing to entertain.<br /><br />The movie isn't exactly perfect. My main gripe is that it is too short for it's own good. What I love about Romero's flicks is how you can get sucked into this alternate world he creates. Here, just as I was getting hooked, the movie was ending. But even still, it works well in it's 95 minute slot. All the actors were great in their roles, and the characters were well-written, despite the fact that there wasn't much time for exposition (I wish we could have gotten to see and gotten to know more of Argento's character though), and the best part: The zombies in this movie are REAL zombies. Not rabid, blood-thirsty animals. Don't get me wrong, I like today's zombie flicks, but nobody does it like George, and "Land Of The Dead" is a testament to that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Awesome zombie masterpiece!!!<br /><br />A true example of Romero's genius, this was truly a keeper for fans. I was really glad I went to see it when it came out and the audience pretty much enjoyed it.<br /><br />However, the movie was not bolstered by 28 Days Later (an awful movie) nor RE, but it's bolstered as a great zombie flick because of the fact that's it's done  by the Master of Zombie<br /><br />movies, George A. Romero.<br /><br />Romero knows how to do zombie flicks, the ones every other third rated director (Paul W.A Anderson, Uwe Boll), try to copy but fail miserably at it.<br /><br />Why do they fail? Crappy special effects,limited or no story, bad directing, well with the master at the helm that wasn't going to happen, nor we're we going to have a major disaster on our hands. Romero really gave his followers something good again, and he needs to recognized again for it.<br /><br />The fourth zombie flick in the Dead saga finds a couple of renegades for hire who work for a rich white tycoon named Kaufman (excellenty done in fashion by Dennis Hopper).<br /><br />Hopper as Kaufman was deliciously evil, humorous and twisted. He reminded of George W. Bush in a way, he is an evil conservative who could care less about people dying in his own country,<br /><br />all he cares about is making a profit, and saving his own hide all the while spewing propaganda about what he's done when everything he's done has been for himself.<br /><br />This is actually an element of the movie from interviews George A Romero has given that he actually wanted to do more. Besides giving us a great zombie flick to eat out popcorn with he wanted to implement political and social satires. Always the brilliant<br /><br />director as he did with Dawn of the Dead, he does so here. Well done George.<br /><br />The gore for the movie was extremely high so gorehounds will not be disappointed at all. There's also certainly a high amount of action and pulse pounding violence and suspense to keep people in their proverbial seats for the whole viewing. This truly is a great movie.<br /><br />Even Tom Savini has a cameo in the movie.<br /><br />Moving on the mercenaries after killing many zombies, have a fallig ou. Cholo (John Leguizamo) who as another Latino actor and one of the best gives a great performance, takes into custody Dead Reckoning the advanced zombie killing machine unit. Riley (Simon Baker) hates Cholo ruthlessness but deep down they both are the same.<br /><br />Anyhow Kaufmann enlists Riley's help in getting the thing back all the way Kauffman has ideas of his own. Eventually everyone gets what they deserve at the end and of the top of that we have two hours of non stop zombie action!!!<br /><br />To sum up, this is a great zombie flick, and it's a great horor movie overall, George A Romero kicks butt and maybe Uwe Boll and every other mediocre horror director could learn a lot from him.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>With the succes of the remake of Dawn of the dead, and the modest hits 28 days later, resident evil and shawn of the dead Gearoge A Ramano thought why not make some cash while zombie movies are popouler. Well that's what he did made a really bad cheap horror movie with B actors. When relesed it went out of theaters so fast. The story is so bad it dosent make sense.

Romero is able to explore the other half of the scenario in his original, and un-filmed, Day of the Dead script.  All I can say is that, for this fan, it was worth every minute of the wait...<br /><br />Some time ago the dead began to rise up and attack the living.  Because a bite from a "walker", or "stench", is a death sentence, the people they killed got up and killed.  Society quickly crumbled, the major cities becoming fortified shelters for those lucky, or unlucky, enough to survive.  Within one of these fortified cities is Fiddler's Green, a shining luxury tower owned and operated by the wealthy Kaufman (Dennis Hopper).  To keep the people in the Green fed and happy Kaufman has built the Dead Reckoning, a muscular marriage of truck and armored vehicle, to go out into the "walker" infested areas and collect food, water and medicine.  Manning these runs are mercenary teams led by Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo).<br /><br />The raid of Uniontown is Riley's last run.  While scouting the area, he notices that the "walkers" are remembering their former lives.  More disturbing is that they seem to be starting to communicate with one another.  His warning is ignored by Cholo, who just wants to grab some extra loot for financial gain, and the raid goes sour.  The team leaves Uniontown, but the "intelligent walker" that caught Riley's attention, a burly gas station attendant named Big Daddy, begins to follow...using Kaufman's glowing ivory tower as the visual goal to be reached.<br /><br />Riley and Cholo return to the Green, unaware that they are being followed by the undead.  Riley hopes to get a car he has purchased and leave the city for a simpler, and uninhabited, area.  Cholo hopes to buy his way into Kaufman's tower, but he is refused by the slimy fat cat.  Determined to bring Kaufman down to his level, Cholo steals the Dead Reckoning and Kaufman sends Riley out to get it back.  Meanwhile the zombie horde is beginning to launch an organized attack against the city...<br /><br />Based on my first impression, all I can say is that Romero does not disappoint.  Land of the Dead is a lean and mean (both figuratively as well as literally) thrill ride that both encapsulates and expands upon the concepts and storylines of the previous three entries in the series.<br /><br />The acting is pretty much the best in the series.  Dennis Hopper underplays a part that, if a little more ham had been added to it, would have become a cartoony figure.  By keeping it quiet and subtle, Hopper let's us see the vile and monstrous power that is coiled beneath his falsely gentle and polite exterior.  Simon Baker likewise underplays Riley, but considering that his character wants nothing more than to just disappear, his fading into the crowd likewise makes his character feel real.  John Leguizamo's Cholo is a swaggering mix of anger and frustration just waiting to explode...and explode he does.  I have to say that Robert Joy's Charlie is my favorite character.  A simpleton fiercely devoted to Riley who also serves as the voice of Riley's supressed soul.  Rounding out the main cast is the stunning Asia Argento as Slack, a prostitute who, when she is tossed to the zombies, Riley rescues and reluctantly befriends.  Argento manages to nicely balance Slack between being both vulnerable and as tough as nails.<br /><br />KNB's gruesome zombies and their feasting scenes are top notch, despite the cuts for an R rating.  Don't let that R rating fool you into thinking that Land is some kind of watered down vision, far from it.  There are more than enough gruesome set pieces to wet the appetite of the expectant gore hound.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>while not quite on a par with NIGHT and DAWN , "LAND OF THE DEAD" is smart and fun . a solid cast and typically good writing and direction by ROMERO make this outing pretty much comperable to the very good DAY . don't know why this one devides folks so ?

They are safe, because the zombies don't cross water, but that's about to change.  While the peons dwell on the streets, the privileged elite reside inside a high class luxury building called Fiddler's Green.  Among them is Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), administrator of the supplies department, a group that leaves the safety of the city to forage for supplies in zombieland.  Riley Denbo (Simon Baker, The Mentalist) leads the supplies group, scrounging among the hoards of the undead, who have an insatiable hunger for human flesh.<br /><br />Cholo (John Leguizamo) a member of the supplies team, steals 'Dead Reckoning', a heavily armored vehicle used on supply runs, after Kaufman shoots down his bid to become a resident in 'The Green'.  With Cholo holding the vehicle for ransom, Kaufman sends Riley, and his pal Charlie (Robert Joy), ex-streetwalker Slack (Asia Argento) along with his team of mercenaries to try and get the vehicle back.<br /><br />Meanwhile Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), who ran a service station before joining the ranks of the undead, has begun to take a leadership role. Soon the zombies are on the march, and nothing can stop them.<br /><br />With headshots, bodies torn open and guts ripped out, decapitations, and limbs being pull off and munched on, Land of the Dead delivers tons of explicit gore.  Dispatching the 'stenches' is so routine for the supplies team, that inattention and carelessness results in team casualties.  A bit of a self confident know it all, unphased by anything, Denbo's demeanor is reminiscent of Patrick Jane, the character Baker plays in The Mentalist, a guy who tries to maneuver and outthink people.  Kaufman represents the privilege of wealth, looking to survive any way he can, while Cholo contributes the most, to what little real emotion there is.  It is chaos when the zombies attack 'The Green', though more mayhem could have been done.  The same goes for Dead Reckoning, where the full destructive potential is not fully realized.<br /><br />Land of the Dead has lots of extras, including various featurettes, and a commentary track with George Romero, editor Michael Daughtery, and producer Peter Grunwald.  The unrated director's cut is a slightly longer and has a little more gore.  Those interested in Romero's continuing zombie saga should be sure to check this out.  The violence and gore are definitely there, though the story may or may not satisfy.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>LAND OF THE DEAD<br /><br />**** ? Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- June 24th, 2005<br /><br />Running Time- 93-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Writer/Director- George A. Romero<br /><br />Starring- Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Asia Argento, Robert Joy, Eugene Clark and Dennis Hopper as Kaufman<br /><br />After 20-years George Romero returns to the zombie flick a type of film that Romero is the godfather of. After the success of Night of the Living Dead the zombie film was changed forever and after Dawn of the Dead it changed again. Every zombie flick since those two pretty much follow their concept with others following Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 and sometimes filmmakers mixing both Romero and Fulci together. Upon its initial release Day of the Dead wasn't highly received among fans, but over the years has gotten a lot more respect by people who originally dismissed it and not long after the release of Day of the Dead zombie flicks would start to die out and by the late 80s they were all, but dead and the ones made were hardly making an impact and than through most of the 90s zombie flicks were of something of a distant memory.<br /><br />For years George Romero wanted to make another zombie flick, but no one really seemed interested in producing it. But with the success of movies such as Resident Evil, Shaun of the Dead and the remake of Dawn of the Dead, George Romero finally got the chance to make his follow up to Day of the Dead and this was something fans have been waiting for, but started to doubt it would ever happen. But finally Land of the Dead came about and fan expectations were quite high for it. Regardless of if you like or dislike Romero's Dead flicks nobody can deny the impact they made on the horror genre.<br /><br />In my opinion Land of the Dead easily will go down as one of the best zombie flicks of the decade and quite honestly the only zombie movie of the decade that might be better is the remake of Dawn of the Dead, but I suppose it depends what you are looking for. I don't think Land of the Dead is as good as the previous 3 Dead flicks, but it is on par with them and makes for a great thrill ride. Though I have to be in the right mood for this one; my first viewing was in cinemas and I've never seen a Romero Dead film theatrically. Being born in 1979 I missed out on the first two and Day of the Dead wasn't playing near me. So I was so excited that I would have enjoyed this movie no matter what. My 2nd viewing on DVD I wasn't as into it and my 3rd viewing I loved it like I did when I first saw it. So as much as I love Land of the Dead this is the kinda movie that I have to be in the right mood to enjoy.<br /><br />The screenplay by George Romero is very well written and that's one area I feel he doesn't get enough credit. As a director he's one of the greats of the genre and not just that, but his movies aren't just great horror movies, but great movies. But as a writer he always had interesting and well developed characters with plenty of depth. The characters we were meant to like we did and rooted for them and the characters we disliked we did and wanted to see them get what's coming to them. The script for Land of the Dead continues with that and again Romero created some excellent characters and some are just as solid as any of Romero's past characters even if most fans overlook that in this one.<br /><br />As excellent as the script is not everything works; in each Dead flick the zombies have evolved and in Land of the Dead they have evolved even more. Big Daddy played by Eugene Clark was different than any other zombie in the series. Big Daddy was a little too smart for my liking and while I suppose you can also make that case for Bub in Day of the Dead I felt it worked a lot better in Day than it did in Land. Big Daddy also showed a lot of emotion and for me that was the only drawback in what was an excellent screenplay. It's an idea that is no doubt interesting, but in my opinion it just didn't fully work for me, but as other people really liked that aspect of the film so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Again I have to say that Romero really is a great writer and most people never really seem to talk about that. Some of the most memorable characters in the horror genre are characters from a Romero movie. What I like about his characters that even the heroes aren't perfect and are often flawed. Not every character in a movie can be developed, but Romero always manages to get the job done and as great as a director he's also such an amazing writer. And the fact he wrote a movie that is still relevant in today's times is amazing. Most filmmakers lose touch, but with at least Land of the Dead George Romero was still in touch with what's going on.<br /><br />37-years after his debut film Night of the Living Dead, George Romero still managed to put together an excellent flick. Most filmmakers from Romero's era have since faded away the only filmmaker from that era still making movies just as good if not better is David Cronenberg. Horror filmmakers in general seem to decline the most and Romero showed no signs of that with Land of the Dead. The pacing is excellent and there really isn't a slow moment to be found. The story always moves forward each scene with plot, character development or suspense. There's a few more jump scares than the past Dead flicks, but Romero works it well and manages to get a few good jump scenes and is able to deliver some good suspense and tension. Land of the Dead might lack in that area compared to the previous Dead movies, but Romero works it well and delivers a very solid movie. The final act though really delivers big time and Romero delivers some really exciting and tense scenes.<br /><br />When you look at the filmmakers from Romero's era like Carpenter or Argento these guys aren't making the films they once did. And while they still might craft a fun movie it's far inferior to their earlier work, but George Romero was able to avoid that trend and make a movie just as solid as anything he's done in his prime. While Land of the Dead isn't his best movie it does stand proud next to his body of work.<br /><br />The performances were all strong with Simon Baker, Robert Joy and John Leguizamo the best of the lot. Dennis Hopper delivers his best performance in years and the always lovely Asia Argento also provides a strong performance. Simon Baker as Riley and Robert Joy as Charlie are two of the best characters from the Dead series and Leguizamo as Cholo is a complex character that you'll love and hate.<br /><br />The gore by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger is excellent; there's also some CGI used, but it works well. It's not overused and the way it was shot it actually looks good. I hate CGI in general, but when not overused and shot the right way it can be effective and the CG works well here and the gore F/X by Nicotero and Berger are some of the best of their career. Some people were upset that Tom Savini didn't do the gore F/X Savini of course did the gore in Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead and would have done Night of the Living Dead, but he had to go to Vietnam. But Nicotero and Berger is every bit as good as Savini and do a bang up job.<br /><br />Land of the Dead was more than worth the wait and while you can't please everybody I felt Romero really got the job done and made another great movie in a legendary career. This was the last of the Dead series as Diary of the Dead would start a new Dead franchise. Also keep a look out for Shaun of the Dead star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright in cameos and Tom Savini reprises his character from Dawn of the Dead.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>Following the events of George Romero's beloved Living Dead films, "Night of the Living Dead", "Dawn of the Dead", and "Day of the Dead", in which the bodies of the recently deceased returned to life and began feeding on the living and increasing in number, "Land of the Dead" takes us to a walled-off community where a society of human survivors live as two distinct social classes: the wealthy, who live in a luxurious building called Fiddler's Green, and the poor, who live everywhere else. The big man who runs it all is the dangerously powerful Kaufman, and the film itself focuses on the group of marauders who work for him, particularly reluctant hero Riley and wannabe social-climber Cholo. Their job is to lead teams who travel outside the city on raids to collect goods from abandoned towns. Riley, however, is sick of the life within Kaufman's city and has made plans to get a car and head north, but his plans are interrupted when his former partner Cholo takes possession of Dead Reckoning, Kaufman's heavily armed, zombie proof raiding vehicle. Riley, his sidekick Charlie, and new friend Slack suddenly find themselves coerced into a mission to retrieve the vehicle from Cholo just as a large collection of intellectually evolving zombies are working their way into the city itself.<br /><br />"Land of the Dead" is a film Romero fans and zombie fans in general had been awaiting for a LONG time. When we finally got it, many of us were thrown for a loop by the concept of zombies learning (or is it remembering?) to tote guns and feel emotion, despite tastes of this from the previous film, "Day of the Dead". Ya gotta love how so-called fans who didn't like this film are trying to tell George A. Romero how his living dead are SUPPOSED to act; creatures that he himself invented. At first, I didn't love the concept of zombies becoming thinking creatures either, but given time, I've accepted that this direction was coming. How many times can you ask George to make movies about surviving the same basic situation? Okay, I could watch a million new ones, but still, it's understandable. And yet this is the main gripe people seem to have about this film. Oh well, you can't please everyone. Putting that aside, the film itself is a great ride! Another example of why Romero zombie films are the top of the heap. The characters in the film are wonderfully written and played. Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Asia Argento, and Robert Joy were just wonderful. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as the despicable Kaufman, and while there's nothing likable about zombie leader Big Daddy (sorry, the only good zombie is a completely dead zombie), he's an unforgettable presence. The effects are fantastic, the story is exciting and engaging. The only things I could possibly nit-pick about are one moment of CGI that is a bit too CGI, and the overall concept of money still having value (not impossible, but unlikely). Still, these things are forgivable in such a cool movie loaded with awesome scenes! Definitely a worthy addition to the Romero zombie saga, and just loads of horrific fun!<br /><br />The great looking widescreen, unrated, director's cut DVD features some great extras (though no theatrical trailer for some reason). There's a great director commentary, some excellent featurettes (including a fun day on the set with John Leguizamo and a look at Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's experience doing a cameo in the film), and even deleted scenes! It is unquestionably a must-have for any horror DVD collection, as are all the Romero zombie flicks!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>Okay, so this is a must see because it is part of George Romero's zombie saga, however I didn't really like this one too much. The special effects were great, however the story itself wasn't all the way there. I enjoyed the part of the story where the rich have isolated themselves and the poor have taken to the city streets, but the part of the story that I really did not like was the zombies forming their own army to take on the humans. I thought that the main zombie was horrible. Terrible acting and he looked silly. The way the zombies gather and follow him to the city and then they walk underwater through a river??? What was that all about? The plot about the weaponized vehicle being stolen and held for ransom, I just thought it was stretching things a bit. Of course it has some great moments too, like the whole fireworks thing was very cool. But ultimately this movie ended and I felt like it wasn't up to par with the other "Dead" movies. I give it 3 stars and probably won't ever watch it again. It's simply not a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>[note: approximately one thousand words cut from review due to Amazon length requirements.]<br /><br />Land of the Dead (George A. Romero, 2005)<br /><br />I'm not saying not to go see this movie. As a film that stands on its own, it's not a bad little thing, though it probably would have gone straight to video these days. Do you really need a plot synopsis? Stuff blows up. Lots of gory special effects get slung around. A rip-roaring, intestine-chewing good time is had by all. And yes, it is, in fact, a good time.<br /><br />But this is Romero. And this is the film that Romero has been wanting to make for two decades. It's reasonable to expect more than that. And it's not here. Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to say why that is without major spoilers as examples, but the majority of the film's great flaws, and they are great, have to do with continuity problems. Yes, I know I sound like an obsessed Trekkie when I say this, but I'm not talking about the guy with the red shirt on dying in Season 3 Episode 2 and showing up again with a hefty promotion in Season 5 Episode 6. I'm talking about the major development at the start of the movie, the big twist on which all other spoilers hang, having originally happened halfway through Night of the Living Dead. I spent the movie's next eighty minutes wondering how Romero could have managed to overlook that very basic fact, upon which the whole movie turns?<br /><br />As well, it's an ninety-three minutes long. It's not only the shortest film in the zombie quartet, but it's the second-shortest film Romero has ever made. I'd like to put it down to an exceptionally tight production schedule, I really would, because it seems so many of the movie's actors wouldn't have been utterly wasted in their roles given a longer running time. The two leads, Riley (Simon Baker, recently of The Ring Two) and Cholo (John Leguizamo of Spawn and To Wong Foo fame), are decently-drawn characters, though neither has the depth of character that categorized the major players in the earlier zombie films. Everyone else in the film, including female lead Asia (Scarlet Diva, b.Monkey) Argento, is utterly wasted. Again, about what you'd expect from a B-grade action horror comedy, and forgivable in the hands of most directors of such fare. But this is the guy who gave us some of the most enduring characters in horror film history. Why skimp now?<br /><br />Then there are the effects. I expected tameness when the film received an R rating, and I got it (though it should be noted that if you're watching closely enough, you'll see a "greatest hits" pastiche of deaths from the other films in the series throughout, which is numbly depressing on so many levels we won't even go there). What I didn't expect was that the zombie makeup that has characterized the zombies in Romero's films would have completely changed. The trademark blue-tinged zombie skin has disappeared completely.  The zombies in Land of the Dead are not nearly as unhuman, as they are in the series' first three films. This points to what may be the movie's greatest structural defect-- the lack of subtext. Romero's zombie films remain cinematic classics because they're not about the zombies, they're about the humans, and the underlying human condition. Each of the first three films in the series is so loaded with sociopolitical subtext that, looking back at them, I wonder how I missed it in my first go-round with each. I think it may be because those zombies are so alien. Romero had to work that much harder to get the subtext to work, and despite that, it's never delivered with the mallet-like cloddishness that is so rife in Hollywood message movies; they are nothing if not subtle most of the time. I'm not sure whether the more lifelike zombies were an attempt to not have to work that hard, but somewhere in the mix, the sociopolitical subtext took so much of a back seat that it was almost dropped. Sure, there are the haves and the have-nots in the human stronghold, and you could put together a small article on how the disparity between the two groups mirrors the same growing disparity in American culture today. But it would be a small article, and one that not many people would disagree with; it certainly won't inspire hours, if not days, of debate, like the earlier films, Dawn especially, did.<br /><br />But perhaps the most telling detail of how far the mighty have fallen I have saved for last, and I have to go back into obsessed-Trekkie mode, so take with whatever salt necessary. Kaufman, the head of the stronghold's "have" contingent, actually calls the walking dead "zombies" in this film-- the first time the word "zombie" has been used in the entire series. (This conceit is so much a part of the original three films, in fact, that Pegg and Wright used it as a semi-running gag in the wonderful Shaun of the Dead.) If you see that as a desecration, I have to warn you away from this movie. If you can shut your brain off and forget, for an hour and a half, that this was supposed to be the closing masterpiece in what is, arguably, the finest series of horror films ever made, then give it a go. **1/2</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />"Land of the Dead" is George Romero's third sequel to "Night of the Living Dead," the 1968 classic that, for good or for ill, brought the horror movie genre into the modern era.  In this latest edition, we find the planet still overrun by flesh-eating zombies, but now the hitherto mindless creatures seem to be developing the ability to think for themselves.  In true "Masque of the Red Death" fashion, the elite survivors have holed up in a protected fortress trying to carry on the rituals of everyday life as if nothing whatsoever were wrong with the world outside.  The city is run by a ruthless tyrant, hammily played by Dennis Hopper, while Simon Baker and John Leguizamo portray mercenaries who go out on zombie-zapping missions to protect the citizenry, but who aren`t "good enough" to secure a home alongside the well-to-do in the walled-off city.<br /><br />Although there are a few novel twists floating around in "Land of the Dead," the sad fact is that, with this film, Romero may have gone once too often to the zombie well (actually make that twice too often, since the third film "Day of the Dead" was no great shakes either).  Gone is the nightmarish starkness that informed both "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead," having been replaced by scenes that look as if they came straight out of a poor man's version of "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."  These zombies have simply lost the power to either disturb or scare us, and so the movie becomes just another flat action flick with a lot of random shooting at nameless targets.  The terror of the original film came from seeing ordinary, average people trying to cope with a situation for which there was no precedent, and having to fight against a threat they could not even begin to understand.  Yet, in a world in which zombies have become an everyday event, and everyone we`re involved with seems to be a trained zombie killer, the ability of the creatures to unnerve us becomes severely diminished.<br /><br />I guess we're not supposed to actually link this film all the way back to the 1968 original, since the characters in here - who are clearly in their twenties and early thirties - keep referencing back to a more halcyon time before the zombie invasion.  Moreover, the presence of modern technology, in the form of cell phones and home computers, implies a much later date for the initial event as well (I mean, if the world had really been overrun by the living dead for close to forty years, would cell phones ever have been invented?).<br /><br />As he did (quite successfully) in "Dawn of the Dead," Romero tries to make some satirical points along the way - in this case, about the cravenness of human nature and the inequity of the caste system - but the attempts here are so feeble that they just come across as stereotypical and hackneyed (particularly Hopper's callous, unfeeling, every-man-for-himself dictator).<br /><br />With so many other directors beating Romero at his own game of late - with better zombie pictures like "28 Days" and the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" - the filmmaker may have inadvertently laid the groundwork for his own destruction.  One wonders if, like the zombies who have made him famous, Romero will ever be able to rise again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>This movie is a good example of what a real zombie movie should be like. The movie has great actors, awesome visual effects and absolutely nothing that I did not like. This is 100% my favorite zombie movie from now on. Here is the story about zombies that actually start to think and understand the very basics of what and where and how to overcome the obstacles. Thinking zombies that also start to communicate with each other, are just awesome. And without giving away any spoilers I absolutely loved the ending (''They are just looking for their place to live''). Here is the real story, which I loved. There is a real teamwork in this movie, well developed characters and friendship among some, and just as much action as needed to be and not too much of any of those.

I mean even if the people trying extort the money get away where are they going to go and spend the money on in a world almost completely taken over by the undead?  The acting from the main characters is very decent though and Dennis Hopper as always gives a great show in his movies but at the end it's pretty much what anyone who looks at the cover knows,  and that is it's a flesh-eating zombie movie for anyone who wants to see the blood and gore of people been eaten an the like but don't expect to much more from the movie itself such as a great storyline or the like...</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>LAND OF THE DEAD features our beloved cannibal corpses still meandering about, in search of quick snacks. This time, they are led by a semi-intelligent mechanic zombie that learns and teaches the others how to better find soft, warm nourishment. Meanwhile, within the exclusive high-rise cluster known as Fiddler's Green, the inhabitants are unaware that they've been added to the menu. Dennis Hopper rules over the city in despotic fashion, as sort of a zillionaire Stalin figure. Simon Baker and John Leguizamo are two of Hopper's men. Leguizamo gets to play the reckless road warrior, while Baker is the more rational, compassionate type. Asia Argento is the tough, smart hooker w/ military training. The rest are either minor characters and / or zombie-chow. Romero had a bigger budget for this one and it shows. LOTD is flashier and more hollywood-looking, which is both good and bad. Good because it is so well-made, bad because it lacks the low-budget griminess of NIGHT, DAWN, and DAY. Still, George is king of the zombies, and his latest installment is gooshing w/ enough biting, ripping, and other fun to make it a classic in its own right...</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>George romero did a great job with this higher budget zombie flick.<br />On blu ray it even looks better, some of his fans didn't enjoy this one but it is filled with social satire and good old fashioned gore. It is much better than 'day of the dead" in which it's very small budget kept most of the action inside of a bunker, but not as great as the truly classic by any horror fans standards: 'dawn of the dead"  or the first and great 'night of the living dead"  , still this movie has a fine pacing and good performances from the top notch cast.  It's worth getting on blu ray as part of any superior horror dvd collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>After about 20 years since the last DEAD movie came out which was Day of The Dead which I didnt care for, Land of the Dead was a notch higher then that one but it really didnt survive in my mind. Simon Baker (The Ring Two, Tv's The Guardian) plays Riley, a man who is working for head honcho Kaufman, played by none other then Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Blue Velvet). The zombies have become vast and by the millions and the surviving ones are protected within a safe zone but that doesnt stop the zombies from gaining a slight of knowledge as they figure out how to use guns and other weapons including gas pumps and the zombies head for the safe zone. Baker's second in command Cholo, played by John Leguizamo (Cronicas, Empire), steals Baker's armored gun ready truck. Baker meets along the way a former hooker played by Asia Argento (Scarlet Diva, New Rose Hotel). Then Hopper wants Baker to go find Leguizamo, kill him and bring back "his" truck. But things vastly change but Baker decides he wants to rescue other people still trapped within the safe zone walls. It has that good old Romero touch to it but it kinda gets boring after awhile though watchable. Hopper is Hopper and Leguizamo is Leguizamo. Argento is always hot no matter what and Baker gives a good performance. Also starring Robert Joy (Joe Somebody) who plays Charlie. Look fast for horror makeup guy Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn, Dawn Of The Dead) as a zombie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>The first thing I have to say about this film is it did not really FEEL like a George Romero film.<br /><br />It felt like somebody trying to imitate Romero's style.... maybe just because it has been so many years since Romero did a film like this.<br /><br />Oddly enough, even though it was a comedy and spoof, I feel last year's SHAUN OF THE DEAD actually captured the Romero feel better.<br /><br />I actually give LAND 3.5 stars because even though they did a good job showing the evolution and advancement of the problem, it did not quite "come together".<br /><br />There was never really a feeling of impending doom like in the other "Romero Zombie Trilogy"...... this one had more of a typical Hollywood feel to it.<br /><br />We never really got a connection with any of the characters or cared about them much.<br /><br />It was all a little "stiff" and did not "pull you in" like the first three in the series.<br /><br />At least I am glad to see the Zombies the way they are supposed to be....slow lumbering masses... and not the olympic runners oj steroids moving as fast as lightening in recent films.<br /><br />The creepiness of Zombies comes from the fact that even though they move slowly, the growing numbers will overwhelm you eventually... that's the "creeping death" and is much scarier than a supposed Zombie that moves like a Mountain lion ....geezzzz.<br /><br />Question........ What happened to the TWILIGHT OF THE DEAD script Romero wanted to shoot for years ?<br /><br />This movie LAND OF THE DEAD (Dead Reckoning) is NOT that ame story from what I gather.<br /><br />Good to see George back.<br /><br />LAND was better than the other attempts out there, but despite the budget, big studio distribution, etc....  it did not quite have the same "magic" as the first 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Well, here it is!  The movie most of us have been waiting 20 years to see.  To Romero fans, this is a pretty big deal, to everyone else, it's just another zombie movie that's come out.  To horror fans  this film has been anticipated like The Phantom Menace was to sci-fi fans.  Did it meet expectations?  No.  Twenty years of built up excitement for this film are the cause.  With that kind of anticipation, this could be probably the best film ever made and it still wouldn't live up to expectations.  So, no, it doesn't.  But is it a good movie?  Hell yes it is!  Romero's back to the genre he created to show all the Zack Snyders and Paul Andersons of the world how it's really done.  And it's a very welcome return after all the crapfests posing as zombie films that we've had to deal with in recent years.  These are the Romero zombies, not the running, jumping, hopping, skipping, galloping zombies we've been seeing recently(it's a large stretch of the imagination to accept the concept of a dead person coming back to life to eat you.  It's downright inane to accept a dead person coming back and acting like an olympic gymnast).  The subject is handled with intelligence, but at the same time never taking itself 100% seriously.  Day Of The Dead was quite grim, Land is a little more like Dawn.  In fact, the whole look and feel of this film reminded me alot of Tom Savini's Night remake.  Romero's working with a bigger budget here-for him anyway.  Not a Summer Blockbuster budget, but larger than anything he's worked with before, and he makes the most of it.  It's not a special fx extravaganza.  Romero uses fx when necessary, relying on good ol' storytelling to progress the film(imagine that!).  Even Leguizamo's good!  I was skeptical when I found out he was in the film.  Not that I don't like him, he just didn't seem to fit.  But Leguizamo has proven he can put on a serious performance when he wants to, and he does here.  I wasn't crazy about a few of the humor attempts.  Humor's played a role in all the Dead films, but I could have done without the Samoan character who has no purpose in the film but to say goofy lines.  Why are Samoans always the butt of jokes in movies?  Romero doesn't go overboard with CGI(thank god!), but there are a few cgi headshots that would have looked alot better had Savini done them.  In the past, Romero had been able to tell the execs where to shove their R rating, but the film business has changed ALOT in recent years.  George had to settle for that R rating coz mommy and daddy at the MPAA are looking out for us.  Don't worry, coz George promises the uncut proper version on dvd.  The violence here pushes the R rating almost to it's breaking point though.  All in all, I enjoyed Land Of The Dead and I'm very glad that George finally was able to make it.  If there's anything good to be said about crap like Resident Evil and House Of The Dead, it's that they probably helped open the doors for George to make this film.  It's not gonna please everybody.  The harshest critics of this film will be Romero's fans, all of whom have 20 years of built up expectations like myself.  The fact of the matter is, you're just not gonna please them all.  It's a helluva lot better than the Phantom Menace too.  I say support the master and go check it out in the theater before someone remakes it.</p></br></body></html>

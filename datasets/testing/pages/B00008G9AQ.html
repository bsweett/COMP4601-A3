The film version of the second J.K. Rowling novel has been on everyone's "want to see" list, and director Chris Columbus does not disappoint.<br />Once again, the screenplay adaptation is true to the book, and little of significance has been left out.  Although it may escape the youngest viewers, Harry's discomfort with the fact that he is a celebrity begins to show, and the class war between Wizards and those  with partial "Muggle" blood is featured, foreshadowing class conflicts we have in the real world.<p>The film opens with the soaring "Harry Potter" music, and you first begin to realize how much you equate it with the films, kind of like the "Star Wars" theme. Harry's life at his "Muggle" home is featured, but it isn't long before visitors (our first glimpse of Dobby, the House Elf, magically created in computer graphics) and an action-packed appearance by the Weasley brothers, in a marvelous car, shake up Harry's world, and it's back to magic!  The Weasley home, shown briefly, is a charming wonder.  It's funny to see how the young actors have changed, with Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) now much taller than Harry...they were the same height in the first film.  <p>This segment at Hogwarts is far darker and scarier than in the first movie.  There is a threatening tone for Harry throughout, and the Hogwarts staff is frightened and mystified by attacks on staff and students.  The bond between Harry, Ron and Hermione is very strong, and all the young actors are convincing in their roles. One of the great scenes occurs with the polyjuice potion, with Hermione very matter-of-fact about the ghost that haunts the girl's bathroom and amusing transformations for the three of them.  <p> One of my favorites, Kenneth Branagh, steals scenes as the egotistical professor of the dark arts, Gilderoy Lockhart.  Lockhart is comically inept at his magic, and very vain of his appearance - Branagh adds just the right touch.  Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) is back, and his best scenes are when he is drolly putting down Lockhart.  This will be Richard Harris' last turn as Dumbledore, and he is featured heavily, along with the incredible Fawkes, his computer generated pet Phoenix. Robbie Coltrane returns as Hagrid, and we learn more about him than in the first film.  The ladies, too, are back, and a new favorite is Professor Sprout; you'll laugh at her gardening class!  One role that was wonderfully cast was Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father.  He drips evil all over the film as his character sets out to destroy Dumbledore and all Wizards with Muggle blood. <p>Quidditch is even better than before, with many of the scenes exhilarating and scary. The monsters that Harry encounters on his way to the Chamber are mesmerizing, and beautifully filmed.  Harry is less of a spectator in this film, and uses his own skills and magic to overcome the obstacles cast in his way.  <p>One of the most charming elements of the film are the little jokes that escape you during the first viewing, that you hear when you finally get the DVD.  Here's my favorite:  after Ron bumbles a spell containing slugs, the friends take him to Hagrid to help him get through  throwing up slugs.  Hagrid sits him down and says he'll need "special equipment" to help him get through it....then hands him a wooden bucket!  Priceless little jokes like this permeate the film, and for that reason, many choose to see it several times in the theater.<p>Why the "A-" rating?  The film, at nearly 3 hours long, needed more editing. Perhaps a little less of Dobbie...? And, unfortunately, although I loved the special effects, the violence in several scenes makes this a movie to which I would not choose to take a preschool child.  That said, neither of these drawbacks really affected the way I personally viewed the movie, and, I still am just wild about Harry ! <p>Go, see and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>It is year two at Hogwarts, and there are already big changes at work since the first film.  The three main characters - Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are quickly beginning to grow up.  Their actor counterparts will be the biggest surprise, with the boys already sporting much lower voices and taller heights.  Most of the same characters return from the first film, along with some newcomers such as the villainous Lucius Malfoy - deliciously played by Jason Isaacs (you may remember him as Mel Gibson's opponent in The Patriot).  His son, Draco, returns as well, up to his usual no good ways of insulting Harry and his friends.<br /><br />The story behind "you know who" continues in this film.  The Chamber of Secrets is the newest mystery at Hogwarts, and the biggest threat at present.  Harry must follow lots of clues to solve the puzzle, which is fun in the sense of watching a good mystery.  Aside from the chamber plot, there is a lot of fun in this film, including a lot of action and a lot of humor - a huge improvement over the first film.  Even the special effects have easily tripled in effectiveness, especially an intense scene of Quidditch and the very scary and amazing climactic showdown of the film - easily better than the climax of the prior movie as well.<br /><br />Overall, Chamber is much edgier, darker, scarier, and intriguing than the first Potter film.  This is easily one of my favorite films of the series to date, mostly because it has come so far as a sequal.  Though the films are meant to follow the novels of Rowling, the creators of this film have definetly put more into the second Potter film than one might expect.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>This second installment in the immensely popular series once again delivers a world of fantastic magical proportions.  Most of the members of the original movie are back and once again director Chris Columbus weaves a tale of sorcery and danger for our young heroes.  Notable new faces include a bombastic Kenneth Branagh and a nasty Jason Isaacs.  With gorgeous sets, costumes and neat special effects, this movie should entertain all, even those of us who aren't Harry Potterphiles.  Good moviemaking, though</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>While I'm (im)patiently waiting for Goblet Of Fire to come out in November, I'm having fun watching the movies. I got the fright of my life when I started watching & Daniel & Rupert's voices had broken! They sound so strange! It's like when I left school, I remember a lot of the guys still hadn't hit puberty. But now they sound so deep & grown up! But I still remember some guys' voices breaking at school, so I asked my boyfriend the other night. They also seem to have shot up a couple of inches, and poor Emma, is still toddling along after them!<br /><br />Chamber Of Secrets really was an excellent movie, on a par with the first, even though I hated the first book, and loved the rest after that. But I have to say I hated a couple of the characters in this, particularly Professor Lockhart played by Kenneth Branagh (not Richard, why did I say Richard?) and Dobby. They were pointless characters in the books, and pointless characters in the film. Dobby annoyed the hell out of me, what was the point? One of the worst characters that JK has written so far.<br /><br />We get to see a lot more of Draco Malfoy & his dad in this too - how freaky is that white-blonde hair with the dark eyebrows? Both are getting meaner, and I swear it's only going to get worse as the movies/books go on. There's potential for the dad to get a lot worse.<br /><br />How sweet are all the Weasleys? With Julie Walters playing the mum & the stuttering guy from Shakespeare In Love playing the dad, and lookalike Rons, it's a terrific family! Thankfully we get to see a lot more of Dad Weasley in the later books, so hopefully he'll appear more in the films.<br /><br />There's a little bit of the love story between Ron & Hermione incorporated into this film, even though JK has admitted in the extras to not featuring it until the fourth book. It's a shame Hermione disappears for most of the film, from about halfway through; she's not there anymore. Aw, what a shame. You know, the thing about Hermione, is she's nothing like how she's described in the books. Her hair is so calm, and not bushy as described.<br /><br />And how weird was the flying Ford Anglia scene? There was something not quite right about that scene.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about the lack of screen time some of the teachers get. I had a small moan about the lack of screen time given to classes in my last review, and it's the same again. But what you have to remember, is that this film is what, over 2 hours long? Things have to be cut, and judging by the amount of deleted scenes also, it seems Chris Colombus found it quite difficult to cut scenes.<br /><br />The extras on this were slightly better than the previous one; we actually get interviews with the entire cast, rather than the crew like in the previous one. Unfortunately, nearly all of them are interviewed on the set (I always find it more interesting to see them interviewed out of character), only Alan Rickman isn't filmed on set. (He's definitely got a lot of makeup on, either that or it's the hair!) I still haven't managed to get through half the games, but at least they're less annoying than the previous game.<br /><br />This has to be a film to be seen, but not if you're scared of spiders. Who else had flashbacks to Eight Legged Freaks or the Arachnophobia film? (I haven't seen the latter, and don't plan to either - the former was bad enough.) Hopefully in the later films, the director will choose to cut Dobby. Seriously, NOT a good character.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets struck me as a significantly better movie than the first Harry Potter film.  The first movie was thrilling, giving us the first look with the naked eye of the setting already firmly lodged in the imaginative minds of Rowling's readers, but the fact that audiences are now quite familiar with both Hogwarts and the colorful characters who reside there allows for the plot to exert greater control over everything that happens.  Surely, there are little sidetracks along the way, but the tension builds continually toward the almost inevitable conclusion of the film.  I will admit that one can find a few weak spots if not holes in the plot, but this fact does little to diminish the overall effectiveness of the film.  Just as Rowling's writing draws you in to Harry Potter's world, so does this movie.  It's rather amazing to see just how much the heroic triumvirate of Harry, Ron, and Hermione have matured, but they are still the same friends we left behind at the end of Year One.  The late Richard Harris is once again the perfect Dumbledore, Professor Snape is even more Snape-ish that before, and Draco Malfoy is somehow even more unbearable.  Along with all of the beloved characters we already know and love (or hate), a new set of important personages now enters Harry's world.  The conceited egomaniac Professor Lockhart is a fascinating, albeit increasingly annoying, wizard, while Dobby the house elf is a well-animated, exceedingly sympathetic little guy who never fails to liven up the action around him.  No one looms larger, however, than Lucius Malfoy, whose dark and looming presence comes through immediately on first sight and lingers until the very end.  Important storylines for both now and the future begin to emerge, helping to pave the way for successive films.  The special effects are really well done indeed, the music works perfectly, and the movie succeeds admirably in following the storyline of the book on which it is based.  I would imagine that young readers are particularly fond of this film, as its variety of special effects, from the flying car to the increasingly exciting action above the Quidditch field to the amazing effects of drinking Polyjuice Potion, offers a lot of delightfully memorable moments.<p>The DVD features are excellent, much better than those found on the DVD of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  You don't have to jump through hoops to see all of the deleted scenes, there is a fun and informative look at the making of the movie; the tour of Dumbledore's office comes off nicely, and a number of interviews with Rowling, Chris Columbus, the actors and actresses, as well as some of the individuals in charge of creating the incredible look and feel of the movie are quite interesting to watch.  A number of other activities, particularly among the DVD-ROM features, offer both adults and children a fun and easy way to linger in Harry's world for some time rather than leave immediately upon viewing the movie.  <p>I haven't gone into detail here about the film because there's really no need to.  Quite simply, this is just a great film.  No longer are we and Harry oohing and aahing around every corner of the school corridors; the days of innocence and play are over as Hogwarts faces the prospect of closing.  The darkness that will continually work its way into the Harry Potter storyline, greatly increasing the depth of even the most familiar of characters, begins in the Chamber of Secrets.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>This second Harry Potter outing is an overall better film than the first.  After some initial time spent with his adoptive Muggle parents, Harry escapes to his friend Ron's house, then makes his way to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for year two of his training.  But not all is well at the school - students are turning up petrified and the teachers are not able to stop it.  Therefore, it's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to save the day yet again!<p>The film is better for a number of reasons, not least of which being better source material.  Rowling's 2nd book is smoother and more cohesive, and this comes through in Kloves's screenplay.  Secondly, the children actors are more comfortable in their roles (and the actors playing the adults maintain their high quality).  Unfortunately, Harry himself, Daniel Radcliffe, still seems too standoffish and arrogant relative to his portrayal in the book.  I'm not sure if the blame for this lies with the actor or the director.<p>Thirdly, Director Columbus spends less time admiring the scenery and more time developing the story/characters.  That is not to say that the film is any less dense, but the camera doesn't linger too long, improving the pacing and interest in the story.  Finally, the new characters, including a scenery-chewing turn by Kenneth Branagh as a new prof, and the parents of Ron and Malfoy, are welcome additions to the Potter cast.<p>This DVD edition is likewise far superior to the first film.  Gone are the annoying little games you had to play to access the special features (the annoying games are still there, but they aren't requirements for accessing the goodies).  There are many (19, but mostly short) alternate/cut versions of scenes, an interview with Rowling herself on adapting her books to the screen, and other such extras.  Columbus does not grace us with a director's commentary this time, but I suspect it's unecessary because he covered much territory in the Philosopher's Stone commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>The magic is back!  Harry, Hermione, and Ron Weasley return to the screen with yet another adventure, bigger and better than ever, as they begin their second year at Hogwarts.  With a veritable flick of his magic wand, director Chris Columbus offers up &#65533;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&#65533; the second chapter in the on-going saga of everybody&#65533;s favorite young wizard, who is joined this time around by a new instructor (teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts), as well as some formidable new opponents.  There&#65533;s also a couple of surprises along the way as Harry encounters a rather singular character in his bedroom, and another deep in the Forbidden Forest.  And, yes, there IS a Quidditch match. <p>Harry&#65533;s second year at Hogwarts begins inauspiciously with a warning to stay away; someone-- or some&#65533;thing&#65533;-- doesn&#65533;t want him there.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is undeterred, of course, and is soon back in Gryffindor House along with his friends and fellow students.  But the warnings persist, now written in blood on the walls, and they portend an ominous fate for Harry, as well as many of the other students of witchcraft and wizardry.  The messages indicate that the &#65533;Chamber of Secrets&#65533; has been opened, and that dire consequences (for some unknown reason) are about to befall many of those in attendance at the school.  And this is serious business; enough to make Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) fear that Hogwarts may have to be closed indefinitely.<p>So it&#65533;s up to Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) to get to the bottom of the mystery.  And they don&#65533;t have much time; already one of the students has been found literally &#65533;petrified&#65533; in the hall, and the perpetrator is still unknown and at large.  Harry knows the answers can be found in the Chamber of Secrets, but the questions persist:  &#65533;What&#65533; is it, exactly, and &#65533;where&#65533; can it be found?<p>As if channeling the spirit and imagination of author J.K. Rowling (in whose heart Harry Potter was born), director Columbus brings this film vividly to life in a swirl of excitement and colorful characters.  He sets a perfect pace that will keep even the youngest members of the audience enthralled, and his transitions are impeccable, always moving the story forward with nary a single lull or hesitation.  It&#65533;s a film that will grab you in the opening frames and sweep! you along to the finish. <p>Written for the screen by Steven Kloves (adapted from the novel by Rowling), the story is compelling, the dialogue is fresh and crisp and, as expected, the special F/X are the absolute best.  And Columbus uses it all to great effect, aided in no small part by the exemplary work of film editor Peter Honess, the original score by William Ross and John Williams, Roger Pratt&#65533;s brilliant cinematography, and last, but certainly not least, the engaging performances turned in by his young stars and veteran performers alike.<p>Young Daniel Radcliffe&#65533;s portrayal of Harry is so complete and natural that, simply put, he IS, and will forever be, &#65533;Harry Potter.&#65533;  It&#65533;s the kind of definitive performance that will always, without question, be a part of Radcliff&#65533;s life, putting him in such dignified company as Sean Connery (James Bond), Leonard Nimoy (Spock) and Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes).  And, for better or worse, that&#65533;s not such a bad place to be.  He has a gift, and if he uses it wisely, he has a long and successful career ahead of him.<p>The characters of Hermione and Ron Weasley are definitive, as well, but not in the way that Radcliffe&#65533;s Harry is, but inasmuch as it would be impossible hereafter to accept anyone else but Watson and Grint as, respectively, Hermione and Ron.  Their portrayals are solid, endearing and entirely convincing; who will ever forget Hermione&#65533;s adamant stare, or Ron&#65533;s bemused expression of befuddlement?  Though without a doubt they will always be associated with these characters, they have the kind of talent that should take them successfully beyond their &#65533;Potter&#65533; personas.  And hopefully they will make choices in the future conducive to their auspicious &#65533;star-making&#65533; turns in these films.<p>Kenneth Branagh gives a delightful performance as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new instructor at Hogwarts, whose self-importance has made him a legend in his own mind.  He is pompous and self-serving, but in a fun kind of way that allows you to see immediately beneath the mask of his vanity and his puffed up ego; he&#65533;s the Wizard of Oz revealed as the man behind the curtain.  And Branagh plays him perfectly.<p>In this chapter we&#65533;re also introduced to Draco Malfoy&#65533;s father, Lucius Malfoy, played with deliciously restrained malevolence by Jason Isaacs.  After meeting Lucius, it&#65533;s easy to see that Draco (Tom Felton) is an apple that didn&#65533;t fall far from the tree.  <p>Also turning in a memorable performance is Shirley Henderson, as the empathetic, disenfranchised ghost, Moaning Myrtle, doomed to forever roam the lavatory in which she met her untimely and premature demise.  With very little screen time, she manages to make a decided connection with the audience, which makes her an effective and integral part of the story.<p>Reprising the roles they established and made their own in &#65533;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#65533;s Stone,&#65533; are Richard Harris (Dumbledore); Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid); Alan Rickman (Professor Severus Snape); Bonnie Wright (in an expanded role this time, as Ginny Weasley); Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley); John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick); Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon); Fiona Shaw (Aunt Petunia); and Harry Melling (Dudley).<p>The additional supporting cast includes Toby Jones (extremely effective as the voice of Dobby, the House Elf), Christian Coulson (Tom Marvolo Riddle), Miriam Margolyes (Professor Sprout) and Sally Mortemore (Madam Pince).  Be forewarned, there&#65533;s a scene in the Forbidden Forest that will absolutely make your skin crawl; but it&#65533;s all a part of the fun, and by the final scene of &#65533;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&#65533; you WILL, without a doubt, believe in magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ.html">A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" not only meets but far exceeds the standards set by its predecessor, 2001's "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."  "Sorcerer's Stone" went on to be the biggest worldwide hit of 2001 (and of all time next to Titanic) due in large part to the popularity of J.K. Rowling's hit series of books that it was based on, but as a film it easily stood up on its own merits combining the right amount of action, eye candy FX, humor and "whodunit" mystery intrigue.  "Chamber of Secrets" keeps the tradition going, and then some!<p>THE STORY:<p>"Chamber of Secrets" is the adaptation of J.K. Rowling's second book in the landmark Harry Potter series, the story of a boy wizard who through a twist of fate is locked in mortal combat with an evil wizard.  The series follows his (and his buddies Ron and Hermione's) (mis)adventures as they progress through 7 years of study at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Chamber of Secrets chronicles their adventures during their 2nd year at school where Harry becomes the prime suspect in a string of deadly attacks against his fellow classmates as the mysterious Chamber of Secrets has been opened.  What exactly is the "Chamber of Secrets" and if it wasn't Harry who opened it, who did?<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>All the stunning visual eye candy from "Sorcerer's Stone" is back, bigger and badder than ever! The world of Hogwarts is once again depicted just as grand as before, if not more so.  For fans of the first movie the revamped Quidditch scene will hit you harder than before like a psychotic Bludger.  Also, the addition of the new "wizard duel" scene will strike you just as hard as any of the Lightsaber battles of Star Wars fame.  Overall, if you're an FX freak you'll love CoS as much as SS, if not more.<p>The actor's performances in this film are just brilliant.  Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley and Kenneth Branagh's Gilderoy Lockheart as well as the Jason Isaac's Lucius Malfoy and Dobby the House Elf easily steal the show and bring Rowling's depictions to life just as you'd imagine it.<p>BEST SCENES:<p>- Wizards duel<p>- Quidditch Match<p>- Flying car<p>- Harry vs. The "Secret" in the Chamber<p>THE ADAPTATION:<p>Fans of the books will once again (or at least should) be pleased with this very true and near perfect translation of book to silver screen.  Like the first movie, very little was changed from the book with just a few "minor" deletions of scenes or "rearrangements" from the book.  Once again, as movie adaptations of books go, the Harry Potter movies are almost as perfect as you'll get.<p>WARNINGS:<p>Readers of the books should know what kinds of things to watch out for in this one.  For the somewhat squeamish there are scenes with slugs, spiders, giant snakes and a few other things that may upset you that you'll want to look out for or be mindful of if you are bringing very young children.<p>THE VERDICT:<p>Overall, once again, if you are a fan of the series (or even if you are not), "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" should easily top the list of movies you should definitely see.  Fans of the book will appreciate seeing everything come to life and fans of great movies will marvel at all the action, humor and visual eye candy this one has to offer.<p>Can't wait for the "Prisoner of Azkaban" movie and the Chamber of Secrets DVD.<p>Highest Recommendation. (Like you didn't know...)</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Suspected of being responsible for the attempted murders of several Hogwarts students, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) spend their second year unraveling a dangerous mystery that threatens the very existence of the academy.  This is a wonderful film that introduces several great new characters, such as the conceited and comical Guilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branaugh) and the evil Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), as well as boasting terrific visual effects and costume design.  I am so gratified that director Chris Columbus and writer Steve Kloves have been granted the long running time of over two hours to do full justice to author JK Rowling's magical world.  The respect paid to the source material really shows on the screen.<br /><br />The death of Richard Harris, who played Albus Dumbledore, heralds what may become a problem with this series as it plays out over the next five projected films.  It is unlikely that all of the actors who portray the large cast of main and supporting characters will be able or willing to devote so much of their time over the course of the next five years to the production and promotion of a single film franchise.  The producers might lessen this problem by spreading out film production rather than trying to release one every year, but then they run the risk of having their principle actors age out of their roles.  Fans should be prepared to see more roles recast with other actors before this series reaches its end./</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>2001's "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," the first in the series of films based on the J.K Rowling novels, had a strong first half and a weak second.  The follow-up feature, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," reverses that formula, actually becoming better as the movie goes on.  In this new film, we miss that air of freshness and novelty - as well as the wit - that came with the getting-to-know-you opening section of "Sorcerer's Stone."  As compensation, "Chamber of Secrets" offers a better overall storyline and a greater sense of mystery.<p>Devotees of the novels will require no plot iteration here.  Suffice it to say that, in this installment, Harry becomes involved with unearthing the deep dark secret that has the whole Hogwarts Academy in an uproar - a secret involving a mysterious hidden chamber, the death of a student 50 years previous, and an assortment of creatures and monsters that Harry must battle in order to save the school and everyone in it.  This film appears to be far darker in tone than the original, so much so that one wonders if very young children might not be unduly disturbed by some of the proceedings.  For adults, the darkness may make the whole thing a little less cutesy and a little more palatable than the first time around.  <p>Once again, director Chris Columbus has gathered a veritable who's-who of wonderful British performers to flesh out his enormous gallery of characters.  Of the seasoned veterans, the late Richard Harris (in what turns out to be his final screen appearance in fact) brings a quiet dignity to the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and Maggie Smith provides just the proper balance of humanity and stiff-upper-lipped starchiness in the part of Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.  Kenneth Branagh, cut loose from his Shakespearean shackles, seems to be having the time of his life, hamming it up as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a vain charlatan who makes the Wizard of Oz look like the soul of veracity.  Of the neophytes, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are still wonderful as Harry and his buddy, Ronald, but, alas, Emma Watson's role as the spunky Hermione has been sadly minimized in this story for she seems to be off screen more often than not during much of this movie's action.  That's a real shame.<p>In the special effects department, "Chamber of Secrets" does a first-rate job bringing much of the story's magic to life on the screen.  The superb art direction and set design help to create an entire world where witchcraft and sorcery are commonplace occurrences.  Cinematographer Roger Platt brings a nice burnished glow to the film's look, particularly in the castle interiors, which always seem to be lit by soft candlelight.  John Williams' musical score never hits the heights of his great works ("The Empire Strikes Back," "E.T." etc.), but it is adequate to the task at hand.<p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" won't exactly carry you away in the way that the great fantasy films invariably do, but it does make for a couple of diverting hours nonetheless.  Considering what else is out there at the moment, that may be the highest praise one can offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>This second Harry Potter film is a fine adventure, and this two-disk DVD edition has fun features. Disc One contains the film (you have to purchase widescreen or fullscreen rather than getting both on one disc -- what's up with that?), which can be heard in English or Spanish, or read in English, Spanish or French. The disc also contains a cast and crew listing (which includes neither Moaning Myrtle nor Mr. Weasley!); a theatrical trailer; and an entertaining synopsis trailer of the first film.<p>Disc Two navigates easily and contains a number of good items, including: an enlightening 16-minute conversation with author Rowling and screenwriter Kloves; charming interview snippets from virtually every speaking actor; production sketches; a photo gallery; a 17-minute behind-the-scenes featurette of the production team as they tackle Dumbledore's Office; Lockhart's Classroom, a facsimile replete with certificates, books and pictures all concerning Magical Him; a quiz; an interactive tour of Diagon Alley that lumbers a bit through Navigation Alley but contains clever images; and two games, one getting through the Chamber of Secrets, the other navigating the flying car through the forest -- the latter looks really fabulous. Nineteen additional scenes are available, and they are a lot of fun. I wish several had been used in the theatrical release, including a fine bridge between (a) Hermione's telling Harry he could, indeed, be the heir of Slytherin, and (b) Harry's feeling the curious stares of his housemates; the scene is beautiful -- Harry looking forlornly out over a Lake District-y looking place. I think it's a scene that could easily have been overplayed, but Radcliffe pulled it off nicely.  It convinced me that Radcliffe may grow in the role and benefit from another director.  (I'd love to see Tim Burton tackle an instalment!)  I think all three young leads are better this time around, and of course the entire supporting cast is flawless. Sets and props are inspired, and the effects are breathtaking. Tom Riddle's wordy denouement is less successful on the screen than it was in the book, but therein lies the difference in the mediums. <p>All in all, I'd say this DVD set is lots of fun. The film is very good and the extras are quite entertaining. <p>Caveat: the movie may be too intense for young viewers, people who don't like spiders, or people who don't like snake-ish things.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>This Harry Potter installment has more story, more intrigue. The conflict Harry has concerning his "true nature" is very effective.<br /><br />The young actors all give fine performances, and the special effects are top notch. Some of the "creatures" may be too intense for very young children.<br /><br />A must for any fantasy DVD collection.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<br /><br />The film begins with young Harry being oppressed by his step-parents: they want to control his life!!! Harry wants to run around with his friends (who are driving without a license). This film panders to teenagers by portraying parents as stupid, when in fact it is teenagers who are ignorant of the dangers that can occur in the real world. The computer generated images are better than in the previous film; full of sound and fury to accompany meaningless action. Special effects are not a substitute for a good story. The British class system is alive and well in Warthogs; the "mudbloods" are kept in their place. (Or is the gender discrimination experienced by the author?)<br /><br />The interpersonal conflicts between Harry and Malfoy lead to a duel before the school. Then Harry finds a petrified student ("stone drunk"?) There is a trick where they change shapes and acquire information not meant for them. Someone vandalizes Harry's room and steals a diary. Then Hermione becomes another petrified student (from boredom?). Haggrid becomes a suspect, Harry visits the monster spider deep in the woods. The magic car allows them to escape. The teacher expected to act against the danger tries to run away. [This teaches children to not believe the stories they are told.]<br /><br />The Secret Chamber is found by magic, and boys leap to discover the secrets. The secret of the villain is revealed. Harry fights and kills a giant snake! There is a final confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who dies by magic. This story seems weak and confuse. Those who enjoyed it can have their viewpoint. [This film seems to have more British expressions than in the earlier film.]</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Once again, there's no point for me to tell the plot of this because everyone knows it but I just want to get my point accross. While this book was my least favorite of the first 3, somehow, this movie was brilliant. I was sucked in from the start when I saw Dobby. Dooby was brilliantly created and is like a cute version of the evil Golem. Dobby was wonderfully brought to life. Once again, the movie had great acting, not by Daniel Radcliffe especially but by the wonderful Alan Rickman. But, I'm sure kids reading this review have no idea who he is.<br /><br />This movie is simply an excellent family movie. It's great fun and turns a solid but average book somehow into an excellent family movie. So, enjoy yourselves kids, because this is going to be the best Harry Potter movie of the franchise, period. How do I know? I don't but the rest of the books are too long to put into a movie that isn't boring. Chris Columbus directed two good movies, this one much better than the first, but I'm sorry, now that he's not the director, I think that this franchise is going to take a turn for the worst. Especially after seeing the third movie. Yikes!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; pulls off something that only &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; has done.  It's better than the first film!  Not only is the story more interesting(though the first was tops as well), it's packed with even more wonder and imagination than the first as well.  The castmembers of the first flick return, as well as Kenneth Branagh in a superb performance as Lockhart, the bumbling, vain writer of &quot;Magical Me.&quot;<p>I'm sure the naysayers had a wonderful time bashing this sequel for its evil undertones.  Students get &quot;petrified&quot; and the basilisk takes shots at Harry, but all in all, Harry prevails.  He makes the right choices, does the good deeds and fights a good fight.  How dare he promote such horrible values!<p>Please folks, I used up a lot of space harping on how kids need to have fun in my review of the first film.  The same applies to this movie as well.  Don't worry about your kid becoming a warlock or praying to Satan, just let them have a little fun.  If you raise them right, you won't have to worry about any of that anyway.<p>The &quot;Potter&quot; books encourage kids to read and use their imagination.  That's a good thing in my book.  The movies encourage kids to use their imaginations as well.  <p>You've just got to love something that promotes so many good things.  We need more heroes like Harry.  He's a good character to let your kids read about and watch on the big screen.  He's caring to others, takes his studies reasonably serious(you might want to promote Hermione's study habits to your kids, though) and he always tries to do the right thing.<p>Overall this movie is fun and enjoyable for the whole family.  Some of the scenes might scare the little ones, but this movie is worth explaining those scenes in order to get the message across.  <p>Watch this one and have a ton of fun.  It's great for everybody.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>The magical world of Harry Potter is revisited with the second film in the series that digs deeper into mysteries of the wizard world. The original film, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone, was met with huge hype and an enormous response from the movie-going public. The film broke almost every box office record in the book. Unfortunately those records didn't last long as they were quickly broken by the release of Spider-Man in May 2002. But could The Chamber of Secrets offer a threat to the famous web slinger? Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets hopes to follow in the foot steps of the original though it appears to be much darker then the first film. Hopes are that many of the fans won't be alienated by the change. But the question is whether the film can hold up better the original or will it show that the original was just a mere fluke and change is not good for the series?<p>The story focuses on Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the problems that ensue around the young wizard. Harry Potter has been spending the summer at his uncle and aunt's house and desires to return back to the school with his friends. But that may not be so easy. Apparently a house elf named Dobby has reason to believe that great danger will fall upon Mr. Potter if he returns, so he does everything he can to prevent Potter from returning to Hogwarts. When he is able to make it back to his school, strange things start happening. Harry begins to hear voices in the empty hallways, water begins flooding the halls, and Harry is able to communicate with snakes. Not only that but people have been found petrified and a rumor is spreading that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened once again. It is up to Harry and his group of friends to protect Hogwarts from impending danger within the school itself. The story for The Chamber of Secrets is much darker then the original Harry Potter but that is what makes it great. The darkness of the plot shows that the film makers are willing to make their films more mature as their audience gets older. The plot keeps the audience interested in every aspect of the movie despite the long time length.<p>A good amount of the cast from Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone reprise their roles in the second film. The acting within the film was much better then in the original film as many of the cast members have grown more into their roles and feel more comfortable, which is quite evident within the film. Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry Potter and once again he is fabulous in the role. He showcases a broad range of emotions within the film which is rarely seen in a film intended for children and does a much better job at showcasing his acting talent then he did in the original. Richard Harris, in his last major role in a motion picture, is wonderful once again as Professor Dumbledore. Harris is one of the greatest British actors that have ever appeared on screen and it is wonderful to see him go out in such a great way as in this role. There are too many roles within this film to mention each by name but the cast is very well put together and there were very few problems. The only problem was the character of Ronald Weasley. There was no problem with the person who played him but actions of the character itself. In the original film Ronald was sort of mixed character having both comic moments as well as serious ones but he has now been reduced to a comedic character, which is quite disappointing.<p>Overall, Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best movies of the year and goes beyond the expectations of a normal sequel. The magical world of Harry Potter is brought back to life better then ever before. Though the film is much darker then the original, that does seem to affect the overall effect of the series. The darker moments actually make the film feel more exciting and make the audience feel more connected to the characters and what happens to them. The film definitely matures with the audience the Harry Potter series seems to connect to but doesn't do so in such a dramatic way that some fans are alienated by rapid change. Though the film is near perfection, there are flaws to it. The running time of the picture, which stands at an amazing two hours and forty minutes, seems too long for a film intended for children though it did help tell the story better then if it had been edited down to a shorter time length. There were many amazing CG special effect sequences but not all the CGI was greatly appreciated. The character of Dobby the house elf is sure to be added to the most annoying CG character list for this year. He seemed fine for the plot of the film but for the most part, he was too annoying and distracting for the purpose of the story. Other then those problems, Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets definitely raises the bar not only for children films but for sequels as well. This film is a delightful film for all ages, though some precaution may be needed for the younger fans of Harry Potter as the film has several frightening moments. One of the few films out there that truly lives up to all the hype of the original and even goes beyond expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>In many many franchises &amp; trilogies, the 2nd movie is the weakest in the series. Fortunately for us, this isn't the case here.<p>The most noticeable thing (well, except for the boys' voice changing) was the fact that the younger actors' acting has improved tremendously (esp. Daniel Radcliffe, while Rupert Grint can use a little more help...). The adaptation of the story was much better this time, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Swish and flick--reviewus commencius!  OK, so I've done the theatrical release review a day after its debut.  What's the point of doing the video version, apart from the fact it popped up in my Amazon recommendations?  Maybe it's the fact that I've seen this so many times after it came out on video.<p>Those who have read the book already know the plot of the movie, but for those who haven't, here goes.  In his second year at Hogwarts, Harry hears an ominous voice speaking of blood and killing only audible to him.  Ms. Norris, caretaker Argus Filch's cat, is found petrified.  Colin Greevey, a first-year student and a bug-eyed admirer of Harry, suffers the same fate, as do others.  A blood-scrawled message reads:  "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened.  Enemies of the heir beware."  <p>There's also a new teacher of Dark Arts, Gilderoy Lockhart, a handsome but vain self-promoter whose books are required textbooks for his class.  And as for his classroom competence--don't ask!<p>The continuing antagonism between Harry and his nemesis Draco Malfoy is ratcheted up a notch, as Malfoy becomes Slytherin's Quidditch Seeker.  However, pal Ron Weasley's unassertive personality basically has him as a follower of Harry and Hermione.  And Hermione more than ever proves to be a valuable linchpin of support via magical knowhow.  The friendship between the three become tighter, as does their rapport with Rubeus Hagrid, the giant gamekeeper, especially when Draco hurts Hermione's feelings by calling her a derogatory word.<p>The four main young actors, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Tom Felton (Draco) all show signs of that critical transition of adolescence, that dynamic increase in height and deepening of voices (for the males anyway).  All though have made the characters their own without altering Rowling's book.  Radcliffe in particular is more confident than ever without losing that enthusiastic smile. Emma Watson once again takes top honours as Hermione, prettier and more self-assured than ever.  Tip to Warner Bros:  treat her like royalty and pay her whatever she wants--she's invaluable.<p>Themes in this movie (and the book) include some Nazi overtones of pure-blooded wizards being superior than Muggle-born (those born of non-magical families).  And the Minister of Magic's reactions against pro-pure blood wizard Lucius Malfoy's machinations is reminiscent of Neville Chamberlain appeasing Hitler at Munich.<p>Of the adult actors, Richard Harris-(R.I.P.) (Dumbledore) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) still shine as the supportive providers, but Jason Isaacs steals the show, portraying Lucius Malfoy as a menacing force to be reckoned with, complete in flowing blonde hair, black robes and snakehead cane.  Kenneth Branagh (Lockhart) isn't bad.  Shirley Henderson gets kudos as the snivelling ghost Moaning Myrtle, who gets a laugh once in the movie.<p>CGI effects make filming of the Harry Potter movies good timing, and the fast-paced Quidditch match isn't the same numbing blur of movement that plagues today's action movies.  Face it, had the movie been filmed two decades earlier, the realization of Hogwarts, the Quidditch match, and certain monsters would've looked pathetic using Ray Harryhausen special effects.<p>The Chamber of Secrets tops the original in character development, story, and competent performances.  In terms of content and scenery, the film is slightly darker than the first, but the overly sentimental finale makes up for those moments.  My recommendation is read the books first, then watch the movies.  Both are enjoyable, but read the book and play it out as if you were watching the movie.  It's great that way.<p>Oh yes.  Darker will definitely apply to the third film, The Prisoner of Azkaban, which I will definitely go see on opening day next year.  What about you?  Swish and flick--finite reviewus!</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>So i have to say, this is one of the rare times that I liked the movie better than the book.  That's not to say the book isn't good, they're all pretty fantastic, but I've never cared for the second as much as I have some of the other ones.  And speaking of second, if you haven't read the first book or watched the first movie what on earth are you doing reading this?  Go check those out!<br /><br />The Chamber of Secrets explores Harry's second year at Hogwarts.  Rescued from his muggle aunt and uncle by Ron and his brothers, he heads to Ron's house to await the start of the term.  But things keep going from bad to worse and when he can't get to the train, he and Ron decide to take a magical car to Hogwarts, with mixed results.  From there other strange things begin happening at Hogwarts and it's hurting the students, especially the Muggle born ones.  Harry and Co. can't help but get mixed into the problem and adventures abound!<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe:  Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Kenneth Branagh: Gilderoy Lockhart<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Richard Harris: Albus Dumbledore<br />Jason Isaacs: Lucius Malfoy<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br />Tom Felton: Draco Malfoy<br /><br />As usual I thought the cast did a superb job.  Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson make a great team and have wonderful camaraderie on the set.  Each plays their part exactly as you envision from the book.  Branagh was ok, I guess I just pictured something different for Lockhart and while he does pull of the smarmy self-centered aspect well, there was just something there missing for me.  The same with Harris, I really wish Dumbledore would play a larger role in these movies, but his screentime seems to be limited.  All of the supporting cast were pretty good though and I can't think of any I'd wish to replace with someone else.  They certainly bring the wizards and witches of Harry Potter to life.<br /><br />The plot was pretty well paced.  As said before I liked the movie better than the book for this one (not by much, but a little) and even though it followed the book pretty well, this one just seemed to be more exciting.  Especially the action scenes, not to spoil too much, but I'm not a big fan of spiders and definitely got creeped out by the ones in this movie.  There were a couple things from the book that I wish had been included, but I understand the limitation of time and that they can't fit everything in there.  I also liked that they paid attention to the detail of the books down to the moving pictures and foods in the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent, as usual.  I like how they incorporate magic and even the Quidditch looks real.  Makes you want to grab a broomstick and jump off your balcony (just kidding of course!).  It's amazing what they were able to do considering how much of the movie had to be generated and yet it still looks life like.  The music too is wonderful, and the instrumentals that accompany every Harry Potter movie are chilling yet exciting at the same time.  I don't think it would be a worthwhile movie without the music actually.  It's just as big of a part as the plot is.<br /><br />Great movie, great series.  Can't wait to watch the next!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>Chamber of Secrets is of course the adaptation of the second book in the successful Harry Potter series, and finds the gang at Hogwarts racing to uncover a great evil that has been released upon the students again. In terms of translating the book to film, 'Chamber' is much more successful than the original, if only because the story is more focused and there is a stronger, hands-on climax that gives Harry something to do. In comparison to the third and fourth films, Chamber of Secrets was also the last movie where major chunks of the original story were not cut out or re-written. There are bits missing, but they aren't as obvious. It also started the trend of the series taking on a darker tone, so parents might want to watch this one with younger kids.<br /><br />Warner Bros did a decent job with the dvd edition. The film presentation is solid. The extras are a mix of kids games and useful production information. Not a huge ton of stuff, but worth checking out. In all, Chamber of Secrets is a successful continuation of the movie franchise. The stakes are greater than the first, and none of the magic world of Harry Potter has been lost. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>The second Harry Potter film begins as Harry and Ron fly a magic car to Hogwarts School, join their pal Hermione, and begin their second year of wizarding studies. They meet their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the celebrated wizard hero, Gilderoy Lockhart, but he may not be all he claims to be. Several people are attacked and petrified, and the culprit is "the heir of Slytherin" who controls a monster that lives in the "Chamber of Secrets." As Harry tries to solve this mystery, he encounters giant spiders, a monstrous serpent, and he even faces a 16-year old Lord Voldemort in a finale that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe shines as 12-year old Harry, the orphan-hero, and he emerges as a real screen star.  He is much more confident and an all-round better actor than he was in the first movie. Rupert Grint (Ron) gets all the funny lines and proves himself a clever sidekick.  Emma Watson (Hermione) has a  smaller part this time, but is also very comfortable in front of the camera. Jason Isaacs plays the villain you love to hate, Lucius Malfoy.  I wish we saw more of him and of Kenneth Branaugh as the very funny Professor Lockhart.<br /><br />Harry Potter fans are sure to enjoy this installment, although it may be too scary for those under 7. If you like action-packed plots and really good special effects, you will not be disappointed.  The DVD includes hours of fun that includes  deleted scenes, interviews, and games.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I suppose I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed this film. I saw it in the theater when it was new, and I've played the DVD several times since I bought it over five years ago. But I had indeed forgotten some of the nuances which I enjoyed so much. So rather than spend much time on the basic plot, which you probably already know for the most part, let me tell you of some of the things that struck me as especially fine.<br /><br />I love the special effects that created Dobby. It is through him that we know what a house elf is, even though when we meet Kreature later on, and Winky too, they are rather different. But Dobby is a fully developed character, not just a special effect. He has personality, moves like a living being, and turns out to have a good bit of magic of his own. Aside from the regulars we met in the first movie, I think Dobby may be my favorite.<br /><br />I am also impressed by Tom Riddle. We'll see him again later, too, when Dumbledore shows Harry some of his memories. But this 16-year-old Riddle is charming in a horrible way, and very impressive in a way similar to Anakin Skywalker. We not only see him as a villain, but get an opportunity to glimpse how he got that way.<br /><br />Richard Harris plays Dumbledore again, and is truly lovable in his way. Not that I have anything against the guy who replace him, but he remains my visual and auditory image of Dumbledore.<br /><br />Then there is the fool of the piece, Gilderoy Lockhart. If that isn't every ego-mad idiot you've ever known all rolled into one, what is? Of course, underneath his fake reputation is a coward. Seems like that's often the case.<br /><br />It may be just my imagination, but I don't think this one suffered as much in the transformation from book to movie. The basic elements are there, and we get visual images to attach to them when we go back to reading the books. Lucius Malfoy makes a terrific villain, doesn't he? And my favorite Dumbledore quote is there, reworded only a little: "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." Important for all of us to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition) is the second part of the Harry Potter series and a dandy of a movie. The second year of Hogwarts is about to begin and Harry Potter is warned by a small house elf not to return. This starts an amazing adventure filled with magic and fun.

A deeper story which introduces extremely compelling characters and storylines, this movie really begins the push toward maturity that defines the series' overall trajectory.<br /><br />Here, Harry begins to see the cracks in Hogwarts' supposed status as a safe haven, and learns even more about his nemesis Lord Voldemort.  The character is given a brilliant human backstory through the discovery of a magical diary which mysteriously leads Harry on a quest to do battle with(SPOILER)the malevolent memory of Voldemort's human self.<br /><br />Returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint must carry an even meatier story on this second film, and their performances grow as surely as themselves.  Each actor is able to convey a wide range of emotions, but it's Radcliffe who truly owns Harry Potter with his performance here.  He brings a self-assurance and talent to the role worthy of actors two and three times his age.  In the final performance of his life, Richard Harris is subdued yet gently authoritative as Albus Dumbledore.  Dame Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are standouts as Professors McGonagall and Snape, respectively.  Series newcomers Kenneth Branagh, Toby Jones, and Jason Isaacs all give terrific performances.  These three actors especially add the creative flavor the first movie misses.  Their characters Gilderoy Lockhart, Dobby, and Lucious Malfoy, Draco's hateful father, give the series more themes to address.  Mr. Issacs in particular is superbly cold.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is a promising second chapter in arguably the most creative fantasy movie series of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This second instalment of harry potter is awesome. this movie is great.

I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart. He's well played and adds humor to the movie. Hagrid's character also gets some more development.<br /><br />I'm not as crazy about the plot. It's a bit too convoluted, and much of it is never really explained well (even after watching "Half-Blood Prince," I still don't understand how Voldemort could have controlled Ginny Weasley or lived through a book). Dobby was really annoying. He's way too dramatic and a sadomasochist to boot. Would anybody really believe that programming a ball to attack and almost kill Harry Potter was really going to succeed in keeping him away from Hogwarts? It just doesn't add up.<br /><br />Also, the basilisk and spiders were somewhat disappointing and pretty dull. The spiders aren't as exciting as Shelob in Lord of the Rings. The basilisk was somewhat believable, but sometimes looked like a big movie prop. Maybe a special edition could be released with better monster designs.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably tied with "Half-Blood Prince" as my least favorite in the series.

It worked for Lord of the Rings and they STILL cut out a lot from the books (though they did embelish a little in Two Towers by bringing in the Elves at Helm's Deep but I digress). The young cast has aged a little, clearly for the young men (they're voices are starting to get deeper). Though, to me anyways as I haven't read the books in a while, it gets a little tiring of Ron Weasley being reduced to the comedic sidekick. I know he is one, but not all need to be used for comedic relief. The elder cast is still perfect for their respective roles and Kenneth Branagh is excellent as the ego-centric Lockhart. Again, they could've trimmed up a few things; Harry didn't need to look at every little thing in the Weasley's home (despite the fact that he's not used to magic homes), Ron's slug scene could've been eliminated, some characters that're important in the novel (like Justin and Colin [who at least is important in later books]) are glanced over and are only petrified as that's what happens to them in the book. Still no Peeves (the one character I'm glad they decide to cut out as he adds nothing to the story) and instead of they're ghostly Magical History teacher giving the speech on the Chamber, its McGonagall, which I think is a better switch as they're history teacher is hardly ever mentioned once or twice in the books anyway. Action scenes and CGI are better in this than the last, Dobby and the Basilisk being the highlights of the computer charcters. And hardly any new music from John Williams, who's music from the first film is pretty much tracked to this.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is a fun movie even though it suffers from some of the vices of the first movie in the series and not participating in the virtues of the subsequent films.<br /><br />There are some things that are better in this film than the first. In particular, Daniel Radcliffe evidences enormous improvement as an actor. And because there is less set up in this one than in the first film, they are able to delve more directly into storytelling. And as in the first film, Hogwarts is rendered memorably. Still, the film is in many ways a disappointment. Chris Columbus's direction was as weak in the second as in the first and either he or the film's editor had to take responsibility for the terrible pacing in many of the film's scenes. On every level, all subsequent films would be better directed and edited. One might quibble over the script, but not the direction and editing. Future films would not drag in individual scenes like in this one.<br /><br />I do, however, have a lot of problem with the script for this film. Any adaptation of a novel by a movie has to make compromises. Still, ultimately the script has to function as an independent entity. The problem here was the abrupt and inelegant shifts from one scene to another, with no foreshadowing of what would come later or thematic repetition. Few parts of the screenplay resonate with other parts of the screenplay. Now, this very possibly is not the fault of the screenwriter. Directors and editors can radically alter screenplays during the course of filming. so unless we could see the original screenplay and to what degree it was preserved in the filming it is hard to blame the screenwriter. We blame the director. If what was filmed was the writer produced, a writer should have been brought in to fix it. I suspect that the director made changes. Who can say for sure. But one thing is for sure: the film has almost no narrative flow. And as an adaptation of a novel is does a poor job of maintaining its key themes.<br /><br />Luckily, the movies got much, much better. THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is by any standard a great film, the best directed film in the series, while the later films were buoyed by very substantive stories. The movies are not nearly as good as the books. That is pretty much par for the course. There have been very, very few movies in the history of film that were better than the novels upon which they were based, except in cases where the novels were not very to begin with.<br /><br />One of the more humorous sidelights of the film was that some Russians took offense at the film, imagining that the elf Dobby was intended to look like Vladimir Putin. Some Russian lawyers for a while even contemplated taking legal action. There appears to be little justification for such an action. Whatever resemblance between Dobby and Putin would be strictly physical and Dobby in no other way would appear to refer to Putin. I personally think the easily offended lawyers needed to bash their heads a few times on their desks as penance for their silliness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>This follows the legendary first HP movie as well as could have been expected. It is not a few months after the end of Part 1, and Harry is spending his last few days with the Durselys. They are of course still abusive to him. Harry is wondering why he has not heard from his friends. Harry then gets an unexpected guest Dobby who accidentally reveals that he has been hiding Harry's letters.<br /><br />Later, Harry and Ron are unable to get to Platform 9 3/4 which makes them realize that something is up. They make it to school, but end up making the cold/virtuous Snape angry. (He has some valid reasons for his anger here.)<br /><br />Moving on, we meet Ron's sister Ginny, who takes a liking to harry. We also meet Kenneth Brannagh's character. (A writer who seems friendly enough and appears skilled in Defense Against Dark Arts.) Despite his boasting though, we see Snape knock him out easily. At times, Brannagh seems to want to help, but he ends up making matters worse. (Such as when he tries to fix Harry's broken arm, but makes the bones disappear.)<br /><br />the major suspense of this movie has to do with the chamber of secrets. Throughout the film, certain parties (including Hermonie) get paralyzed. We see creepy writing on the walls, and Harry gets a hold of Tom Riddle's diary and learns that the kindhearted Hagrid has a questionable past.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Hagrid is arrested, and Dumbledore is suspended. Harry and Ron go to Hagrid's friend for help, but they find his gratefulness to Hagrid for saving his life does not extend to Hagrid's friends. Tensions rise when Ron's sister Ginny disappears. This leads to a climactic showdown between Harry and a dark wizard we know quite well.<br /><br />If you liked Part 1, don't miss this great sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>I read an interview with Ray Bradbury once where he said that the best way to adapt his books was to simply "stuff the pages into the camera."  This is what has been done with the Harry Potter adaptations so far and the results are wonders to behold.  <p>Chamber of Secrets may be even better than Sorcerer's Stone.  The first film was the introduction, this film provides a very solid plot, even as we meet new characters, some of whom will only be in this film (Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Instructor, is a safe revelation.  Each teacher only lasts a year.)<p>Others are welcome returns, especially Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid.  But Richard Harris, in his final film, sadly looked tired and worn out, gamely going on with the show even if he wasn't feeling up to it.  Of course the scenario did require all of the characters to undergo a great deal of stress so in context of the movie it works.  The actors seem to have settled into their roles very comfortably and deliver strong performances throughout.<p>This movie is darker and scarier than the first one with better special effects.  The plot follows Harry on his 2nd year at Hogwarts where students start to be found in a petrified state -- frozen solid.  Harry also starts to hear a slithering voice saying "Kill kill," and is often the first on the scene, making him a prime suspect.  The words "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened" are written on the wall at the scene of the first attack, deepening the mystery for our hero.  He and his friends Ron and Hermione must find out what the Chamber of Secrets is in order to save Hogwarts.<p>The film runs 2 hours and 41 minutes, which is long for an alleged children's movie.  But, although I often believe that most movies released during the past few years have tended to be too long, this is one of the exceptions.  J.K. Rowling fashioned a very well constructed novel where everything played a part, from the flying car and Ron's younger sister at the beginning, to Hagrid's continued fascination with exotic creatures to Dobby the House Elf causing muschief for Harry Potter, to Draco Malfoy taunting Hermione to Moaning Myrtle who haunts a girls' lavatory.  There was nothing that could be cut and keep the story coherent.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>This was even better than the book and the first movie. You will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>While it still retains many of the elements that continue to make of the series a children's classic, I liked the second installment more than the "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" movie. The beginning was a little repetitive in some ways (Harry's family, the train departure, etc.) but past that, the movie took on a life of its own and became very enjoyable, with a whole plot woven around the existence of a terrible hidden Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts. Some elements I found to be rather interesting were the uninvited house-elf (Dobby) and Dumbledore's beautiful Phoenix bird. Obviously deserved praise for the ingenious characters and their surroundings belongs to J.K. Rawling, the author of the books, but the movie in itself is capable to deliver a whole world of effects that blend very well into the brilliant story. With Mexican-born Alfonso Cuaron directing the next installment, the Potter movies promise to only get better with time, quite an accomplishment for sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>This movie is as good as the book on which it's based. It's surprisingly faithful, though I wish they'd have let the audience know more about Ginny Weasley's crush on Harry Potter. It's as good as the first movie, occasionally it's even better. <p>But the reason I'm writing this review is to warn people that, though &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is excellent cinema, some of it is downright scary. The spider chase scene is genuinely frightening, and moments involving a giant snake could be too much for little kids to take.<p>Watch it before you show it to younger kids. That way, you end up catching a good movie twice, and you can determine whether your kids should watch it at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>They got it about 85% right in the first Harry Potter movie; they got it 110% right in the second one.  "Chamber of Secrets" is a marvelous fun-ride that in some ways outdoes the book.  The cast is back, with one great, sinister addition.  Harry is a deeper character this time around; he's stronger, more sure of himself, starting to realize his potential; he's going to be a force to be reckoned with.  Ron is more grown-up now that he has his little sister Ginny to look after at school.  Hermione is less whiny and know-it-all than she was in the first movie; she's nicer to have around this year.  And a wonderfully malevolent addition to the cast this time around is Lucious Malfoy, Draco's evil father.  We can see where the kid got his mean streak from; Dad is so evil he's almost demonic.  The movie is a lot more fun to watch than the first one; we dispense with the boring muggles (after Dobby the house-elf has played havoc with the family by crashing a party and dropping a cake on a guest's head) and go zooming back to Hogwarts in a flying (stolen, but so what?) car.  Wow, does it feel great to be back!  Only this year, the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden room known only to its creator, Salazar Slytherin, and his star pupil, the young You-Know-Who, has been opened after fifty years, and the resulting mayhem threatens to close Hogwarts for good.<p>The film runs for a good two and a half hours, but at such a clip that it seems a fraction of that time.  The special effects are better than they were in the first movie and add to the excitement.  What really makes "Chamber of Secrets" a better movie than its predecessor is that while "Sorcerer's Stone" seemed to keep looking over its shoulder to make sure it was following the book correctly, "Chamber" just kicks back and has a ball; this movie knows where it's going and it takes us along for a thrilling ride.  One walks out of the theater wanting to walk right back in and see it all over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>Summer vacation is a dreaded time for Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) as it means having to endure the histronics of his mean aunt and uncle. Returning back to his Hogwarts School of Witchcraft would seem a much wiser option but Dobby the House Elf warns him of "a plot to make most terrible things" is in the brewing. With disregard of the warning, the boy wizard begins his sophomore year at the school of magic - and things happen - when his schoolmates are 'petrified' into statues. In fact this is only the beginning when he later takes on gigantic spiders, screeching mandrakes, Fawkes the phoenix and the fearsome Basilisk. <p>The second entry adapted from J.K Rowling's legacy has neither the epic sweep of the fourth book (The Goblet of fire) nor the mystery of the third (The Prisoner of Azkaban) but is nonetheless an engaging adventure and a riveting story. What's more with director Chris Colombus at the helm who shows more precision and familiarity after his first attempt, Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is a majestic adventure filled with visionary sets and fluid CGI effects that astonishingly enhance the darker fantasy tale and adventure. The soaring adventure thrills with its enshrouding perils, awesome moments of wonder and enlightening morality and friendship. <p>It thus resembles more of an awkward adolescence stage in this saga for the three main casts. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grinch as Harry, Hermoine and Ron reprises their role with the loss of their innocence along with veterans Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, the late Richard Harris as the benevolent headmaster Dumbledore, Robbie Coltrane as giant Hagrid and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. The new interlopers are equally scene-grabbing in their own rights: Kenneth Branagh does a rib-tickling interpretation of braggadocio Gilderoy Lockheart as well as Jason Issacs as the wicked Lucius Malfoy.<p>With a solidly ensembled cast and sumptuous sets, the second installment is fascinatingly entertaining as it is enchanting enough to sustain its 3 long hours without any misgivings.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>Was JK embarrassed by this blunder? egad this was truly a dissapointment, and the delusion that it was fine cinema, or five stars is only on the track of it having Potter as a label. Potter fans around the globe would give it accolades even if Freddie Prinze Jr was playing Severus Snape.<br /><br />A poorly executed screenplay, the CGI was adolescent, in a world now taken over by the mass marketed Transformers and the like, you think they would have called Stan Wintson in for some fun, this was truly a first year at the New York Film Academy type work. The plot was acerebral. Rupert Grint is wooden, plastic and insignificant. There was absolutely no character development from jumpstreet, and equally no suspense.<br /><br />We are yoked into believing that because it's Harry Potter it's going to be good. I am such a huge fan of the book series, and naturally the books are usually better than the films, but [this] compared to the book, was a true washout. Personally I find Branagh a superb method actor, he played a fine Hamlet and his movies are very thoughtout and distinctive, however the miscast here is evident, as he was unmoving, and commonplace.<br /><br />In closing the whole package seemed rushed, irrelevant, unbecoming of the worldwide sensation of Rowling's, uh, epics?, and like Augusten's "Running With Scissors", definitely stick to the book.<br /><br />A two star rubbish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I think Chamber of Secrets is a step back from the first and third movie.  It begins on a high note but turns dry 45 minutes later ("dry" by Potter standards).  From that point, it never really recovers.  However, the mysterious story and the dark atmosphere (in some moments, overwhelming darkness not far from a horror flick!) really make it stand out from the other Potter movies.  Probably my least favorite of the Potter films but worth buying indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", the second Harry Potter film in the series, was the first bit of the Harry Potter phenomenon I was every exposed to. I'd kind of avoided the boy wizard before then, but after seeing it those couple of years ago, even though I didn't entirely follow what was what and who was who, I realized it was pretty entertaining. After reading the second book recently, I picked up the DVD and watched it again. The series gets a little darker, like the books do, but unlike the book, I don't think the jump is as large, which I reckon is a good thing. Though I prefer the first film, it's still good to watch.<br /><br />It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) second year at Hogwart's wizards school, and after a shaky summer, he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot. It seems a certain Heir of Slytherin has opened the legendary Chamber of Secrets, loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students, literally! Many fingers point to Harry, Harry's finger points to Malfoy, and Ron's wand... well that doesn't point at all, as its broken and backfiring. What's this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders, haunted toilets, a rogue Quidditch bludger and a self-flagellating house elf? Can Harry, Ron and Hermione figure things out?<br /><br />All the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film, plus the boys' voices are breaking. In some scenes they're kind of croaky sounding, in other scenes they have their child voice, and in others their voices broken through, not neccesarily in that order. There's a couple of new kids, (like Colin Creevey) and they are just as well cast as the others. The new adults are well cast too. Though not my favorite performance of his career, Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh makes an interesting Gilderoy Lockhart, the vain second year dark arts teacher. He played it a lot more subtley than I expected him to. Ex-Fast Show comedian Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, which I reckon was a great choice. I missed some of the cast from the last film though. You hardly see Warwick Davis (who plays Professor Flitwick), let alone hear him say anything, and John Cleese's Nearly Headless Nick, who has a rather significant deathday party in the book, has hardly anything to do here except get petrified.<br /><br />There were other things cut out too, like the catching of the garden gnomes at the Weasley's. The fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though. Personally, I like to think of the Harry Potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion, rather like the pictures in the world of Hogwarts. They give an idea of what the book would look like, an impression.<br /><br />Special features include an interview with author J.K. Rowling and script writer Steve Kloves, as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors. There's also slick virtual tours through Diagon Alley, Dumbledore's Office and Gilderoy Lockhart's Classroom (a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is, complete with gushing praises from the narrator). There's also a couple of games: you can visit the Chamber of Secrets after answering some Harry Potter trivia, you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest (which I found frustrating but addictive). There's also a trivia game about what spell does what too. Unlike the first DVD, you don't have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes, you're able to go to them straight from the main menu. Just as well, there's 19 of them, and some of them are pretty significant. Notable scenes include Harry's close encounter with the Malfoys in the dark magic shop, Harry discovering that Filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence. I wish they'd left some of these scenes in, particularly the ones where Harry Potter questions his nature, is he a good wizard or a bad wizard. That was some mighty fine character development cut there! There's also a gallery of design drawings and a section called "Colin Creevey's Darkroom" where you can select pictures of various characters, then play them in a slideshow of sorts.<br /><br />Apparently there's a whole stack of stuff in the DVD ROM features, but I just couldn't get them to work on my laptop's DVD drive. Using InterActual player (the player that many Warner Brothers films have you install to play their DVDs), it says there is a script error, and when I tried Windows Media Player 9 and Cyberlink PowerDVD 4.0, though it ran the DVD and everything else with it fine, the DVD acted as if it wasn't in a DVD ROM drive, telling me that if I put the DVD into my PC's drive I'd get all these wonderful features. It was in my DVD drive! Aggh! It IS in a DVD drive. Maybe its just my type of laptop (BenQ DH5100U, 1.5 Gigahertz). Ah well, it looked like it would have been really fun, especially for fans of the series.<br /><br />All in all, its definitely worth a look for Harry Potter fans, but I would recommend you read the book first.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is a good sequel to "Harry Potters and the Socerer's Stone". Much like the first movie, "Chamber of Secrets" is full of magic and fantasy. However, this film is much scarier than the first, something the surprised me a little. Even though I read the books, I was a little surprised by how graphic and violent some of the fight scenes were.<p>Even though some of the scenes may have been a little too much for younger children, I would still recommend watching this film. I doubt there is a Harry Potter fan out there who hasn't, but those of you who aren't, this is a film to at least check out.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets builds on what the first film did right and improves some of what it did wrong, providing an overall enjoyable, magical film for all ages.<p>With the opportunity this time to launch right into the story without the set-up and endless character introductions of the first Potter film, the Chamber of Secrets is able to focus on plot and improving the pacing problems of the Sorcerer's Stone. This one still, unfortunately, crams too much material from the novel into the film, proving that the filmmakers don't so much want to adapt it as recreate it verbatim (things that work on the printed page don't always work on the big screen). But what is plugged in this film does build a better cohesiveness then the Sorcerer's Stone.<p>The Potter kids are beginning to fill into their shoes the second time around, coming off as more confident in their popular roles. With deeper voices and early signs of becoming full fledged teenagers, the trio is becoming a group of talented youth. It seems that great things will come from them in subsequent films. The rest of the cast doesn't have nearly as much to do, and some talent, such as John Cleese's ghost of Nearly Headless Nick and Professor McGonnagall (Maggie Smith), seem wasted in what amount to cameo roles. But newcomers Kenneth Branagh as the ego-filled Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Issacs as the evil Lucious Malfoy both vividly recreate two of the novel's great secondary characters. The late Richard Harris is also great in his small but important and final role as headmaster.<p>This second story in the proposed seven-book Potter series is considered the weakest by most fans and critics, and much of the problems of the book are nearly unavoidable in the transfer to film. The similar plot from the first book and movie sticks out most prominently here. But with much of the pacing problems cleaned up this time around, the end result is a better film.<p>What I find most enjoyable in Chamber of Secrets is the darker tone of the story line. There are moments here that promise the series will become more disturbing in subsequent films, a process that will help the films avoid becoming stale retreads of each other.<p>For those that enjoyed the first Potter film, this one will more than live up to your expectations, providing another wonderful look into this magical world. Those who didn't care for the original adaptation probably won't like what this one has to offer, despite the slight improvements in story telling and pacing. But to not be able to enjoy these magical films at least on some level would be unfortunate, as it has the potential to bring out a youthful wonder and exuberance in even the most hardened adult.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>Since I didn't really care for the first movie of this seris to much I was expecting much from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I saw it because I being a fan of the books had to know what they did to it. The movie was longer then the first but much much better. There was a little more comendy which lightened it and it was much much darker. The director warned parents that it was going to be darker before the release and the darker subject made it more entertaining. The only dull moment in the movie was when the main characters found themselves in the Dark Forest with giant spiders. <p>Critic's hailed this movie not as good as the first but good so I was a little hesitant at that. But the actors being older and probally a little bit more like the character having pratice from the first one probally also made it enjoyable. <p>The movie is about Harry Potter(Danelle Radcliff) who recently found out that he was a wizard. He attended a school that teaches magic called Hogwarts and during the summer holidays he lives with two Muggles(non-magic people)called Veron and Petunia who are also his aunt and auncle. There son Dudley is always picking on Harry. When Veron has two people over to the house to set a deal it could be the biggest deal of his career. He tells Harry to stay in his room and not make a peep but that is when he is visited by Dobby the house elf. Dobby warns him not to go back to school because terrible things would happen. Harry says no and Dobby goes downstairs to the family and the guests and dumps a cake Petunia made right onto the guest's head. Venon outs bars on Harry's roof and keeps him inside his room. One night Harry is visited by his friend Ron and his two brother Fred and George who have come to pick him up in a flying car. Harry escapes and before he knows it is back at school a month later. Everything is normal at first. He goes to his classes and visits his friends. He also gets a new teacher. Gilaroy Lockhart who is a pompus writer to is always boasting about his experence with creatures like hags,vampires,werewolf,etc. Everything is fine untill written on the wall of on of the halls are the words THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPEN. ENIEMIS OF THE HEIR BEWARE! Now everybody is wondering what is going on and why some students are being petrified. <p>The best part about the movie is the humor that is brought to the screen by Lockharts's character. In the end Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fun film that is much better then the first one in everyway.<p>Also my condolences to Richard Harris who passed away two weeks before the release of the movie. Harris's last roles were Harry Potter and the Sorercer's Stone and The Count of Monte Cristo.

Who is the heir of Slytherin?

In the end,he confronts a giant snake,rescues Ginny,and battles Voldemort's younger,ghostly self.<br /><br />There are disturbing sequences-such as Harry&his friends being taught to cut up mandrake roots,which resemble infants. Harry also meets Moaning Myrtle,a girl who was killed in the bathroom.

Richard Harris plays Dumbledore, sadly for the last time, as he died, and Dumbledore is played by Michael Gambon after this movie. Kenneth Branagh plays the role of Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a convincing air of vanity, appearing airheaded most of the times, as should be.<br /><br />The effects are even better in this instalment than in the previous movie - the creatures especially Dobby the house elf,the Basilisk, and Aragog, the giant spider are true examples of great CGI effects.<br /><br />All in all, this is a worthy follow-up in the Harry Potter franchise, and a visual feast for the senses.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>I haven't read any of the books so far--although a book discussion group (adult level) I sponsor in my library has opted to make the first book in the seriew their April selection.  I caught the first movie in the series several months after its release, and although I was in any hurry to see it (or to see it again for that matter), I did find it enjoyable and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to most viewers.  Ditto this second entry. As far as family fare goes, in fact, the series is turning out to be just that--something the entire family might enjoy on various levels. These are films that parents (or other caregivers) can actually discuss with kids at some length, and parents, older siblings and other older Muggles are likely to get hooked enough to pick up the books as well. (OK, OK, as I said, I haven't as of yet, but I work in a library, so I know it happens!)<p>THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS has even better special effects than the first film, and the child actors seem more comfortable in their roles. And the distinguished adult cast members are all fine, and look as though they're having a ball. As others have noted, the film may be a little too dark for the very youngest viewers. It's also a bit on the long side, so younger children are likely to get antsy and older viewers, like me, may find themselves getting a little sleepy.  But it wraps up well. If I may be alowed one cynical observation it would be that, in the future, fantasy writers and screenwriters might want to ease up on the cutesy humanoid figures who refer to themselves --and others-- in the third person all the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn't overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It's not "Lord Of The Rings," of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the lot.<br /><br />The special-effects are fun to watch and it was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff ("Harry"), Emma Watson ("Hermione") and Rupert Grint ("Ron") have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. "Ron" squeaks half the time he talks!<br /><br />As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. It's definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language, and the Blu-Ray editions eleveate this DVD another star.  The transfers on all of them, from what I've seen and read, are fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>After the phenomenal success of J.K. Rowling's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439434866">first four Harry potter novels</a> and the first Harry potter film, there was no doubt that the boy wizard would be returning to the big screen. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, we are given a darker tale that explores the pasts of Hogwarts' students and professors. It was with this story that author J.K Rowling first began to experience a backlash from more conservative parents. Most were disturbed by the themes of death and violence, which Rowling insisted was her way of being more realistic and that by including these themes her books would be grounded in a universal reality. However some parents did not accept her explanation. They even went so far as to suggest that Satanism and a belief in witchcraft inspired the Harry Potter books and films. At first deeply insulted and angered by these preposterous accusations, Rowling later would dismiss them with her signature wit and sense of humor.<br />Furthermore this ridiculous controversy had no affect on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' Box Office intake. The film was a hit!<br /><br />As Harry Potter prepares for his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he is warned of a dangerous plot against the students. He's told of this plot by a manic house-elf named Dobby, who is forced to inflict injuries upon himself whenever he disobeys his master. Between bouts of self-abuse, Dobby explains that his allegiance to the wizard family that owns him prevents him form saying anymore, but he is adamant that Harry Potter should not return to Hogwarts, for Harry's own protection. Harry, obstinate as ever, tells Dobby that he must return to school, so Dobby goes about creating obstacles to prevent this. Dobby, it turns out, has been stealing Harry's mail, making him believe that his friends weren't writing him over summer holiday. Dobby did this in hopes that Harry might not be so eager to return to school if he thought his friends no longer cared about him, but this wasn't the case. After Dobby gets Harry into trouble and Harry's uncle Vernon locks him in his room, Harry's best friend Ron comes to the rescue. Ron and his brothers, Fred and George, show up at the house in a flying car and save Harry from the monotony of staying with his ill-tempered relatives.<br />Ron and his brothers take Harry to their small home in the English countryside, where Harry meets the rest of the Weasley family. Harry and the Weasleys go to Diagon Alley, where magical supplies can be bought, to buy all of the children's materials for the upcoming year at school. They bump into school bully Draco Malfoy and his father, Lucius, who harass the Weasley children for being poor.<br />When Harry and Ron are unable to take the train to Hogwarts, they take the flying car and are seen by muggles (non-magic folk), not to mention the fact that they crash into the school's Whomping-Willow tree. As punishment they are given detention. While Ron is given the task of polishing medals and trophies, Harry must assist the new self-obsessed teacher, Professor Lockhart respond to his fan mail. But that's the least of Harry's problems. Harry begins to hear an eerie voice reverberating through the walls, and he follows it and it leads him to a message written on the wall in blood. "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir... beware," it reads.<br />As Harry, Ron, and Hermione uncover the meaning of this cryptic message, they realize that no one at Hogwarts is safe. An evil from the past has been awakened and students begin to turn up, literally, petrified. Soon no one can be trusted and some are even pointing the finger at Harry, but when Hermione and Ron's sister, Ginny become victims and the safety and freedom of all at the school is jeopardized, Harry must prove his innocence and save his friends. But can he find the Chamber of Secrets before it's too late?<br /><br />As with the first film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was written by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris Columbus. The film is more selective in what content is included from the book, but overall it is a very successful adaptation. In many ways this film is superior to the first film. The special effects surpass those in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W74EQC">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a> in realism, detail, and style.<br />The acting has also improved as can be seen in the children's performances. On a sad note, the brilliant actor Richard Harris, who plays Headmaster Dumbledore, passed away shortly after the film's completion. The cast features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley, Kenneth Branagh as Professor Lockhart, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore.<br />Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts tests his courage and his skills while showing viewers that greater challenges are to come.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IR5S">the superb soundtrack by John Williams</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets" is an excellent film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's book.  Having read the book, I was impressed by how recognizable the film was, very like the original.  Chris Columbus directed "Rent," "Mrs. Doubtfire," & "Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone," as it was titled in the USA.  The young actors who are the leads fill the film well and seem to be growing in ability with each of the films. Daniel Radcliffe created a stir by taking off his clothes on the British stage for Equus and has appeared in "The Tailor of Panama."  As Harry Potter, he does a good job of showing Harry's stubbornness, his loyalty and compassion.  Rupert Grint was in "Driving Lessons" in 2006.  As Ron Weasley he is the sidekick who can stand by Harry, even when he doesn't understand.  Emma Watson seems a perfect choice to play the brainy Hermione Granger.  I greatly enjoyed this film.  From Moaning Myrtle to Dobby to Lucius Malfoy's malevolent snicker to the visuals as Harry slides down into the chamber, Columbus kept the pacing building right to the climax.  Harry Potter unravels very much like a mystery story with the twist that the magical world events make the clues pure delightful fantasy.  Words like "muggles" seep into our vocabulary with perfectly clear understanding.  The bonus DVD is full of interesting cast interviews of the younger actors, the villains and the teachers.  This is one of my favorite rainy day films to watch again & again.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This was a pretty fun film. I liked it better than the first one and the acting definetely improved in regards to the younger adults. The story was pretty interesting and it follows the book pretty nicely which was surprising. All in all, if you are a HP fan, you will love this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The first sequel to "Harry Potter" is absolutely fantastic, far better than the original one.  Or, I should say, despite some uneven pace and tone of the film, it is much more three-dimentional and complex, giving us what we want: theills of fantasy.<p>Harry Potter is in the second year at Hogwarts, and now is ready to go back to the school, inspite of the advice given by strange creature called Dobby, who shows up before him to warn that very bad things would happen if Harry goes back.  But Harry ignores his warnings anyway, and starts his new year at the school, only to find weird occasions that remind him of Dobby's words.  And finally, he is to know that "The Chamber of Secrets," about which no one (including the teachers) knows -- its existence, its location, and its terrifying secrets -- is opened by someone inside of the place, and students start to fall victims to it.<p>Can Harry stop the danger, and regain the peace for the school?  The premise seems similar to that of the original film, but the overall tone of the film gets darker and more sinister.  It is possible that some of the pre-teen kids might find the film too scary at some time (especially they don't like slugs, spiders and snakes), and perhaps adults find it the same way.  Don't underestimate the film's dark elements any more.<p>But the most remarkable thing about "Chamber of Secrets" is its hugely improved CGIs, reflecting the filmmaker's confidence coming from the commercial success of the previous one.  The match of Quiddich is again used as one of the highlights, and the newer game scene is simply great, much better than the first one.  With enhanced sound effects, the fight between Harry and Malfoy looks more realistic, even frightening, flying all over the ground and stands (and unbelievably, under them).  <p>The only weak point is its new character Dobby, created all by CGIs, which still looks unnatural sometimes.  Moreover, in the opening sequence, the film attempts to get laughs using Dobby not so effectively, making him a bit irritating creature like Jar-Jar Binks or Scooby-Doo.  But wait a while, and see Ron's family is introduced, including ever delightful Julie Walters ("Billy Elliot") as Ron's mother.<p>Another new character is given by Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, a new teacher (and a celebrity) at Hogwarts.  Obviuosly he is a comic relief, and Branagh is surprisingly good, this time not resorting to his overacting tendency that destroyed Woody Allen's "Celebrity."  And don't miss the brief scene after the end credit roll.  <p>Daniel Radcliffe is as good as before, and so is Rupert Grint (in fact, they are giving the best acting in the film), but most regrettable is Emma Watson's Hermione, who is given much shorter time on the screen.  All the actors are good, but their presence seems to be rather sacrificed to establish darker images of the school.  So, John Cleese is allowed to speak very briefly only twice, and even Maggie Smith and Allen Rickman are not allotted enough time to impress us.  You brink your eye, and you will miss Fiona Shaw!<p>Probably their roles would be enlarged next time; let's hope  so.  It is, however, undeniable that the film went through great improvement, and it explores much darker side of magic, which gives more thrills to adults and children alike.  But how will they keep this pace in the future?  Is it possible to combine evil elements with the concept of family picture?  That is my only concern, and the second sequel would show the answer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was an amazing film. This sequel is even better.<br /><br />This film is not only funnier, and more fun than the first, it is much darker, and full of suspense and action.<br /><br />Any Harry Potter fans should see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>I have never had any interest to read a Harry Potter book, but for some reason I really enjoy the movies. I guess because they are different and have something new to offer other than the usual Hollywood "Blow everything up and show off my heaving pecs" movie.<br /><br />I really liked the witch soccer game, the ghost in the bathroom, the scenery and sets. I liked the giant snake at the end and the way Harry killed it. How the elf got his freedom at the end of the movie was pretty funny.<br /><br />I was a little confused with the whole "I am a memory and my diary holds my rememberances and I need this sacrifice to become real again", but I went along with it. I don't take movies like this so seriously that I cannot enjoy them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>Not as good as the first one but it's still great and is the best film of the year. The story it self is a little slow at points but the movie stays close to the book. The acting is great and the story is great it's more suspensfull, scary and mature then the first. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat espesially when harry is int he Chamber of secrets. The movie is so great words can hardly describe it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>It appears that these Harry Potter movies appeal to all ages.  I know two adult males who go to all of them.  As do my young children.  However, with so much suspense and complicated plots, they are better suited to pre-teen and young adults.<p>Being one of the very few adults who have not read a single Harry Potter book, I was certainly not prepared for such an onslaught of scary situations and monsters as this movie put forth. I usually can take a lot of mysterious scarriness without being bothered, but some of this was so gross I wondered how on earth the people watching the movie as I did could sit there and put their little children through that horror. And whether these children would have nightmares for weeks (perhaps months) to come.<p>Parts of this movie was enjoyable and entertaining. But I would never take my seven-yr. old grandson to see such violence.<br />The flying car was fun to watch, shades of Chitty Bang Bang and Stars Wars special effects crammed together.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>This is the popular movie version of the second Harry Potter book.  Once again, popularity and quality are not related.  This movie has all of the flaws of the book (almost too many to count).  The major ones are:<br />Ron Weasly breaks his wand.  It is a hand-me-down.  But we know that wands choose their owners and a wizard should never use someone else's wand.<br />Magic users are completely ignorant of the muggle world.  One student cannot conceive of a poster where the pictures don't move.  Students have never heard of basketball.  Ron's dad works for the Ministry of Magic and yet is clueless as to how a bus stop works (and he works in London). (etc. etc.).<br />Muggles are not to learn that magic exists.  Hermione's parents visit Diaganon alley and they are both muggles.  How do they know their daughter is a witch?  How does any mixed parentage work if letting muggles know about magic is a horrible crime?<br />Apparently it is illegal to enchant anything that is of muggle origin.  I would love to know the &quot;magical origins&quot; of all of the objects populating the book.<br />The defense for the dark arts teacher is a complete buffoon and yet the wise heads of Hogwarts are completely fooled.<br />Hagrid has been wronged for many years (is he really 62?) and yet when his name is cleared there are no reparations or apologies.<br />Hogwarts is a center of magic but not the only place magic is done and yet they don't seem to be able to get a hold of any mandrake (there is no evidence that they even tried).<br />I still have been unable to figure out money in this world.  There is magical money, of which Harry has hordes, but it doesn't really seem to be good for anything (although the Weaslys don't have enough).  Harry stays with the Weaslys but never offers any help.  Muggle money is for muggles and Harry has none.  What is the magic money for (other than school supplies?).  We'll have to see how Rowling settles that (although I doubt she will).<p>Some changes were made to the plot in the first movie and I was curious how they would get resolved in this one.  they weren't.  Bad boy Malfoy has bought his way onto his house's Quiddich team by getting everyone new brooms.  Since a seeker is the most important player (the only one who can win a game) it seems unlikely that one can buy into that particular spot.  but wait!  Malfoy is already on the team and already a seeker (see the first movie).  It was a big deal that first year Potter was on the team and a seeker, but no big deal was made that first year Malfoy was on a team and a seeker.  Now we are just confused.  Did Malfoy buy his way onto the team as the new seeker in year two or was he already a seeker in year one?<br />I know special effects artists can get carried away with their craft but the sheer number of spiders in the woods is completely implausible.  There would be nothing but spiders.  They would have eaten all of the other inhabitants is there were as many as the movie shows.<br />But, mistakes aside, people like this film, or at least spent a lot of money on it.  No long novel can be fully made into a single movie, but it seemed like the choice of scenes to include was almost random.  One should really not waste one's time on this.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>They had me until the one-hour mark.<p>  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets adapts the second book in J.K. Rowling's mega-successful book series, and before you start bashing me for the two-star review, just let me say that I love the books. But there IS a reason why most book-to-movie transfers leave large chunks of the book on the cutting-room floor. Chamber of Secreets is just WAY too long at nearly three hours. I was loving it until about an hour in. Then we meet "Moaning Myrtle", and it was about then that I really started to notice entire scenes that had nothing to do with moving the plot along. A lean, mean 90-minutes or two-hours would have been much better. Did we really need TWO long scenes with the flying car? The scene in The Dark Woods with the spiders was cool, but it didn't serve the plot in any way. I was bored, and to be totally honest, the theater full of kids was getting restless too. By the time the actual SECRET of the Chamber of Secrets was revealed, I had a sore butt, and a wandering attention span, and there were restless kids running all over the theater asking when they could leave. Asking a kid to sit for nearly three hours is asking a LOT.<p>  On the plus side, the effects are MUCH better than last time. The performances are great, like last time, especially Emma Watson (Hermione), and the wonderfully expressive Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley). I'll be there when The Prisoner of Azkaban opens next fall; I just hope it's a little faster-paced.<p> P.S.- Make sure you stick around until after the credits end!</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>The movie starts you out with an older Harry Potter. It's obvious that he is going through puberty because his voice is squeakin' and it makes him sound goofy at times. They are all going through puberty. Anyways, I think the film really falls short in terms of enjoyment.<p>The new people offer no excitement. Sure, mabye that teacher guy was okay... Draco's father is incredibly boring and isn't really mysterious at all. He can't really act at all. From what it looks like, they hired him because he is somewhat resembalant of Draco but he isn't convincing enough to be enjoyable.<p>The movie has it's action, but the first half is boring. The first 20 minutes of the movie have some nice special effects but overall they set the tone for a boring and prolonged movie.<p>To wrap it up though, in the end... a movie will get a lot of praise if it is a popular book adaptation. Pass this one up. Sorry to those who are die-hard fans. I do not think this movie was very entertaining though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q.html">A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q</a><br/><p>In the second installation of the "Harry Potter" movies, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" starts off again with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) back home for the summer with his uncaring and unloving uncle, aunt, and cousin. Harry is certainly looking forward to going back to Hogwarts but it seems that again this year, danger awaits him. Reunited with his two best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), they discover that Hogwarts is in dire danger as a 50-year-old mystery is reawakened by the opening of the 'chamber of secrets'. As one by one, students become mysteriously 'petrified' and soon the students begin suspecting that Harry is behind it all! Will the three friends be able to find the secret behind the chamber of secrets, and clear the good name of Harry Potter? <p>Not being a real fan of the Harry Potter series, I have not read the books. So I am reviewing this movie from the view of someone who has seen only the movies.<p>*PLOT* - The plot of the movie was the real downer of the move for me. I had found the first Harry Potter to be really interesting with its fun story and interesting theme. But unfortunately, "Chamber of Secrets", gives the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu to the movie watcher, except this time we're led into a two hour and forty minute movie. Somehow, I must say that the story was (I'm sorry to have to say this Potter fans!) dull and boring. The plot seemed to drag a bit, and I felt that there were too many similarities between the two Potter movies. There's the Quidditch (forgive spelling mistakes) match, a secret room with deadly forces at work, a venture into the deadly forest, and much more. Maybe it's just me, but I also felt the movie was too long. The movie seemed bogged down for its length, giving the feeling as if the director tried to hard to contain as much from the book as possible while still trying to keep it interesting enough for youngsters to sit through the movie. Well, the special effects and some masterful action sequences may help to keep kids occupied, but I think the teens and adult crowd may have found it a bit tedious. <p>*ACTING* - Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown up since the first film and handles his character very well. A bit more serious and not quite as 'innocent', he give the characterization of Harry Potter a bit more maturity. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger also does a good job, her haughtiness from the first film toned down more. Unfortunately, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasely seems to be only a comic relief to the movie as his only acting ability seems to be having this weird expression whenever his character is supposed to be scared. I couldn't help but cringe whenever he made that face, couldn't he have done a better job? Best acting done by the adult actors and actresses are most notably Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Minerva McGonagall), and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). I was disappointed that there was not much of Alan Rickman's character Snape, he was one of my favorite characters from the first film. Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart is little more than an annoying character and there should have been less of him. The same could be said about Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) who was VERY annoying!<p>*PG RATING* - It was a bit surprising for me to see that this movie is aimed for younger children. I can see how some may say how this movie shows very good morals, I must point out some conflicting points on this subject. Not only does the film make a point to show that Harry and his friends deliberately disobey the teachers and break rules, in the end they are rewarded without any punishments! I'm not sure what children are supposed to learn from this. Another reason parents might want to be cautioned is the violence. Oh, I know the violence is nothing compared to other films rated PG-13 or higher but I do know that some parts may be a bit disturbing for children. Most especially the end where Harry goes into the chamber of secrets, there's a battle going on that doesn't end simply. A bit gruesome and disturbing, I suggest that parents be cautioned.<p>*OVERALL* - Overall, the movie is a mediocre film. The good points of the movie include: 1) some good morals are shown, mostly about strong friendship and good triumphing over evil, 2) pretty good acting, nothing dramatic but still pretty good, 3) terrific effects, and 4) some nice action scenes. On the other hand, some of the bad points of the movie include: 1) a plot which seems to drag and feel stretched over a too long amount of time, 2) some unnecessarily realistic violence, 3) some questionable morals, and 4) too many similarities between the previous Harry Potter movie. As a series, I must say that unless the next movie has more of an intriguing plot with better pacing, I'm sure that non-Harry Potter fans might start finding the movies getting a bit old.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>And so the second year begins at Hogwarts school of witchcraft & wizardry. As does the second cinema adaptation of the world of Harry Potter. This piece in the saga starts off right on a good note when Harry is visited by a mysterious elf named Dobby, who warns him that terrible things are going to happen at Hogwarts this year and that Harry must stay away. Unwilling to listen Harry finds out with his good friends Ron & Hermione that long ago one of the founders of the school created a secret chamber where a hidden chapter of the school's history has lay dormant for 50 years. Now there are bloodstained messages on the school walls and non-magical born students are ending up in comas, but worse all fingers are pointing at Harry Potter. Now Harry must question and dive into a world that has been locked away only to bring the secrets of the hidden chamber out in the open.<br /><br />This movie as well as the book is by far my favorite in the saga. This movie really shows significant character development and true bonds of friendship through Harry and his companions. Chris Columbus did a fantastic job for his final directorial attempt, still keeping close to the original story, but also really working with the kids bringing their acting abilities up to speed with the aging characters to make the audience connect with the characters as they did in the book.<br /><br />While the movie is better than its predecessor, it still does rank as the best in the saga for there is still much to learn and 5 more years left to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The film continues to shed light on (the very well known by now) Harry Potter, as he attends his second year at Hogwarts.  His powers are growing and so is the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life...<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The concept, the setting, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>The second Harry Potter movie lives up the first one but some magic was lost.  I still loved it!  I loved the innocence of Harry and Ron and the way that they are friends with Hermione.  Just a great movie for all young and old!<br /><br />Harry gets help in going back to school although a house elf named Dobby  doesn't want him to.  As he knows that Harry is in great danger!  But Harry is saved by Ron and the Wesely brothers come and save him in the flying car...which is cool shown on screen.  And we begin Harry's second year at Hogwarts.  I loved this movie...full of action and fantasy.  There are many things we learn about Harry in this movie such as someone is a parseltounge.  If you read the books you will already know what happens but it is neat to see how someone else sees the same thing you did.  And if you haven't read the book and loved the first movie I think you will be happy with one as it give you insight into Harry and will help with future books and movies.</p></br></body></html>

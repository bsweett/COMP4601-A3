Lee Ermey, Dorian Harewood, Kevyn Major Howard, Arliss Howard, Ed O'Ross, John Terry.<br /><br />Running Time:  116 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme violence and extreme language.<br /><br />The training of war ends up being a darkly humorous adventure for the men going into the Vietnam War. A crazed drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey) puts his men through hell on Earth. The Tet Offensive becomes a story of its own. Men develop dehumanized personalities and others lose their minds. Turmoil prevails. Gallows humor and war violence erupts on the big screen. This is "Full Metal Jacket," raw, hard, and one of the best war movies made in the last quarter century.  One of Stanley Kubrick's best, "Full Metal Jacket" is a unique take on the Vietnam War, and while it isn't the best war movie out there, it is certainly amazing: Breathtaking cinematography is one of the film's strongest aspects, and a fantastic performance by R. Lee Ermey pulls the movie into a kind of interesting feel, where the strengths of the production are so vibrant and memorable that you start to forget about time and just appreciate the movie for what it is.  A whole line of young men play the different soldiers in the film, and while none come even close to matching Ermey's performance, they are all fantastic in their own right. A stunning amount of dedication and energy is present in "Jacket," making for an unconventional and humorous take on one of the world's weirdest wars.<br /><br />The first half of the film, dealing with the training of these raw soldiers, is hilarious and frightening. Ermey's crazed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the funniest characters ever put on film, and all of his lines are hysterical and impressively effective. Dark humor triumphs in the first half like war movies very rarely achieve, and this is part of what makes "Jacket" such a unique and wonderful movie. The second half calms down a bit, which is ironic because this is the half of the film where the combat takes place: This is the half with the Tet Offensive, and it's a disturbing, sobering and breathtaking piece of cinema. Truly excellent acting comes into play here, as do important political messages and a round of unique character development that takes it a step further from what the first half left us with. Though not as funny or entertaining as the first half of the movie, it is still a glorious piece of cinema, and it looks tremendous even by today's standards.<br /><br />This is one of Kubrick's most entertaining efforts, and not quite as polarizing as "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "A Clockwork Orange." Instead, it uses different film-making techniques to define itself, and its purpose is very, very clear: All the traditional messages of war movies are here (That wars are contradictory and often silly), and a lot of fascinating scenes can be found as well.  All the characters have a grounded "real world" feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil, beyond-hope look he gives later on remains as the most frightening looks ever seen depicted onscreen.  A haunting, humorous, and often horrendously difficult film; however, it sparkles in its own way despite its flaws and sadism.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film is a two part view of the military as an institution more than about Vietnam specifically.  The film first looks at the institutionalization of soldiers through basic training and, second, how such training develops the characters in actual combat.  The film is more of a system analysis than the symbolic social themes present in 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now.'<br /><br />The film starts in Paris Island where several Marine recruits undergo basic training.  This is definitely the best part of the film with the great performance of Lee Ermey as the zealous drill instructor.  The film follows how the training affects the recruits psychologically and how they work as a group.  Trainees who perform under par (Vincent D'Onofrio) are soon put at the bottom of the pecking order and are subjected to the abuse of their peers as well the drill instructor.  As for the combat part, there are pluses and minuses.  True, the city didn't really look like Hue and, in light of the huge offensive the North Vietnamese launched on the City, there don't seem to be many corpses littering the streets or any soldiers in the City other than a young girl with an AK.  Even accepting Joker's (Matthew Modine) limited combat experience, the other soldiers themselves look too disorganized and confused to be hardened men who've been in-country for a while now.  I did like Kubrick's brilliant camera work in filming the combat scenes; the cameras aren't fixed in one place at any time: they follow the action briskly with the men as they run, seek cover, etc.<br /><br />This is a good film to own and watch especially for the first half of the film.  I rate this film with just as much quality and insight as the other two top Vietnam films of 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon'.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>First off is Stanley Kubrick's addition to the slew of Vietnam war films that came out during the '86-'87 film season. Based on an effective novella about the Vietnam War titled Short-Timers, Kubrick's take on that war and the military (specifically the U.S. Marine Corps.) at that time is one that's very anti-war and also shows the dehumanizing effect that young men go through to become effective soldiers.<br /><br />I agree with Ed that the first half of the film during Corps bootcamp is very effective and also very brutal. The dehumanizing tactics used to turn soldiers like Pvts. Joker, Cowboy and Pyle into killing machines has Kubrick's style written all over it. Kubrick succeeded in showing the brutality of their training, yet still keeps the audience at a distance. Its almost clinical in the way he pulled it off. The stand out performances by R. Lee Ermey as Gunny and a young Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle made the first half of Full Metal Jacket a classic in my book. The second half on the other hand loses some of the effectiveness of the bootcamp scenes.<br /><br />Kubrick tried to show the inhumanity of war through scenes for the Battle for Hue. The scenes are well-shot, but Kubrick's knowledge of city-fighting was very limited and he has talked about it in some detail that he didn't want to really show the battle accurately. He needed a major set piece and the Battle for Hue was a major battle the USMC fought in and used it. This second half is also where he deviated from the book. The book showed the camraderie that Joker and Cowboy had during bootcamp and then throughout Hue and showed that even through war's inhumanity and insanity soldiers kept a bond with their comrades that allowed for heroism to shine through. Kubrick's take on the second half was that war made instant cynics and murderers of people no matter how principled they may be.<br /><br />I may disagree with the second half's treatment of the book and of Kubrick's unsubtle antiwar message, but this film has to count as one of his best. Right up there with The Shining. Spartacus and Lolita.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>First of all....many Marines say that the first 30 minutes of the movie about boot camp is THE most accurate depiction of Parris Island in cinematic history.  And of course Lee Ermey himself being a former Marine drill instructor tops it all....his profanity laced tirades are totally outrageous.<p>  Second of all,  the latter half of the movie deals with a subject not covered in Vietnam movies,  a squad getting lost and having to face a lone sniper.  Its a radical departure to be sure,  but Kubrick in his usual cinematic mastery makes it very gripping.<p>  So if you like Vietnam movies that are a bit different but still as strong as Hamburger Hill and Platoon,  check this one out....its fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The picture was 1.85:1 (or something close to that), and completely filled my widescreen LCD.  I would rather of had 2.40:1.<br /><br />Video quality was very good to great.  I only saw grain on one scene.  I give it a 9.0 out of 10.  Very good for a movie this old.<br /><br />Audio quality was disappointing.  It was only Dolby Digital 5.1, and there were hardly any surround sounds, if any.  The sound came from the fronts and center.  I don't recall any sub-woofer bass, but I could be mistaken on that.<br /><br />Overall, a good Blu-Ray purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's film is spectacular and defies easy description. The film is divided into two parts that are clearly distinct. The first is the Parris Island training base for Marines and the second is in Viet Nam during the Tet offensive. In the first section we see how young men are turned into soldiers and in the second section we see how they perform under real war conditions. Yet there is a dark undercurrent that in the first section asks why such extreme techniques are necessary to create group cohesion and directed aggression in young men and in the second section asks whether the official stated purpose for war runs counter to the experiences of those on the front lines. It is Kubrick's skills that bring in just enough humor, horror, violence, and absurdity to keep the film constantly entertaining. Under war conditions, it is the front line troops with their dark humor that point to the absurdity of their goals and situation. The film rings especially true in this time where we are engaged in war in Afghanistan and Iraq with vague ideological goals of establishing democracy whereas the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, like the people of South Vietnam, may not view the conflict through the same eyes as Americans. The film is beautifully filmed. Kubrick was the finest film maker for interior scenes and the barracks on Parris Island, with their red shiny floors, created a perfect stage for the drama to unfold between the drill sergeant and the new troops. The bombed out buildings for the final scenes were fascinating, a labyrinth of death and danger. The acting was absolutely superb with Private Lawrence giving one of the most frightening performances while the Drill Sergeant giving one of the most over-the-top performances on film. The film is totally entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>This is a non-conventional war movie and it happens to be the ONLY war movie I like.  It's more of an artsy type war movie but that's what I like about it.  The acting is fantastic and the battle sequence towards the end of the movie keeps you gripping with fear.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Two years ago, some of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films had been upgraded to 2-Disc Special Edition DVD's. Unfortunately, Full Metal Jacket didn't become a part of the upgrades. Why? It's not only one of Kubrick's most outstanding films, it's also one of the greatest war films ever made. It's full of Kubrick's vintage camera work, Lee Ermey's excessive profanity, and some odd dark humor. The first half of the film deals with physical training in a boot camp. What makes it so unforgettable and so fantastic is R. Lee Ermey (a former Marine drill instructor) with his incredibly brutal dialogue (most of it being ad-libbed). The second half involves the real inferno: the war in Vietnam. Here, Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, and many others are in the city of Hue. And here is where Hell makes its mark, as we watch undeniable chaos ensuing until the end. The second half of the film may be a bit weaker compared to the first half, but I see that all of the boot camp sequences prepare us for what really goes on in Vietnam.<br /><br />This masterpiece by Kubrick may not have the same effect that Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove have, but it's still a great one by the God-like filmmaker. Kubrick's usual treatment on war and on human nature is probably why many people call him a genius. And a NOTORIOUS genius, I would add.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" seems like an uncomplete film, but to me that's poetic to one of America's uncompleter wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like your there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and the second half just falls apart. The first half is set up to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter lives of these soliders during war.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This is one of the best war movies ever. The beginning scenes at the boot camp set the stage for what follows and helps to learn what it took to become a Marine. Kubrick's directing is top notch as usual. After watching this you'll be singing the Mickey Mouse song in your dreams.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>I'm of the opinion that both sequences of Kubrick's war drama are equally compelling. However, when they find out who the sniper in the war ravaged building is--it seems like it could be more than one of those killers up there--well, that's good cinema, period. And you can't help but feel the irony when the soldiers sing the tune to The Mickey Mouse Club. This moovy is epic, but not overbearing. It's got realness and rawness in it...don't expect buffoonery, or every thing being a set up for  rim shot jokes ala TV's MASH. War is insanity, war is intensity and Kubrick attempted to show that here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick, in this film, apparently deals with two problems by cutting the film in two separate parts, and yet he only deals with one problem that goes beyond the two parts and reunifies the film. In the first part he gives us a precise, accurate and nearly sickening description of the training of a Marine in the US. This training has to do with brainwashing, physical training and ideological conditioning. The objective is not to produce robots, but Marines who are so well conditioned that killing is their first reflex in a war situation. ? Born to kill ? as they say. This first part leads to a drama because in the mass of new recruits, there is, not a rotten apple, but one who cannot stand the brainwashing, because he cannot erase some of his old psychological attachments. His unconscuious reacts against the brainwashing and turns the brainwashing against the trainer and against the owner of this unconscious : to kill becomes to settle accounts (in vengeance) and to commit suicide. In the second part,  Kubrick gives us a vision of the Tet offensive in 1968, hence of the dramatic turning point of the Vietnam War that will eventually mean the American defeat. There we find again some of the characters of the first part and a few others and Kubrick describes how the killing instinct of these Marines has become the only survival strategy they have. They can survive and even remain sane because they kill, blindly and without thinking. Kubrick even goes further by showing that this leads to deranged personalities. One case is only quoted, but the main hero is confronted, right at the end, no longer with the blind reflex, but with the necessity to kill in order to respect some deep belief he has (suffering is not justified on a moral level) and the necessity to kill willingly, out of a conscious resolution. This leads to two possibilities : either the Marine is an animal and he will let the wounded person die, hence suffer, thus showing that he has no more moral values, or he will kill just as if it were an ordinary and simple action like drinking, eating or anything else, thus showing that he has no more moral values, no sense of perspective. And that's where the film gets its unity : either the Marine has become a robot for whom killing is as simple as breathing, or the conditioning is in contradiction with ethical values, making the reflex difficult if not impossible. Killing becomes then a regressive attitude and the film can end up on Disneyland famous song : M.I.C.K.E.Y.M.O.U.S.E. And this last image of Marines coming back from their exterminating mission for the night and singing that song, shows how deep war can make people sink. The last scene is poignant and revealing. A masterpiece.

The Blu-ray presentation is nearly flawless with a rich looking, terrific presentation with sharp images and an accurate representation of the color scheme of the film.<br /><br />Note: Keep in mind that this film was ALWAYS grainy and Kubrick intentionally went with a "flat" look for the lighting of the film. However, an earlier edition of the film used an older HD master that didn't do the film any favors and had issues with the MPEG2 compression technology not being able to do an adequate job of keeping up with the shifting images (particularly in the latter half of the film. This probably isn't the disc to "knock your socks off" about Blu-ray because of the way it was shot. The new edition, however, accurately reflects the "look", textures and feel of the original film much more accurately than ANY other version to date.<br /><br />The extras which include a commentary track by the cast (although curiously Matthew Modine is absent), is extremely good providing bits of detail about the production of the film. As Vincent D'onofrio points out Kubrick would probably be very unhappy if he was alive and knew there was a commentary track on the film. Kubrick wanted his films to be accepted without commentary or observations about those involved in the production (much like Spielberg)but it does help to have these observations to provide a context about the making of the film. As with the DVD we get a number of terrific featurette "Beyond Good and Evil" that provides insight into the making of the film and themes that Kubrick shapes.<br /><br />How does this compare to the DVD? It looks better of course. How does this compare to the HD-DVD? Since both used the same encoding, it should look roughly the same but I haven't had time to do a side-by-side comparison. I can't compare this to the previous Blu-ray edition because I don't have it.<br /><br />Any film is truly about the era the film was made in whether it be a period drama, science fiction or romantic comedy set in another time it captures the essence of that era, comments on it through the actions of the characters and behaviors and even the themes itself. This was true of "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Jaws" as much as it is about "Citizen Kane" and "Vertigo". Great films, however, manage to also transcend the era about which they were made because they manage to touch on much more sweeping, grand (or in this case intimate) themes pursuing the essence of what it is to be human. "Full Metal Jacket" Stanley Kubrick's penultimate film fits in this category. It's as much about the Reagan/Bush era as it is about the Vietnam/60's experience and manages to be both clinical and intimate touching on the small moments that altered these individual's lives unlike the epic "Apocalypse Now" (to which this film is a terrific companion piece).<br /><br />The story is, essentially, broken into two sections equally powerful and satiric; the first half is set on Paris Island where new recruits are indoctrinated into the military way--their identities are symbolically taken away as they are "reborn" with their heads shaved, they are given a new set of rules and codes to live by and are "reborn" to kill. This section focuses on the tools these men are also given to be both killing machines and survival with the hopes that they can retain some sense of humanity as well.<br /><br />The second half focuses on their experience in Vietnam itself where they've "grown up" into the hunters they were retrained to be. Kubrick manages to be both satiric and, surprisingly, allows us the audience to connect with the characters wayward humanity in scenes where they interact. Most of the what's left of these people are the surface and underneath when unleased are deadly creatures as dark, base and cynical as the astronaunts in "2001" are intellectual, detacted and curious. It's a fascinating companion piece to Kubrick's films "Paths of Glory", "Dr. Strangelove", "2001" and "Clockwork" all of which touch on the same themes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I've watched this movie several times, but the HD DVD version was the best.  It is a nice clean transfer in the original aspect ratio (the DVD release was cropped to 4:3 and highly compressed).  This is the definitive Vietnam war movie-great cast, dialogue, and editing.  I forgot that Adam Baldwin was in it (he also played my favorite character Jayne in Firefly and Serenity).  His role felt like an early prototype for Jayne.  And R Lee Armey was just fantastic.  This movie is not for the faint of heart, but I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>Vietnam War has inspired many films, ranging from excellent to abominable.<br /><br />In my opinion there are three outstanding: Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" (1979), Oliver Stone's "Platoon" (1986) and Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" (1987). Each of them shows their director's personal approach to this dramatic and tragic war.<br /><br />Kubrick has constructed his film in two huge parts: Boots Camp and Vietnam.<br /><br />The first part is by far the best. The process to transform young "green" civilians into "hard killer" soldiers is shown in depth.<br /><br />The figure of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman emerges overshadowing everyone with his sadistic methods. He effectively erases all "civil" traits in his charges, straining them to the utmost limit of endurance. Some will resist, some will not. All will be changed into a different person.<br /><br />The second half is more conventional. Is a war movie with excellent production, photography and Kubrick's splendid choreographic deployment, but conventional nonetheless.<br /><br />Playacting has two outstanding performers: Lee Emery as Sgt. Hartman and Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle. The rest of the cast is good and convincing.<br /><br />The music score, original from Vivian Kubrick and non-original from various authors, is very good and enhance the scenes they underline.<br /><br />The final scene with the Marines singing the theme from Mickey Mouse Club is chilling. The contrast between kid's music and devastated battleground is a synthesis of the inferno lived by those almost teenage soldiers.<br /><br />An interesting film for anyone interested in the historical period depicted.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Full Metal Jacket is an outstanding film that grabbed my attention by the throat and never let go until the very last frame of the picture! The acting mesmerized me; it was all done so convincingly and nobody--but nobody--gives a bad performance in this film. The script was well written; the casting well done; and the cinematography and choreography enhance the film as well. The musical score enhances the plot as it moves along; and it's a plot that never left me feeling bored. But please note: this film contains a lot of profanity and graphic, violent war scenes; I would not recommend this film for small children as it might frighten them.<br /><br />Many have noted that the film seems to be presented in two parts; and I would agree with that. The first part takes place on Parris Island, South Carolina, a boot camp for new Marines during the Vietnam War in the 1960s.  The new recruits have to endure incredibly grueling conditions and training by their leader Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) who pulls no punches as he trains them "to be killers." Among the new recruits are Private Joker (Matthew Modine); Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio who plays this to perfection and beyond) and Arliss Howard as Private Cowboy. Private Joker turns out to be quite well suited for the Marines but he is eventually assigned to report for the Stars and Stripes newspaper over in Vietnam; Joker also tries very hard to prepare the ill-suited Private Pyle for combat as a Marine.  However, the stress does take its toll and the first part of the film ends with a tragedy that shows the horrible impact of war even before overseas combat begins.<br /><br />The film then somewhat abruptly changes to military life in and around Hue, Vietnam in 1968; we meet up again with Joker (who now wears a peace button on his uniform) and others including Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), who works for Stars and Stripes as a cameraman alongside Joker; and they do get along very well. Things don't stay happy for long as Rafterman's camera is stolen and both Joker and Rafterman become involved covering the action.  Look also for excellent performances by Adam Baldwin as a Marine who goes by the name "Animal Mother;" "Eightball" (Dorian Harewood) and Ed O'Ross as Lt." Touchdown."<br /><br />I could tell you so much more about the action and the tough decisions they and others must make during some of the brutal action in the Tet Offensive; but then again I'd be spoiling it for you. Of course, some survive and others don't; and the sniper scenes are some of the most riveting I've ever watched in any motion picture.<br /><br />Full Metal Jacket is an excellent film with a message that war is horrific; and the acting will amaze you. I highly recommend this film for people studying the Vietnam War; people interested in gritty war dramas will not be disappointed.  The film also explores the issues of duty, honor and sacrifice alongside a moral ambiguity many soldiers grappled with while they carried on the fight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick has been quoted as saying that with Full Metal Jacket, he wanted to make a war film, as opposed to an ANTI-war film. Condemning war is easily. It's a moral no-brainer.  Trying to understand its nature is something far more challenging.  As a result, Full Metal Jacket does something far more subtle and difficult than simply tell us that War is Hell (although it does that, too).  To understand what and how, one must consider the film's structure:<p>Full Metal Jacket is split brutally into two parts, the first of which follows our hero, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) through basic training at Parris Island. A tubby, slow-witted misfit named Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio in an effective performance) is pushed too hard by the sadistic drill instructor Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey), and ends up killing both Hartman and  himself in the Grand Guignol blackout sketch that ends part one.<p>It is at this point that many people have trouble with Full Metal Jacket, as the second half jumps to Viet Nam with no warning. Although Joker and another character named Cowboy (Arliss Howard) carry over from the first part of the film, they never so much as talk about Parris Island or the murder-suicide that marked their training there. It is as though that event happened in another universe, or at least a different movie. <p>The key to this apparent gaffe in story cohesion is contained in a scene where Joker is confronted by a Major over having "Born to Kill" scrawled on his helmet at the same time he wears a peace symbol on his flak jacket.<p>"I was trying to say something about the duality of man," he says, "...the Jungian thing, SIR!"<p>Duality of man; duality of film. There are (in the film's  developing thesis) two possible motivations for killing people and breaking things - compassion (to defend freedom and turn back despotism; our OFFICIAL purpose in Viet Nam), and annihilation (the perverse joy of revenge, of domination; of blood-soaked victory).<p>Which motivation is more "moral"? Which leads to the "high-ground"? Doesn't annihilation always entail moral decay? And doesn't compassion always lead, ultimately, to peace, rather than violence? Through Joker's journey, from killer-in-training to killer-in-fact, we get a disturbing answer that, by its very simplicity, defies the kind of dumbed-down platitudes most war films (even really good ones like Kubrick's own Paths of Glory) try to feed us. The end finds Joker facing a wounded, disarmed sniper who has killed several of his fellow soldiers, as well as his best friend. In a typically Kubrickian reversal, the sadistic thing would be to "...leave her to the mother-lovin' rats..." (in other words, leave her in PEACE), rather than finish her off, which seems the more humane choice (through a paradoxical act of VIOLENCE). The sniper, a teenaged girl, even begs Joker to shoot her. It seems a simple, humanitarian act when he finally pulls the trigger, but in a long, ambiguous close-up on his face, we see the same demon lurking in Joker's eyes that haunted Lawrence back in Parris Island, just before he killed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, then himself. The connection is clear; even the same music cue (by Kubrick's daughter Vivian, under the pseudonym of "Abigail Mead") can be heard on the sound track. By setting up a situation where both possible choices (to kill or not to kill) seem at once sadistic and kind, virtuous and evil, we are forced to see the situation on a more abstract level - where words fail, but a horrible insight reveals itself. The nature of war, it seems to suggest, is the nature of mankind - and vice-versa.<p>Kubrick's production values are first-rate. The DVD looks and sounds quite good, given the source material (Kubrick's muted palette is deliberate; his original sound mix was a fairly compressed monaural track). One particular use of a Steadicam with a slightly longer-than-ideal lens is inspired, giving us a view shaky enough to seem "real" but smooth enough to be fluid.<p>In the Kubrick canon, Full Metal Jacket is a hotly debated film.  Whether you love it or hate it, just remember: it's a Jungian thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>great powerfull movie this was,, i really enjoy how stan dosent have to add a score to make the drama more powerfull thats how good the directing is. i also enjoy the story very much. i really dont see many movies that show the break down people feel in boot camp. the only bad thing is it was full screen but still i love this film!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest wars films ever made.  The film stands with and apart from Kubrick's anti-war films, Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove.  Full Metal Jacket takes its subject seriously.  It's not interested in sensation and artifice; rather, the film is interested in the young men who train to be killers and go into other countries to do terrible things.  To claim that the film doesn't have some element of anti-war theme would be disingenuous, but the psychological reality of war is darkly documented here.<br /><br />It appears that Kubrick lifted and borrowed from sources other than the novel The Short Timers, on which the film is based.  Familiar elements are given new life under Kubrick's wonderful direction.<br /><br />I am somewhat annoyed that this version is full screen and not wide screen.  Other Kubrick films from this collection were not even re-mastered (the video of the 2001: A Space Odyssey DVD was very grainy).  This version of Full Metal Jacket appears to have been re-mastered, but go for the wide screen version if you can find it.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Like everyone else, I enjoy the first half of this movie over and over and over. It is by the far the greatest 'boot camp' sequence ever filmed by Hollywood. Ermy will have you howling with laughter at every profanity infested tyrade. You can hwatch the boot camp 'mini movie' all by itself and never tire of it.<p>The second half has it's moments, but fails tragicly in comparison to the first half. If the entire movie had been boot camp, this would be one of the most watched and entertaining movies of all time.<p>5 stars for the first half<br />2 stars for the second.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>This was one of my favorite movies to come out of the Hollywood Vietnam Movie Period (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill).  I was disappointed by the DVD however.  First of all the sound was in mono and the picture was Pan and Scan for the most part.  I would give the movie 5 stars, but I give the DVD 1 star.  So I guess it averages out to 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>During the Vietnam War, marine recruits are sent to boot camp to undergo training and be prepared to go to war in a foreign country. They face a Gunnery Sergeant who uses severe and cruel treatment to hammer the recruits into tough marines and ready to fight. One recruit in particular is a clumsy, slow to learn and does not do well in following discipline. His story is one of the first tragic stories in this movie.<br /><br />Another of the recruits winds up being a reporter for Stars and Stripes and he is assigned to go into battle with a marine squad. There his will and preparedness for battle is tested to its limits....<br /><br />This movie was directed by and produced by Stanley Kubrick. He also helped to co-write the script and it is one of his best movies. It is certainly one of the most dramatic movies I have ever watched and that starts at the boot camp scenes though the final battle scene. The movie features a good script with excellent acting from multiple actors. It even features some of the best depictions of the horror of war and the effect that it can have on people.<br /><br />This movie is ranked among the top ten war movies ever made and it deserves that ranking in my opinion. I strongly recommend it to you if you like war movies and seek realism in what our soldiers went through. This is also one of Stanley Kubrick's best films that he ever made. Buy it and watch it, you will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>Most of the marines I know say that this is the most realistic movie for them. Probably true.<br /><br />When it first came out, I wasn't impressed. Probably three stars at the time. It's probably not been the indictment that Stanley Kubrick intended.<br /><br />Now, on Blu-Ray, I liked it much better. I considered giving it four stars, because it's probably not the action-packed story most people are expecting. But, if you look at what it is, it should be five stars. Consider it more of a documentary, with a light philosophical touch.<br /><br />Every recruit should watch it before applying for USMC. But, they probably already knew that.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>When this film came out, many Viet Nam films were being made, at the time. So, this film, took a different spin, on the material. Viet Nam was merely the backdrop, for this film, which focuses more upon, a few of the characters. As they experience, basic training, and eventually, some action in Viet Nam. A well made psychological War film, done only the way Kubrick can.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>"Full Metal Jacket" is a very effective movie about the training and war in Vietnam. Following the character Private Joker, the movie takes in the training of new recruits and their experiences in Vietnam.<br /><br />The movie itself really is an illustration of the dehumanising effects of war and the training. Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann particularly illustrates this in his treatment of Private Pyle, (and, yes, Hartman has a lot of fun with Pyle's name). The dehumanising theme is continued in the Vietnam part of the movie, with the soldier's views on the locals being very much as objects. The movie does not simplify it, but looks at the complexities of the moral choices that face the soldiers in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is a powerful look into the realities of war's effects on people. It is a hard movie to really "enjoy", but it is a very good film all the same. I have seen it a few times, and it has stuck in my memory for the way it addresses a very complicated and broad topic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Kubrick was a visual wizard. Masterfully controlling the cinematography of Full Metal Jacket, he rendered every image is a work of art, searing them into the conscious and subconscious mind. And seeing it in high definition is a wonder. To be sure, there are better transfers, but mostly on subpar films (trash like Stargate). This version of Full Metal Jacket is crisp and clear; the soundtrack is amazing.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, it's impressionistic -- a series of vignettes held together by characters we first meet in bootcamp. It leaves a powerful, lasting impression of the horror, irrationality, and, ultimately, the pure humanity of war. We are killing machines and lovers, passionate friends and brutal thugs. And, in killing and fighting, we sometimes find ourselves most alive.<br /><br />There are amazingly poignant lines in this film that resonate powerfully in terms our current war in Iraq. They don't support one side or another, but merely reflect on the universality of war and on America's invervention in places where the locals might not entirely appreciate our efforts and sacrifices. Reasonable human beings can differ on what is going on in Iraq, just as they could about Vietnam. Full Metal Jacket really isn't about that kind of debate. Rather, it turns the spotlight on how much war is a part of us -- and we a part of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick has made eight film's, "Full Metal Jacket" was his second to last film, made in 1987. Personally I find all eight of those films good even though "Lolita" and "Eye's Wide Shut" dont have half of the goods of the other six. Five of his eight films are all about the same, they are all near perfection. Those include "A Clockwork Orange", "The Shining", 2001: A Space Odyssey", "Dr. Strangelove" and the one at hand "Full Metal Jacket". I think that all eight of his films are worth seeing but those five you simply cant die until you see.<br /><br />This may seem a bit weird but I found "Full Metal Jacket" to be just as scary as Kubrick's "The Shining". Even though there is really only one scene in "Full Metal Jacket" that can be considered scary, the transformation of the "...unfortunate" man into what he becomes is frightening as well. The thing that I really loved about this movie is that it feels like you watch two short films in one movie. Not only do you watch Joker, Leonard, Sargent Hartman & the other men go threw Boot Camp but you also get to watch as Joker enter's the actual war (Veitnam). You continuously see the effects that the war has on the people fighting as well as an ending that keeps you fully involved to say the least.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's Directoral habits (I use habit's in a good way...) and tendencys are fully apparent. The screenplay is flawless. The acting is all around great. The Visuals are unforgetable. The film has a deep impact that you will never forget. "Full Metal Jacket" is an absolute spectacular display of film-making at it's finest!<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>One of the great movies of all time. Essentially it is one story for the first 1/2 of the film and another for the 2nd half. But the two stories work so well together it is all the more effective.<br />The cinematography is beautiful and the acting and dialogue is superb. My only probelm is that this digital remastered version is full frame and not widescreen. Will be waiting for a proper edition, remastered and widescreen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NLH4A3XP4WA5.html">A3NLH4A3XP4WA5</a><br/><p>A good story about a group of men slowly being torn apart by the horrors  of war.  Opening with a mezmorizing scene at the Marine Corps training  camp, and the gut-wrenching Drill Instructor which constantly beats the  platoon into a pulp, is the most realistic training scence that I have ever  viewed.  This film should be viwed by anyone with a serious passion for war  films and Nam history, NOT a family film.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>Fade in:Welcome to the U.S. Marines.<p>  Fade out<p>  Fade in:Welcome to Vietnam<p>  Stanley Kubrick is my fave fimmaker of all time, and he has a style that is unlike any others. The reverse track, the  heavy use(and expert use) of the steadicam, the slow pull backs and slow  zoom ins are all Kubrick. One of the best scenes is when a squad of war  correspondents are scene panning past a unit of Marines after an  attack(with The Trashmen playing in the background), and each Marine gives  his contribution to Sgt. Cowboy's &quot;Start the cameras, this is  Vietnam--The movie! &quot;.  Boot camp scenes are powerful and there  is one scene that is priceless as the D.I. is lecturing to the young boots  about 2 of the world's greatest sharpshooters Charles Whitman and Lee  Harvey Oswald!As we are taken to Hue City during the '68 Tet Offensive, we  get to see what happened to some of the recruits that made it out of boot  camp(now of higher rank-Sgt.Joker,for ex.). Good Vietnam war flick that  shows the young audiences that the war was not just fought out in the  jungles, but in the cities as well.My only complaint(and it is a technical  one) is when are they going to re-release this in DOLBY-SURROUND?</p></br><a href="../users/A17D77DFID0GZG.html">A17D77DFID0GZG</a><br/><p>"Full Metal Jacket" is a two-part film -- the first part hard realism, the second ineffective drivel sprinkled within some brilliantly stylized battle scenes.  Combined, they reflect a rather unsatisfying viewing experience,  at least, for me.<p>The first half of the film is a jarring, realistic look  at basic training, and reveals Kubrick's obsession with perfection.  Although I wasn't in the Marines (I was drafted into the Army during that  period), these scenes sparkle with realism (we had a couple very sadistic  D.I's running our company).  Too bad Kubrick chose to end the basic  training section with a ridiculous (almost comic) performance of a soldier  gone mad (shades of "The Shining" -- but way, way over done).<p>The second  part of the film shows both Kubrick's wonderful camera work along side some  of the lamest excuses for Vietnam-era lingo that I've ever seen/heard  (boring, sing-song dialogue that should have bristled with realism).  The  part where the general chastises Private Joker, then salutes him, was  agonizing to watch.  Another scene where we see one soldier after another  play to a newsreel camera, each speaking a little verse, is strictly out of  the 40's.  There is also a scene onboard a helicopter where the gunner is  shooting villagers and telling Joker that he doesn't have to lead as much  when killing the women and children.  Sorry, this doesn't work either as  comedy or as satire.  But true to Kubrick, while this ridiculous and  unbelievable scene unfolds, Private Joker's friend is listening and trying  not to throw-up (whether it's the helicopter ride or listening and watching  the gunner -- I'm not really sure).  It is this scene that is done to  perfection (honest, I think the kid was actually losing his  cookies!).<p>There is much to really love in this often brilliant,  sometimes shocking film, but alas, there is almost as much to hate.  Between 1 and 10, "Full Metal Jacket" gets a 6.  I just wish Kubrick would  have deleted those cheesy scenes that I listed, because they really brought  this movie crashing down from Kubrick's normal brilliance to  uncharacteristic mediocrity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>There was a point in the eighties and nineties when we were bombarded with Vietnam movies and Vietnam TV series. Overloaded with guilt about ignoring the war and its veterans, we went to the theaters and watched every awful flick Hollywood could churn out. I had a vague memory that FULL METAL JACKET was the best of this bunch. Yeah, I was right. It's excellent.<br /><br />If you've seen the film, of course you remember the drill sergeant. I could quote the first five minutes of his dialogue and bounce out of every mailbox with a spam filter. What do you figure? An hour of writing time for each minute of dialogue? Two hours per minute? You can't possibly take it all in at a single viewing. I have subtitles on the DVD, which is good because sometimes I laugh too loud to hear the words. The guy raised profanity to an art form.<br /><br />Boot camp was a powerful and accurate depiction of institutionalized abuse and manipulation. I know a lot of vets, 1940s through 1980s. They tell me this is real. It damn sure feels real. I won't let my inner cynic say anything about what the locals could learn from this DVD.<br /><br />But, this particular tragedy was only the first half of the film. Armed with whatever they learned in boot camp, they still had to go fight the war. This part of the film was also excellent. Jim Brown didn't run through a minefield or anything like that, but this film's probably more real.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>This is one of Kubrick's best films. This is very realistic about the Vietnam War. His best films include The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and this. Get this classic on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Full Metal Jacket', coauthored, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick may very well be the great director's second best film, after `2001, A Space Odyssey'.<br /><br />The conventional wisdom at the time of the film's release in 1987 is that it was ? of a great film and ? of a good film. Until I recently viewed this DVD, I complacently thought the first half on the Marine training camp on Paris Island, South Carolina was the `great' half and the second half in Vietnam during the Tet offensive was the `good' half. Now, I am not so sure.<br /><br />Most of my new doubt arises from Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as the clueless recruit nicknamed `Gomer Pyle'. I may be seeing this performance in a new light as Mr. D'Onofrio is now a prominent face as an actor in one of the `Law & Order' incarnations where he ably plays a much different sort of role. When I pair this performance with that of Jack Nicholson in `The Shining', I see a common weakness arising from the two actors' giving away the game in their expressions several scenes before their climaxes. In the case of Nicholson, it is almost a full two acts before the story tips its hand. Up until now, I wrote this off as Jack being Jack rather than a result of Kubrick's direction. But now, when I match these two performances up with those of Stirling Hayden and George C. Scott in `Dr. Strangelove', I begin to see a definite pattern of overacting in Kubrick's lead actors, whether it be in comedy, horror, or drama.<br /><br />Another reason for lowering the stock of the Paris Island act is the fact that the central character here, the lead drill instructor, is played by Lee Ermey, who was actually a Marine drill instructor and who served as the technical consultant on the film. Ermey, in the part which would make his career from then on, could probably have played this part in his sleep. I would not be too surprised if I did not actually contribute to a lot of the dialogue, if not literally improvise it on the spot.<br /><br />A third reason for valuing the second half of the movie is the fact that the Vietnam action is so open-ended in comparison to the Paris Island story. There is just so much you can show about Marine trainees and their drill instructors, without going off the reservation. And, with Kubrick's penchant for realism in most things, he is definitely not going off the reservation in this situation.<br /><br />The second half of the movie is largely owned by Matthew Modine (Joker), one of the recruits graduated at the end of the first half, and Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother), he of the `thousand yard stare' who manages to fire a belt fed machine gun while standing and cradling the weapon in his arms. If the recoil doesn't make this improbable, then the overheating of the barrel surely does. But there is none of the overacting which tipped the director's hand in Act I.<br /><br />For the longest time, I felt a disconnect between Act I and Act II, but now the connection between the two halves has become much clearer for me. Act II depicts Marines in combat. Act I shows the kind of training which lead to that combat under fire. And, the most salient aspect of that training is the message that `...Marines are meant to kill, and even if they die, the Corp will live forever...'.<br /><br />It's noteworthy that one of the collaborators in the writing of this movie is Michael Herr, the author of `Dispatches', who also is listed as a co-author of that other great Vietnam era movie, `Apocalypse Now'. Herr's contribution of realism to two relatively surreal movies may be why these two films are well remembered to this day and Acadamy Award winner, `Platoon' has fallen to second string status, except for the cachet obtained by winning the Oscar for best picture.<br /><br />Kubrick's DVDs, like those of Woody Allen, have few extras. And, my favorite, a commentary soundtrack by the director is no longer possible, but, unlike `2001', this movie has relatively few obscure scenes. The only puzzle may be the several visual and auditory allusions to Mickey Mouse.<br /><br />Oddly enough, my take on Kubrick actors' overacting suddenly raises my opinion of `Eyes Wide Shut', where the principals are so low key, you hardly notice that they are acting at all.<br /><br />This is easily in my top 10 favorite war pictures and possibly my favorite Kubrick flick to watch on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Full Metal Jacket is the 2nd Kubrick movie that I've seen and I really enjoyed it. I liked The Shining better though! Watch it!<br /><br />But this movie is different than other war movies. And it's the originality of this movie that makes it such a good movie! It's so original because it's divided into 2 parts. I preferred the 1st because it's the original part. Instead of focussing on the war like all other war movies, this part focusses on the actual training. But this training is showing the brutality and atrocity of war. But this is in the training. It shows the drill officer picking on one soldier for this whole section. Everyone hates this soldier and he suffers and is driven to madness. This part is ended by a tragic and gruesome moment. Therefore it shows not the war between the americans and vietnamese but instead the war between the americans. Or basically all of the americans against one american.<br /><br />The 2nd part is actual Vietnam. It focusses on a journalist also present in the 1st part that is in Vietnam.<br /><br />The movie is sad, violent, brutal, gruesome but very memorable. This is an excellent movie that I preferred over Saving Private Ryan. I recommend this movie to everyone wanting to watch an excellent war movie. I probably wouldn't buy it because it's hard to watch. Th acting is brilliant, notably by the drill seargeant who is very convincing.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>It is strange that Kubrick would choose to revisit the theme of war, considering that he had already conquered the genre with the classic controversial `Paths of Glory' and had done a variation of the theme for `Spartacus', the war comedy `Dr. Strangelove', `Full Metal Jacket', a war film, seems an unlikely career choice, given that Kubrick had not made a film in 7 years since `The Shining', this happens to be his second last film, made in the UK London docks in 1987, it would be 12 years before Kubrick would film again, the somewhat average `Eyes Wide Shut', making this probably his last best film.<br /><br />FMJ is a well made war film full of interesting characters (lots of them) and stunning set pieces - Boot camp and the final war torn city sniper search being the most memorable, FMJ is not exactly original, but the fact that when Kubrick does it right then it usually turns out great, this is another Vietnam war film, that is very good, period. Even though R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman has almost the exact same lines as Louis Gossett Jr., playing Sgt. Emil Foley in `An Officer and a Gentleman', you will watch him in FMJ more than turning to the Richard Gere vehicle. Even though you have seen it all before, it is still worth watching because the set pieces are just done well and the acting is quite good, most noticeably, D'Onofrio as Pyle, cracking under the pressure of drill training and eventually turning on his own squad.<br /><br />FMJ is a two part story, Boot Camp and then War, the newly fresh Marine Corps recruits becoming death, deciding fate, taking action, suffering consequences, `The Draft' a prison for the recruit who should not be there, section 8s everywhere, killers who do not know why they are in Vietnam thrust into the Tet offensive head-on, most of them have peace symbols but will they kill?... or be killed<br /><br />Although quite violent and bloody Kubrick mostly chooses psychology. There is not much to it other than to show the horror of war from the viewpoint that it is just such a mixed bag, from those who are afraid to pull the trigger, to full blown adult criminal sadists leading the men to victory. Kubrick captures Vietnam quite well and Full Metal Jacket is certainly an important film in any collection, as it will be watched time and time again for the high production values and strong acting. Although it might not carry that much of a message like `Paths of Glory' did, it certainly doesn't shy away from showing us the horror of war.<br /><br />As a note this is a PAN and SCAN movie, shot in 1.85 : 1, it was shown in this aspect ratio in the US and then in 1.66 : 1 in Europe. Kurbick did not want to release this in widescreen or even flat. He filmed it specifically for the video market and television's PAN AND SCAN.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Directed by Stanley Kubrick, this 1987 film packs a terrific wallop as it follows the dehumanization of marine recruits as they are first prepared for Vietnam and later sent there.  As in other Kubrick films which deal with the dark side of human nature, there's a voice-over narrator and some extreme closeups, particular one called "the glare" in which a character tilts his head slightly down with his eyes looking up.  The title itself  refers to a shell casing, a metaphor for the tough hollow fighters that these men will eventually turn into.  And from the first scene, which is that of an off-camera barber shaving the heads of the recruits, we see their depersonalization as their hair, which once made them unique individuals, is shaved off.<p>Boot camp takes up more than half of the film, with R. Lee Emery, a former marine sergeant himself, cast in the role of the drill sergeant.  His creativity in insults and curses is amazing as he prods the weak spots of the men under his command, especially the chubby misfit he labels "Private Gomer Pyle", played brilliantly by Vincent D'Onofrio who won a Golden Globe award for his performance.  Aggression is glorified, with serial killers used as examples of excellent marksmanship as the men are taught to worship their rifles, which they treat as objects of love and recite scripted allegiances to them.  It's not surprising when this training results in an act of violence.<p>The scenes that follow in Vietnam are not as strong as the earlier ones, but clearly show how the training both saves the men's lives and dehumanizes them.  Short, episodic scenes set the stage for the final one, where we see the men have come full circle from the recruits they used to be.  And when they are finished with the battle, war weary and left with the visions of some hard choices they have had to make, they march back to base singing a popular child's song, in which they spell out the words "Mickey Mouse" to a familiar tune.  The resulting effect is chilling.<p>The video moved fast, holding my attention in an iron grip.  I was fascinated and horrified and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen as it bolted along.  I felt the agony of the boot camp experience, especially for the misfit, and the horror of Vietnam, including what it must have been like for the Vietnamese.  The film made a statement about inhumanity loud and strong.  Clearly, it was one of the best war films I've ever seen.  The violence is real, both physically and mentally.  Highly recommended, but be prepared for discomfort.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Was this "the best war movie ever made" as the dust jacket proclaims, or just a contrived bit of entertainment, seductive, but ultimately paper thin?  Or maybe this was anti-war propaganda with chuckles from a bleeding heart liberal?  Looking back and seeing it again some fifteen years later (and about fifteen other years after the fact) one can say, "no" and "no" and "something like that, thank you." The sheer waste and stupidity of war is gotten across, and Kubrick is to be thanked for that.  Comparing Full Metal Jacket to some other war movies, say, the pretentious Saving Private Ryan (1998), we note that it may be the funniest war movie ever made.  (But then one recalls Mister Roberts (1955).)<p>Vietnam was a lovely war, as all wars are, kind of like America's loss of innocence.  One would suppose [this had happened] long ago at Gettysburg or somewhere thereabouts, but we proved in Vietnam it wasn't so.  We helped to pile them high at Ypres and Verdun, but that was a limited engagement, and we learned jack-zero.  And in World War II we really had no choice.  But in Vietnam JFK and LBJ thought with a little use of force we could stem the tide of a feared ideology, not yet knowing it would start to die of its own accord, and so we sent off a few of our youngest and brightest as a small price to pay. Well, maybe not our brightest, just our unluckiest or perhaps just those stupid enough to go ("hell no, we won't go!" said some) or poor enough to have no choice.  Those who went were mostly "young and dumb and full of come." But, what the hey, wars are always a good way to kill off superfluous males.  By the time we figured out we weren't getting any kind of bang for our buck, meaning we could pile them high at Da Nang or anywhere in the Mekong Delta and it wouldn't make a ... difference, it was too late.  The body bags were coming home and some of the bro's of conscription age clearly didn't like the fit.  They staged a protest or two, and amazingly enough a lot of people saw the wisdom of their position, and we were forced to declare a victory and pull out, this in the heyday of Tricky Dick.<p>Kubrick recalls those balmy times with boot camp ditties and a whole lot of well expressed jar head jargon to which he adds some amusing audio selections, e.g., Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots were Made for Walking," "Paint It Black" by the Rolling Stones, and most appropriately in the classic Kubrick ironic style, the Mickey Mouse Club theme song, "Em-eye-cee, kay-ee-why, em-oh-you-ees-ee! Mickey Mouse!  Mickey Mouse!"<p>Kubrick got the story from the novel The Short Timers by Gustav Hasford, the title referring to those lucky soldiers with only a short time left before rotating back to "the land of the big P.X.'s," the luckiest of whom were "so short" they could "crawl under a rattlesnake's belly with a high hat on." ... <p>By the way, comparing this to Barry Levinson's fine Good Morning Vietnam from the same year, it's interesting to note that two directors independently came up with practically the same treatment of our experience in Vietnam, albeit with a different emphasis.  I think they got it right.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>As with all of Kubrick films this is meticulously crafted to create an effect an to show us the dehumanization of men at war. The film is divided into two equally compelling halves. The first being Marine basic training,  R. Lee Ermey is scarier than any Vietnamese could hope to be as the drill  sergeant who turns his men into 'killing machines'. The second half  (vietnam combat) is also equally intense and memorable. Vincent D'Onofrio  is also devastating as a clumsy confused private. Matthew Modine adds a  little comic relief to a very heavy film but also creates a fascinating  character. But this is Kubrick's achievement, his use of sets,  cinematography and sound create a profoundly intense impact. A hell of a  war picture. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>The dual nature of man, wherein he is able to embrace both war and peace simultaneously, is addressed by director Stanley Kubrick in the decidedly anti-war film, "Full Metal Jacket," starring Matthew Modine.  Divided essentially into two parts, the first half follows raw recruits through basic training at Parris Island, where the effects of what it takes to turn a man into a Marine / killing machine is explored, predominately through the characters of Private "Joker," played by Matthew Modine, and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), dubbed "Gomer Pyle" by the D.I, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey).  It's a hard, stoic study of techniques and motivation that inherently questions the system itself, and is deftly and succinctly illustrated by the results achieved, which are not entirely those desired.  It's hard stuff to swallow at times, but engrossing, and Kubrick manages to gradually build the emotional intensity that gives such impact to the climax of this first part, which is without question the strength of the entire film.  The second half switches suddenly to Vietnam, where Kubrick takes up his pallet and canvass, and while attempting to paint a realistic portrait of war, instead takes more of a turn away from reality, and the film takes on a sense of the surreal; the result is more reminiscent of the visual artistry of "The Thin Red Line" than of the truly gritty realism of "Saving Private Ryan," and rather than make his statement  directly through the use of the story, he uses the movie to stage sequences of events to demonstrate the contradictory nature of war and it's consequences, and man's involvement therein.  And while he compares the moral and emotional conflicts with the physical, it is an acknowledgement of an inner struggle devoid of any proffered solution, though delivered quite subjectively.  The pace of the film is very deliberate and much of the dialogue has a "staged" sense about it that, rather than underscore the issues being addressed, has more of an alienating effect which serves to neutralize the emotional aspects of what is being presented.  The story is told from the point of view of Modine's "Joker" , but though Modine does a passable job, his is a rather unsympathetic character whose purpose it would seem is merely to act as narrator and to serve as the "eyes" of the camera.  And, again, it only manages to distance the audience further, as Joker becomes a kind of buffer between the viewer and any sustained level of emotional involvement with the story or any of the characters.  Instead of a stirring fulmination against the lunacy of war and man's enablement of it, Kubrick's approach creates more of a sense of rather cold ambiguity.  Had Joker (as the lead) been a stronger character, and had the second half of the film been more like the first, instead of nothing more than a series of vignettes, this could have been a dynamic movie; as it is, because of Kubrick's choices, he made a good movie, but not a great one.  There are two memorable performances here, one by Vincent D'Onofrio, who did an exemplary job of creating the hapless Leonard; the other by Lee Ermey, as the Gunnery Sergeant who could be the poster-boy for an anti-enlistment campaign.  Also worthy of note is the work of Arliss Howard, who brought "Cowboy" so credibly to life.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother); Dorian Harewood (Eightball); Kevyn Major Howard (Rafterman); Ed O'Ross (Lieutenant Tinoshky); and John Terry (Lieutenant Lockhart).  With "Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick raises issues that are important, and makes some valid points about the causes and complexities of war, and the moral and ethical challenges of those presented with it.  Obviously, this was a passionate endeavor; if only he would have allowed more of that passion to make it's way onto the screen.  What a movie this could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>There are so many lines of this movie which have become part of the American Experience, yet so many people have no idea where they come from.  When you try to explain this movie, they often get it mixed up with Platoon and other movies about Nam.  However, I feel no one has captured the true feel, contradiction, frustration, confusion, and absurdity of the Vietnam War like Kubrick did in this movie.  The only way your friends will understand it, is to see it, unless they were there.</p></br><a href="../users/A27QZDO1FRRFCV.html">A27QZDO1FRRFCV</a><br/><p>This is movie is quite addecting, IT takes place from boot camp witch gives you a idea what boot camp really is like<br />  and thean goes to the harsh hell of Vietnam, It will show you how many men went out there wanting to kill and walked back haveing more respect for life.

Definitely a classic worth owning!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Director Stanley Kubrick has created a masterpiece about the war in Vietnam.  Told through the eyes of Private Joker (Matthew Modine), this movie follows a group of recruits in basic training on Paris Island and then into combat in Vietnam.<br /><br />This movie is told in two sections.  Section one describes basic training.  Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is the squad's drill instructor.  Ermey was the perfect choice for this role, having been an actual Marine sergeant in real life.  Hartman is a foul-mouthed pitbull of a drill instructor whose job it is to turn a bunch of young teenagers into a group of well-disciplined killers.  Most of the squad adjusts to Hartman fairly well, but Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) has great difficulty.  He is overweight, out of shape, and rather slow mentally, so he quickly draws the wrath of Hartman, who soon singles him out from the other members of the squad.  Pyle is always screwing up, and Hartman makes the rest of the group pay whenever he makes a mistake.  Soon, the squad gives Pyle an "attitude adjustment" in hopes of shaping him up.<br /><br />After six weeks of hard training, the squad is ready for graduation.  Pyle survives basic training, but its clear that he's pretty much lost his mind, as evidenced by the ending of the first section of the movie.<br /><br />Part two of the film deals with the actual fighting in Vietnam.  Joker, after completing basic training, has become a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, and its his job, along with his partner Rafterman (Kevyn Howard) to write news articles.  His job takes him to many different areas of Vietnam, but he finally latches onto a platoon with has Cowboy (Arliss Howard), his friend from basic training.  Also among the group are Eightball (Dorian Harewood) and Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin).<br /><br />Soon, the group finds themselves up against a concealed sniper who is picking off the squad one by one.  Determined to break through, the group charges ahead, but will they survive?<br /><br />This is a first-rate war movie.  Stanley Kubrick's directing is excellent, and his coice of R. Lee Ermey as Sgt. Hartman was perfect.  I especially liked the way that the movie was divided into two sections.  This made the movie that much more exciting to watch.  Matthew Modine and the rest of the cast give fine performances, too.  The battle scenes are very realistic, and even the scenes with the Vietnamese prostitutes are authentic.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The action is savage, the story is unsparing, and it shows both the rigors of basic training as well as the horrors of combat.  Watch this fine movie and experience the reality of war, from basic training to actual combat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>If Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; stopped after its harrowing boot camp sequence, it'd be a 5-star masterpiece.  The problem is the film's two-part structure.  The first story it tells is such a compelling and fresh take on familiar war-movie material, there's no way the second half can live up to it. <p> Matthew Modine stars as Joker and serves as the narrarator.  The first sequence takes place in boot camp, where Joker and the other recruits learn what it means to be a modern warrior.  R. Lee Ermey, as the DI, completely dominates this half; his character gets almost all the movie's best lines and is such an original and powerful character, the story never quite recovers after his exit.  The boot camp scenes have a nightmarish quality; most effective is the lecture where Ermey praises the sharpshooting skills of former Marines such as Lee Harvey Oswald.  I can't think of another film with such a boot camp setting that matches &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; in intensity- not &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima,&quot; certainly not the otherwise enjoyable comedy &quot;Biloxi Blues.&quot; <p> Then the movie moves to Vietnam in time for the Tet Offensive and the Marine battle at Hue City, and despite its increasing violence, the story begins to sag and feel a bit repetitive.  Joker, now  a combat reporter, meets up with a rifle squad for the fighting at Hue.  The combat scenes have a grungy veracity, and when the troops finally enter the city and meet a sniper, there's a growing terror and suspense... unfortunately, the payoff scene runs much to long, with a pat and disappointing moral quandary for Joker and his fellow Marines.  It's as if Kubrick wasn't sure his themes of dehumanization and brutality have been slammed home enough.  But believe me, they have. <p> Still, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; has to be considered one of the best war movies.  Instead of merely focusing on the action, it examines the psychology of the battlefield mind.  The Marines are close to the edge, and their comaraderie borders on the psychotic.  One in particular laments that back home, he won't have anyone around worthy enough to shoot.  Very eerie and effective. <p> Standouts besides the amazing Ermey include Vincent D'Onofrio as a dim-witted screw-up nicknamed &quot;Pyle&quot; and Adam Baldwin (from &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;) as the ultra-mean Animal Mother.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" suffers from the same inconsistency and inaccessibility that characterizes many of the director's other works.  There are moments of brilliance scattered throughout the film but these moments only appear in spurts and are inter-cut with moments of sheer emotional detachment.<br /><br />Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and a group of raw recruits go through an agonizing combat training program headed by the tyrannical Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey).  The soldiers are molded into warriors but tragedy strikes when Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) snaps under the physical and psychological trauma he has been put through.  Later when Joker heads to Vietnam, he experiences the horrors of war first-hand while carrying out his duties as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes.<br /><br />"Full Metal Jacket" scores points for devoting a substantial amount of time to the basic training program that the soldiers go through.  Oftentimes this aspect of war films is just covered in passing so that more time can be spent on the more riveting battle sequences.  Yet as interesting as the first half of the film is, "Full Metal Jacket" continuously feels distant.  Even when the setting shifts to Vietnam in the second half, the level of the film's emotional intensity still is stuck in neutral.  Kubrick, like Alfred Hitchcock before him, is a master film-making technician who sometimes had trouble infusing his works with passion and zeal.  The end result in this case is a superbly crafted film that just feels flat from start to finish.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>Most people think that this is really 2 movies in 1: the Marine boot camp first half, the Vietnam combat 2nd half. Actually they are two sides of the same coin.<br /><br /> I agree with the Boston Globe's assesment that this is &quot;the greatest war movie ever made.&quot; It captures the essence of war: the mass psychological programming that makes it possible, and the concrete results of that programming when it comes in contact with reality.<br /><br /> A lot of people criticize the second half as being slow, abrupt, pointless, ugly and anticlimactic---which, of course, is exactly how war IS, especially the Vietnam war.<br /><br /> ...The movie suggests that both forms of innocence/humanity must be killed if one is to &quot;get with the program&quot; of war fighting---a program that is by terms hideous, brutal, corrupt---and absolutely, hilariously absurd.<br /><br /> In contrast to today's Bush Jr.'s simpleton yee-haw post-9/11 view of the world, Kubrick's film presents a much more ambiguous and therefore more richly accurate picture: There are no good guys, there are no bad guys, there are just guys who kill and guys who get killed, and there's no telling which category you'll find yourself in, 'cause it's just one big crazy Mickey Mouse show out there, in this &quot;world of s--t.&quot;<br /><br /> Right-wing lovers of patriotic kitsch need not apply!</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick is one of my all-time favorite movie directors. He was an unparalleled master of technique and form, releasing unequaled classics like "A Clockwork Orange," "2001," and "The Shining." But even great directors have at least one subpar movie in their resume, and this puppy is it. "Full Metal Jacket" is really two films blended into one. The first half is easily the more effective of the two. Here, we get an unflinching look at the day-to-day training of the Marines during the Vietnam war. The recruits are humiliated, verbally assaulted, and endure the most rigid of physical regimens. It's simultaneously unsettling and hilarious. But the minute these recruits go to war, it all goes downhill. This is quite possibly the first Kubrick movie that nearly put me to sleep. The war sequences are unexciting and perfunctory, and they pale in comparison to the rawness of the vastly superior Coppola masterpiece "Apocalypse Now." But there are definitely Kubrick touches that help make the film interesting. A lot of the photography recalls the clean and sterile images of "A Clockwork Orange." In addition, one scene, which looks like it could have been lifted from "The Shining," has the camera zoom into a recuit wearing the most demented facial expression. Kubrick diehards may want to give this a whirl, but if you're a fan of war movies, the final verdict is this: you've seen it all before. And better.</p></br><a href="../users/AFMUUJT7J32LN.html">AFMUUJT7J32LN</a><br/><p>The boot camp is entertaining and absorbing. The plot starts too loose it way when hippie factor starts coming out.

It's not even worth one viewing. The best part of the movie is the first half, parts of which (I think) are viewable online; and R.

There's not one character (except maybe Gomer Pyle) that you can really care about, but even Pyle doesn't get enough screen time. It's just as if there are two parts of an idea assembled in a hurry, and the result is a huge mess. To quote a blurb describing another movie, "Scattershot narrative." Worth only one viewing.

They are given a welcoming speech by the Gunnery Sergeant. This is not a recruiting film. [The language is raw, but sort of funny in an exaggerated way.] They are taught to distinguish their rifle from a gun (artillery). "Gomer Pyle" has problems. [I wonder if such training was used in World War One and Two?] Gunny uses peer pressure against "Pyle". He has a "bad dream"! The Marines are taught how to shoot accurately. They finish their training and graduate. Most will go to Vietnam. There is a dramatic scene in the head when Leonard disobeys orders. [How realistic is this?]<br /><br />They arrive in Vietnam and learn to communicate with the indigenous people and learn the culture. The correct phrase is "sweep and clear" not "search and destroy". There are two types of stories published. It is the Lunar New Year. The Marines shoot at the figures who are far away. Joker will be sent to cover the front. One man in a helicopter shoots at the people on the ground. They arrive at the combat zone and find dead civilians. Was that speech by the Colonel supposed to be funny? They meet some frontline troops. There is enemy action and casualties. They photograph the troops, who speak their lines. There is a scene that wouldn't be shown on the 7 o'clock news. The Marines patrol the ruins of a city to check the report. A booby trap claims a victim. The follow the map. Was there a mistake? The enemy shoots the point man to draw in those who want to rescue him. "Where's the sniper?" Did one man stand in an exposed position? The Marines are able to neutralize the sniper. This scene is drawn out for dramatic effect and commentary on combat. What song do they sing as a final comment?<br /><br />The credits roll, the cast is shown in tiny type. "Filmed on location." The story was not designed to be a popular success. So who put up the funds for it? Was it designed to be a loss to offset profits from other successful investments? Oliver Stone's "Platoon" is still the best movie on the war on Vietnam. This is based on Gustav Hasford's novel "The Short-Timers". The first part of the film shows the psychological conditioning of recruits. Do they get any reconditioning before they are returned to civilian life? I wonder if anyone realized that forty years later America would be shipping factories to Vietnam and China?</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>As Pvt. Joker says to the film crew interviewer, only half-joking in his snide and cynical manner.  The whole scene of the men being filmed under fire and then interviewed was just one juxtaposition of absurdity in Kubrick's wonderful take on the Viet Nam war.<p>Of course it would take Stanley Kubrick to finally quit the screwing around and show us a real D.I. dehumanizing and rebuilding recruits into killers in a realistic recitation of a Viet Nam era Marine Corps. Boot Camp.  Lee Ermey was a D.I. and his Sgt. Hartman profanely ripping a new-one on one Boot after another is a piece of work.  And of course, he is brutal to the goat of the platoon, poor fat Leonard (Gomer Pyle), harassing and tormenting him into a homicidal disassociative psychosis. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio are wonderful as tormetor and tormented.<p>Then there are all the other nice Kubrickian touches, such as Hartman using Charles Whitman (the Texas U. sniper) and Lee Harvey Oswald as positive examples of Marine Corps. marksmanship.  No doubt is made of the fact that Hartman's job is to desensitize and harden these young men for combat or they will not survive.  But, it is a cruel exercise, just as shoving young, mostly teenage Americans into a faraway &amp; confusing war is a cruel exercise.  And, it is a thin line, as Hartman &amp; Leonard's fates attest.<p>So, Kubrick gives us the training then takes us to the war.  This is not the jungle war, but the war in the city of Hue during the Tet Offensive.  It is more upfront then the guerrilla-style jungle combat, but as we see, just as ambiguous in the end in its execution and purpose.  Kubrick gives us lots of little touches and anecdotes.  One of my favorites, the Col. breaking Pvt. Joker's chops over his peace button using sports metaphors about &quot;getting on the team and going in for the big score&quot;.  Wonderful.<p>Kubrick doesn't romanticize the North Vietnamese or the Viet Cong either.  The long line of executed villagers lieing in a ditch covered with lye, who had been gulled into reporting to and then murdered by the Cong is shown with an effectively quiet eloquence. Cruelty and savagery abounded there.<p>The final conflict, with the entire squad held-up and shot-up and terrified by what turns out to be a teenage Viet Cong girl says more about who and what we were fighting over there than any long diatribe.  The entire might of the U.S. forces, best trained and equipped in the world, can be devastated by an AK47 wielded by a determined teenager.  Kubrick does not judge these Marines, nor the enemy they faced.  He shows the dilemma, and let's us decide the worth of this effort.  He shows death on both sides, and leaves us to ask the questions.<p>And the young troops march to the Perfume River singing the theme from the Mickey Mouse Club.  Two cultures in collision?  Young men in combat somewhere they never should have been sent?<p>Kubrick's camera work and recreation of combat is as good in its way as Saving Pvt. Ryan's was in its way.  His sardonic humorous touches are numerous and welcome.  His choice and placement of music is, as was always true in his later movies, nothing less than brilliant.<p>Like all of Kubrick's later movies, when I first saw Full Metal, I was a little disappointed.  It didn't seem BIG like Dr. Strangelove or 2001.  But, I have seen it many times since, and I cannot find a flaw in it.  When it starts, I have to watch it all the way through.  Stanley set such a high standard, it always seemed a little disappointing when you first saw the later films, but they age well.<p>Now, I think this is another masterpiece of economy and story telling.  It says a lot, without preaching.  A terrific film.</p></br><a href="../users/A8M4WE1MT4R4O.html">A8M4WE1MT4R4O</a><br/><p>Having seen a hell of alot of war movies in my time, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is by far my favourite. It is the most engaging look at the Vietnam war, in a simplistic Kubrick kind of way.  Who else could make an  &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; war movie.  Don't get me wrong, i'm not really a  Kubrick fanatic (the only other movie I like by him is The Shining). What i  enjoyed about Full Metal Jacket was the sheer minimalistic way it was  filmed. The scenes were not clutered about, and there were no long drawn  out mega-shoot outs where you don't know what the heck is going on.  Instead, Kubrick took his time with each scene, which in essence totally  envelops you and makes the last war sequence a total gut wretching  experience.  A total enthralling movie, and absolutely great  cinematography.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Full Metal Jacket" is Director/Producer/Co-Writer Stanley Kubrick's meditation on the Vietnam War.<br /><br />Typical for Kubrick it has an air of detachment, surrealism, tinged with a nauseous sense of weirdness.<br /><br />In the first half of the film we have basic training at Parris island, which is portrayed in its strip-lit, hospital-like setting as a kind of mental institution where Marine recruits are brutalized. In the second half set in Vietnam, war is literally hell complete with fire and brimstone.<br /><br />The film is stunningly photographed, well-acted, and if not totally successful, is certainly memorable.<br /><br />There are no "extras" on the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>It is increasingly difficult for younger people to understand the 60s and what happened in America. The catalyst for change was the Viet Nam War. On the one hand, we had a society that was chafing under the paradigms of the 1950s, and the residual effects of the black and white world which we tried to create in the aftermath of World War II and the ascendancy of communism. On the other hand, we had a generation looking to change the way we perceive the world, including how we look at enemies, and whether some people were really our enemies. In some ways the Viet Nam War became a surreal alternate reality where our soldiers received a huge cultural shock leaving the relatively cloistered Disneyland of America. The difficulty becomes capturing not the reality of Viet Nam, but the feeling of Viet Nam. Stanley Kubrick did exactly that with "Full Metal Jacket."<br /><br />There are two portions to this movie, with the second part of the movie having sub-parts. In the first portion of the movie we meet the principal character we will follow into Viet Nam, Private J.T. "Joker" Davis. Joker is the observer of the indoctrination of new Marine recruits, where pampered civilian sons are turned into fighting men. R. Lee Ermey established a milestone in military character portrayals by his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. He is mean and tough, but he is that way because he knows that the reality of war requires mean and tough men. Unfortunately, Private Leonard "Gomer Pyle" Lawrence (chillingly played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is unable to tolerate the stress of indoctrination, and snaps in a very violent, shocking, way. Thus ends basic training and Private Joker's transition to Viet Nam.<br /><br />The transition from basic training to Viet Nam is instantaneous, with no discussion of the aftermath of Private Gomer Pyle's actions. However, as I pointed out earlier, consider the shock that these young men faced as they went from the black and white, sheltered life of a citizen of the United States to a corrupt country where death was around every corner. The culture shock is difficult to convey, and yet the disorientation in the transition from the first part of the movie to the second part makes a good attempt at having the audience experience the feeling, even if it is in a relatively benign way.<br /><br />The second part of the movie explores what happens when people who have been exposed only to American culture are faced with the reality of combat. Private Joker must confront combat and the result of combat head on while being a pacifist at his core. However, even his peaceful nature can not stand by while a vengeful and ferocious enemy is killing his comrades. Private Joker is faced with mass graves and the reality of a war of attrition and the senseless violence of some Americans, though the enemy was just as ruthless when the opportunity arose.<br /><br />The movie uses the 1968 Tet Offensive as a backdrop for a series of intense combat scenes leading up to a confrontation between Private Joker's squad and an unseen enemy. The violence in this series of scenes is graphic and simultaneously poignant. Death in combat is never pretty, and Stanley Kubrick did his best to depict combat death in all its horrific detail. If anyone is tempted to glorify combat this movie should be mandatory watching.<br /><br />The final scene in this movie is a confrontation between Private Joker and an enemy sniper. The confrontation is incredible because of the complexity of the numerous feelings. There is fear. There is the sudden realization that the enemy is only a little different from us; young and frightened. There is the desire to not have to kill the enemy, to wish that circumstances could be otherwise. There are more feelings, many more, for an empathetic viewer.<br /><br />Knowledgeable viewers will not mistake "Full Metal Jacket" for a documentary, or even being more than passingly factual. What this movie does do is give viewers the feeling of the era, the feeling of being a soldier in a war that many, and perhaps ultimately most, in America did not want to fight. This war helped America realize that World War II was not happening again, that black and white was gray, and that we too were different, though we were realizing it all too slowly. Of all the Viet Nam War related movies that I have watched, and I have seen all but one of significance, this movie seems to me to best portray how we felt as the 60s came to an end, whether we like to remember that feeling or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>I have to say that there is no war movie like Full Metal Jacket. I haven't seen every war movie, so it's safe to say that other war movies share similar themes and there are many movies that depict combat, friendships, and desensitization .  But man, Full Metal Jacket has many classic scenes, scenes that can not be duplicated in any other movie.  How many other movies feature a forty seven boot camp plot, soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse theme song over charred landscapes, or feature Surfin' Bird over combat and a team filming soldiers?  That's right, none.  These are few of the many memorable scenes that fill the unique Full Metal Jacket, further delivered by the one of a kind directing from Stanley Kubrick.  It's a surprisingly ambiguous and war movie, especially compared to Platoon (frequently compared to Jacket) which is a much more emotionally driven drama, than Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />Sure, Full Metal Jacket may not be as emotionally powerful as Saving Private Ryan of Grave of the Fireflies.  As a matter of fact, the emotional factor seems to be lacking in Full Metal Jacket, especially compared to other movies.  The suicide of Private Pyle has no hint of music that wants us to feel sorry for him (even though we do).  The death of Private Cowboy is surprisingly cold and lacks emotional resonance.  But really, that's part of the reason why Full Metal Jacket stands out among war movies.  It's not an entirely mean-hearted movie by any stretch (though I'm not surprised if this gets criticism for being racist), as there is humanity and goodness within the movie. But when it comes to war movies, there aren't many other war films that have most, if not all, their sentimentality drained as Full Metal Jacket does.<br /><br />As everybody and their mother knows, Full Metal Jacket is divided into two parts.  The first 47 minutes stars actual drill instructor Lee Ermey (according to the box.  I forgot his real name) pitting grunts through basic training.  After the first half, Full Metal Jacket turns into a wild second half, which almost feels more like set pieces and situations than one plot.  However, I find the second half to be just as memorable and compelling, and the set pieces are linked together quite well.  It flows, even though there not much of a strict running plot.  Quite frankly, it works that way.  Not every situation in life is like a story, and Full Metal Jacket is refreshing because of that.  This movie never feels like a story, and quite frankly, I like it that way.<br /><br />The end result makes for a good two hours of war captured on film that you won't find anywhere else.  The first half goes through training, while the multiple sequenced second half goes through a fight with a sniper, some time with a sadistic door gunner, The Battle of Hue, and even some time with sleazy Vietnamese prostitutes (Me love you long time originated from this movie, I think).  All of this is presented with more flair and creativity than your usual war movie, and the movie is surprisingly funny at times.  The dialogue is incredibly quotable and funny.  I know Ermey's dialogue is supposed to be cruel, but good lord, these quotes are just hilarious.  "Five foot nine I didn't know they stacked _____ that high!" is just one of the many lines that are CLASSIC.  The chants he makes the soldiers shout are extremely catchy, for some reason.  No, classic even. Seriously.  Even beyond this, the quotes and moments in this movie stick in your head.  "A Day Without Blood is Like a Day Without Sunshine" has to be the coolest line ever spoken in a war movie.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie is the characters, who are much more fun and memorable than your average war movie.  As another reviewer put it, the young men portrayed here are fun, cool, somewhat dangerous, and motivated in some way or another. Everybody knows about R. Lee Ermey's performance (cool fact: Ermey plays Sarge from Toy Story), Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Private Pyle, Adam Baldwin as the nihilistic machine gunner who goes off into crazy fits of shooting, and Matthew Modine as the protagonist.  They are all funny, somewhat crazy, have personality, and are entertaining to watch.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's directing makes Full Metal Jacket unique as well.  Kubrick is known for making sure every shot was perfect in his eyes, and I think it shows here.  He was a master at the camera.  For example, the end of the movie, featuring gut-wrenching slow motion details on gunshot wounds, featuring blood splattering like slow motion water, are among nothing else I've seen in a war movie.  It's not the slow motion that's unique, it's just the whole way it's constructed.  I also like the soundtrack, both Vivian Kubrick's score and the soundtrack featuring rock and pop artists.  The lack of soundtrack helps as well, making the movie seem even more unique.  Some of the scenes are enhanced further by music, but for the most part, the minimal amount works well.  The pop songs conjures up moods rather well, in the way rock and pop songs proved effective in movies like Dazed and Confused, Pulp Fiction, and Trainspotting.<br /><br />My interpretation of the film may be different from yours, and there are a lot of different interpretations that can said about the scenes, as there are many themes in this movie further established by some ambiguous scenes that actually are open to some interpretation.  The first half, in my opinion, is fairly easy to understand, about how war is not for the weak or dependent.  Self esteem seems to be in play when it comes to reaction to boot camp training.  Some of the soldiers have enough self esteem to harden up, but others, such as the ill-fated Private Pyle, do not.  Private Pyle's breakdown and eventual suicide is an interesting theme for me, being one who has seen plenty of bullying thanks to exposure of some lame Vocational class I took (though that class was filled with plenty of socially adapt people, so we weren't all lonely misfits.  As a matter of fact, many of us were not).  Pyle, unlike the other troops, were socially and mentally slow, which makes it hard for him to gain self esteem.  With no escape from a system that chips away at your comfort zone and dependency on others to make you happy, it's no wonder he turned inward and went crazy.  That may have been his only comfort zone, but it sure was a lot more devastating than helpful.<br /><br />As for the second half?  The goofy Surfin' Bird certainly makes the ridiculous act of having a camera team shooting soldiers seem stupid and insulting to the soldiers involved.  We meet many characters that represent many sides of war, and plenty of situations as well.  Even better, aside from the lame scenes regarding Vietnamese woman, all of scenes are watchable and interesting.  We see the difference between how we are all much more ignorant about something we have never done before, how some people apparently get a thrill of killing foreigners, and the Jungian thing. It almost seems like this movie is about the perception of war, as we get a million different views from different people at once.  A nihilistic view from Animal, a racist view from Eightball, a individualistic side from Joker, and a natural urge to kill from people like Rafterman. At least that's my interpretation.  For now, at least.<br /><br />In short, Full Metal Jacket is definitely a unique war movie.  While it will never truly lift your spirits up, the boot camp section, it's set pieces after the boot camp sequence, the performances and characters, and it's dehumanizing themes all contribute to making this movie an exceptional war movie.  That's why this movie truly deserves to crack top spots in polls for great war films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Full Metal Jacket is one of the best films , Stanley Kubrick ever made. The film has humor, gut wrenching war scenes and brilliant acting. Matthew Modine is great as Joker, but it's Vincet D'Onforio and R.Lee Emery as Pyle and the Drill Sgt. The chemistry between these two actors is of David and Goliath calbiar. The film makes you feel like you're in basic training with the troops and although the film is violent it's still an art form. **** out ****.</p></br><a href="../users/AR14BIUHYR6B7.html">AR14BIUHYR6B7</a><br/><p>Yes, I was disappointed with this release.  Only on occasion does it surpass the standard edition, even with side by side comparisons.  The choice to letterbox the presentation, against Kubrick's intentions, does not jibe with the intent of HD, which is to give you the most accurate presentation of the film on a home video medium.  Hopefully Warner Home Video will revisit this title again in the future and give it the remastering it should have received.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>You could say that 'Full Metal Jacket' is a movie which in fact consists of two movies that can be seen seperate, though we can see some of the characters back in part II.<br /><br />Part I is about boot-camp where new marines are taught to be killing machines by a magnificent Lee Ermey. There are so many insults and so much degrading that there aren't really any personalities. There are just soldiers with their own quirks but we never get to know anything about them.<br /><br />Part II is your typical war movie with of course a Kubrick twist. Visual signs are everywhere. The main character, Private Joker, starts out in the bootcamp but in Vietnam is a reporter wearing a peace-sign, while on his helmet we can read "Born to Kill". There are many signs like this, which makes the movie really interesting to look at.<br /><br />The movie is an anti-war movie and shows the contempt soldiers have in war for the enemy. There is a scene of someone randomly shotting people from a helicopter, a mass grave and more.<br /><br />Better than Platoon, almost as good as Apocalypse Now.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers and directed by Stanley Kubrick who co-authored the screenplay, this film answers two questions: What was it like for a recruit to go through Marine boot camp during the Viet Nam War, and, what was combat like in that war? Unlike a previous Kubrick film, Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket neither makes nor implies any anti-war statements. Rather, in my opinion, the two separate but related portrayals "tell it like it was." When I first saw this film 25 years ago, my reactions resembled those of Private Benjamin during her own boot camp training: shock and denial. Having never served in a military service, I simply could not believe that Marine recruits are subjected to such abuse, both physical and verbal. One of my sons served in the Marines and confirms what other Marines of my own generation assert, that Full Metal Jacket is about as realistic as a film could be. Older friends who were involved in D-Day make the same claim for Saving Private Ryan. <p>In any event, the primary plot during the boot camp sequence focuses on Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), nicknamed "Gomer Pyle," and his struggles to survive constant humiliation by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a former Marine D.I.) Played by Matthew Modine, J.T. Davis ("Joker") does everything humanly possible to help him. Months later while on an assignment for Stars &amp; Stripes magazine,  "Joker" accompanies a squad in the Khe San area. Once under attack by a Viet Cong sniper, most of the Marines react according to their boot camp training. Of special interest to me is the character Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) who has become a highly-skilled (probably psychotic) warrior. He defies authority with the instincts of a ferocious animal but, at the same time, reveals a sincere and endearing concern for the welfare of his comrades. It remains for each person who sees this film to determine to what extent (if any) it is "anti-" anything. And perhaps at least a few will share my own initial reaction: Full Metal Jacket consists of two separate but inseparable films which share the same title. Together, they have enduring dramatic impact.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Full Metal Jacket is a unique entry in the Stanley Kubrick canon, as it's not quite a masterpiece but is as iconic and frequently discussed as his other films. Released in 1987, seven years after his previous film The Shining, Kubrick tackles the then-popular subject of the Vietnam War but puts his own Kubrickian spin on it. At 117 minutes, Full Metal Jacket was the shortest film Kubrick had made since 1964 despite a first and second half that seem like two different films.<br /><br />As if any introduction is necessary, the film opens with Marine Corps recruits entering training at Parris Island and meeting Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), who intends to turn the recruits into hardened marines during their stay. Even those who haven't seen the film know about the opening scene, featuring Gunnery Sergeant Hartman meeting the recruits and spouting some oft-quoted dialogue that has become a part of the cultural vernacular. The first seven minutes is arguably one of the greatest opening scenes in film history. It's certainly one of the most iconic. Out of all the recruits, the film centers attention on Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'onofio), a simple, overweight recruit who incurs Hartman's wrath and is nicknamed "Gomer Pyle." As Hartman begins putting the recruits through their training, he endlessly harasses the simple-minded Private Pyle, eventually pairing him up with Joker in the hopes that it will improve Pyle's skill. These scenes at Parris Island feature some of the most hilarious, depressing, and fascinating stuff that Kubrick ever shot and it's all over after a mere 45 minutes.<br /><br />I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is an undisputed masterpiece. After the Parris Island scenes, it essentially becomes a different film with the locale switching abruptly from South Carolina to Vietnam circa January of 1968. Here, Joker is a journalist accompanied by Private First Class Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), a combat photographer. With the beginning of the Tet Offensive, Joker and Rafterman are sent to cover the enemy attacks in South Vietnam. Here, Joker is reunited with Cowboy (Arliss Howard), one of the recruits at Parris Island, now a Sergeant and second-in-command of the Lusthog Squad. We're introduced to several members of the Lusthog Squad, most memorably Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) a machine gunner, who's given some of the most interesting dialogue about the war effort.  The two halves of Full Metal Jacket are so disassociated from each other it's hard to believe, at times, they're from the same film. The second half is strong, very strong in fact, and effectively entertaining; but it fails to live up to the momentum of the first half and is simply not as memorable as what came before it. Even so, the climactic standoff with the sniper is one of the strongest scenes in the entire film.<br /><br />England was used as a substitute for Vietnam and is beautiful at times, while at others Kubrick's Vietnam more closely resembles a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Even with the onslaught of Vietnam-related films that had been coming out of Hollywood and picking up accolades for the several years leading up to this film's release, not a single frame of this film seems overly familiar. Kubrick's composition of the most minor, seemingly insignificant shot was and remains awe-inspiring. Kubrick's Vietnam film may not be the best Vietnam film, but it certainly has some of the most memorable imagery. Oddly enough, there is something lacking from this film in regards to Kubrick's style. Perhaps it's the lack of classical music that characterizes so many of Kubrick's films and really lend to the atmosphere and style, but Full Metal Jacket, as a whole, lacks the distinct Kubrickian atmosphere that can be spotted in all of his output from 1968 on even by the most untrained eye. There are the unbroken, static shots that seem so still even when there's movement as well as the dead-stare of characters descending into madness that give him away, but there's a tone that's noticeably missing from this film.<br /><br />Based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, who co-wrote the script with Kubrick and Michael Herr, the film is not overtly political and lacks a defined pro or anti stance on war, but that doesn't make it a straight-forward war film either. With Joker sporting the iconic words "Born to Kill" on his helmet, while wearing a peace sign on his flak jacket and discussing the duality of man ("the Jungian thing") with his Major, there's enough of the high-minded here to give a Kubrick disciple plenty to analyze. However, it's no wonder that out of Kubrick's other efforts Full Metal Jacket has arguably been most embraced by the average moviegoer and teenager.<br /><br />Full Metal Jacket features some stunning and unforgettable performances, particularly R. Lee Ermey (credited without the "R.") and D'onofio. There is absolutely nothing I can say about Ermey's brilliant performance that hasn't already been said and D'onofrio too has received his share of acclaim for his sympathetic, tragic performance. There's plenty of great acting across the board here, but the acting is less consistent than one would expect from a Kubrick film (him being such a perfectionist). There are very minor, almost unnoticeable moments where an actor will briefly appear, unconvincingly deliver his dialogue, and disappear. There is nothing glaringly bad, but there are a few moments where the actors just don't seem up to snuff.<br /><br />This is overall a lesser film for Stanley Kubrick, the only one of his films released between 1969 and 1999 that isn't a masterpiece. With that in mind, this shows what a phenomenal filmmaker Kubrick was as most directors would hope that one of their lesser films was of this quality. It's not that Full Metal Jacket isn't a masterpiece in comparison to his other films, it's just lacking in certain areas that keep it from being a masterpiece itself. There's a lack of cohesion between the two parts of the film; they exist so far apart from each other that it almost feels like a great film was cut short and a good film, with some great scenes, was edited onto it. It's a near-masterpiece and an undeniable cultural landmark, a film that will stand the test of time among Kubrick's other work. The biggest problem with Full Metal Jacket is that is has scenes many will remember forever and others they'll quickly forget.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br></body></html>

A book which caused much controversy over its subject matter of rape,and murder and its aftermath on a family and community. Its also a book that is much loved by its fans and I have to say that when I read it one of the first things that popped into my head when I finished it was "This will be a hard book to turn into a movie" and I was right. Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame, BUT who also did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065KFV">Heavenly Creatures</a> a film which I absolutely love. I thought that because of the subject matter of Heavenly Creatures, young girls, murder, deep emotional observations and characters...that he would be able to tackle The Lovely Bones on the same level and skill. I was wrong.<br /><br />The movie sets looked good, I really got that "we are in the 70's" vibe from it. Outfits, houses, knick knacks, hairstyles, cars, posters on the walls, it all gave us a good solid place to start from. It was cast pretty good as well, Mark Wahlberg belongs in that era for sure. Susie Salmon played by Saoirse Ronan can carry a drama as we have seen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013XZ6X4">Atonement (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the rest of the cast was adequate. Too bad that none of them really needed to have any acting skills, because Peter Jackson didnt write a movie that required them.<br />All the skills needed was a good set designer, hair and makeup and CGI expertise.<br /><br />This movie basically just took the story from the book, barely touched on the good parts or left them out all together, and then expected us to connect some dots that were never on the same page at the same time. Even if you had never read the book, you would leave feeling like something was missing. There was no character development, no crafting of the sense of Susie and her family and what they meant to eachother. There was no descriptions of the community in which this horrible crime took place, or any in depth look at the investigation itself! The scene where her mom and dad are in bed and crying about how she is gone forever...flat and deviod of any real emotions. We arent shown how this affected this family except for the father breaking his ships in a bottle and even that was empty.<br /><br />As for the "heaven" that Susie ends up in, I can only say that I was hoping that my TV had suddenly switched to cable and I watching some horrible Disney Channel tweens daydream while she was in math class. I felt like Lisa Frank <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PLRDR6">Lisa Frank Motivational Stickers - Over 1500!</a>decided to direct this instead of Jackson.<br /><br />The characters of Ray, Ruth, Detective Fenerman, Buckley, Lindsey, Holly, and even Abby and Jack were never explored!! Even the main character of Susie? What do we get from what they showed us? Barely anything for us to sit down for 2 hours and whatever minutes and care about the outcome.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones needed to be made into a movie, but it should have been done ina way where it honored the book and how powerful it was. This version, didnt. I cannot recommend this to any fan of the book, or even someone looking for a dramatic movie to watch.<br /><br />a reviewer from [..] said it best "The Lovely Bones is pretty much what I anticipated from the director of an epic trilogy of plus-sized fantasy flicks and an oversized remake of a classic, lean thriller. Jackson is so in love with the material and the premise that he can't resist expanding upon its themes, conflating them with his own ideas on grief, mortality, and the rich fantasy life of teenage girls. The film veers uneasily between entrancing poetry and wrongheaded melodrama, stopping along the way for left-field slapstick and old school cheap thrills"</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>For me, everything worked in this movie, full of imagery and emotion.

While the book, being a rather introspective version of the murder of a young lass, would be difficult to translate to film, Peter Jackson (with a screenplay adaptation by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Jackson himself) should call this version an idea inspired by Sebold's book.  If desiring a reenactment of the novel is the viewer's desire, skip this film, but if simply watching a 'different' Peter Jackson epic is your cup of tea, this film will romance you.<br /><br />The young girl Susie is well played by Saoirse Ronan, and her parents are rather one dimensionally brought to celluloid by Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, with a lot of help from the over-the-top portrayal of Susie's meddling kookie grandmother as molded by Susan Sarandon.  Susie's sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) gets to experience all the things the deceased Susie wanted to experience, Ray Singh gives an interesting bit of strange aura as Ray the one Susie would have loved had she lived, and Michael Imperioli serves well a the policeman who continues to endlessly track the murder.  But the film holds together because of the smarmy  serial killer George Harvey, yet another stellar performance by Stanley Tucci.  He is terrifyingly believable and should scare everyone who watches is sick mind work.<br /><br />The special effects are 'pretty' in a sort of Hallmark cards way and Jackson tries his best to make us follow this maladaptive transformation of Sebold's novel.  But given all the negatives THE LOVELY BONES  is still worth watching, if only as a momentary diversion.  And it would be a shame not to see this performance by Stanley Tucci!

Amazon will only let me give 3 stars, but really, I want to give this 3.5. I just couldn't bring myself to give a 4 because this movie was flawed in some parts, but it IS a step above 3 stars. If you haven't read the book, then you might not enjoy this movie as much, because it is very scattered in some parts.<br /><br />Having read the book, I had no problem with seeing what was going on, but my roomate, not having read the book, needed me to explain a few parts in the movie for better understanding. If a producer/writer can't make a book adaptation clear, then there is a clear problem.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't the best, but there were some great parts, although I am disappointed at the way that some of the parts of the book were changed or just cut out. I realize you can't put the whole book in a movie, but it would be nice if the writers had put together a more coherent and tighter script for the movie, it felt more attention was paid to visuals and special effects than the story itself. Obviously, this movie is not for everyone, so you need to judge for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>This movie has great content, but it seems like they forgot to hire an editor.<br />One moment you're creeped out, the next moment you're supposed to be filled with awe and wonder at a heavenly sequence, it just is too scattered and ambitious.  It's a shame because the casting is great and the story does have the potential to be powerful in more skilled hands.  Several parts were too contrived, worst of all the relationship with her "boyfriend", which they inserted like a letter into a mail slot, no chemistry or feeling.  Tucci was great and I'd still recommend the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>THE LOVELY BONES isn't really a bad movie, exactly.  It's not even fair to say that it's a disappointment (although I had certainly hoped to be moved more by it), because as I think back on my feelings after reading the book, there were flaws aplenty there as well.  Unfortunately, the flaws seem more obvious on screen and the strengths fade somewhat to the background.<br /><br />Set in the 1970's, THE LOVELY BONES introduces us to the Salmon family.  Jack, the father (Mark Wahlberg) is an accountant, and mother Abigail (Rachel Weisz) stays home.  There a young son, a middle sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and oldest sister Susie (Saoirse Ronan from ATONEMENT), who is about 14 or so.  They live in a nice, suburban neighborhood, wear nice earth-tone, corduroy clothing we associate with that time, and they have small arguments and little joys.  They also live down the street from George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), a mild-mannered loner...who one afternoon after school murders young Susie as she's walking home across a dried-out cornfield.<br /><br />Because it's the `70s, there isn't yet a CSI to descend upon the scene, and as a body is not recovered...the investigation, led by Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) never gets anywhere near enough evidence to point them to the killer.<br /><br />The Salmon family begins to unravel, as one can easily imagine any family doing in such horrible circumstances.  When Abigail's mom Lynn (Susan Sarandon) shows up to supervise the household, the results are both hurtful and helpful.<br /><br />All of this would alone be enough for a potentially powerful story.  But the story also posits that we see much of it from the eyes of Susie, who is not quite able to move on to heaven because she is anxious to see her murderer brought to justice and to see her family achieve some kind of peace.  Her "in-between" location is a constantly changing marvel of CGI landscapes, full of beauty (Susie more or less conjures up her surroundings) and full of portentous metaphors.<br /><br />This device, in the book, was interesting but not very gripping, to be honest.  Susie is dead and unable to really influence the world she sees.  We understand that she needs closure in order to move on to heaven...but it's hard to really get emotionally involved with that dilemma.  Yes, it's awful that she was killed...but knowing the heaven truly awaits her makes her "torment" merely seem inconvenient for her.  I don't mean to sound callous...but we know that an eternally happy ending awaits her.  It is the torment of those she's left behind that is the real power of the story.  These are emotions we can relate to.  And when the book explored them, we could be readily gripped by their power.  A father obsessed with investigating the crime.  A mother who can't even stand to live in the same house anymore...not only because of her missing child, but her distant husband.  A younger sister ripped by grief but also by resentment at the childhood she is missing.  A grandmother who is more accustomed to drinking and smoking and indulging, suddenly forced to step up and be a better mother than she had been before.  A cop emotionally shredded by his inability to make headway.  And a cold-blooded killer living in comfort down the street.  In the book, a fair balance is struck between the lives of those on earth, and the observations of young Susie looking down.<br /><br />Writer / director Peter Jackson's singular mistake with the film is to let Susie's world and voice play a far more dominant role than in the book.  Some have complained that too much time is spent "wowing" us with the world Susie lingers in.  I didn't mind the scenery...it's just that we spent too much time there.  And Ronan's voiceovers are constant throughout the film...she's telling us the story, and this removes us somewhat from simply FEELING things.<br /><br />There is power in the film.  The moments leading up to Susie's attack, when she goes against her own best judgment and allows herself to be cornered by Harvey are horribly effective.  Some have had the nerve to criticize that we don't see the actual attack.  I was worked up enough without that, thank you very much.  There are little moments of raw emotion throughout the film.<br /><br />But by bringing things to the screen, THE LOVELY BONES feels less like a story of a family than it does a ghost story.  Various characters get glimpses of Susie.  Near the end, there is a ludicrous scene when Susie is, more or less, able to come back for a moment.  There appears to be a smidge of supernatural intervention in what happens to Harvey.  None of this was needed, because Jackson should have trusted to a simpler story and let his stellar cast go to town.  Mark Wahlberg shows us the anguish and guilt he feels...and given more script time, might have developed a truly unforgettable performance.  The normally reliable Weisz actually is given little to do, and Sarandon is saddled with a caricature rather than a character.  Imperioli was born to play this role, but instead, it is underwritten and generic.<br /><br />Yet I must point out that the movie IS worth seeing, if only for 3 performances.  Young Rose McIver as the surviving sister feels remarkably grounded in her performance.  Her character is able to move on with her life, yet Susie is always a presence to her and she carried a healthy dose of anger with her.  She brings some real drama to the latter portion of the film.  Young Ronan is a striking presence, and while I disagree vehemently with how much voiceover time she is given...she does excellent work.  And best of all is Stanley Tucci, playing one of the creepiest killers we've seen in a long, long time.  Awards will come his way...but if the movie around him had been a little better, his psycho would  be right up there with the likes of Hannibal Lecter...except his character is cringingly credible.  Tucci is the actor of 2009, with his stellar work opposite Meryl Streep in JULIE & JULIA (where he is so likeable) and in LOVELY BONES, where the sickness practically drips from him.<br /><br />So see LOVELY BONES for its good moments and performances, but also mourn what COULD have been if character had been allowed to win over the supernatural.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Note: I watched this on an international flight. Perhaps it was the altitude, but I found it long, slow, and boring. I suppose some of the limbo visuals are neat, but due to the composition you are always aware that it's CGI, so it loses its impact.<br /><br />It's also a meditation on the horror and creepiness of child molesters. And the wistfulness of lives cut short. These themes are not for kids, so beware. It will give them nightmares.<br /><br />But it's hard to say what this movie is supposed to be. She doesn't seem to have much power to affect the outcome, so there's not much connection between her and the "real" world.<br /><br />Now, I realize this statement might be controversial, but all those scenes lingering on little girls (alive or dead) and physical teen romance seemed to border on a sort of unhealthy vibe. I don't know if that was the intent.<br /><br />Like I said, maybe it was the altitude. I found "The Road" to be also long, pointless, depressing, and boring on this flight as well. If you like this kind of thing, more power to ya.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>"The Lovely Bones" is the story of a 14-year-old girl from suburban Pennsylvania who is murdered by her neighbor. She tells the story from Heaven, showing the lives of the people around her and how they have changed all while attempting to get someone to find her lost body.  I have never read the book but the movie is great. It is very interesting. The visual effects are great and the score is perfect. In my opinion, the movie is creative and entertaining. I'm sure the book is more elaborate so I might have to read it. A must see movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I chose not to read other Amazon reviews because I wanted my opinions to be original, without prejudice. I never read the book. I am, however, familiar with the work of Peter Jackson, and his amazing ability to create a different world, from that which we think we know. "The Lovely Bones" is worthy of consideration, from a film perspective. Jackson's apex was the LOTR trilogy, brilliant by any standards. There's a definite look to a Jackson film, mostly the ethereal colors and cinematography, and always a fine script. "Heavenly Creatures" brought Jackson to the attention of the American public, followed by the unbelievable "The Frighteners", with Michael J Fox, one of the most enjoyable fantasy/adventures  I've ever seen. Other-worldly things seem to project Mr Jackson to greatness, and "The Lovely Bones" is no exception. Saoirse Ronan, after an auspicious debut in "Atonement" (Oscar nominated) seems a seasoned pro in the central character, complex in her confusion, dissappointment and tremendous love and compassion. I never doubted for a minute that she was talking to me with utmost sincerity. Darlings of the Oscar: Susan Sarandon, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz are all terrific...add to that newly nominated Stanley Tucci (long overdue) for his oily, snakey and thoroughly fleshed-out performance as the creepy catalyst. Rose McIver is excellent as the younger sister. Whether or not you're comparing the film to the book, this definitely stands on its own as a fine achievement in film-making. Peter Jackson's ability to project the viewer to another place is exceptional. The book may not have been filmed without the vision, sensitivity and grace of a visionary like Mr. Jackson. I enjoyed the film very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>The shortcomings of this film were a bitter pill, when it had such rich material to work with from the book.  What should have been compelling and visually stunning commentary on soul healing and  bonds strengthened across the veil ended up confused communication and a disempowering and dissatisfactory question of how the story resolved.  The film split between the story of Susie Salmon's family after her rape and murder, and Susie's reticent experience of moving on in the afterlife.  For the most part the scenes of her family's life after her death were solid, except for the places where Susie intervened and touched their lives.  There was definitely an emphasis on sentiment in those moments, forsaking continuity and smooth delivery of the story.  The scenes of Susie in the afterlife were pretty but light.  They did not move the plot as they should have, which for someone who hadn't read the book would make them completely pointless.<br /><br />The fact that they chose to keep the film PG13 when dealing with child rape is telling in and of itself.  Often the decision to reach a wider audience kills a film's deeper allure, and this one is a perfect example.  Indeed, child rape is hinted at, but the fact that many nongraphic, yet revealing details of Susie's murder, thus of Mr. Harvey, are left out, the significance of her story and experience are diminished.  In fact, I don't recall the word rape ever being used in the film. This is highly relevant info that shouldn't have been muted, and not naming it exactly what it was is an insult to what Susie endured.  That omission doesn't allow enough of a picture of what Mr. Harvey truly was.  Susie gets a glimpse of it in her discovery of his murder of other girls, but Susie's experience is handled so carefully that the impact of it becomes dulled.  Had the foil of Susie's observation of  her peers going through the luxury of puberty been sustained through the film as it was in the book,  the breakdown between events in her family's life after her death and Susie's experience in the afterlife would have been clearer in the film.  She wasn't just seeking the end of Mr. Harvey, she was seeking peace in the tragic loss of her own selfhood.  This message is thinly veiled alongside the references of her being 'Daddy's girl,' and her resistance to completely move over for her family's peace.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon was the stand out talent in this film.  Tucci's Mr. Harvey was impeccably cringeworthy.  In the end, the film was overall very well acted and even directed.  The final edit detracted from both of those accomplishments significantly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>The Lovely Bones is a movie directed by Peter Jackson, and though his fans are varied, I would say most of them are males. So when I say that this movie is highly anticipated, it is by an entirely different crowd waiting impatiently for this movie. And the ultimate reason there is so much complaining, and unending speculation. But, the fans of the novel do seem to find it appropriate and worthy, and have attempted to counter the negativity of his LOTR's fans.<br /><br />But saying that, I am not one to walk into a movie with the designs that it should be a certain way, and that my expectations must be met. I judge a film's enjoyment and artistic value only on what is presented, and how it is presented, and also by the posibilities made by the cast and crew.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is wonderfully filmed, and it is at times presented like a pretty scrap book of heavenly ideas. I felt the drama of this movie played down by the tone sometimes, and also, I felt that the focus of the film lacking in solid direction. There are chilling moments in this film that deserve wide respect, and they lead to horrendous events, that have been, thankfully, unshot. The power of visuals are very much so in their absence.<br /><br />I only heard after seeing this film that it was based on a popular book. First thing I thought was how hard it must have been to write about the terrible events in this book. It is a film that held me in disgust and suspense throughout. I had strong feelings throughout this film and wanted justice to be had.<br /><br />I felt Peter Jackson did a creative job here, telling a difficult story with the talents we all know he has. I had a front row seat, and that usually makes me car sick, but the landscape-like scenes and the ease that it was filmed kept me from becoming sick. I thought that Mark Walberg had powerful moments in this film.<br /><br />The special effects are criticized for having been too fantastic, yet I thought it was in good form with the way Peter Jackson had set the tone. It was never too serious, and I felt that the tone was set with the creativity shared between father and daughter while making wooden ship-in-a-bottles.<br /><br />But my problem is the selfishness, or rather the absolute overthinking done by the characters of this movie. Rather than being driven by one need: such as revenge or absolution, I felt that the Susie was driven by many needs, yet only time enough to settle here fanatical obsession to experience a first kiss. The father's side of the story robed me of any joy. I felt misery on his behalf. I can't remember a character that has been wronged like this and not deserved it.<br /><br /> I recommend this film for those who haven't read the book as well as those that have because it is a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Lovely Bones" is great!

Peter Jackson as many critics have now said, may not have been the perfect fit for this movie. He is a wonderful visual director, but his vision of the in-between feels out oddly out of place. The CGI is well done and quite beautiful, but it did nothing more than distract me from the characters that I was beginning to care about. Thankfully these sequences were just short enough to not ruin the experience. The acting was pretty solid. Mark Wahlberg is often hit or miss, but he was suprisingly believable here. Susan Sarandon provided some offbeat humor and Rachel Weisz was decent, even though her role was thinly written. The two standouts were Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci. I see a big career in the future for this young actress. There is something about her that grabs and holds your attention. Stanley Tucci was creepy to the core, though I find it hard to believe that anyone would think he was normal. The way he looked and interacted with people should have sent up major red flags. There were two scenes of suspense involving his character that were well executed. The music hit the right emotional notes when needed and the story itself proved horrific enough to make a strong impact on me.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is getting bashed way too heavily by most critics. I know it has its share a flaws, but the fact that I was thinking about the film all the way home from the theater shows the true power it possesses if you go in with an open mind.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I'm a fan of the book this movie is based on, and although Peter Jackson took some liberties with the story, the result was an emotional and visually stunning film. "The Lovely Bones" tells the story of Suzie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old girl who is murdered by a neighborhood predator (Stanley Tucci). As the Salmon family copes with their tragedy, Susie's spirit hovers in the "in-between" that exists between heaven and Earth. Unable to let go of her previous life, Susie keeps a watchful eye on her family and her murderer, hoping that justice will ultimately be served and that she and her loved ones can finally move on.<br /><br />I appreciated that the film didn't show Susie's violent murder on screen, which would have been extremely disturbing. The film does a fantastic job of portraying Susie in her in-between world, which is beautiful to watch. I wish Susan Sarandon was given more screen time, because she is hilarious in her role as the drunk grandmother. Tucci gives a terrifying portrayal of a child killer, and Ronan's performance as Susie is very understated and sincere.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>As the story opens, the narrator, 14-year old Susie, tells us she was murdered.  We then see a cringe-worthy scene (that doesn't actually show any violence) and Susie leaves earth for "the in-between;" a nice place, but not quite heaven.  She watches her family as they cope with her death and the years pass.<br /><br />I liked the book a lot, which is odd considering it's about a girl who is horrifically killed by a pervert.  Except for that one scene, however, the book was uniformly upbeat and uplifting and brought me to happy tears.  Susie loved being in her heaven, which looked like her beloved school and she could order peppermint ice cream anytime and never get told, "It's seasonal."  The movie changes quite a lot of important plot points, the most notable being that Susie's "in-between" is set in a big field amid beautiful mountains, but she's not happy there and is usually agitated or confused.  Instead of being joyous, the movie was very scary and relentlessly sad.<br /><br />Young Saoirse Ronan (already an Oscar-nominee) is perfectly cast as Susie - all wide-eyed innocence.  Stanley Tucci is subtly creepy as her killer, but wasn't quite loony enough.  Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz were too young and beautiful to play her parents, and Susan Sarandon was obnoxious as her grandmother.  Several characters who played key parts in the book were reduced to bit parts.  The movie was very intense, but also very depressing, while the book left me comforted.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you haven't read the book, you may well find this movie enthralling.  I thought too much emphasis was placed on the strikingly visual after-life, while the hopeful message was missing entirely.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />The 'Lovely Bones' reminds me of the film 'Ghost' in that the protagonist has been murdered and now exists in a limbo-like nether world. In both films, the protagonist has 'unfinished business' not only in terms of resolving conflict with a principal love interest but also ensuring that the person who murdered them gets his just desserts.<br /><br />In Ghost, Patrick Swayze's 'Sam Wheat' is tormented by the fact that he never told girlfriend Molly that he loved her. He gets that opportunity at the end of the film when he inhabits the body of Oda Mae Brown, a spiritualist. Similarly, in the The Lovely Bones, Susie Salmon is tormented by the fact that she never got that first teenage kiss from Ray Singh, her handsome Anglo-Indian high school chum. Susie also gets to inhabit someone else's body, in this case Ruth Connors, a neighborhood girl who also possesses psychic powers. But whereas the relationship between Sam and Mollie is decidedly developed and resolved in a quite satisfying manner, the resolution of Susie's angst over the missed kiss is nothing more than mere puppy love.<br /><br />Ghost is also far more satisfying in terms of drama since Sam actively pursues his killer by tormenting him through various means including levitating inanimate objects in his direction . He also communicates with the living, aided by his trusted ally, Oda Mae. Susie, on the other hand, can do little to bother her murderer, George Harvey (the twisted serial killer, well-played by Stanley Tucci). Occasionally she startles him (he catches a glimpse of a shadow inside his garage which appears to be that of Susie riding her bicycle). And when Susie finally does get the opportunity to communicate with Ray, instead of telling him to warn her parents about Harvey, she is merely content to obtain the kiss she missed out on before she was murdered.<br /><br />Susie is truly stuck in limbo since she has no external arc to resolve. Her conflicts are not with the survivors on earth but within her own mind. In addition to obtaining the kiss from Ray, she also must face the reality of the nature of her demise. Director Peter Jackson pulls out all the stops with his CGI effects, depicting Susie's gradual triumph over her own fears, taking in the history of Harvey's murderous forays. Jackson is perhaps most creative when he offers up the nightmare scene (a la Stephen King) where Susie learns of the fate of each of Harvey's victims.<br /><br />Even if one is impressed with all those beautiful special effects in the nether world, the machinations back on earth are strictly soap opera. There is not enough space to catalog the absurdities of the Lovely Bones plot, but I'll mention a few here: 1) Instead of phoning the police, 14 year old Susie, who obviously doesn't know how to drive, plays hero by driving her brother, a choking victim, to the hospital; 2) Harvey constructs an underground den in a clear field and no one notices what he's doing 3) Susie is missing a scant few hours but instead of waiting for the police, her father runs outside, hands out flyers like an idiot, believing that somehow that's the best strategy for finding his missing daughter; 4) Susie's father, who has been hounding the investigating detective for not doing a good enough job in finding his daughter, delays the investigation by not developing all of Susie's film all at once. Instead, he wants to 'honor her memory' by developing one roll each month at a time; 5) Instead of staying with her children like a normal mother, Susie's mother, Abigail, abandons the family and goes off to pick fruit on a fruit farm; 6) Grandma Lynn (played by an over the top Susan Sarandon), can think of nothing better to do but drink copious amounts of alcohol while the family needs a strong parental figure to hold things together; 7) Susie's vigilante Dad goes after Harvey with a baseball bat despite having no evidence whatsoever (except a hunch) that he's responsible for his daughter's murder; 8) Harvey somehow loads that heavy safe into his car and makes a fast getaway but later can barely drag the safe with the help of another man a few yards, where he finally disposes of it in a ditch.<br /><br />Perhaps the most ludicrous part of the plot is sister Lindsey's decision to break into Harvey's house where she finds the incriminating journal. How can Detective Fenerman possibly go after Harvey since the evidence was obtained illegally? After learning that Lindsey had broken into Harvey's house, wouldn't he have been obligated to arrest her? And wouldn't the journal have been inadmissible evidence in a court of law? Certainly no Judge would have given Detective Fenerman a search warrant to enter Harvey's house on the basis of illegally obtained evidence!<br /><br />In the end, The Lovely Bones has the dubious distinction of turning the story of the murder of a 14 year old girl into a comforting tale of reassurance. The full horror of the murder itself is reduced to a series of creepy Stephen King-like horror scenes and the victim somehow 'triumphs' when she finds the courage (in an illusory limbo) to overcome her fears at looking at the reality of her demise.<br /><br />Further reassurance comes in the form of a comeuppance for the evil serial killer. Unlike the book where the killer is not apprehended, nature (or even God perhaps) conveniently has an icicle drop on the shoulder of the villain, where he is promptly dispatched by falling over the side of a cliff.<br /><br />Despite the clever special effects, for those who are not completely convinced of the overall ludicrousness of this flick, please consult the IMDb message board under the topic, "100 things we've learned from the Lovely Bones Movie". It's a thread that should leave you in stitches!</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>OK; the acting was quite good, the screenplay compelling, the direction eye-grabbing and attention-getting.

Based on a famous book by Alice Sebold, this story is set in the 1970's, and is about a family torn apart when one of their daughters is abducted and killed by a neighborhood serial murderer.  The movie is told from the POV of the murdered girl, Susie Salmon, whose spirit floats in the in-between of heaven and earth.  Torn between trying to interfere with events in the living world, and going to heaven, she suffers thru pain, joy, horror, foreboding, and revenge.  Though a drama in its essence, the scenes of Susie enduring in the in-between is pure fantasy with awesome special effects.  The movie also has a great soundtrack with some good vocals.  Overall, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"The Lovely Bones" is an progressively tedious film somewhat redeemed by the second excellent performance in the short career of Saoirse Ronan. Burdened with the tricky task of livening up the solemn 14-year-old Susie Salmon of Alice Sebold's pretentious source novel, Ronan, presumably on wits and instinct, injects a crucial dose of life into a unpleasant, clunky thriller. Her sky blue eyes and eager grin appear to inhabit one film, while director Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast toil away at another. The movie doesn't do justice to her, the overrated book, Heaven, Earth, or anything else.<br /><br />If you fancied Jackson a top-shelf director, consider "The Lovely Bones" a rebuttal. His impulse to veer away from the territory of Sofia Coppola (the perfect match for the novel) is fine. Turning it into a serial killer showcase - replete with a sweaty, bizarre turns from Oscar-nominated Stanley Tucci - is not.<br /><br />Opening in a Pennsylvania winter, 1973, the movie briefly glimpses the life of Susie (Ronan) a mousy-haired, budding photographer teetering between goofy and artsy, with a crush on an older Indian boy named Ray (Reese Ritchie) on whom she spies at the mall. Her mom Abigail (Rachel Weisz) and dad Jack (Mark Wahlberg) are ex-intellectuals who border on eccentric. Abigail's mom Lynn (Susan Sarandon) is a blowsy booze hound. Susie has a brother and sister, a new stocking cap with a jingle bell in it, and a date with Ray, Saturday, in the mall gazebo.<br /><br />And then she's raped and killed by George Harvey (Tucci), a dollhouse maker who lives down the street. Mr. Harvey - as he's known in the book - builds an underground clubhouse in an empty cornfield, and lures Susie into it. Although Jackson shows little of the violence - for some reason, this irked critics who apparently require, for the sake of fidelity, the disgusting sights and sounds of a girl getting raped - we get the picture well enough when Susie's elbow is recovered by a police dog.<br /><br />Plot? Oh, there's a truckload. "The Lovely Bones" is not a short film. Susie heads to a colorful, yet fearsome "holding pen" between Earth and Heaven. Father Jack searches for the killer with a detective (Michael Imperioli) while Abigail mourns in silence. At some point, Sarandon's character, cigarette and sherry at the ready, moves in. Abigail moves out. Sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) matures into a young woman. Susie spies on her family and, in the briefest of moments, influences them. Meanwhile, Mr. Harvey eludes capture and plots a new murder, while reliving his pleasure in Susie's.<br /><br />Jackson pushes so many emotional and visual buttons - he aims for an epic amidst intense personal drama - that he loses track of the story, and ends up lingering on the faces of his two best performers: Ronan - open, searching, evocative - and Tucci - leering, maniacal and sweaty.<br /><br />Tucci, a superb actor, is given the thankless role of a remarkably obvious weirdo - balding, pudgy, raspy-voiced, slightly effeminate - who appears to possess supernatural abilities to detect movement and remain invisible in plain sight. In other words, he's a bogeyman complete with lurches, grimaces and growls. Jackson likes to position the camera just below Tucci's nostrils, or in super close-up of Tucci's thumb as he caresses the key charm on Susie's bracelet.<br /><br />I understand why he resorts to repetitive stock shots. Sebold's novel is a Literary Work; that is, the kind of book that trots out poet Juan Ramon Jimenez on its first page, and Erica Jong not long after. What's "profound" about the book isn't its commentary on grief - it's the usual anger, confusion, guilt and strife - but its conceit of putting a smart kid in a postmodern heaven with murky rules and "literary" trappings. It's a mildly clever dirge, in other words, with a handful of exceptionally-written passages. So the minute Jackson commanded an army of CGI for Susie's heaven, he was stuck trying to dramatize Earth, too - and those roads lead to Mr. Harvey`s subplot. Sebold's novel is modest and minor. Jackson's bold, broad brush strokes are a bad fit .<br /><br />But that doesn't excuse a chase scene heading for a climax, only to be interrupted, at the very second of the big reveal, by a family reunion. Or jaw-dropping lapses of consistency, as when it takes two men several minutes - in slow motion - to flip a safe, end over end, into a sinkhole, when Mr. Harvey must have carried it from his basement by himself in the previous scene. Or when Mr. Harvey leaves his house for what appears to be a location scouting trip only to return minutes later, without the incriminating items he took with him. There's a good half-hour of this slasher nonsense.<br /><br />"The Lovely Bones," then, reduces best to a series of moments, most of them involving Ronan. Susie's aborted kiss with Ray is just a masterwork of tenderness and timidity, while Susie's eventual entrance into Heaven possesses, surprisingly, the power we hoped it might. The Heaven in Sebold's book belongs to no religion; Jackson's movie makes subtle nods toward Christianity - the tree of life, a little girl's earrings - without underlining in a way that would turn off most agnostic (or just plain childish) reviewers. Wahlberg lacks dramatic heft but you like him anyway, while Weisz's considerable skills go largely unused. (Her effortless beauty doesn't.) Time for Sarandon to retire. Tucci, worthy of pity, earns his Oscar nod in the sense that he commits himself to looking like a nerd, irritates the heck out of the viewer and fully deserves his bloody demise at film's end. You're supposed to hate the guy.

"Heavenly Creatures" is a film about intense fantasy and grim reality, some intriguing combination of topics in common with the story of a murdered 14-year-old girl Susie Salmon, the heroine of "The Lovely Bones." Sadly, what we have here is a big sloppy mess of a movie that just doesn't know what it wants to do.<br /><br />Peter Jackson, so intent on the effect-ridden world, never allows us to connect to the characters, including Susie herself. A horrible thing happens to her family, but we don't know much about her parents, young brother and sister. Yes, computer graphics are pretty impressive, but soon we realize this has little to do with the story, or possible themes like metaphorical and spiritual meditation on the loss. Indeed, the story doesn't know where to go, and the film hits the nadir when Susie's free-spirited grandma steps in as "comic relief." Judging from this (and the film's cloying finale), Peter Jackson seems to have forgotten that Susie has not just died, but is brutally murdered.<br /><br />One cannot blame the actors for portraying one-dimensional characters. Saoirse Ronan, so impressive in "Atonement," is pretty good, considering the difficult role she is required to play. Cast-against-type Stanley Tucci is not bad. Actually, he is so good at becoming the character he plays that we start wondering how come people around him missed the obvious thing.<br /><br />Not having read the original bestselling book, I have nothing to say about the liberties Peter Jackson had taken to film "The Lovely Bones." I only imagine that Alice Sebold's book is far more subtle and thought-provoking. The hugely disappointing adaptation is not likely to appeal to either the readers or the viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is the fourteen year old heroine of the unusual, moving film. She is killed by a neighborhood predator after being lured into his secret lair.<br /><br />At first, Susie is not aware that she's dead. She comes to a slow realization of this fact as she is drawn deeper into the world she now inhabits, a fantastic, seemingly perfect Limbo, where she is awed and moved by the otherworldly sights she sees.<br /><br />She is alternately terrified by her own dawning awareness of her hideous murder. She can also see the world and life she has left behind, and is deeply saddened by the agony her family suffers in her absence.<br /><br />THE LOVELY BONES is deeply spiritual, and deeply engaging, but it is also deeply disturbing. It is a thought-provoking film, with a great many strengths, not least of which is the coltishly pretty, ethereal Ms. Ronan in the lead, who carries this difficult role very confidently on her young shoulders.<br /><br />This was Peter Jackson's "art" film, a film he could only create after his spectacular commercial success with THE LORD OF THE RINGS. THE LOVELY BONES, surprisingly, has some elements in common with the trilogy. It's depiction of "heaven" is a bright, calm pastoral fantasy, punctuated by the darkness and fear of the murder scenes.<br /><br />THE LOVELY BONES is the type of film that stays with you after even one viewing. It, however, lacks the kind of "entertainment value" which causes people to buy DVDs. Very few people will say to the family, "Hey! Let's watch that movie about the murdered girl again tonight! Anybody up for it?" though it might be the kind of film a family coping with loss might watch for comfort and openhearted communication.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I think a good test for whether this may be the movie for you to watch is how well you liked the movie WHAT DREAMS MAY COME starring Robin Williams.  This has a very similar look and feel to it, especially in terms of what an afterlife and heaven might look like. The premise is the same as that film as well: someone dies a very violent and sudden death and suddenly finds herself in the afterlife, trying to reach back to her family.  In this situation the girl has been murdered by her neighbor, Stanley Tucci, who is a serial killer. I read about half of the novel when it first came out but I found it too depressing and couldn't finish it. The movie is not as depressing which makes it easier to experience that the novel.  This is NOT a "who done it."  You know exactly "who done it" within the earliest parts of the movie. This is also not a movie about a serial killer. It is simply a given that he is one and murders her.  Tucci does a very good job in a thankless role.  The actress playing the girl is also quite good and Marc Wahlberg, as usual, turns in his usual superior acting job. Peter Jackson of LORD OF THE RINGS  fame directs and he certainly makes this material as palatable and visual as it can be made.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I was very open in my review for the novel of my thoughts here.  The story just does not justify the hype.  This has been lauded and rendered a revelation by fans (the novel that is) and yet while reading it I couldn't help but feel extremely underwhelmed.  I wanted so much more, and instead of feeling inspired and deep and profound, `The Lovely Bones' felt amateurish and slightly cheap.<br /><br />When I read that Peter Jackson was taking this on, I was intrigued for a number of reasons.  I am not the largest Jackson fan, but his more intimate works are really inspired.  He should make more `Heavenly Creatures' and less `Lord of the Rings', but whatever.  The idea of him taking a premise that could meld both worlds seemed inspired in his hands.  Any reservations I had with the source material seemed insignificant at that point.  The same story, told in more capable hands, can prove to be an entirely different experience, and with Jackson, Ronan, Weisz, Sarandon and Tucci on board (eh to Wahlberg, but whatever) I was really interested to see the turnout.<br /><br />Sadly, this was actually worse than the novel.<br /><br />The problem with `The Lovely Bones' is that it has no real identity.  Even in film format, this story feels almost skeletal.  It really needed a core, something to beat through the barrage of clich&eacute;s to create something that felt original or even remotely inspired.  Instead, `The Lovely Bones' builds on familiarity to create something devoid of anything compelling.<br /><br />Ronan is an inspired actress, and she nails her performance.  She grasps the delicate naivety that floats in and out of our protagonist.  Her wide eyes wonderment soaked into the roots of the film to give it a slight heft in areas.  Sadly though, her performance isn't enough to save the film from itself.  The rest of the cast is barren.  Wahlberg is a mess, as expected.  He oversells his scenes and comes across highly unrealistic.  You can always see him acting.  Weisz is barely there, Sarandon is a caricature and Tucci is just plain awful, but I blame a lot of that on Jackson's too `on the nose' direction.  The way he frames his shots is gross.  I hate the way he shoots Tucci to be this `evil incarnate' instead of allowing the audience to be absorbed in the performance.  He has to tell us too much with the way he shoots each scene.  The music, the lighting, the pacing; it just all is too direct.  The visual effects are at times stunning, but other times it is rather garish and `too much'; like recent Tim Burton fare.  Jackson has had an issue with this in the past.<br /><br />Some directors don't know when to stop adding buttons to the sash.<br /><br />So, much like the novel, this is an underwhelming feature.  Ronan is wonderful, but the barrage of mediocrity here is too much to ignore.</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>"The Lovely Bones" is based on Alice Sebold's hugely popular 2002 novel of the same title. Like almost all adaptations it takes some liberties with the source novel's story, but I think it manages to preserve the essence; so that you feel the story more even if you do not understand it as precisely. Unfortunately most of the comments and reviews are rather useless for anyone thinking about viewing the film or for someone looking to better understand what they just viewed. So here are a few random points to consider.<br /><br />  The film is basically a blend of "The Dust Factory" (2004) and "Speak" (2004); with elements of "Silent Hill" (2006) and "What Dreams May Come" (1998). If you like that type of stuff you should get off on "The Lovely Bones". If this sort of story is not your cup-of-tea there is still enough quality acting and imagery to make it time well spent for a technical film buff.<br /><br />  As in the novel, the entire story is told from the point-of-view (POV) of 14-year-old Susie Salmon who became the victim of a serial killer. The main character tells her story in flashbacks and subdued voice-over, as she observes the world from a personalized transitional realm between earth and heaven. Looking into the world much like the penguin in the family's snow globe, as her grieving family tries to cope with her death and her brazen killer goes largely unnoticed.<br /><br />  The distanced voice-over gives Susie more dimensionality; her calm tone is often contradicted by what is happening in the frame and it contrasts nicely with the shallow (but normal) teen qualities of her character before death. "Depth" is an important symbolic element in the story, which is full of juxtapositions between closed places (sinkholes, basement, a compartment under the floorboards, dollhouses, ships in bottles) and bucolic vistas. There is an especially effective montage early in the film as the editor cuts back and forth between the trapped Susie and her unsuspecting family at the dinner table; with each cut Susie looks smaller and younger.<br /><br />  "Atonement's" Saoirse Ronan plays Susie, and her subtly expressive performance elevates the film to "must see" status. A young actor this instinctively talented and effortlessly charming only comes along about once in a decade, and rarely are they matched with a role this perfect for them at a particular point in their careers. Ronan should have a lengthy and very successful acting career but it is unlikely that she will again play a character that is such a perfect physical and emotional fit. For serious film buffs this is one of those historical moments.<br /><br />  Ronan's performance transcends the genre, unexpectedly causing the film to work as a very affecting coming-of-age story. Susie clings to a living world that is lost to her in much the same way that Georgia Lass did in the "Dead Like Me" series, and in the process experiences things that positively change her, even after her death. Allowing her to reconcile things and to even appreciate "the lovely bones that had grown around my absence" as she comes to terms with "the world without me in it".<br /><br />  Director Peter Jackson chooses to emphasize her in-between world with a lot of expressionistic special effects visuals. While this was not a point of emphasis in Sebold's novel, film is a visual medium and these provide an opportunity to introduce symbolic connections between the two worlds and to showcase Susie's journey. Even more importantly, Jackson nicely fills the frame with Susie's innocent features as she bravely navigates her strange land with looks of wonder and on occasion looks of terror. Using a 14-year-old girl amplifies the emotional power of this stuff, it simply would not have been as effective with someone a different age.  Lurking beneath his psychological thriller storyline, Jackson steers the film toward a rather deep allegorical take on an existential theme. It explores the isolation of someone as they realize that they no longer belong in the world.<br /><br />  I am not a Peter Jackson fan; his films, from minimalist efforts like "Heavenly Creatures" to exercises in excess like "King Kong", have never really connected with me. And he was probably not the ideal choice for a film like "The Lovely Bones".  But his only real misstep here, the insertion of Susan Sarandon's comically overplayed grandmother into the middle of the story, was not significant enough to be a fatal flaw. And another director might not have chosen to emphasize the process of Susie growing stronger, which I found to be the most appropriate emphasis for a "practical" adaptation of the original story.<br /><br />  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>.........almost impossible to watch.<br />I never read the book so I really wasn't sure what this movie would be about.<br />I'll get right to it.<br /><br />The good.<br />Masterful directing.<br />Superb acting.<br />The afterlife images are some of the most amazing things I've ever seen.<br />The pacing and score are spot on.<br />Everything about this movie screams masterpiece there's just one little problem....<br /><br />The bad.<br />The subject matter was a little too intense for me.<br />Child murder is a very yucky subject and the film handles it as delicately as possible but...<br />I'm not even a parent so I don't know how any parent could even watch this entire film.<br />I literally went through half a roll of toilet paper (didn't have any Kleenex) just watching this movie.<br />The main story itself was almost unbearable to watch, especially watching the family disintegrate.<br /><br />Sigh.....<br />I'll wrap it up like this.<br />It's one of the most surreal and beautiful movies I've ever seen but not one that I'd want to watch again.<br />Sort of recommended if you can stomach the subject matter.<br />I couldn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Having read the book and not thinking much of that, I decided to rent the Peter Jackson film of the same name, The Lovely Bones.

Though not shown at the start of the film, he kills her.

The book though got deep into mom's feelings and heartbreak which are merely touched on in the film.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book I did not like was the concentration on the people in Susie's former life to a point of exhaustion.  Yes, they're getting on with it, but there is next to nothing being done about getting the murderer.  With the book, I was expecting more of a murder mystery and got too much soap in my soap opera.<br /><br />With Jackson's film, he at least pouts more emphasis into the dark soul that is Mr. Harvey.  The deep shadows the fear, despair and desire are prominent in all dealings with this guy.<br /><br />The "In Between" area where Susie is hanging is misunderstood by some critics of the film.  She is not in heaven.  She's in a Purgatory of sorts.  I do agree with critics though in the light and airiness of her life off earth -- too unrealistically happy and cheerful soon after being raped and chopped up.  Wouldn't happen.<br /><br />The book explores a lot into her former relation with Ray, which was just getting started.  In the film, his family, the accusation that he may be "the one" and so on are not explored at all --- and that's OK with me!  Too much exposition was in the book to a point of boredom and "let's get on with it" from me to author Seybold.<br /><br />Comedy relief with the mother-in-law, the drinking & smoking, the 70s music and her getting her nails done by her 8 year old grandson are priceless, silly and cute.  The cuteness doesn't last long in this film, however.<br /><br />Blue Horizon: it changes and grows with her emotions and realizations and her obsession with her family.  She knew that her father would never give her up.  "He loved me as much as he could -- I had to let him go."  Wow, what a switch!<br /><br />Moments like this, such as the crumbling gazebo as she realizes she needs to let him go are particularly poignant.<br /><br />Going over the dead of Harvey's victims is pretty gruesome, but again the book did not delve much into it.<br /><br />[Spoiler]<br /><br />The film does what I wanted the book to do, to concentrate on the murder, the evil behind Harvey and really solving the crime (rather than taking over Ruth's body and having sex with Ray -- which the movie does anyway!  Seriously, why doesn't Susie say who her murderer is rather than take over Ruth's body to get a kiss??  Oh brother).<br /><br />[End Spoiler]<br /><br />The whole touchy-feely stuff with the former victims all  happy in the Blue Horizon with Susie was something out of the Sixties, all the moody music and harp music, didn't do much for the story nor for me.  Happy and beautiful rape & murder victims?  Nah....<br /><br />I do enjoy Jackson's way with making the slightest motion increase abnormally or making scenes unusually bright or dark pitch to represent mood and "flavor" of the film.  Occasional tense moments such as Susie's sister sneaking into Harvey's house to get evidence of her sister's murder is intense and has you on your seat's edge!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film.  Certainly not Peter Jackson's best, but as book adaptations go, not too bad.  The book suffered from too much secondary characterization and padding and Jackson cut all that out.  The ending he kept (unfortunately).  The "In Between" Blue Horizon of the spirit world was a bit too happy and light considering it was made up of murder and rape victims!<br /><br />Recommended for those who've read the book.  And the Sixties guitar ballads are tolerable!<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Directed by<br />Peter Jackson<br /><br />Writing credits<br />(WGA)<br />Fran Walsh  (screenplay) &<br />Philippa Boyens  (screenplay) &<br />Peter Jackson  (screenplay)<br /><br />Alice Sebold  (novel)<br />Cast (in credits order)<br /><br /> Mark Wahlberg Jack Salmon<br /> Rachel Weisz ...

I'm not entirely sure what Peter Jackson was trying to accomplish but in the end, The Lovely Bones is just a plain, weird film with fantastical elemets that seem entirely out of place.<br /><br />I have not read the book the film is based on, but from what I do know, it was changed up quite a bit. Either way, movie-wise, it is a big dissapointment. For a film that deals with a murdered child, a distraught family and a perverted serial killer, there isn't that much drama or mystery surrounding it.<br /><br />Saorise Ronan plays said murdered child, and she narrates the story from a heaven-type of place. She watches over her confused family and wishes for a life she can never have. It SHOULD be depressing and morose and painful, but I felt nothing of that. Is the movie a fantasy? Is it a mystery thriller? A redemption tale? It is very hard to place and the pacing really throws everything off. The killer is revealed, purposefully, pretty much in the beginning so suspense-wise, there isn't much there.<br /><br />The main problem, I think, lies with the fact that too much time was spent in the fantasy world which doesn't do much for the rest of the picture. It is two different worlds and they didn't mix all that well. I felt dissapointed as I had high hopes for this, especially after utterly adoring the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Even Jackson's earlier and brilliant Heavenly Creatures mixed elements of fantasy with perfect drama and it worked beautifully. Here, it falls flat and just feels plain odd. And the ending didn't help matters either. Hopefully, Jackson will get it right the next time around.</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>I have never read this book before, so I don't know any differences between it and the movie, but as far as movies go, this is a pretty good work.  It was a little dark in parts, but the acting and story were both pretty good.  The visionary style used in parts of this movie was very breath taking and awesome too.  If nothing else, this movie is definitely worth at least a watch.  Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Lovely Bones tells the brilliant story of a normal girl just entering her teenage years who was murdered in the basement of a cornfield, and what it's like when she explores the in-between period of heaven and life.<br /><br />Throughout the film, you will be sitting there on your sofa totally amazed and guaranteed to express a TON of emotion such as crying and feeling sympathy, and even wondering yourself whether dying is anything like the way the girl in the film witnesses it.<br /><br />The special effects showing the magical places in between heaven and life are absolutely *spectacular* and gorgeous, constantly shifting from snowy mountains to beautiful country fields to spectacular lakes and enchanted forests... it's truly a sight to behold and really enhances the story because the atmosphere grabs ahold of your personal inner feelings and refuses to let go.<br /><br />Whenever the switch occurs from the real world to the pre-heavenly area of land, it's always a wonderful surprise when you're treated to how the girl communicates with, not only some of the people she meets there, but how she tries to reach out to her family. It seriously makes you wonder if any of this can even be possible.<br /><br />Now the OTHER part of the storyline is the real life situation involving the cops and the girls family trying to track down the killer, who coincidentally happens to live right down the street from the family's home. Throughout the film you will see the killer try to do everything in his power to avoid getting caught. You can probably guess what happens by the conclusion, but it's the WAY it happens -and the way everything builds with a ton of feeling (and magic) attached to every scene- that left me feeling totally satisfied.<br /><br />The acting is nothing short of astonishing from all the actors, actresses and children, the storyline is easy to follow and keeps your attention constantly, and the film is just really fantastic in numerous areas. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>I haven't read the book so this critique is based on knowledge of the movie, itself.  Generally speaking, however, it's difficult for a movie to 'live up' to the book on which it was based because 1.  movie scenes are usually more limited than 'scenes' in a book and 2.  books rely on imagination far more than do movies.<br /><br />With these limitations in mind, I quite enjoyed this surreal and touching movie.  No, it isn't perfect and the story--perhaps necessarily--isn't linear and logical but addresses an extremely painful topic--the serial murder of lovely young people--in as delicate and moving way as may be possible.<br /><br />I would have given this film a full 5 stars but thought the ending was unnecessarily weak.  Yes, the killer's own death is foreordained in previous scenes but I, at least, would have preferred the satisfaction of vengeful temporal justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>The title character is perfectly cast so there is no one who believes the intentional misleading explanation of the title at the end of the movie.

I didn't want to watch Mystic River or that Affleckted movie but this one is totally different in tone and delivery.  It's awesome.  I recommend it.

Sebold's audacious conceit was to have her story told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old girl (touchingly portrayed by Saoirse Ronan) who has just been kidnapped and murdered by the neighborhood pedophile (the movie takes place in early 1970s suburbia).  Susie's adventures in the afterlife are placed in direct apposition to a family's inconsolable grief, their attempts to come to terms with an unimaginable loss, and the efforts on the part of local law enforcement to bring her killer (creepily played by Stanley Tucci) to justice.  And what role, if any, can Susie herself play in effecting such an outcome from her place in the great beyond?<br /><br />There are those who will balk at the undeniably morbid nature of the material - and, indeed there are times when the why and the wherefore of it all seems as elusive to the storytellers as it is to the audience (the script was written by Fran Wa, Philippa Boyens and Jackson).  Still, this is a technically accomplished, visually stunning, and eerily mesmerizing melding of the worldly with the otherworldly, as Susie and her father (Mark Wahlberg) both learn the importance of letting go and moving on.<br /><br />In his direction, Jackson flows seamlessly between the dual "realities," refusing to set up clear lines of demarcation between the two.  The result is a fluid work that feels all of a piece - one that rarely jars us with gear-grinding tonal shifts or heavy-handed transitions.  Moreover, the mood is greatly enhanced and sustained by Brian Eno's haunting and ethereal score.<br /><br />All in all, a stylish and engrossing film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_Lovely Bones_ (2010) is a fairly good movie about a horrible tragedy and the afterlife.  The movie features very vivid and impressive scenes of the afterlife.  The movie involves a young girl whose life is brutally taken by a serial killer and the attempt to right the wrong of this great evil.  The girl becomes a ghost trapped in a purgatory between here and there until her soul and remains are laid to rest.  The film shows the struggles of her family to come to terms with her brutal murder (although the reactions of some of the family members seem somewhat superficial, particularly the grandmother).  The girl exists as a ghost in a beautiful and lush paradise along with the souls of those who were also killed by this evil man.  Ultimately, after much ordeal the father comes to suspect the real killer and attempts to bring him to justice because the police no longer take the situation seriously.  The sister of the girl sneaks into his house and discovers a lock of hair from her sister and thus attains the necessary "evidence" the family so strongly desires.  However, before the police can arrive the killer manages to escape just before he tosses the remains of the girl into a sinkhole where she can be buried forever.  I felt it was unfortunate however that in the end the killer will not have to face the justice of man but only falls prey to a sort of cosmic justice (and presumably justice in the afterlife).  The movie features beautiful scenes and imagery and shows us a view of the afterlife that is perhaps different from what some have come to expect.  I felt it was a good film but very brutal and depressing, though in the end the wrong appears to be righted (somehow).</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>The book was great but translating it to the screen is a different experience because a lot of key details have been excluded.

But this one balances in-between. The main reason for this is that I read (and loved) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316044938">the book by Alice Sebold</a>. Deep and richly developed characters helped round out this sometimes depressing yet engaging story surrounding the murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon ("like the fish"), and how she views her afterlife ...and looks on as her family attempts to deal with her disappearance.<br /><br />Sebold incorporated a ton of information that was crucial to our understanding within the Salmon household, and the community as a whole. But much gets lost in translation. This isn't too much of a surprise, as Hollyweird requires directors to cut-cut-cut so that movies run shorter and thus can be shown more often (i.e., a three hour movie will only show about three times in a day, whereas a two hour flick jumps up to five a day).<br /><br />Peter Jackson took on a major task here, but nothing compared to his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X9FLKM">Lord of the Rings</a> series (which I found to be brilliantly done, by the way). But Jackson is more of a visual artist. Which was wonderful for Middle Earth fans. But for fans of a story that has such a heavy character background (like this), I think he floundered a bit. In place of story, we get more stunning visuals. Although I didn't mind them (in fact, I found them wondrously eye-catching), it did tick away precious seconds and minutes that otherwise could've been put toward the characters. Fans of the book will be highly depressed to learn that there's nothing in here regarding adultery, and a time-line that is skewed so that we have a more warm and fuzzy ending. Entire characters are removed (including an Indian neighbor), while others are moved around to fit an obviously tightened time-frame for the film.<br /><br />Still, THE LOVELY BONES is entertaining. The special effects/green screen visuals will have your mouth hanging open. And Saoirse Ronan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWNIA4">Atonement</a>) as Susie is played exceptionally well. But if you're going to watch it, you'll probably love to hate Stanley Tucci (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSDW8A">Julie & Julia</a>) as the sick and weird George Harvey, Susie's murderer. When he lures her into his trap, you can feel the skin prickling on the back of your neck. Tucci's Best Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars last year was well-earned.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book, much of what I said here probably won't mean anything. But if you have ...well ...beware.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>The spirit of a young girl is trapped in her own personal purgatory until she is able to assist her father and sister in tracking down the man responsible for murdering her and several other teens. Oscar?-winner Peter Jackson adapts his extraordinary visual style seen earlier in THE LORD OF THE RINGS and KING KONG to bring Susie's ethereal world to life as she crosses between two planes of reality while attempting to expose her killer. Jackson's imaginative fantasy worlds succeed from a visual standpoint, however his kinetic filming is smothered with constantly-sweeping camera movements that are overly dramatic and completely unnecessary. Alice Sebold's heart-felt characters are realized by the considerable cast, with Saoirse Ronan standing out above all others as the fading Susie. While Stanley Tucci manages to create the creepy and uncomfortable persona that the role of Mr. Harvey required, many of the awkward mannerisms he brings with him make it difficult to accept his character completely. Unfortunately, the motion-picture adaptation lacks the same level of suspense and heightened emotional response present in the novel. Had it been structured differently with a quickened pace and darker tone, it may have proven to be far more effective. Even still, THE LOVELY BONES offers a harrowing story built on strong characters and performances that should appeal to fans of the written work and newcomers as well.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Based on Alice Sebold's 2002 novel of the same name, this movie by New Zealand's Peter Jackson tells the alternatingly haunting and uplifting story of Suzie Salmon, a young girl murdered by a neighbor in the early 1970's.  In death, Suzie watches her family from above as they deal in various ways with her disappearance.  I haven't read the book, but I have learned that it is much more graphic and intricate than the film version.<br /><br />Lead actress Saoirse Ronan plays Susie, and Miss Ronan is a true find!  She carries this film, which is no small feat considering how often it teeters toward being both maudlin and saccharine in its depiction of "the in-between", the not-quite-Heaven zone in which she finds herself after she dies.  She doesn't achieve access to Heaven until her murder has reached some sort of closure in real life.<br /><br />For all its flaws (the often overly-fanciful effects work) this film mostly works.  The acting is very good all across the board.  What was most interesting to me was that it veers from genre formula by not engaging in last-minute heroics in one particular scene near the end.  As a viewer, you root for the villain's deeds to be discovered at a particular moment.  Instead, it takes a heart-breaking turn toward sadness and disappointment which is almost immediately erased in favor of a somewhat ethereal optimism  --  Suzie is perhaps less concerned with seeing her murderer meet justice than we are  --  she has different priorities at that possible moment of revelation.  We want to see justice, but Suzie is still trying to find her joy. ["Huh?  What?"  Just go with me on this one.  You'll understand when you see it.]  Suzie is not interested in seeing justice served.  Her goal is loftier --  to allow her family, her father in particular, to let go of her and live free of the exquisite pain of her loss.  [Or something like that  -- just watch the damn thing]<br /><br />The film was not a huge success at the box office and received more than its fair share of negative reviews (notably from those who disapproved of its absence of religious themes).  But as a stand-alone experience, it is quite unique and worth the trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Oscar winning director Peter Jackson shifts gears with this haunting translation of Alice Sebold's bestseller.  The movie is beautifully filmed with gorgeous fantasy other worlds matched with stunning vistas of the real world.  While Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon are fine in their roles, the movie belongs to Saorise Ronan and Stanley Tucci.  Ronan is stunning as the murdered girl caught in a purgatory torn between her lust for revenge and a need to provide solace to her grieving family.  Tucci's quietly malevolent killer is chilling.  I would have preferred a more appropriate finish to his character, his ironic death is disturbingly satisfying.  Not the classic it should have been, THE LOVELY BONES is nonetheless quality film-making.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>In a time in american history when people did things like sleep with their doors unlocked, talk to strangers, and basically trust those who lived in their neighborhoods, the last thing on anyone's mind was child adbduction. Even more gruesome, child murder rears its head and says "here I am," taking the life of a 14-year-old girl who liked to take pictures, imagined herself as a wilflife photograpger, and helped her Dad build ships in bottles. The crime struck hard, and harder still was the acceptance of this tragedy by both the girl and her family. And all the while a killer walked their streets, looking at other Salmon to swim his way.<br /><br />One thing I can say for The Lovely Bones was that it had many asthetically pleasing parts. There were the portions where we saw the place in-between, and these were rich and vibrant. You could see the Peter Jackson of new in this, with his directive toward special effects here. I also liked the narration that the girl added to the mix, making the story touching and sad for everyone involved. You could feel her plight as she watched life pass her by, and you could see her worry about those people she cared about but could do nothing to comfort.<br /><br />On the flipside of this, I thought that the movie really played down some of what had transpired. When i call a child killing a visually appealing movie, it seems like an odd thing to say. Still, the PG-13 label says a lot about what you should expect - and that is sad considering how well the characters come to life. From the father to the killer, I thought there was a lot to be explored. Still, with the the time ticking away, I knew little about the killer in this and, well, I thought this was somewhat important. I know it was her tale and I know that it was aiming for a different level but, in the end, the killer wasn't painted in the light I thought he should have been.<br /><br />All this said, the movie was still good and I still liked it and would say watch it. I thought it had a lot to offer to someone and I cannot say I didn't enjoy the film. I thought the ending, like a spin on a Karma-laced wheel, was a little much and I really didn't like that.

It came last night! I read the beautiful, but very sad book--its basis-- when it was first published. How can a movie depict ethereal, esoteric, other-worldly even adequately? Peter Jackson, director extraordinaire, could do it! He did it!<br /><br />His ethereal success--there is no way to do justice to a review of this movie without spilling spoilers,the biggest being Susie's murder early in the story and by a  neighbor. When the movie first came to theaters, several actors appeared as guests on "The David Letterman Show" to promote the film. Letterman was appalled at the subject matter--the death of a child and could not recommend such a subject. Now that he has his own child, Letterman sees the world through the lens of a father and could not imagine the horror Mark Wahlberg went through as Susie's father. His stunned facial features gave no false impression of this movie!<br /><br />You see, that is the success of Jackson's directorial powers--making viewers feel sick at the loss of life of this sweet little girl (14 and looking forward to her first kiss). The actress is a darling and the audience comes to love her during her sojourn in the afterlife before going forward. Everyone is stuck at the time of Susie's disappearance--father, mother, sister, brother, a boyfriend in the making, grandmother. Even the murderer is stuck in that he lives and relives and relives the murder (much blood was lost, according to the detective on the case).<br /><br />The strange, eerie sequences that show life after death, at least for Susie, will puzzle the viewer. These do not jibe with standard religious motifs. Just go with the flow here. Alice Sebold wrote the novel this way. She is the creator of this world--beautiful, pure, ethereal, but, I found, also vaguely terrifying. My personal taste is that the director keep to the author's world and not create his own. A beloved book made into a film is expected to be faithfully rendered from the word to the screen. Jackson does this. Thank you.<br /><br />This may be a small point from the movie as a whole, but the single most disturbing incident is the destruction of the underground chamber. He took great pains to create a cozy spot, then tore it up, like a spider's nest. Kill the victim, then destroy the nest. Such detail, such effort for one murder. Ah, wow, little girl, what a prize you were. (I'm intending this to sound sick because the man is very disturbed. As the family comes unraveled, so does the neighbor, until he, too, is flicked off the spider web.<br /><br />Knowing in advance that this film is not fast-paced, but rather delivers through characterization, nuances of plot development, and esoteric, ethereal episodes, you will be prepared. This is a film you will love and appreciate for its artistic and faithful details or dislike for its slow and confusing passages.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"The Lovely Bones" is a memorable book; the narrator, a fourteen-year-old girl is dead and tells the story of her death and how her parents cope with the tragedy. If anyone might seem to be the perfect choice to adapt this book to the big screen, it is probably Peter Jackson, the force behind the enormously successful "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.<br /><br />But there is just something wrong with the movie adaptation. It just doesn't work as well as you would expect or hope for from a director of his caliber and his writing partner, both of whom worked together of enormously successful collaborations in the past.<br /><br />1973. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan, "Atonement") lives happily with her mom and dad (Rachel Weisz and Mark Wahlberg) and her brother and sister. One day, taking a short cut home from school, she walks across an abandoned cornfield and meets one of the neighbors, Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Mr. Harvey has been watching Susie and wants to become her friend. In fact, he is excited to show her a little clubhouse he has built for the neighborhood children. Would she like to see it? It isn't far. In fact, it is built in a hole in the field they are currently walking across. Susie is eager to see it and follows Mr. Harvey into his clubhouse. But things quickly go wrong. Later that evening, Mom and Dad begin to get worried when Susie doesn't come home. She is a good kid and doesn't normally come home late. They call the police and Detective Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) arrives to help them out. When Susie doesn't show up and they can't find her, Jack and Abigail begin to unwind so Grandma Lynn (Susan Sarandon) comes to help out, to take care of her other two grandchildren, Susie's younger sister and brother. Susie is watching all of this from the "In Between", narrating the story of her life and death for us, giving us a look into how this family copes with the loss of a loved one.<br /><br />Set in the early 70s, the film is a fairly straightforward narrative; a family mourns the loss of their fourteen-year-old daughter. When Susie dies, and begins to narrate the story for us, this makes everything more interesting and more intimate. Because she is viewing everything from the "In Between", Susie has knowledge about everything affecting her family, giving us an intimate knowledge of their emotions and feelings. This allows the author and filmmaker a certain amount of creative license; for the author, she can give us details we would not necessarily have otherwise. For the filmmaker, it allows him a little license to interpret, to be creative, to play with his special effects toy box. But Jackson takes this license too far. Yes, the film is set in the early 70s, but despite the high production value, as Susie and her new friends (other teenagers caught in the "In-Between") begin to explore their new landscape, it looks like a cross between "The Lord of the Rings" and a flashback Greg Brady might have after sniffing too much glue while making a model airplane with his brothers. They walk through lush green hills, past burbling brooks of crystal clear water. All of this instantly brings to mind the lushness of the New Zealand landscape featured so prominently in the director's films. But Susie looks into the water and sees a giant rose blooming under the surface. Another time, she is walking past huge glass ships that begin to crash into one another. It just seems a little too "Hippy Dippy".<br /><br />As in the book, you know from a very early stage who kills Susie. And Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Mr. Harvey is the best thing in the film. Suitably creepy, it is easy to see how someone who is innocent or unsuspecting might fall for his trap. He seems nice, so it doesn't seem like a huge stretch when Susie agrees to go and look at his new clubhouse. And when Tucci has to turn on the creeps, he is able to do that. Years after Susie's murder, Harvey returns home and suspects something. He sits silently at his dining room table, his ears alert. Finally, he hears a noise and springs into action.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan is also very good at portraying all of the values you would expect in this girl. Mom forces her to wear a knitted cap a relative has made for her, she appears even more innocent than she already is. But the fact Susie reluctantly puts this on, after leaving school, shows she is not a very rebellious sort, even at fourteen. She trusts people and doesn't really have a lot of reason to not trust people. Yet. But unfortunately, she will learn too late.<br /><br />It is also nice to see how her unrequited love for the new student at her school is handled. She is instantly attracted to Ray Singh (Reece Richie), a handsome boy who has recently moved to the small town from London. Admiring him from afar, she doesn't have the courage to approach him. Then, he makes the first move and this makes Susie swoon. She dreamily thinks of Ray as she takes a shortcut home from school. She is in such a good mood, she takes a few extra minutes to check out the new clubhouse Mr. Harvey has built.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon is amusing as the grandmother who realizes she has to suddenly act like a grandmother, to help her grieving family. She is quite a sight to watch; Grandma Lynn vacuums the floor with a cigarette dangling from her lips and a glass of scotch nearby. Grandma would rather be doing a lot of things and we instantly realize domestic chores are at the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg seems out of place as Jack, the patriarch of the family. He just doesn't seem like an adult and he seems like a teenager playing the head of the family in a high school play. It doesn't help that he is unable to change anything about his voice, to reflect any of the differing emotions he has throughout the story.<br /><br />Michael Imperioli plays Len Fenerman, the detective assigned to the case. Throughout the film, Imperioli seems to miss some key moments to demonstrate any emotion for his character. Jack pesters the detective with his theories and ideas about Susie's disappearance. He just calmly listens. When the case goes nowhere, he seems quietly resigned. When they close in on a suspect, he doesn't seem all that excited. When he interviews Mr. Harvey, his suspicions aren't raised, so you begin to wonder if he is any good at his job.<br /><br />It's too bad that so many people in the film seem to have been directed to play everything low key and with so little emotion. This is a story about a family who loses one of their own, why shouldn't there be some emotion, some fury. Wahlberg shouts a little, but it isn't enough and isn't very believable. Weisz, who plays Abigail, the mom, is okay, but she isn't very emotional either. In fact, Abigail leaves the family at one point, unable to deal with all of the emotions. Without any apparent emotion, the end just falls flat and doesn't register with the intensity you would hope for or expect.<br /><br />"The Lovely Bones" is a rare misfire from an extremely talents and gifted writer and director.</p></br></body></html>

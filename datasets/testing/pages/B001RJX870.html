However, there is a brief aside in the beginning, in November 1942, chronicling the scene where young doe-eyed Traudl Humpts is hired as der Fuhrer's secretary.<br /><br />The Third Reich is on the verge of collapse throughout this film.  Certain bigshots are positioning themselves, whether to remain in Berlin, loyal to the end (Goebbels, Martin Bormann) or to flee (Heinrich Himmler).  Hitler himself is told by his architect Albert Speer that he must be on the stage when the curtain falls.  And acts of desperation also take effect on that stage.  Josef Goebbels has recruited defenders of the city, many of them in their early teens, who are impressionable enough to want to become heroes.  Sadly, most of them end up as shell fodder for the Russians.<br /><br />As for the Fuhrer, he is out of touch with reality, the divisions on his map existing only in his imagination.  He still believes that two divisions can regroup and take the Russians from behind, but alas.  And when things don't go his way or he hears reports of lines having fallen, he blames the generals and soldiers, even going out of his way to insult them.  It's ironic how his ideology placed the Germans as the superior race, but when the end is near, he dismisses them of being unworthy of survival and deserving to die.  Quite an about-face there...<br /><br />Traudl aside, there are others of honourable mention.  Professor Dr. Schenke is concerned with the fate of the civilians during this critical time and is one of the more humane characters involved, as he risks going into Russian held territory to get medical supplies for the wounded.  And as for the wounded, the scene of the limbs being dumped into plates, saws used to amputate, and the sight of the injured are pretty grim, but then again, Germany was up the creek without a paddle, so to say.<br /><br />Eva Braun's life of the party personality boosts flagging morale during those last days, in the impromptu parties she stages, leading to dancing and drinking.  She even befriends Traudl, confiding in her at one point how she hated Blondi, Hitler's dog and even kicked it when the dictator wasn't looking.<br /><br />One debit for Nazi history buffs is the where certain major players aren't clearly identified.  Only later in the epilogue, do we realize, "oh, that was supposed to be Goering, Jodl, Martin Bormann etc."<br /><br />I marveled at Bruno Ganz's performance as the angel Damiel in Himmel Uber Berlin, and he outdoes himself as Hitler in this movie, getting the dictator's nervous twitch in his left hand to a tee.  He exhibits bouts of madness, outright callousness, and a man totally out of touch with the reality of the situation.  Yet, he is shown to be gentle and caring to certain individuals, such as his secretary and to Eva Braun.  When one of his trusted henchmen Albert Speer announces his decision to flee, Hitler is saddened, even heartbroken at this desertion.  Ulrich Matthes's portrayal as Josef Goebbels is amazing, as when comparing him to photos of the propaganda minister, there is a striking resemblance.<br /><br />Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl) is the other great performer that boosts Der Untergang.  Not even a strong National Socialist, she still remains loyal to the Fuhrer, believing in him till it becomes apparent that Germany's defeat is certain.  With the real Traudl Junge bookending the movie in two scenes, I have to say she is hard on herself for not realizing the atrocities that went on during the Reich, even though she wasn't an avid Nazi.<br /><br />But it's Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, she who believed that there was no future in a world without National Socialism, and coldly poisoned her offspring, making her with someone with more backbone than her husband.  The actual scene when she poisons her children is also quite disturbing.<br /><br />One of the best movies on Hitler, with the best ever portrayal of him in a movie.  To accompany this, I also recommend the documentary Death In The Bunker, whose events parallel that of Fest's book and this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>This is a near flawless movie, well deserving of a wide audience. The fact that it is a German movie which required watching subtitles, may put some people off - but the reality is that the German actors give this much more resonance than any Hollywood version could have.<br /><br />Much has been said about the fantastic performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. This is his movie, no doubt. It should also be mentioned, however, that all of the performances are so spot on that we are removed from a theatrical overview of events, and truly become part of life in the bunker. So many movies of this period show either the two dimensional Nazi bad guys and Hitler as a raving lunatic and nothing else, or a dispassionate overview of the tactics of the battle for Berlin. This movie achieves something rare - a real personal insight into the characters and how they informed the battle tactics and actions of individuals.<br /><br />Our view into this world is through the young and naive private secretary Traudl Junge, who wrote one of the books on which the movie is based. Thus, historical accuracy is very high. But what we see is an insight into the humanity of Hitler - in one moment warm and compassionate, the next brutal and vulgar. We can understand through Ganz' portrayal the charisma the man must have had to attract such loyal devotion.<br /><br />Do not be fooled into thinking that a movie about life in the bunker will be small scale low budget sets.. the movie ventures outside and we get glimpses of some terrible battle scenes. Those with DTS capability for surround sound will be richly rewarded. The scenes of a war ravaged Berlin are incredibly real - in fact, shot in Saint Petersburg.<br /><br />Towards the end the scenes become more and more disturbing as the veneer of normality is stripped away as the war looms closer. Scenes of suicides and murders are truly disturbing - not least the scene where Magda Goebbels, having sworn her children should not survive in a world without National Socialism, calmly murders them in their sleep, one at a time, before calmly sitting down to a game of cards.<br /><br />At once compelling in the drama of a city at war, and engrossing for its insight into characters normally cinema is too scared to show as humanity, this is perhaps one of the most insightful movies into the horror of National Socialism in WW II and the man who created it. The movie is bookended by the real Traudl Junge speaking in a 2001 documentary, adding an entirely appropriate coda to the movie showing its relevance to all of us.<br /><br />Thoroughly and unreservedly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Few films have dared to touch WWII objectively from a German point of view; most use the Germans as great villains and Allied forces as great heroes... Movies like "Patton" show brief sights into German military thinking while "The Pianist" finds a good cultured German officer in a nightmare scenario...<br /><br />"Downfall" tells the story of the F&uuml;hrer's final hours, his last critical 12 days in a fortified bunker below the Reich Chancellery, while the Soviet Army was slowly taking over Berlin and their artillery bombarding the whole the city...<br /><br />Mostly through the eyes of his young Bavarian secretary, Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) we see the ailing and obviously delusional F&uuml;hrer allowing no negotiation with the Allied forces, raving about how his generals betrayed him, ordering the movement of troops that do not exist, screaming that the German people do not deserve to survive for their apparent treachery and cowardice...<br /><br />But what has come under criticism is the film's attempt at giving Hitler--whose face has become symbolic for the epitome of evil--a compassionate side... He's "Uncle Hitler" to the children of Josef Goebbles who happily sings for him, so loving for his blonde wife Eva Brown, so kind to his pet dog Blondi, so caring when he awards a young boy (who showed great bravery in the face of the enemy) with a medal and pinches his cheek, and so gentle when he pins a medal on Magda Goebbels for being the 'bravest mother in the Reich'.<br /><br />It's easy to see why the film was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Film Category... It takes you inside the minds of Hitler's faithful, showing you how it was that one infamous man could be so charismatic and magnetic... Although his closest advisors, the remaining dedicated members of the Nazi government, know that there is no hope, no one was seen willing to challenge his orders or attempt to seize power... And many opted for suicide after living out their final hours in obscene denial, singing and dancing champagne glass in hand...<br /><br />But Hitler's dark side is also shown when the film depicts his hate and antipathy for the Jews; when one of the more "rational" members of the Nazi hierarchy, Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), stated gently but bluntly to him that the war was lost and he did not follow his orders to destroy the infrastructure in German cities; also when he becomes convinced that Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) has betrayed him and must be executed; and when Eva Braun pleads him for her brother-in-law's life, the tormented Hermann Fegelin (Thomas Kretschmann), and he furiously rejected her request...<br /><br />One of the most horrifying sequences that is unforgettable was that of Magda Goebbles played by Corinna Harfouch... It is astonishing to witness how an unstoppable steely mother, with no hesitation or remorse, is capable of such atrocities for a blind and irrational loyalty to a 'charming' monster...<br /><br />Ganz's character is equally psychotic and human, capable of shooting even his most loyal followers and utterly believable as Uncle Hitler...<br /><br />Juliane K&ouml;hler complements Ganz's exceptional performance with her own chillingly fine one as the ultimate blind follower whose loyalty to her F&uuml;hrer never flagged... K&ouml;hler shows us how she can be drunkenly carefree dancing to swing as bombs and artillery shake the walls of the bunker one day, and in another day applying a fresh coat of red lipstick to her fleshy lips before she takes one cyanide tablet for the man she preferred not to live without...<br /><br />"Downfall" may be considered powerful and historically significant... It is a must for history buffs...</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>"Downfall" is an intelligent, engrossing drama, and one that is sure to be a treat for history buffs, though "treat" might not be the right word in light of the grim proceedings on display.<br /><br />There's really not much else I can add to the excellent customer reviews and comments here on Amazon, so I'll just say this: I didn't have any problem at all with Hitler being portrayed with a touch more humanity in this production than in many previous dramatizations of his life.  Showing Hitler being patient with his nervous secretary or having a quiet moment with his mistress or (to use the old cliche) being nice to his dog, doesn't mean the film makers are making excuses for Hitler or softening him.  Rather, such moments do just the opposite: they warn us that the horror of Hitler could rise up again in another human being who may at first glance seem like a regular person.<br /><br />Portraying Hitler in a one-note lunatic fashion- as he's been portrayed often in the past- makes him less real and more like a cartoon villain that only achieved power as a fluke, and that's a dangerous idea.  No, I think the film makers made the right decision in making Hitler seem, at least somewhat, like a regular person.  And, besides, for those who prefer to see the crazy, ranting Hitler, not to worry: there's plenty of that here, too.<br /><br />Now, whether the film makers gave a free pass to many of Hitler's supporters, many of whom are portrayed in the film as simply naive or just too weak or scared to resist, I don't know.  Certainly the film didn't give such a pass to everyone surrounding the man in the film.  Hitler is by no means the only figure in the film who radiates hate and evil.<br /><br />In the final analysis, the important service this harrowing, often claustrophobic film provides surely outweighs any shortcomings it might have.  Also worth your time is the almost hour-long "making of" documentary that's also on the DVD.  It explores in detail many of the themes and topics discussed in these Amazon reviews, in particular why the actors felt it important to portray the historical figures as the figures likely saw themselves and not as they're seen today; and what the German film makers wanted to accomplish in making a film about Hitler at all.<br /><br />This is a top-notch film, and a top-notch DVD, all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>FIRST THOUGHTS ABOUT 'DOWNFALL': DONE SO WELL IT IS TRULY PAINFUL TO SEE<br /><br />DOWNFALL is NOT a film you watch to quietly pass a few pleasant hours. In Downfall, the viewer has a front-row seat and there is much here one may not wish to see or to allow children to see. Essentially, this is gritty, harsh stuff depicting the end of the most tragic and convulsive period in history. That's right, Berlin during the last week of April, 1945 and, more specifically, in and around Hitler's bunker with Adolph Hitler as the central character.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: DOWNFALL MAINTAINS AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRAGIC DESPERATION FOR 2.5 HOURS<br /><br />Basically, everything that is depicted in this film has been documented and is true to historic fact, so there are no real surprises to anyone that has studied the Third Reich. Nevertheless, from beginning to end, the viewer is steeped in the tragic circumstances of the soon-to-be beaten Germans. Somehow, it seems very sad and pitiful. Hitler seems like a tragic figure, while Doctor and Frau Goebbels seem like the parents from a horror movie and their sweet, cute children don't know that their parents are the monsters. There is a whole subplot involving the final disposition of the Goebbels' children that might best be skipped over for some viewers. It is all quite true, but truly gruesome.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: HITLER'S GERMANY IS DISINTEGRATING & WE ALL HAVE FRONT ROW SEATS<br /><br />The real question here is --- DO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IT? Put simply, this film is an honest-to-goodness downer! If you are prone to feeling blue or miserable from witnessing human misery, you will feel pretty low after this. That's because this is both very realistic and based on historic fact so that, after the film, one cannot take comfort from the knowledge that this was only a movie. The truth is that this film gets as close to the truth as any has to date, but the actual gut-wrenching experience of being in Berlin during this final curtain call for the Third Reich is beyond description. Frankly, those that survived [and so many died horribly] like Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) were put into such a state of shock that they never recovered from the experience. Having Traudl Junge's experiences incorporated into the film as a viewpoint character adds perspective and humanizes this last week of the New Germany beyond where the historic source material, provided chiefly by Joachim C. Fest, could have taken it.<br /><br />ABOUT BRUNO GANZ AS ADOLF HITLER:<br /><br />Ganz gives the best rendition of Chancellor Hitler to date. He is a surprisingly-sympathetic character who is literally being buried alive by the weight of the calamities surrounding him. He appears to be poorly served by his inner circle who are waiting around for him to come up with some brillant master stroke to save everyone's bacon. Of course, Hitler knows he can't pull a rabbit out of his hat this time, and that fact is killing him right in front of our eyes. His coping skills fail him as he turns first on his followers and then the German people as a whole. Clearly, Hilter was pretty much losing his sanity at this point and everyone seemed to simply lean all the more on him as things grew darker. Small wonder he shot himself and took poison along with his new bride [she took only poison in order to avoid tarnishing her looks, before the petrol treatment, that is.]<br /><br />PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT IS SHOWN IS HORRIBLE [ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE HORROR WAS NOT SHOWN]:<br /><br />Yes, we see children being armed and then killed defending Berlin. We see the wounded and the civilians being pushed aside like fodder and we see the death of a great culture in Berlin itself. Throughout this film, one indeed gets the impression that it is far easier to destroy than to create. We see a lot of destruction and self-destruction, such as Germans executing their own people at the very end and then killing themselves. Generals of the Army [Jodl - Keitel] were later executed anyway at Nuremburg, so perhaps they had the right idea.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz deserves an Academy Award and Alexandra Maria Lara and Julianne Kohler are true standouts. The casting and the acting in this film are first-rate and many of the characters (Joseph Goebells, in particular) bear uncanny resemblance to their true counterparts.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: RAW HISTORY -- SORRY, NO HAPPY ENDINGS HERE<br /><br />"Downfall' is a phenomenal film that uses the cold historic facts of sources like Joachim C. Fest's "Inside Hitler's Bunker" to get the story correct. It then adds the additional humanizing effect of Traudl Junge's memoirs, which are effectively inserted into the film from its first scene until its last.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_Downfall_ is a film which depicts the last days of the Third Reich as Hitler and his cronies await their imminent doom in their bunker as the Russians invade Berlin.  Hitler is depicted by Bruno Ganz as suffering from Parkinsonianism and slowly losing his grip on reality, ranting and raving about the failure of the German people and the German generals and military as it becomes more and more apparent that he has lost the war.  The film is interesting in that it also shows a more personable side to Hitler, an ambiguous figure in the film, capable at once of kindness towards his secretaries and his dog but also great cruelty.  However, one also becomes aware of the ultimate failure of the Third Reich, as one sees how the cult of personality surrounding Hitler fails to serve the German people as innocent German civilians are slaughtered by the Red army.  Many of the most loyal in Hitler's regime choose to fight to the end and ultimately commit suicide (serving as would be martyrs of the National Socialist political religion).  Goring, Speer, and Himmler all ultimately opt to attempt to save their own lives by betraying Hitler.  Goebbels remains loyal to the end and he and his wife murder their own children, in the most sickening of manners, and then commit suicide because they cannot bear a world without National Socialism.  Eva Braun too remains loyal to Der Furher, opting to commit suicide with him by cyanide capsule after their marriage in the bunker.  (According to the film, Hitler's body was burned following his suicide so as to never be found by the invading Russians.  The film does not give credit to many of the various survival myths or alternative accounts of Hitler's last days.)  The movie speaks to the horrors of war, and also the cruelty of men, showing the insane cruelty of the Nazi regime and the SS, but also hinting at the equal cruelty of the Soviet army.  The movie also speaks to the dangers of fanaticism, showing the way in which many of Hitler's own men obediently followed his every order unto their very death.  It should be noted that Hitler had a lifelong fascination with suicide and that several of his former mistresses had committed suicide over him.  The unquestioning nature of Hitler's associates is particularly shocking to see depicted on film, although many would break with him and betray him, it becomes clear in the film who constituted the opportunists in the Nazi regime and who constituted the true believers.  Also, the conflict between Hitler and his generals and the military became very pronounced as Hitler ultimately turned his back on them and the German people but insisted at the same time that they never surrender.  I found this movie to be very disturbing, although no doubt a more accurate depiction of Hitler's ambiguous nature than much of the over-the-top pro-Allied propaganda.  While Hitler is depicted as clearly insane (or becoming insane) he is also clearly depicted as a human being and not merely a demon spawn conjured up from the pits of hell.  Ultimately however, while the Third Reich regime was a failure, its memory has lived on due both to its insane cruelty and to the role of war in shaping the Twentieth century.  This film provides an interesting account of those final days.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>Based on the book, "Bis zur letzen Stunde"  by Traudl Junge and Melissa Mueller, director Oliver  Hirschbiegel's 2004 film about the end of Nazi Germany is the most sobering account of that event to date, and told appropriately in its native language.<br />  It begins in 1942 when a group of frightened, wide-eyed young secretaries are escorted into a Quonset hut under guard, and made to  wait outside an office. Among them is Traudl Humps(Alexandra Maria Lara), a young woman whose family wished for her to avoid close association with the Nazis, who is chosen for the position of Secretary to Der Fuhrer.<br /> The Swiss-born Bruno Ganz's first appearance as Hitler in this increasingly dark drama is spellbinding because he doesn't appear menacing, but as an aging military officer having a convivial chat with a new employee....<br /> Fast forward to three years later...What Germany sent around had come back around.Berlin is under heavy siege as the Soviets advance, and after over 700 years of periodic German invasions, and ultimately having the largest number of casualties in what the Russians call "The Second Great Patriotic War"--in which every family in the country lost someone, they just weren't going to be nice people.<br /> The main focus is on the claustrophobic conditions of the Fuhrerbunker in the waning days of April and May of 1945.<br /> The film introduced me to the saga of  Dr. Ernst-Robert Grawitz (Christian Hoening), whose falling out with Hitler  led him to blow himself and his family up at dinnertime, six days before Hitler's demise by his own hand.<br /> On the streets of Berlin, Hitlerjugend prepare to defend the city to the death. The most prominent of these is the ill-fated Inge Dombrowski (Yelena Zelenskaya), a striking young girl with blonde braids dangling beneath her warrior's helmet. Her friend, Peter Kranz (Donevan Guina)was honored for a combat mission during one of Hitler's final public appearances.<br /> Juliane Kohler's Eva Braun is slimmer, harder, ane more intelligent-looking than Hitler's actual wife-to-be. She presides over one final party in a scene whose desperate gaiety is highly reminiscent of how Ancient Rome looked just before its downfall. Later, in between discussing quick and painless methods of suicide between Hitler, Traudl, Gerda Christian(Birgit Minichmayr), et. al, Eva invites the secretaries for a walk outside where they encounter a ready made bouquet of white flowers springing up amid the ugliness of the demolished world around them.--A moment of such wistfulness and ironic beauty.<br /> Hitler, shaking from Parkinson's Disease, still manages to give orders, including one for the execution of Eva's brother-in-law, SS-Gruppenfuhrer Herman Fegelein (Thomas Kretschmann) for disloyalty despite Eva's pleas on his behalf. His orders regarding combat strategy  reveal that he, like all dictators, has lost touch with reality.<br /> Certain details struck me as odd; Why were some in Hitler's inner circle smoking when he objected to that vice? And why is the vegetarian Hitler shown eating meat ravioli for a last meal?<br /> I had a sense of deja vu watching  Anna Thalbach as Hanna Reistch. She is the doppelganger of her mother Katharina, who played Wanda in "Sophie's Choice" over two decades earlier.<br /> Ullrich Matthes is a sinisterly beady-eyed Josef Goebbels(sans the clubbed foot). Heinrich Schmieden's Rochus Misch seems largely impassive to the goings-on around him.<br /> There are many elements to keep track of in this film. A significant amount of the drama revolves around the arrival of Magda Goebbels(Corinna Harfouch) and her six children. A conversation with Albert Speer ( Heino Ferch) reveals Magda's intentions for her children. She fogoes Speer's offer to take them to safety; in real life, she rejected a similar plea from her oldest son, Harald.<br /> Eva and Adolf marry as cyanide is tested on Hitler's dog, Blondi(whose pups were put down as well).<br /> Hours before her death, Eva confides her feelings about Blondi to Traudl, and gives Traudl one of her possessions.  The Hitlers say farewell to their staff, and Magda, who later begs  for Hitler to save himself receives a pathetic badge as a reward for over a decade of loyalty.<br /> As Traudl gives Goebbel's darling children their lunch, the Hitlers meet their notorious end. No words are needed to express Traudl's feelings as she visits the empty chamber shortly thereafter.<br /> That evening, Magda enters her children's room with a sleeping draught mixed by Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger(Thorsten Krohn), and while little Heide(Amelie Menges), Hilde(Charlotte Stoiber), Helmut(Gregory Borlein), Hedda(Julia Bauer), and Holde (Laura Borlein) sip compliantly, Aline Sokar gives a memorable performance as 12 1/2-year-old Helga Susanne Goebbels (who turned seven the day WWII began); a child raging futilely against the dying of the light, suspecting the truth of her mother's intentions. The scene of their extermination is handled less gently here than in the 1981 film, "The Bunker".<br /> Soon afterwards, Josef and Magda join the contiguous parade of death, leaving behind those who must use all their cunning to survive.<br /> The real Traudl Humps Junge is shown speaking at the end, expressing remorse for her blindness to what the Nazi regime stood for. The audience can make up its own mind about her sincerity.<br /> Comparisons to modern events will be left to other reviewers. But viewers of this film would do well to consider them. For it is a powerful drama with a timely cautionary tale brought forth by a powerful nation  that has come to terms with its past.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Downfall, is a movie describing the last days of the German High Command prior to the fall of Berlin in the Spring of 1945.<br />The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!<br />Bruno Ganz, Alexandra Maria Lara, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.<br />The setting, the dialogues, the special effects, the music, and the costumes are all excellent!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, let alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for WWII enthusiasts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>All "true" stories take a specific viewpoint, be it an autobiographical one or something determined by a scripter. This is unavoidable. The German-made biopic DOWNFALL is no exception. In this story of Adolf Hitler's last days, he's depicted as what he was: both a compassionate person and a deranged dictatorial monster. This attempt at honesty is admirable, and yet, the filmmakers exercise restraint, perhaps respect, in dealing with his and Eva's suicides. They're simply not shown, nor do we see their faces afterward.<br /><br />This same method is used when Goebbels and wife die in the courtyard: the camera discreetly cuts away. I'm not lusting for gore, but what would've been so wrong in actually witnessing the ignominious ends of two of the worst villians in history (Hitler and Goebbels)?<br /><br />By contrast, Frau Goebbels, who only hours earlier was anointed by der Fuhrer as "Germany's best mother," drugs her five children with a potion and once they're incapicitated she kills them by breaking cyanade capsules into their mouths. These horrific acts are shared with us in their entirety.<br /><br />It's troublesome. Lesser Nazis are seen blowing their brains out, so not showing Adolf or Josef doing so is a choice that sends a message, albeit not a loud one, to the viewer about the meaning of these figures to the German people, even in death.<br /><br />That's the only issue I take with what is an extraordinary and often nerve-shattering film, one that otherwise constantly rings true and is in fact a must-see for military history buffs.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>It was agreeable to see Hitler reduced to a bent, defeated, raving madman, and there is no question that Bruno Ganz looked the part.  The endearments he gave to the children and to his bunker mates contrasted horrifically with his plan for them and his "love" for the German people.  In a sense the way the final days are presented in this film reminded me of what the victims of the Nazis suffered, and that was also apropos and agreeable.  Still most people do not like to see human suffering even to those who may, by all that is right, have it coming; and so it was essentially a depressing experience to watch this film.<br /><br />Alexandra Maria Lara, who played Hitler's last personal secretary, Traudl Junge, provided the only bright spot in this necessarily grim picture.  She is a fine actress, but somehow she seemed too normal, too smart actually to be the sort of worshipful underling that she must have been.  Incidentally, it is from the book by the real Traudl Junge, Biz sur letzten Stunde, and from Joachim Fest's Der Untergang that this movie was adapted.  The fine screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger.  Junge appears at the beginning of the film from an interview in 2001, a year before her death, to say a few words and at the end where she explains that she is essentially not that naive young person she once was who should have looked further than the fuhrer's face to see what was really going on.  But she was with Hitler for three years and knew his philosophy well.  Truth is she was so pleased to be his secretary that she turned a deaf ear to the truth that was in front of her.<br /><br />Of course she was hardly the only one.  An entire nation was seduced and led down the path to genocide, humiliation, starvation and near-starvation, and ignominious defeat.  One thing the film does to help us understand how this could have happened is to show the blind loyalty that even some of the highest ranking officers felt toward Hitler regardless of his bumbling, his stupidity and his blatant disregard for the feelings and lives of anyone who got in his way--his essential immorality.  Some say there was something in the German character that accounts for this blind obedience to authority regardless of how corrupted and evil that authority might be.  Maybe in a more pluralistic and multicultural society something like this could not happen.  There might be something to that, but I doubt it.  Too many monsters have grown in too many different soils and in so many different cultures, I am persuaded it could happen anywhere, but perhaps not as easily and as completely as it happened in Germany.<br /><br />It is interesting that Oliver Hirshbiegel, who directed, did not show the Red Army atrocities as they stormed into Berlin.  I don't think he wanted to dilute the sense of the moral culpability of the German people.<br /><br />I was also struck by Hitler's obsession with loyalty.  This is how all dictators, warlords and, unfortunately, some respected heads of state operate: they demand unquestioned loyalty, and they ruthlessly eliminate anyone they suspect of anything but that unquestioned loyalty while rewarding the loyal.  And so in such governments the head of state becomes surrounded by sycophants and toadies who tell him what he wants to hear and who live in fear of their own lives should they somehow be seen as disloyal.  Indeed they sneak around trying to undermine others in other to protect themselves.  They live in secrecy amid lies, intrigue and murder.<br /><br />The film is long, 155 minutes, the bunker is dreary and most of the characters are sickies of the worse sort.  We as an audience are reduced to those who see inside a cave, the floor covered with bat guano crawling with despicable creatures who feed off of one another.  The stench is overwhelming.  We watch transfixed for a while at the ugly, unsavory spectacle and then we turn away.<br /><br />Can it happen again?  Can it happen here?  Let's hope not, but that freedom that the right assures us is not free requires more than loyalty.  It requires vigilance and a willingness to speak out, the kind of vigilance that can see the danger when the government begins to deal almost exclusively in lies and misinformation, that invades other countries for dubious gain, deals in propaganda and points fingers at perceived enemies and promotes only those loyal to the leader instead of those most qualified.<br /><br />(I said I would write this review without mentioning a certain personage, and I did, but the allusions are probably more than obvious.)<br /><br />See this for veteran Swiss-German actor Bruno Ganz who gave a fine performance as Hitler.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>The first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure, "Downfall" (2004) takes place in the dismal gloomy Berlin during April - May 1945 in anticipation of the inevitable German defeat. The film shows the last days of Hitler and those close to him through the eyes of his young secretary, Traudl Junge.<br /><br />Oliver Hirschbiegel's film has been criticized by some circles as presenting a "too sympathetic" portrait of the Fuhrer. I don't believe anything in the film suggests that its creators sympathize with the Nazi regime and those who had orchestrated it.<br /><br />Showing Hitler as a human being (amazing performance by Bruno Ganz), a man who loved his dog, was a vegetarian and could display some moments of tenderness did not undermine the overall image of a lonely, domineering, conscienceless, and hateful man who believed that his people, his compatriots, women and children deserve to die because they are no longer deserve to live and because "in a war as such there are no civilians".<br /><br />Did those who think that that the film "humanized" Hitler forget the most chilling scene in the movie, the one that shows Frau Goebbels crush the ampoules with cyanide between her children's teeth, after they had been dosed with a sleeping draught? She did it not because she was scared of what would happen to them after the war, no, her reason was, "The country without National Socialism and its party is not worth living in". How dangerous Hitler was if he could induce such a blind devotion that could convince a mother of six to murder her children in cold blood.<br /><br />Bernd Eichinger, the producer and scriptwriter of "Downfall" emphasized, the greatest danger he saw in making a film about Hitler was the temptation to show him as a psychopath or madman: "Hitler possessed an enormous criminal and destructive energy, and he was a barbarian in the most fundamental sense of the term... But I am convinced that he was totally of sound mind until the very end, which is why leadership never slipped from his hands."<br /><br />The film's director Oliver Hirschbiege says that, in the same way it was evil of Hitler to see Jews as less than human beings - i.e. as "insects" - it would be equally wrong to portray Hitler as a madman, because that would excuse him of culpability: "I think the biggest mistake is to have an image of Hitler as insane - that he was not a human being but a monster. The most important point to realize is that Hitler was not a madman, not a psychopath or someone on drugs, which implies that he wasn't responsible for what he was doing. Of course he was responsible! "For me, (this film is) paying homage to and truly honoring the victims, because we fall short if we explain the Holocaust by stating that they were all out of their minds. They knew what they were doing!"<br /><br />I believe that the result of their work, the film I saw last night is absolutely unforgettable - honest, powerful and devastating. It is a masterwork of film-making and a very important in its objectivity historical document.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Nominated for best foreign film in 2004, Downfall recreates Hitler's final days in his underground Berlin bunker. The film opens with a real life clip from Traudl Junge, age 81, whom Hitler hired as his secretary when she was only 22. Junge wrote a memoir about her experiences, and sat for a lengthy interview-turned-movie called Blindspot (2002), both of which served as material for Downfall. Struggling to forgive herself, Junge remarks, "I never thought that fate would take me somewhere I'd never really wanted to be." But contrary to Hitler's insistence that she and others flee Berlin as the Russians invaded, Junge stayed to the bitter end. Delusional, paranoid, and mercilessly disdainful of the German citizenry who suffered the carnage of his megalomania, it is chilling to watch Hitler and his volcanic rage as the end approaches. He screams about betrayal, and strategizes with battalions that no longer exist. At 155 minutes, this is a long film, but even though we know the outcome before we begin, the film maintains its dramatic tension. Strong portrayals of Eva Braun, who married Hitler in the bunker a few days before they both committed suicide, Himmler and Goebbels enrich the plot. Magda Goebbels murdered her six kids with cyanide pills rather than have them live in a world without Nazi Socialism. Downfall reminded me of the idiocy and horror of war, its catastrophic human toll, and the consequences of leaders who are blinded by ideology, surrounded by sycophants, and deaf to genuine criticism. In German with English subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Who would have thought you could shed tears for the Nazis?<br /><br />"Downfall" is a sad, grim movie about the last days of Nazi Germany. It takes place in corridors and sealed rooms, deep underground, with occasional forays into the shattered surface world of Berlin mere hours before the Russians overran it.<br /><br />The main character in the story is Tradl Junge, and was based in part on her memoirs, who as a young woman was hired as Hitler's secratary. Now after three years in his employ, she's seen him go through all sorts of moods, but hasn't until now seen him grimly suicidal.<br /><br />Hitler isn't the only one. Left and right his generals and commanders start killing themselves, at least those who don't try desprately to leave Berlin. Himmler even muses about making a peace with the Allies and wonders if, upon meeting Eisenhower, he should shake his hand or give the Nazi salute.<br /><br />The movie is also about the innocent. You see a young boy, not even old enough to shave, with his friends. All of them are wearing Hitler Youth uniforms. We learn in time that the boy is being given a medal for destroying two Russian tanks. His father is horrified. The boy, convinced he's immortal, is proud of himself, and ashamed of his father.<br /><br />The saddest of the innocent, though, are the Goebbels children. In the bunker they sing and play, and Frauline Junge does her best to look after them. Then their mother says she doesn't want them growing up in a world without National Socialism. Not long after, all the children are dead; killed by their mother, who is then shot by her husband, who then kills himself.<br /><br />The last days of the Nazi regeime leaves those more mythologically inclined to have flashbacks to Ragnarok, the Norse myth about the end of the world. Hitler, obsessed with appocalyptic imagry, seemed determined to bring about his own Ragnarok. You see him having conversations about how the German people failed him, and if they die, well, they'll get what they deserve. Towards the end he issus commands that even his loyal followers, like Albert Speer, are unable to follow.<br /><br />In the final scenes we see Tradl Junge and our young Hitler Youth member escape into the countryside on a bicycle. Yes, their lives as they know them are over, and there's sadness, but also a feeling of hope, and one remembers these are the people who in later years built Germany into the dynamo it's become.<br /><br />The movie is indeed sad, but also at the end uplifting and well worth seeing. Yes, it's in German with subtitles, but, well, deal. It's worth it. Trust me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>After hearing all the hubbub about this movie, I had to watch it.  Unfortunately, none of the theaters in the immediate area were showing it so I had to wait for the DVD.  I ended up buying the movie because I figured I would like it.  Sure enough, I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The movie really starts about 10 days before the fall of Berlin.  Although, there is a brief scene before that where Hitler hires his secretary.  In the point where the movie really starts, we see an aged Hitler who looks like he's been through alot (which he has).  The information he is getting from his people is bad and he's moving imaginary divisions.<br /><br />There were strong performances all around, especially by the person who played Hitler.  You could see the dispair, exasperation and everything else in his mannerism.  You also had the sense of the inevitable.  It gave a more human dimension to a figure who isn't often portrayed as such.  In that, it made all that did seem that much worse because he knew what he was doing.<br /><br />Anyways, I thought this was an all around good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>There will most likely never be a better film made about the subject of Hitler.  This film is incredibly well done.  The cinematography is unbelievable, the acting is amazing by the entire cast especially Bruno Ganz and the actresses playing Eva Braun and his secretary (using the clips from Blind Spot was a masterstroke).  The score was also quite good and the writing was superb throughout.  I found the film gripping from start to finish and I would definitely watch it again.  The element of it that I believe I most appreciated was its uncompromising portrayal of the people surrounding Hitler as the time just before his death(suicide)in the bunker.  This movie really makes you feel like you're there...You feel their sense of dread and loss.  Its a film that leaves you with many conflicting emotions.  One of the most haunting lines in the film is one that Hitler himself has where he basically implies in no uncertain terms that it isn't so much his fault that things happened as they did as it was the German people for going along with it and allowing it to happen.  He basically says the German people cut their own throats.  Listening to Hitler saying something like that is some powerful and riveting stuff...Its an honest, gutsy albeit controversial approach/statement that sets the film apart from many other films of its type.  There is no sugar coating here or beating around the bush and its particularly admirable in that this was entirely a german production.  You could almost think of it as if germans from the time like Hitler's secretary said you know what we screwed up big time and we better accept responsibilty for our actions and never forget what we did to so many innocent Jews and the stain we've left on our country's history.  Its not in any way that you feel sympathy for Hitler as some reviewers have suggested as it is you get an idea of what psychologically was going through people's heads during that time...And it can be quite a disturbing and despicable experience watching these people love and honor their Fuhrer so much.  But without a doubt it is a brilliantly directed thought provoking motion picture and one with core themes that we should never forget and that we are unfortunately dealing with today in this county (The U.S.) I am saddened to say.  But I'll refrain from going there...Just see the movie.  Also...It would make an effective double feature with Werner Herzog's film Invincible.  Some other films I'd highly recommend that deals with the same time period are Fasbsinder's BRD Trilogy (all three of the films in this Criterion collection are nothing but pure filmmaking genius), Verhoeven's Soldier Of Orange (a stunning film), Das Boot by Wolfgang Peteresen, All Quiet On The Western Front and a personal favorite of mine The Young Lions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Oliver Hirschbiegel's film recreating Hitler's last few days in his bunker beneath the Reichstag as Soviet forces make the final assault on Berlin in April 1945. A gripping film based mostly on the memories of Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara.) An outstanding yet harrowing film showing the final stage in Hitler's realization that his megalomanic dream of a Greater Germany was in its final throes.<br /><br />The film follows Adolph Hitler's (Bruno Ganz) mind as he ponders on what to do in the face of certain defeat. The film shows how Hitler continued with his typical hysterics in ordering his generals to fight to the death and not retreat one inch; how he ordered Speer and others to destroy all infrastructure in Germany; how he had little interest in evacuating the citizens of Berlin arguing that they had brought this upon themselves; and, that the only Germans who would be left would be the weak ones who were worthy only of death. The film correctly shows how Hitler vascillated between these extreme maniacal and paranoid fits to being briefly sympathetic with others who were with him. The most interesting is to see Hitler's relationship with his devoted henchmen, Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and Himmler(Ulrich Noethen.) One can clearly see that each of them were complete sociopaths who had absolutely no grasp of reality at that point. Even Himmler's idea to settle a peace with the US was senseless as neither the US or USSR had any need to negotiate a conditional peace at this late hour. Perhaps the most convincing demonstration of their insanity is when Goebbels and his wife decide to murder all of their children on the basis that a world without Nazism isn't worth living in. The film presents Albert Speer in a favorable light in his refusal to obey Hitler's sabotage orders but doesn't really delve into his previous dealings as Reich Minister for Armaments for which he was sentenced 20 years in Nuremberg. The film is also rather light as to the atrocities committed by the Soviets in their siege of Berlin. The most touching perhaps were the parts showing fanatical Hitler Youth or other children fighting in block-to-block engagements against Soviet T-34 tanks and infantry closing in on the city. As this a German film, all of the details of the period were closely followed in terms of clothing, mannerisms, etc. As the film shows, most of the German soldiers at that point were equipped with the Sturmgewehr, the first modern assault-rifle to be used in war: Kalashnikov was a tank crewman during that time and took one of these rifles back to Russia with him and modeled the AK-47 after it.<br /><br />This is a great film as it is depressive. The scenes in the damp bunker with sounds of pounding artillery above certainly gives one the impression that the end is coming closer and closer. The scene where Eva Braun is celebrating and dancing while the Soviets are less than 1 Km away from the Reichstag is quite surreal. The acting in this film was top knotch and the screenplay is faithful to the events that transpired in those last few days of April in 1945. I strongly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>How "Downfall" lost the best 2004 foreign film Oscar is as puzzling a question as how Germany lost World War II. In depicting the collapse of a psychotic dictator, it also details the demise of National Socialism and the transfixed personalities that enabled it. And it treats all this with an uncommon fidelity to fact, a feat of detection and dedication for which future researchers will be indebted, that is not to say moved and enthralled. It's not a pretty picture but it is a powerful one.<br /><br />The filmmakers move between the melodrama in the besieged bunker, where Adolf Hitler and his cohorts are delusionally in command, to the anguish and chaos in the streets of Berlin. It is there that German soldiers and fleeing civilians encounter the advancing Russian "liberators," armed resistance, and exploding bombs. The camera scrutinizes the lair-like claustrophobia of the Third Reich's last throes and the agony and bewilderment of those entangled in it.<br /><br />Alec Guinness and Anthony Hopkins have played Hitler, but their performances pale beside that of Bruno Ganz, who now owns the role (an odd distinction for an actor.) Ganz gives us the humanity behind the horror, rendering the madman and his mission as weirdly comprehensible (Hannah Arendt's famous "banality of evil.") As a result, some criticize Ganz's achievement and the picture itself as "humanizing the inhuman." Yet that is the very point the movie is making.<br /><br />"Downfall" is based partly on the memoirs of Hitler's young secretary, a major character in the film whose real-life persona is seen briefly commenting at the beginning and end. The director could have done a better job identifying the characters as they come and go (was that Martin Borman?), but the actors playing them couldn't be any better. This splendid DVD comes with a commentary tract and extras that are as engrossing as the film itself. Miss this one at your own risk.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>It is April 20, 1945, and Adolf Hitler celebrates his bizarre last birthday in the F&uuml;hrerbunker, the underground fortress far beneath Berlin's Wilhelm Strasse, where the architects of the Third Reich are about to meet their end. The Chancellery is in ruins, as is the rest of the Reich. Six years of war and bombing have laid waste all Europe. The Soviet Red Army is pounding at the city gates, having finally overpowered the German military machine - a vivid reminder that there is little cause for the F&uuml;hrer to celebrate this day with cake and ice cream. Traudl Junge, (played by Alexandra Maria Lara), is at Hitler's side in the bunker, as she has been since 1942 - at the Berghof, in Berchtesgaden, in Ostpreissen, and in glittering pre- Gotterdammerung Berlin. Hitler, himself, hired her to be his personal secretary, and she remained in her position until the end. Frau Junge was nearby when Adolf Hitler committed suicide in 1945, not long after his birthday. This is the hour of Hitler's final downfall.<br /><br />"Downfall," (Der Untergang), a two and a half hour film, chronicles the twelve day period from April 20 until May 2, 1945. This is an absolutely riveting, historically accurate and detailed account of the end of Adolf Hitler and his infamous Third Reich - which did not last the 1000 years envisioned by the Nazis, but did manage to reap havoc, destruction, despair and cause the deaths of millions and million of human beings. (Almost sixty million people perished worldwide as a result of WWII). Producer/screenwriter Bernd Eichinger, along with Director Oliver Hirschbiegel drew on a best-selling Hitler biography, "Inside Hitler's Bunker," by award-winning historian Joachim Fest, and the memoirs of the late Traudl Junge, the F&uuml;hrer's last personal secretary, to make this outstanding film. Apparently, "Downfall" is the first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz performs brilliantly as the leader of the Third Reich.<br /><br />Hirschbiegel paints a hellish picture of the mad, surrealistic bunker world, where fun-loving Eva Braun, (Juliane K&ouml;hler), throws parties while bombs are falling just overhead, and meals are served on fine china while starving Germans try to survive the Russian shelling. Grandiose war plans are still being made. Entertainment is provided, strict protocol is observed. Meanwhile, Hitler lies on the sofa in his leisure moments, eating cake, (talk about Marie Antoinette!), and chatting about his dogs. His generals discuss the best methods to commit suicide. Dozens of corpses swing from city trees and lampposts - fresh bodies, (examples to all of what happens to bad citizens), and those left over from the wave of executions in March. Fear, hopelessness and despair cause thousands of Berliners to kill themselves each month. In one scene, Eva offers Albert Speer, the minister of armaments and munitions, (Heino Ferch), cookies and champagne because he has been unable to eat all day.<br /><br />Although Ganz does not physically resemble Adolf Hitler, even with make-up, in an extraordinarily accomplished performance he takes on his character's persona emotionally, using the same facial expressions, body language and gestures to such a degree that he actually becomes Hitler on the big screen. At times, I totally forgot about physical differences. Palsied, stoop-shouldered, Ganz walks with Hitler's particular lurching gait, pacing the narrow, claustrophobic bunker corridors. Usually a meticulous man, his clothes are now food stained and his sight is so bad he can scarcely read. The Fuhrer had been unwell for some time, and it is clear that now, at the end of his life, he is totally out of control. He experiences violent mood swings. On occasion, he predicts victory and gives orders to move nonexistent troops to defend Berlin. He graciously bestows meaningless positions and appointments on some, and orders the arrests and executions of others. Not long after these manically optimistic episodes, he throws tantrums and rants, in momentary surges of psychotic fury. He rails against his formerly close cohorts - Himmler, (Ulrich Noethen), is suing for a separate peace with the Allies, while Goering, from his Bavarian retreat, is trying to usurp Hitler's leadership. As his personality continues to disintegrate, paranoia takes over and he rages and condemns the actions of the treasonous officers who "sabotaged" his grand plans. With the Allies crossing the Rhine River and the Russians closing in, he finally acknowledges defeat and decides to commit suicide - but he wants Germany to follow suit. Deutschland, he argues, had proved itself unworthy of his genius and had failed to prevail in the struggle for life. Then, thoughtfully, in all seriousness, he expounds upon his planned scorched-earth sacrifice of Germany, which Albert Speer refuses to carry out. By the end of his life, it's clear that Hitler is neither in command of the country he raised to glory then smashed to smithereens, nor of his own sanity.<br /><br />Ulrich Matthes as loyal propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, and Corinna Harfouch as his wife Magda also deliver superb performances. The film's most chilling, horrifying scene is Magda's final one with her children.<br /><br />The movie begins and ends with interview footage of the aged Traudl Junge, from the documentary "Blind Spot" in which she notes how naive she was. She maintained, until the end of her life in 2002, how unaware she was of the horrors perpetrated at Hitler's behest. She recognized, however, that she had no right to be so uninformed, so ignorant - that there was no excuse.  She acknowledges her passive complicity and personal responsibility as a German.<br /><br />Subplots are played out on the streets of Berlin - a boy, (Donevan Gunia), defies his father to defend the city, and a military doctor, (Christian Berkel), stays behind to help the wounded. The contrasts between the world above with the one belowground is very effective in demonstrating how isolated Hitler and his small cadre of followers have become. Politicians use the term, "the bunker mentality," to describe this out-of-touch mind-set.<br /><br />"Downfall" is cinema at its best. It is also a terrible, but necessary lesson in history - one that those who govern should learn well in order to prevent this evil from being repeated. Adolf Hitler has been dead for over 60 years now, as are many of those who were his cronies and minions, yet the study of this man, who I believe personifies evil, never fails to fascinate. I highly recommend viewing this exceptional movie.<br /><br />DVD special features include a feature on the making of the film, interviews with the cast and crew, and a commentary by the director.<br /><br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>"Downfall" has received some criticism here and elsewhere for "humanizing Hitler."  In that regard, I think that the movie "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary" ought to be a prerequisite for seeing "Downfall."  In that film, we hear Hitler's young secretary, Traudl Junge, discuss Hitler as a gentle, caring father figure.  She's so close in, she has limited visibility of the scope of the insanity and destruction this man has sown throughout the world.  And, since much of "Downfall" is from Ms. Junge's eyes and her "Blind Spot" position, this is the Hitler we get.<br /><br />Acting-wise, "Downfall" is a tour-de-force from Swiss actor Bruno Ganz  (a favorite of mine from an all-time favorite movie, "Bread and Tulips").  He plays Hitler as a claustrophic, deranged, literally shrunken, shell of a man beset with the very definition of "bunker mentality."  There's also some riveting acting from the actors playing Speer, Goebbels and Himmler.<br /><br />One can only imagine the impact "Downfall" had in Germany.  As one reviewer here aptly puts it, this is a "German movie for Germans."</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I believe that this is the first German film to deal with the problem of Hitler.  Independent/Foreign Film icon, Bruno Ganz, gives one of his best performances as the increasingly insane Fuhrer.  Hitler, in this movie, is human and frail, but still a monster.  His random acts of kindness are all the more grotesque.  Even at the end, he congratulates himself on his courage in dealing with "the Jewish problem."<br /><br />The movie is book-ended with clips of Hitler's real-life secretary, who appears as a young girl in the film.  Most of the movie is seen through her eyes - from her first job interview with Hitler at the age of twenty-two, to the final days in the bunker.<br /><br />The movie feels so authentic it is almost a docu-drama.  A series of titles at the end shows what happened to each of the characters - a surprising number of them led incredibly long lives.  We get to meet most of the characters in the bunker, which seems like a version of Hell.  The most illuminating character is Eva Braun: she actually has a feisty personality.  What does she see in Hitler?  What, in fact, does anyone see in Hitler?  At a time when he is clearly insane, commanding make-believe armies, and doing everything wrong, his supporters cling to him all the stronger, as if he were capable of leading them away from this horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Der Untergang" (Downfall) is a German production (filmed in Petersberg, Russia ironically enough) that tells the story of the last ten days of Third Reich, told mainly from the perspective of those in the bunker of Adolf Hitler.  But it begins with a scene from 1942 when young Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is hired by the Fuehrer as a secretary.  Then we jump ahead to Berlin in 1945, with the Soviet army enclosing the city and Frau Junge still by Hitler's side.  The screenplay by Bernd Eichinger is based on not only Junge's memoir, "Until the Final Hour" (written with Melissa Muller), but also Joachim Fest's "Inside Hitler's Bunker."  Junge's story was told in a 2002 documentary, "Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekret&auml;rin" ("Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"), which I will be watching next week.  I decided I watched to watch this dramatization first and then watch the documentary.  The real Junge, who died in 2002, appears at the beginning and end of "Der Untergang," providing a context for the story in keep with our perspective on Hitler and Nazi Germany from the vantage point of the start of the 21st century.<br /><br />Basically what we have here with "Der Untergang" is a horror movie.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel makes it clear that the machinery of destruction did not stop with the death of Hitler, which is why this 2004 film is about the last ten days of the Third Reich rather than just the last ten days of the life of Adolf Hitler.  In fact the deaths of Hitler and Eva Bruan take place off question with the sound of the bullet that Hitler shot through his brain letting us know the Fuehrer is tote.  Throughout the film Hirschbiegel makes a point of refraining from showing us Nazis shooting themselves, choosing most of the time to show us their corpses (yes, there are some exceptions to this rule, but by the time the camera pans away right before Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) shoots his wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) and then himself, the point has been made.  The voyeuristic emphasis here is not on death but the fact that even with Soviet artillery shelling Berlin and Soviet troops a few hundred meters away, there were so many Nazi officers who were willing to fight to the end or blow their brains out to follow their Fuehrer off to Hell.<br /><br />Traudl Junge is a spectator to most of what goes on and we know that she is going to survive what is to come just as we know that Hitler will not.  Consequently there are other figures who emerge as being more interesting because we do not know if they are going to get out of Berlin alive.  For me the two key characters because Professor Werner Haase (Matthias Habich), a member of the S.S. who thinks it is long past time that the insanity stopped, and young Peter Kranz (Donevan Gunia), decorated by Hitler for having destroyed two Soviet tanks with his bazooka and embarrassed by having his father (Karl Kranzkowski) try to drag him off the front line because the war is lost and he wants his son to come out of it alive.  One thing that this movie makes clear is that being a good German (to wit, wanting the nation to survive) has absolutely nothing to do with being a good Nazi (to wit, death before, during or after defeat), but perhaps its greatest strength is in showing the environment that can help us understand (but not accept) why it is nobody ever just pulled out their pistol and blew Hitler's brains out long before he did it himself.<br /><br />I cannot speak to the authenticity of the events depicted, but they certainly ring true and hold with what historical details I do know about those last days in the Bunker.  Hirschbiegel even adds an additional element of horror to Magda Goebbels's murder of her six children but having one of them fight being administered the sleeping potion that would allow her mother to slip a cyanide capsule into her mouth.  As for Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler, what I think I got out of watching the film is that Hitler was nice to women and that they worshipped him, some, such as Hanna Reitsch (Anna Thalbach), more than others.  But whether it was simply ingrained manners or a measured response to deep adoration, it is hard to tell.  Not that it matters much in the end, because even if Hitler can be seen as being human that does not make him any less of a monster.<br /><br />In fact, it can serve to magnify the horror.  When Hitler marries Ava Braun the presiding official is required by the Race Laws of Nazi Germany to ask the Fuehrer and his bride if they are of pure Aryan origins.  Given that the Nazi ideal is a tall, clean shaven, curly haired blond Bavarian and Hitler is a short man with a dishevelled mop of dark hair and a Charlie Chaplin mustache who came from Austria, it seems obvious to me that Hitler is one of the least Aryan looking Nazis.  But you do get a sense of Hitler's charisma and the power he holds over these others is clearly absolute.  Even as Berlin is crumbling the Nazi's struggle to order remains paramount, and if there is any clear contrast between Nazi Germany and modern America it is that the government can make all the calls for order that it wants, but we are not willing to simply shut up and go along like sheep to the slaughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Downfall" navigates a surprisingly easy path between two untenable extremes in its depiction of the last days of Hitler and the Reich.  Beginning in 1942, Hitler meets Traudl Junge, one of several candidates for the job of being his steno.  Eventually, Traudl will follow the Reich leadership into the Fuhrer bunker and observe the agonizing disintegration of the nation.  Here we meet the monsters both well known and less-so - from Hitler & Goering to men like Krebs, Jodl & Hanna Reitsch.  As the Red Army closes in on Berlin, the Reich leadership barks orders both purposeless and impossible - with non-existent combat units capable only of delaying the inevitable.  Eveyrbody knows what happened next - in high spirits, the occupants of the bunker kick off a suicidal orgy of cyanide capsules and 9mm bullets.  Magda Goebbels, traumatized by the end of Hitler (more than the collapse of the world around the two of them) murders all of her children.  On the surface, in bombed-out Berlin, those who neither fight nor commit suicide, are murdered as Bolshevik collaborators or defeatists.  Eventually, some will escape the Bunker - but must face vigilante Waffen-SS troops ready to kill any who would turn their weapons over to the Russian invaders.  Never far from either the proceedings above or below, is Der Fuhrer himself - as acted by Bruna Ganz, even after he's committed suicide, he still has a presence.<br /><br />"Downfall" takes a third path from those normally used to chart the end of last century's monster.  Making the Nazis into monsters doesn't quite cut it - they were men who had the opportunity not to commit monstrosity, why deny them that one shred of humanity that condemns them the most?  At the same time, humanizing the monster in the context of a 2-hour movie that doesn't begin to chart their atrocities risks downplaying those atrocities.  Instead, "Downfall" measures the evil of the Nazis by depicting the ends they will go to avoid having to face the consequences of their evil.  With their Walther pistols and their cyanide capsules, they gleefully end their lives confident that the rest of us will see valor, and not the shame of defeat, or their fear of years of Soviet captivity.  Ganz, as Hitler, best emphasizes this - by making sure that scenes of him suffering shame, terror and Parkinsons are balanced by scenes of him demonstrating unregenerate fascism to the end: giving orders even he can't believe, making pronouncements right out of Mein Kampf, abandoning his people by committing suicide.  We're led to believe that Hitler's end was marked by his own suffering and that of others, but "Downfall" confirms that he callously ignored the one to inflict the other on those he hated.  The rest of the performances are also nuanced - the script gets us terribly interested in people who - for all we know - will probably blow their brains out at any moment.<br /><br />If the story has one flaw - moral or dramatic - it's the recurring focus on Traudl.  Though obviously loyal to an evil cause, Traudl herself is not really evil, and "Downfall" is willing to make Traudl more a victim than victimizer of that loyalty even if none of us are willing to do the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>A German film about the last days of the Nazi regime, centered on the Fuhrer's bunker, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to the fall of Berlin on May 8th. This is certainly a very compelling story (certainly one of the most important stories of the 20th century) and while it has been filmed before, it is the first time it's done in the German language. This makes the movie look far more authentic than when someone like Anthony Hopkins or Alec Guinness played an English speaking Fuhrer. And it has a neat framing device in the story as seen by Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge. The more compelling parts of the movie, for me, are not the war scenes, but the discussions Hitler has with his closest aides and military staff: Jodl, Krebs, Burgdorf, Keitel, Speer, Wiedling, Mohnke. Most of them know the situation is extremely critical, but they are reluctant to tell the Fuhrer, who is increasingly in denial, promising final victory even after the Russians are only a few kilometers away from his headquarters. Only Goebbels remains completely wedded to the Fuhrer's autistic vision. Even Himmler and Goering, realizing the desperate situation of the Reich try to unsuccessfully arrange negotiations with the allies. These negotiations never got to anything, but Hitler is furious when he learns about them, and consider them both traitors.<br />Bruno Ganz is brilliant as Hitler, but the movie is considerably helped by the strengths of its many characters. For example, Fegelein, who as Himmler's adjutant, tries to convince Hitler and the other people in the bunker that it's best to leave Berlin. Fegelein meets an untimely fate and has become the subject of many internet gags (more on that later). Or Eva Braun, portrayed here as the ultimate dumb blond totally subservient to his man. Or Magda Goebbels, who can be both cold and hysterical. Perhaps the only character whose portrayal is unsatisfying is Joseph Goebbels, since he is played by an actor in a heavy and ridiculous white make up. Also strange is the decision to have Goering appear in only one scene and without a speaking role, just looking impatiently at his watch.<br />I remember that when the movie came out, some critics thought the movie was pro Nazi, in that it understood Hitler too much. I think with time it is clear that this charge is ridiculous. This movie clearly shows the delusion of Hitler and the terrible philosophy of the Nazis: no compassion and ultimate indifference to the fate of their own people. One criticism is that perhaps the movie was a bit too long: most of the scenes involving the bald doctor in the hospital or the child soldiers could have been cut and the movie would have been better.<br />Of course, by now the movie is well known by the hundreds (if not thousands) of parody videos in the Internet where the original audio is retained but the subtitles are changed so that Hitler and his aides end up arguing about a lot of ridiculous and anachronistic subjects (like computer programs, sport teams, pop stars, whatever). Those videos are sometimes very funny (and they have been surprisingly resilient in time given the short attention span of fads in the web), but if the movie on which they are based was not powerful, they couldn't have thrived as they did.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>As an avid historian I was incredibly fascinated by the story of the last few days of the German Third Reich in Berlin.  The major players of the Nazi regime are all represented.  The story doesn't just portray them as one note villains--rather it paints a picture of all shades with acts of courage and evil alike, honor and deceit.  Bruno Ganz is terrific as Hitler.  The entire cast is fantastic as is the story.  The only thing that may turn people off is that the film is entirely in German with English subtitles.  You can't get much better than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Das Boot is still my favorite war film, but Downfall is just as great. This  film, which deals with the last days of Hitler and the Reich, is something that we aren't really accustomed to these days. Like Das Boot, we get to see the German P.O.V. rather than the American/British/Russian, only here it is a bit more striking because it involves the notorious dictator himself. We get to see his ruthless paranoia and isolation as Russian forces are gaining victory around Berlin. We also get to see the people around him who start to see that Nazi Germany has been greatly defeated. It's a very disturbing experience, and once the end credits roll, we are left with awe and shock.<br /><br />This is a fantastic foreign film that should've won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (or at least have a tie with The Sea Inside). Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is very full portrait of the end of Hitler's regime.  Ganz (who is half-Jewish) is completely convincing as the declining, self-deluding, vicious Hitler.  You watch him as he loses touch with reality, first in ignoring reports that are not to his liking, then in placing ridiculous hopes in gambles and deus ex machina scenarios.  He seems quite human until he orders meaningless executions of the disloyal, who know the end is coming.<br /><br />Most interesting, however, are the characters around him.  The story is told from the point of view of one of his secretaries, who states, perhaps disingenuously, that she was not a committed Nazi, but came to almost love Hitler the man - he earns her loyalty through kindness.  THere are also the Goebbels, whose wife and children come off as rather sympathetic, symbolic in many ways of the self-destructiveness of the German elite.  Deep in the bunker, they live in a kind of parallel universe, a mythological kingdom in which everything still seems possible.  Eva Brown works hard to keep everyone's spirits up in ironically frivolous dances while the guards are drinking themselves senseless.  Meanwhile, the Soviets are pressing closer and closer.<br /><br />This is excellent historical drama, stimulating the viewer to want to discover more.  Warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />An exceptionally well-acted and well-made war film, Downfall transcends any controversy about its point of view by portraying the last few days of the Third Reich as an observer without any sympathy; the film is a must see to history buffs or anyone interested in good films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This is a GREAT MOVIE all the way around and top to bottom.<br /><br />Nothing else needs to be said.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>World War II movies have usually entertained me, though a vast majority of them have been relegated to the same dull "Saving Private Ryan"/"Band of Brothers" pro-America, screw everyone else storytelling.  That's not to say Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan is bad, simply that they break no new ground.  They are entertaining, but they are hardly one of a kind.<br /><br />Then came Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima" which captivated me with its utterly human portrayal of virtually every level of Japanese military command on Iwo Jima.<br /><br />And so I came to Downfall, which has been lauded for its well-rounded portrayal of Hitler, and criticized for its supposed "heroicizing" of some higher-ranking Nazis responsible for horrible war crimes.<br /><br />Thankfully the film is German, so it is naturally in German, and well-known Hollywood stars aren't around to be a distraction from the content.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz is almost frightening in how he can make Hitler a real person, from a brief prelude in 1942 which clearly portrays the man who held an entire nation captivated, to the broken shell barely hanging on to his ambitions, his struggles, and his sanity two and a half years later.  His genial nature to the main character, Traudl Junge is almost frightening when you remember this is the same man who nearly destroyed Europe, was responsible for the killing of tens of millions of Russian soldiers, millions of western Europeans, and ten million civilians with the "Final Solution".  And so easily he can turn on the fits of rage and shouting that could melt even the most spartan of military officers.<br /><br />I do agree that some of the high-ranking Nazis are treated almost like heroes, but I think this speaks volumes about the kinds of people who would perpetrate such crimes as the Holocaust; normal people, with virtue and vice, sticking to an ideal and blinding themselves to a reality, or otherwise accepting the reality as furthering the ideal.<br /><br />Every character is portrayed as more than a grotesque caricature of evil, hatred, and rage, given personality, even down to the stone cold zealot Goebbels, whose unwavering devotion to Nazi Germany is no detraction from his humanity, as he mourns the loss of his children, genuinely believing the future to be not worth living in without the Third Reich.<br /><br />There is no propaganda to this film:  Hitler is human, yes, but that does not make him right or his actions forgiveable.  Bruno Ganz as Hitler is warm, gentle, and witty, and he is stubborn, heartless, and deranged.  The Soviets are the greatest threat Germany faces in these last days of the war---as they were for most of the ground battles in the war.<br /><br />Somewhat foolishly enough, my only complaint with the film is that every explosion is accompanied by the exact same sound effect of twisting metal.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Downfall (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2004<br /><br />Downfall is that rarest of birds, a movie that actually lives up to all the hype. It is a depiction of the final days of the Third Reich from the perspective of Traudl Junge (Alexandria Maria Lara, as yet unknown to American audiences-- that will change soon), Hitler's secretary. Based on Junge's own memoirs and Joachim Fest's Der Untergang, Downfall shows a quick scene of Hitler interviewing Junge for the job, and then cuts to April of 1945, when everyone involved knows that no matter what happens, this will end badly. The film is for all intents and purposes plotless; Hirschbiegel is simply interested in exploring the different ways in which the characters are reacting to the stress of the imminent loss of the war. Hitler (peerlessly depicted by the great Bruno Ganz; this performance should have nabbed him an Oscar) gets sicker and more frail before our very eyes, while Eva Braun (Nowhere in Africa's Juliane Kohler) tries to keep up a happy-go-lucky air. Traudl and her friend Gerda (Perfume's Birgit Minichmayr) just try to muddle along. Schenk, an SS doctor (The Experiment's Christian Berkel, who also turns in an absolutely stunning performance) vacillates between simply trying to do his job and trying to talk sense into the other officers, who are doing their best Brownian motion impersionations, while the enlisted officers are separating into groups who do nothing but drink heavily and reminisce and those who become more fanatical by the day. There is a deep sense of nihlism about the whole affair-- it's Nero's Rome without the fiddling.<br /><br />It seemed to me while I was watching the movie that what made it truly great was that it did not end with the death of Hitler himself; the film continues for another forty minutes, getting more and more grim every second, as the Russians take over the last holdouts in Berlin and what would have been minor characters in most movies are allowed the full dignity of having their loose ends tied up. The darkness of this picture is relentless, from the literal darkness of the first scene-- Hitler interviewed for secretaries, it seems, in the middle of the night-- to the existential darkness of the long, brutal denouement. There is not one shred of hope to be found here, only fleeting, and spurious, happiness. And yet these characters go on, and the actors who play them play them going on exceptionally well. Hirschbiegel directs them going on, and does it in such a way that we can't help but feel the most sympathy for the greatest monsters-- who were, after all, human beings. Vastly misguided ones, perhaps, but in the end, they are us, just as the millions who died under them are us. Hirschbiegel never lets us forget that, and in doing so has made, as one critic trumpeted, perhaps one of the finest war films of all time. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Ever since his death in a Berlin bunker at the end of World War II, there has been endless speculation and conjecture surrounding the final days of Adolph Hitler and his long time mistress Eva Braun.  A few years back, a documentary entitled "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary" interviewed one of the few people who claimed to be an eyewitness to those events, a young woman hired to take dictation for Der Fuehrer for the last two and a half years of his life.  "Downfall" is a dramatized account of what she saw.<br /><br />Indeed, this new film begins and ends with clips from that earlier work, in which a now aged Traudl Junge attempts to explain why she allowed herself to become a devotee of both Hitler and the Nazi party (she chalks it up, basically, to "curiosity").  After that brief preamble, "Downfall" plunges us immediately into that hellish time when the world lay in ruins and The Third Reich was breathing its long overdue final gasp.<br /><br />The beauty of "Downfall" is not merely that it affords us a glimpse into one of the most fascinating bits of 20th Century history, but that it opens up aspects of human nature that we may not always wish to acknowledge.  It shows Hitler as a man accustomed to being able to control events and the people around him suddenly rendered impotent in the face of a force - in this case the Russian army battering away at Germany's capital city - greater than himself.  As events spiral more and more out of control, the dictator becomes ever more paranoid and divorced from reality (by the end he's issuing orders to an army that , quite literally, no longer exists).  For him, the world suddenly divides itself up into those who will remain loyal and faithful to the bitter end and those who will become traitors both to him and to the "glorious cause" that defined their lives for so many years.  For one thing the movie is clear to acknowledge is that, even in his final moments, Hitler remains unrepentant and convinced that not only was he right in what he did, but that future generations would come to recognize that rightness and honor him for it.  In many ways, this is the story of any failed dictator whose dreams of worldwide domination end in the smoldering ruins of his own hubris.<br /><br />But it is not merely Hitler who exhibits bizarre behavior in the face of onrushing doom.  Even though most of the people who have chosen to remain in the bunker with their leader are fully aware of the fate that awaits them, they maintain many of the rituals and accoutrements of "civilized," "gracious" living: they hold dances, sing patriotic songs, drink champagne from crystal glasses, read magazines, all the while calmly discussing the ideal way to kill themselves.  Despite their fear, they are so caught up in the vision and the man to whom they have sworn allegiance that they are willing to die - and take their children with them into death - rather than live in a world without their beloved Fuehrer.<br /><br />The makers of "Downfall" run the risk common to any work that attempts to provide a three-dimensional portrait of Hitler: the accusation that they are trying to "humanize"  a man whose epic disregard for human life puts him in the category of the greatest monsters who ever lived.  And, indeed, the movie does show Hitler displaying moments of warmth and tenderness, mainly aimed towards the women in his life (and, of course, his dog).  Yet, who among us really believes that Hitler NEVER showed affection to those who were close to him?  It was the fact that he COULD treat the people he loved in this way yet was unable to extend that same sense of empathy and concern to the faceless, nameless millions he slaughtered that made him the true incarnation of evil on earth.<br /><br />The film also does a great job showing the varied reaction of Hitler's military commanders as they argue back and forth over whether to level with him about the hopelessness of the situation and thereby risk incurring his wrath or to continue to feed his delusions and let him go out thinking he was still master of his fate.<br /><br />The performances are all first rate, but I would like to single out especially the lively and vivacious Juliane Kohler who manages to make Eva Braun's blind devotion to a murderous madman and fearlessness in the face of death touching, understandable, and - dare I say it? - strangely heroic.  As Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara shrewdly portrays a woman whose own devotion to the man and the cause is tempered by a certain degree of rationality and fear, to the point where she can ask, in a moment of candor, how Hitler can be so kind on a personal level, yet so brutal in his comments and actions.  And, of course, Bruno Ganz gives a bravura performance as Hitler, running the gamut from full-throttle mania to tender solicitude while never losing sight of the man at the core.<br /><br />Although the vast majority of the scenes are set inside the bunker, writer Bernd Eichinger and director Oliver Hirschbiegel take us outside to see the devastating effect this war is having on the innocent civilians caught up in it.  Thus, while the focus is tight, the tapestry on which the film plays out is broad and large.<br /><br />Despite being set in the past, "Downfall" has a great deal of relevance to our own time.  To see Magda Goebbels methodically and systematically poisoning each one of her own children before having herself killed is to understand a little better how family men can fly planes filled with innocent men, women and children into skyscrapers.  It's a scary and sobering sight indeed.  Now if only we as a species could learn some of the lessons put forth by this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Intense and intimate portrayal of Hitler's demise has the crazy, nightmarish feel of a Bosch painting, with a pervading sense of unreality, the last barrier to death and destruction. This is an astounding film experience for those with the stomach for it. Ganz renders Hitler so expertly that the effect is spooky, as if the dead had been brought back to life. Other searing performances come from Juliane Kohler as a curiously cheery, detached Eva Braun, and both Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch make your blood run cold playing the twisted, ever loyal Josef and Magda Goebbels. Finally, the delicate, wide-eyed Lara beguiles as Traudl, a mostly innocent lamb placed by fate right in the center of the wolf's lair. Nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, with good reason.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>"Downfall" is actually a very story sad story to be told. The film comes through and shows everyone that the man who was responisble for the death of 6 million Jews actually had a human side as well. This is what makes the movie sad, with everything that has been said about him all of these years, people forget that he is human as well. Bruno Ganz does an excellent job as Hitler. He does bring a human side to the movie. The script is very well written. After watching, I can see why this film won so many awards</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Downfall" depicts the turmoil, delusion, and despair of the last 12 days of the Third Reich in the "F&uuml;hrerbunker",  where Adolph Hitler and some of the Nazi elite sat out the Soviet assault on Berlin in April 1945, 10 meters beneath the Reich Chancellery. This account of events in the bunker is based on the book "Inside Hitler's Bunker" by Joachim Fest, on Traudl Junge's eyewitness account in "Until the Final Hour", written with Melissa M&uuml;ller, on the autobiographies of Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nther Schenck, and on other eyewitness accounts. Traudl Junge was Adolph Hitler's private secretary and one of few surviving witnesses to his last days. She spoke candidly of the harrowing final days in the Chancellery in the 2002 documentary film "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary", and "Downfall" uses her character as a perspective through whom we see the others, particularly Hitler and Eva Braun. Traudl Junge is not strong character, yet she is featured prominently in the midst of much stronger personalities. Actress Alexandra Maria Lara does an impressive job of keeping the audience interested in her.<br /><br />"Downfall" opens in November 1942, as 22-year-old Traudl Humps gets a job as dictation secretary to Adolph Hitler. The film then jumps to Hitler's 56th birthday on April 20, 1945. Traudl has married in the interim years, although no mention is made of it. Her name in now Junge. Hitler (Bruno Ganz) has ordered "Clausewitz" in effect, so all government offices and departments are evacuating Berlin, leaving the city to bedlam and the civilians at the mercy of starvation and the advancing Soviet army. Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethan), among others, urges Hitler to leave Berlin, but he refuses. Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nther Schenck (Christian Berkel) is running around trying to get support for the plight of civilians and wounded. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel places the audience in the middle of this chaos without explanation. The film has a quasi-documentary quality, and it does not create a context for the events that we see, nor does it introduce the characters. It just plunges right in. I think that this technique ultimately heightens feelings of confusion and madness, to "Downfall"'s benefit, but it can sometimes be frustrating. Anyone who is not familiar with the major players in the history of the Third Reich will have trouble figuring out who is who, because most characters are never clearly identified.<br /><br />When "Downfall" moves to the F&uuml;hrerbunker, we find an unhinged Adolph Hitler. The F&uuml;hrer is more hysterical and irrational than usual, can't keep track of his armies, insists that Germany can win the war, and refuses to allow civilians to evacuate the city. Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is frightened and horrified by what she sees but usually calm and consistent in her dictation duties. We observe the conflicts between the generals and SS officers who remain faithful to Hitler's orders and those who wish to act independently, in particular SS-Gruppenf&uuml;hrer Hermann Fegelein (Thomas Krestchmann), the playboy brother-in-law of Eva Braun, who was loyal to Himmler. We see Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), chief architect and Minister of Armaments and War, refuse to carry out Hitler's scorched earth policy. But more interesting than the politics of the Reich's last days are its personalities. Adolph Hitler is delusional, blaming everyone but himself for Germany's imminent defeat. Eva Braun (Juliane K&ouml;hler) is ever the party girl. Josef Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) are fanatical to a fault and contemptuous of Germans. There is constant talk of suicide and cyanide capsules.<br /><br />"Downfall" periodically focuses its attention on the streets above, where the brutal battle for Berlin wages on. The desperate attempts by a brave but defeated army to defend Berlin are gut-wrenching, no matter what side you are on. The character of 12-year-old  Peter Ganz (Donevan Gunia) is intended to be representative of the very young soldiers recruited into the Hitlerjugend in the last days of the war. He is not a real person. "Downfall" makes me wonder how Traudl Junge and the German people could not have noticed that their leaders were stark-raving mad, but I suppose loony politicians are not unusual. I have never understood Adolph Hitler's charisma, and this doesn't help. But Oliver Hirschbiegel and the film's cast have done a great job of bringing the emotions in the Chancellery and on the streets of Berlin in April 1945 to the audience. The film has no score. The 20 rooms of the bunker were recreated as realistically as possible. We are dropped into this tense environment, where the Nazi elite and their staff awaited their doom, practically entombed in 4 meters of concrete already.  "Downfall"'s realism, painstaking accuracy, and delicate performances are an extraordinary accomplishment that make this a masterpiece among war films. In German with English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia Tristar 2005): Bonus features include a making-of documentary, interviews, and an audio commentary. "The Making of Downfall" (1 hour) features interviews with the director, much of the cast, and some others who are not identified, but may be the screenwriter and a historian. The director talks about why he chose to make the film and what he wanted to convey. The actors discuss their characters. And there is a segment about filming in St. Petersburg, Russia.  "Cast and Crew Interviews" includes interviews with director Oliver Hirschbiegel (4 min.), author Melissa M&uuml;ller (8 min.), and actors Bruno Ganz (6 min.), Alexandra Maria Lara (2 min.), and Juliane K&ouml;hler (2 ? min.). Some of the interviews are repeated from the documentary, but I recommend the one with M&uuml;ller. The documentary and interviews are in German with English subtitles. The audio commentary by director Oliver Hirschbiegel is in English. He provides a lot of additional historical details about locations, characters, background, and situations, expounding on each scene.  I highly recommend the commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>In 1945, the remnants of the Third Reich were in the final hours of its death. The Russians were pounding Berlin from the land and air, as the once strong German Army scrambled to avoid annihilation. Adolph Hitler retreats into the confines of a bunker to spend his last few days with his mistress, generals, soldiers, fellow cabinent members and their families, and one Traudl Junge, his personal secretary. What follows is a fascinating, and what I consider to be a true horror story, about insanity, desparation, and the end result of hatred.<br /><br />This movie is based on the works of two books, one of them authored by Traudl Junge, which gives this film an air of authenticity and realism that is haunting. Junge spoke as a witness to these events, and in fact, the real Junge bookends the film. Chosen out of five women to be Hitler's personal secretary, she was thrilled to be employed by the Furher, and worked very closely with him, even going so far as to enter the bunker with him and refusing to leave. Junge is never in conflict during the film about her role in the Nazi regime, nor ever questions anyone about the possible horrors that would surface; she claimed innocence. With the Russians pounding Berlin with artilery, and Hitler descending into insanity (ordering armies around that don't exist and talking about a great comeback), Junge realizes all is lost, and her decision is when to save herself.<br /><br />The tour de force performance in this film is Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler with such realism that you cannot believe this is an actor. He captures Hitler when he is screaming at his generals is that is lifted right out of old films of Hitler speaking at large Nazi rallies, and captures a different man when dealing with people close to him.  It's his realism that is eerie; definitely a complex man so successful portrayed.<br /><br />The other horrifying element in this film occurs later on, with Josef Goebbel's wife Magda's poisoning of her five children in the bunker after Hitler's suicide. After making her children drink a sleeping substance, she methodically and ruthlessly kills all of her children by making them bite glass capsules of poison. The scene was so amazingly powerful that I wanted to weep yet no tears came. It became an incredible image for the heartlessness of a regime so bent on perfection and courage, in a final act of desparation and weakness.<br /><br />And don't worry: there is nothing in this film that attempts to glorify Hitler, or make him out to be anything that he wasn't. Even in moments that he treats Junge with compassion, the six million people he murdered are never far out of your mind. In fact, when his beloved dog Blondi is killed in the bunker, and Hitler tears up, you wonder how a man could feel so badly for a pet when he ordered the deaths of so many others. His wedding to Eva Braun is not touching or romantic, but a mere formality. It's amazing, to say the least, to watch someone unfold to frightening effects.<br /><br />Junge went on to escape the bunker, and into a life of hiding, until coming out publicly about her role before her death in 2002. A documentary film was made about her life, in which she was interviewed about what she witnessed. I found Downfall to be the better movie, more thrilling, and ultimately more terrifying, than the documentary. I highly recommend Downfall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>There's a lot going on in this incredibly powerful German film about the last days of Hitler. Primarily told from the perspective of Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), Hitler's infamous personal secretary, Downfall is all about the fall of Berlin as Hitler (Bruno Ganz) goes through the motions of masterminding fantasy counterattacks and disintegrating mentally.<br /><br />When his inner circle of generals and confidants begin to realize that they're losing the war, their allegiances to The Fuehrer begin to fracture and disintegrate, while the average German citizenry is left to cope with the out and out horror of a full scale Russian attack. As the Allies get close to Berlin, the story shows what it must have been like to be trapped in Hitler's bunker, to be caught up in wave after wave of shelling, and to realize, that if it is a choice of getting caught or suicide, taking one's life is the only option.<br /><br />Outside the bunker, we follow a variety of subplots involving a 13-year-old Hitler Youth named Peter who receives a medal from Hitler shortly before all hell breaks loose, and an impossibly noble army medic Dr. Schenk (Chrstian Berkel), who disobeys his orders and stays in Berlin to provide treatment to the locals. But the main dramatic impetus takes place inside Hitler's palatial fortress where he rants and raves at his most powerful leaders as he stands over maps, manipulating nonexistent divisions, desperately trying to turn his forces around to protect Berlin from the barrage of enemy attack.<br /><br />The high-ranking Nazi's are portrayed as a nervous, sweaty lot who are either ready to cut their losses and betray their leader or are just fed up and disillusioned with the whole process. Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) and Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) both beg Hitler to leave Berlin for the safety of German civilians, while Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) - a square-jawed conflicted wimp whose wife constantly prods him to do the Reich thing - tries in vain to stand up for the "noble" ideals of National Socialism in the face of crippling defeat.<br /><br />But it is the portrayal of the women that is the most affecting and perhaps the most firmly drawn: The fresh faced and beautiful Lara as Traudl Junge is so devoted to Hitler that she treats him like a father, and in the face crippling sense of disillusionment, becomes the singular reminder of how anyone could have fallen for Hitler's false promises in the first place. Juliane Kohler is superb as the ditzy and flighty Eva Braun, who is so obsessed with maintaining stoicism in every situation, that she even gets drunk and demands swing music and dancing as the shelling outside the bunker only increases.<br /><br />But the most powerfully sinister performance belongs to Corinna Harfouch as the benevolent purposeful Magda Goebbels. She's a one kind of political wife, who, while hysterically begging Hitler to leave Berlin, also possesses a steely and determined resolve to spare her six children from living "in a world without National Socialism." The most horrific scene in the film is when this calmly psychotic and resolute woman sedates her children with "special medicine."<br /><br />Much has been made of director, Oliver Hirschspiegel's efforts to portray Hitler as a somewhat sympathetic character. The film certainly shows him vacillating between moments of intense madness and tender kindness. Consideration is enthusiastically given to those people who believed whole-heartedly in the Nazi party and who have thoroughly devoted themselves to it. But as he blames the German people for failing him and blithely announces that they deserve death and congratulates himself for ridding the country of scourge of the Jewish, the film finally shows him up for what he really was.<br /><br />Ganz gives a brave performance in a showcase role imbuing Hitler with sure-handed mix of sadness, anger, craziness, and eventually false hope. Hitler is always recognizably human, if still disreputable, and Ganz never shies away from showing both facets of his complex personality. And as the movie steadily revolves around his moods, his final decent seems to bring Berlin itself to madness.<br /><br />It has never ceased to amaze me that for all the death, destruction and mayhem that was caused, not once did Hitler or any of his cohorts ever express regret or sorrow at the terrible results of their ghastly and appalling world-historical project.

Written by Bernd Eichinger who based his screenplay on memoirs by Traudl Junge  and Melissa M&uuml;ller ('Bis zur letzten Stunde') and  Joachim Fest, directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and acted by an all-German cast, this is about as frightening as a story can get - yet a seemingly authentic one.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz gives a searingly vivid performance as Hitler, and while some are enraged that the film shows too much of the human side of Hitler (as though this could make him seem less horrid!), Ganz finds that fine line of presenting Hitler as a delusional underachiever who will go to any lengths to fake a 'caring man' to some while always being short-fused into irrational rages to others.  The film takes place in the final 12 days of Hitler's life while he is living in an underground bunker surrounded by many of his fellow ghouls as Russian troops rapidly advance to stamp out his existence.  There is condescension as well as blind devotion among the ranks. Hitler marries Eva Braun, informs his confidants that he will never surrender (nor should they) and then proceeds on his plans to commit suicide with Eva, having extracted a promise that their bodies be burned beyond recognition to prevent desecration by the Allies and encroaching Russians.  How this grand final plan is carried out is terrifying, especially watching Frau Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) sedate then poison all her children, and  quietly placing herself in front of the firing squad.<br /><br />The spectrum of the horror of Hitler's atrocities is not diminished by this so-called 'humanizing' film:  quite the contrary - Bruno Ganz inhabits the role with a verismo that makes Hitler even more terrifying in being a credible mind gone mad.  The entire cast of this claustrophobic underground bunker team is superb and the direction makes the 156 minutes speed by.  The minimalist musical score by Stephan Zacharias lends just the right tone of eeriness and the cinematography by Rainer Klausmann  (shot in St Petersberg and Munich) is stunning. The film opens and closes with the elderly Traudl Junge (the 'secretary' author of the book on which the film is based) commenting on the terrible tragedy in which she took part.  The effect is devastating.  Highly Recommended.

The last days of the Third Reich play out like a warped, insane version of Gotterdammerung, as Hitler keeps clinging to his dream of being a world conqueror. Bruno Ganz (remembered from the 1987 "Wings of Desire") is remarkable as Hitler; though there is little resemblance between them, Ganz has captured the strident voice, and the body language so well that he convinces us we are looking at the evil dictator.<br /><br />The re-creation of a war-torn, devastated Berlin is extraordinary (most of it filmed in St. Petersburg), with the fantastic cinematography of Rainer Klausmann. Meticulous attention was paid to the costuming and the props, making sure each uniform was correct, as well as the weaponry, and the furniture in the claustrophobic bunker. Based on "Inside Hitler's Bunker" by Joachim Fest, and "Until the Final Hour" by Traudi Junge and Melissa Muller, much of the film is seen through Junge's eyes, as she was hired as Hitler's secretary in 1942 and stayed with him through April '45. Fortunately for the director, many of the people depicted in this film, if they were not sentenced to death by the Nuremberg Trials, and survived the Soviet prison camps, lived very long lives, and were able to talk of their experiences.<br /><br />All the great performances are too numerous to mention, but standouts are Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudi Junge, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, and in the one heroic part in the film, Christian Berkel shines as Dr. Ernst-Gunter Schenck. A surprising character in the last desperate days underground is Hanna Reich (Anna Thalbach), one of the most famous aviatrixes and test pilots in the world. Anyone who has seen the 1965 film "Operation Crossbow" will remember the depiction of her testing the V-1 Buzz Bomb. The only "invention" is little Peter Kranz (Donevan Gunia), who is a composite of all the children who fought in the final phases of the war.<br /><br />This is a stunning film, and needs to be seen several times, as there are quick details that are passed over in the first viewing. Not to be missed is seeing it with director Oliver Hirschbiegel's commentary, and the "Making of Downfall" Special Feature is excellent, as well as the cast interviews. An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Film, it also has a subtle but beautiful score by Stephan Zacharias. Total running time is 156 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Based on a memoir by Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries, this 2004 German film tells the story of Hitler's last days.  It takes place almost entirely in the bunker beneath the streets of Berlin and the viewer gets to watch the deterioration of the man who embodied the epitome of evil of our time.  This is a time of his weakness, his madness, and his unwillingness to understand the real defeat of his monstrous empire.  This film does not depict the Third Reich in all its glory.  Rather, we see its pitiful demise.<br /><br />The cast feels absolutely authentic, and the most moving part of all is when Joseph Goebbles and his wife murder their own six children before committing suicide themselves because, as they say it, they cannot picture a life for their family after National Socialism.  The casting is excellent.  Hitler is very believable as the aging dictator who lapses into madness but who still commands absolute loyalty from all the people around him.  Alexandra Maria Lara is cast as the young secretary.  She's very pretty and has extremely large and expressive eyes.  She's young and na?ve and worships her leader.  However, at the end of the film, the real Traudal Junge, an old lady in 2002 when she wrote her memoir, is shown before the camera talking about her innocence and naivety in her youth and expresses deep regret for following Hitler so blindly.<br /><br />The film was over two hours long and the setting is quite claustrophobic.  It's also unsettling to view Hitler so up close and personal.  We never feel sorry for him.  But we do see him as a very flawed human being.  And, of course we know how it will all end.  However, I did find the film intriguing.  It's another glimpse into the unthinkable world that Nazi Germany was.  This is not a film for everyone.  But it does add some insight from a unique perspective to the whole sorry story.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>Yes, this movie is heavy handed but I appreciate the fact it portrayed Hitler, his cronies, Germania, soldiers, civilians, doctors, nurses, and predicaments that they were in towards the final reign of the Third Reich.  There was a saying that if you were to kill a person, you were called a murderer.  If you were to kill hundreds of people, you were called a tyrant.  If you were to kill thousands of people, you were called a conqueror.  And if you were to kill millions of people, you were called a Leader.  Here, you were able to see that in some people's point of view, Hitler was the saviour for Germania and their devotion and loyalty towards the man were unwavering till his death with his Mistress.  For the Jews, he was a monster who would zealously wiped out one race for the sake of maintaining the purity of the Aryan people.  For some, they finally understood that Hitler was an intolerant person that wouldn't take compromises and would take extreme measures to get his way.  They simply repented and subsequently went against his wills.  Here again, we question the rationality of having a war.  It's simply senseless to see a German killing another German whilst other Germans were fighting the onslaught of the Red Russia Army and having to protect the deprived, forgotten, and "dispensable" civilians.  Audience shook their heads in disbelief as Dr Goebbels (one of Hitler's more prominent cronies) and his wife calmly fed their children with cynides prior to them meeting their own deaths.  For them, it's about unquestionable loyalty and fanaticism towards one particular belief such as what Talibans and Al Qaedas believe in jihad to free Middle East from white's supremacy.  Lastly, there were those unspoken heroes that would stand up to the occasions to fend for the weaks when they weren't able to defend for themselves.  There were also those whose innocence was lost and that reality didn't seem to live up to their expectations.  "Downfall" is very good in terms of depicting the daily happenings, the intimate moment such as Hitler struggling with his Parkinson disease, reactions of various people from different facets of society, people dealing with their own mortality through denial, coming to term with it, or simply quickening the process to their final moment.  This is truly a riveting movie told from German's perspective catering for the matured audience that would want to understand people's reactions to it all rather than having those glorifying images shoved down our throats as done by other American film-makers.  A movie that would linger on in my memory bank for many years to come and a movie that deserved to be watched on the big screen.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Ultimately, Adolf Hitler met a cowardly and ignominious death - many of his allies and friends (e.g., Himmler and G&ouml;ring) had fled the incoming Soviet invasion in efforts to save their own skins.  Hitler, refusing to leave, committed the almost-as-cowardly act of killing himself and leaving his subordinates saddled with the order to "fight to the last bullet" and "leave Germany as an unlivable wasteland".  This film tells the story of the last few days of Hitler's life, and in fact continues for a few days thereafter.  The action scenes are few and intermittent, and after having seen Saving Private Ryan, they are not particularly shocking.  What is shocking, at least to a North American viewer, is the utter dominance Hitler still had over the German people and its military leaders.  Many of them honestly believed that, even with Soviet artillery shells raining down on the centre of Berlin, Hitler would be able to pull off a miracle and save the Third Reich from destruction.  So convincing are the actors and so compelling is the story, that Hitler's famous movements of non-existent formations to the relief of Berlin  is not comedic or incredible, but oddly depressing and pathetic.<br /><br />This is an all-German production (although, ironically, the exterior location shots were filmed in Saint Petersburg), and they make ample use of the memoirs and autobiographies of Hitler's contemporaries and employees, including interviews with those Nazis still alive at the time of pre-production.  Much was based on the book "Hitler's Last Secretary" (the English translation's title), in which Traudl Junge prints excerpts from a diary she wrote immediately after WWII ended.  Using the secretaries' points of view is a wise decision by the filmmakers, as they are outside the Party apparatus and are mainly viewing the madness around them, just as we are as movie watchers.  The filmmakers have made every effort to only show onscreen events that actually happened, and even went so far as to attempt to determine where Keitel, Jodl, Bormann, and the others stood during the F&uuml;hrer's war conferences.  Not only does this lend authenticity to the events, but (along with the superb acting of all the players) makes the film feel like a "true" depiction of what life was like in the G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung last days of the Third Reich.<br /><br />A potential problem with the film for the average non-German viewer is that there appears to be no logical or even emotional reason for the generals to continue to obey and revere Hitler right up to the end.  The timeframe is too short to see Hitler's charismatic rise to power, his devotion to the German working-class who formed his power base (and their devotion to him), his near-perfect military record in the first 3 years of the war where he was repeatedly proven right and the Wehrmacht general staff officers proven wrong.  I would also have liked to have seen more emphasis on Bormann, the only other high-ranking Nazi official (along with Goebbels) who stayed with Hitler to the bitter end.  Where the film steps bravely, and I think importantly, is the celebrated (and condemned) portrayal of Hitler and the other high-end Nazis as human beings.  It is unquestionable that Hitler collected a number of synchophants and star-chasers around him, and that they might not have been particularly intellegent (his alienation of people like Guderian and Rommel is evidence that independent thinking was not tolerated in the F&uuml;hrerhauptquartier).  The only possible misstep is the promotion of a "hero" in the person of Col. Schenk, "Inspector of Nutrition" for the Waffen SS.  He apparently selflessly wishes to serve in Berlin to provide medical help to soldiers and civilians, but this is the same man who callously used slave labour at the Dachau concentration camp for nutritional experiments.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a fascinating and engrossing look inside the final days of the Third Reich.  The performances are fantastic, and the film has an authenticity (even a "truth") that is rare and raises the film to a high level of importance.<br /><br />Extras on this DVD edition supplement and add to the experience.  There are interviews with the authors of the books on which the film is primarily based, and also with the actors protraying the parts.  It is refreshing to see that all these actors took their parts very seriously and did extensive outside reading to ensure their performances were authentic.  The biggest kudos have to be reserved for Ganz (Hitler) and Harfouch (Frau Goebbels) who have the hardest people to portray, and somehow embody them as real people, not cartoon carricatures of teeth-gnashing villiany.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Within the orbit of the "sturm und drang' universe that was the twelve year reign of the Third Reich, almost nothing was excessive, not even the maniacal gesticulations of the Little Corporal, Adolph Hitler, whose final days in the enveloping holocaust that was Berlin in April of 1945. In "Downfall" we are treated to a disagreeable dollop of desperately demented degenerates in an absolutely riveting look at just how fantastic and solipsistic the worldview of the Nazis was. Even as the Gotterdammerung explodes around them, Hitler fancies a meal of Cheese ravioli even as his eating companions dither.<br /><br />Hitler was nothing if not megalomaniacal; yet there was method to his madness, for the Soviet Union was indeed literally moving heaven and earth to discover and destroy him. Yet his almost whimsical last-ditch efforts to resurrect the smashed Wehrmacht to rescue him and win the day are fascinating to see recreated so powerfully and sometimes poetically here, and it helps one to better understand the malignant and molevolent motive force behind the mass movement that left mega-millions of dead and even more ruined lives in its fateful wake.<br /><br />The movie strikes a fascinating counterpoint between the social dramas of the siege of Berlin around with the more personal drama of what is happening within the bunker itself. In so doing, it breathes life into Hannah Arendt's fascinating comment about the ultimate banality of evil. After all, these were human beings struggling to survive within the concrete confines of the bunker, however tortured, conflicted and self-interested. To recognize this is to better comprehend just how petty and mundane their lives were in these most fatal final hous of their miserable existence, worrying as they did about making coffee and smoking cigarettes while their very world was being smashed into smithereens above them.<br /><br />The movie is multi-layered and quite sophisticated, and pointedly makes no effort to reach for the lowest common denominator in judging Hitler and his entourage, offering no drive-by facile answers while painfully and graphically exploring the excruciatingly caustic world of the Third Reich in its last painful death throes. Instead, we are reminded that the Fuhrer was as much a social phenomenon as he was an individual, and it was as much the fault of the average German who followed his charismatic lead as the devil himself who created the circumstance for the greatest tragedy of the 20th century. This may not be a movie you will really enjoy, but it is one we can all profit from seeing!</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>DOWNFALL is possibly the best German-language film I have ever seen about the Second World War. It sets a new and impressive standard that will be very hard to beat and serves notice on hack film-makers everywhere that depicting historical figures as cartoon images of good or evil is no longer acceptable with the modern audience.<br /><br />There have been a number of films and programs over the years about Hitler's last days on earth, and if you watched DOWNFALL, you've probably seen one or more them. They vary widely in quality, but the performance which pops into my mind most readily is that of Stephen Berkoff in the 12-part "War & Remembrance" mini-series. Berkoff is a fine actor, but he was handcuffed to a script which was predicated on the false image of Hitler as a carpet-chewing lunatic who reacted to the slightest setback by throwing a screaming fit and ordering someone shot. This image was partially an echo of wartime propaganda, and partly stemmed from books penned by surviving generals who wanted to lay the blame for the war's defeat exclusively at Hitler's boots. A more accurate description of the man came from Albert Speer, who said "Hitler was a genius wrestling with a demon, and the demon won."<br /><br />This image is precisely the one conveyed by veteran Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler as a man who in private often took on the role of a kindly, absent-minded professor-grandpa, but when frustrated, thwarted or betrayed (as he frequently was in the last months of his life) showed an inner character reminiscent of a hateful child -- full of misanthropy and an arrogant kind of self-pity. Ganz's performance is simply epic. And when does finally throw the "Hitler tantrum" you know is coming, you can't take your eyes off the man. Wow.<br /><br />The decision to depict Hitler as a human being will clearly irritate people who prefer to see him as Satan incarnate. The NEW YORKER review posted here is visible evidence of this, stating: "The attempt to re-create Hitler in realistic terms has always been morally and imaginatively questionable-a compromise with the unspeakable that borders on complicity with it." Thankfully, Hirschbiegel and Ganz paid no mind to this type of simple-minded drivel when they made the film. They understood, as the audience does, that to demonize Hitler lets humanity off the hook for producing him in the first place.<br /><br />Thomas Kretschmann (as SS-Gruppenf&uuml;hrer Hermann Fegelein) is another scene-stealer. Kretschmann portrays the handsome, oily opportunist who married Eva Braun's sister and used his SS rank as a license to amass a criminal fortune as a dyed-in-the-wool bastard who is as charming as they come -- just the type of cynical crook that flourished in the moral wasteland that the Third Reich ultimately became, and just the type that was first to jump ship when it all went south.<br /><br />Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, is played ably by lovely Alexandra Maria Lara. Like many people around Hitler, she seemed to be unable to form a consistent opinion of him and her inner conflict is well conveyed on the screen. Other terrific performances are delivered by Corinna Harfouch (as creepy Magda Goebbels), Juliane K&ouml;hler (as the very likeable Eva Braun), Christian Berkel (as Prof. Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nter Schenck, a kindly and heroic SS doctor), Michael Mendl (General der Artillerie Helmuth Weidling, a true soldier in the old German mold, who responds to a threat to have him shot by grasping his Knight's Cross and snarling, "Do you see this? Don't you dare take that tone with me!", and sinister nebbish Ulrich Noethen as the back-stabbing Reichsf&uuml;hrer SS Heinrich Himmler. There is also a fine turn by G&ouml;tz Otto as Hitler's SS Adjutant, Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer Otto G&uuml;nsche, a hulking brute of a man who serves as a two-legged counterpart to Hitler's faithful dog, Blondi.<br /><br />Unlike some German war films I've seen, DOWNFALL's battle scenes are well-directed, and the technical execution of the film is superb. The movie is mercifully light on moralizing, letting the horrifying images on the screen speak for themselves. I have very few criticisms of the film. The interview scenes with the real Traudl Junge, who dutifilly condemns herself for getting involved with Hitler, seem tacked-on, forced, and generally PC. The battle scenes show nothing of the wonton rape committed by Soviet soldiers in Berlin (so many German women were raped that East Berliners later dubbed the statue put up there by communist authorities commemorating Soviet dead as "the tomb of the unknown rapist"). And the movie is about 15 - 20 minutes too long. But these are very minor points. In DOWNFALL, Oliver Hirschbiegel has directed a film that stands comfortably with the best WW 2 movies of all time. Terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a superb movie that I helped me fill in a few questions I had about the end of World War II.  When I was young, the sensational media was still talking about finding Hitler, that is death was faked.  Sound familiar?  This movie takes inside the bunker in Berlin for the last few weeks of the war.  It is a reconstruction of various accounts from people who were there and left there testimony.  Several were still alive as late as 2000 and answered questions for the director.<br /><br />I had always wondered what the end of the war felt like to the Germans.  What actually went on there receiving all that bombardment?  Since this movie was made by Germans primarily for Germans, this is a fascinating perspective on that phase of the war and what went on in and around the bunker.  It is quite puzzling how in control of everything Hitler remained and yet how seemingly out of touch with what was really going on outside and not far away.  One answer could be that he was aware and simply refused to admit it in order to manipulate others to carry on the suicide / destruction of Germany - which he clearly wanted and ordered others (such as Albert Speer) to do.  Thankfully, those orders were largely disobeyed.  The destruction of the war made things hard enough without acts of self-sabotage.<br /><br />It was also interesting to see how all those around Hitler functioned and how Hitler manipulated and bullied them.  Their utter devotion to him and belief in him and the Reich bewilders me, but there it is.  I keep wondering why someone simply didn't take out a pistol and shoot him when it was clear everything was lost and it was apparent Hitler wanted to take everyone and everything with him to the grave.  But they didn't.  The seen of Magda Goebbels murdering her own six children with her husband standing just outside the door, when escape was still possible, is horrifying beyond description and made worse by its quiet bloodlessness.  However, this was the level of madness that possessed the true believers.<br /><br />The other issue is one that is still quite touchy.  Hitler is an icon of evil.  He, along with Stalin and Mao, were the great killers of the 20th century.  Hitler is the safest one to criticize, because his regime is thoroughly repudiated while the other two still have political connections with the present even if they are personally repudiated.  Still, in reality, they were people.  Monsters, yes, but still human beings of a certain, if horrible, kind.  In nearly all representations of Hitler and the Nazis in movies, television, books, magazines, or whatever, they are simply embodiments of evil and barely even caricatures of human beings.  This is a serious movie and it is interesting to see him put on the behavior of a human being when it suited him and when he let the monster rage.<br /><br />As interesting as the movie is, watch it a second time listening to the director's commentary.  While Oliver Hirschbeigel said that he is doing it without notes and simply reacting to what he is seeing on the screen, it is constantly fascinating.  He did a great deal of research for this film and knows a great deal of the history and shares it with us.  The few times he made things up, he tells us.  When he had to compromise the reality, he explains what it was and why.  He also discusses certain scenes and what he was going after.  The performances of the actors are also discussed and what they had to go through to make this film.  Most of those playing the key monsters understandably resisted the roles, but eventually took them on (obviously) and sometimes had personal issues with various scenes.  For example, the actress playing Magda Goebbels broke down during the filming of the scenes involving the murder of the six children (as does the audience watching).  However, on film she is as cold as can be.  In real life, the director tells us the reports have tears streaming from Magda's eyes as she plays the card game afterwards.  Here she is simply cold and dead as she lays out the cards.<br /><br />While all of the actors are superb, Bruno Ganz as Hitler has to be singled out for praise.  It was very courageous to take on this role.  And the way he not only gives voice to Hitler but the physical embodiment of his physical deterioration is overwhelming.  This is a performance that should be recognized and honored for its artistry and courage.<br /><br />The movie is in German with English subtitles.  Some of the subtitles move very quickly because of the amount of dialogue.  However, it is easy to pause the DVD and rewind if necessary.  Not all of the dialogue is essential to the understanding of the scenes.<br /><br />Please, do yourself and your sense of history a favor by seeing this powerful film and listening to the director's commentary about it.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>I had no idea Ganz had it in him to be this great until I saw him here as Hitler. Alexandra Maria Lara as his young and naive secretary is also very good. Cast is excellent. Director Oliver Hirschbieger deftly pulls it all together and will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through--even though we all know how the tale ended.<br /><br />The film gets under your skin and gnaws at your psyche long after you have seen it--and that is some trick. How were the makers of this motion picture able to accomplish this? By avoiding the usual approach of making Hitler and his murderous SS thugs as two-dimensional cartoon characters, instead they show the lot of  them to be what they were: human. Mixed-up, misguided, fanatical, barberic, coldblooded mass-murderers--and all in the quest for power (that they never attained), but human none-the-less.<br /><br />What is sad here, as far as I am concerned, instead of encouraging his nation to focus all that energy on making the world a better place, because Germans, the German people, have given us so much more than fine cars and excellent beer and camera lenses...Hitler and his thugs had their people squandering all that  potential on causing destruction and mayhem, misery and pain...for nothing.<br /><br />I realize quite a few Germans didn't care for Hitler and his loony notions...only there wasn't much they could do about it (once he came into power and they saw where he was actually taking them...straight to Hell). Any German who opposed the dreaded SS and the Gestapo ended up dead or in some camp somewhere to suffer the consequences.<br /><br />I always wondered what it must have been like for Hitler and his people down in that bunker during the final months/weeks/days... This powerful motion picture shows you what went on--and then some.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>"April 1945, a nation awaits its...Downfall" so goes the tagline for this movie. That should pretty much tell you all you need to know about the content of this film. Oliver Hirschbiegel's "Downfall" depicts the last 12 days before the end of WW2. The Russians are fighting their way through Berlin as the Third Reich must now face their defeat.<br /><br /> Many people have damned the movie saying the film wrongly humanizes Hitler and the Nazis. These kind of statements are misleading. Yes perhaps some are right, the movie does present Hitler as a human being, we are after all seeing the movie through his eyes. He is the star of the film but under no circumstances does the movie advocate his actions. In my opinion by presenting Hitler the way the film does it merely shows what sort of madman he was. He was a lunatic. Here was a man who failed at nearly ever endeavor he pursued. "Downfall" paints Hitler as a man filled with delusions. He insist that his army continues fighting while others around him say it is pointless. Many of his closet allies abandon him while he goes on protesting saying Germany can not make the same mistake it did during WW1 and surrender. Hitler even says he allowed the Russians to advance as far as they did. It is all a ploy. Now either Hitler was starting to lose his mind or he really did feel he could have won.<br /><br /> "Downfall" on a purely emotion level reminds me of Roman Polanski's "The Pianist" both films seem gut wrenchingly real. It should be pointed out this movie is based on two books. One of them written by Hitler's stenographer Traudl Junge entitled "Until the Final Hour" and another book entitled "Inside Hitler's Bunker" by Joachim Fest. Because of this we believe most of what we see as real. We imagine this was probably the way it really happened. And when you look at the film from that viewpoint you may find, as I did, the movie is depressing. We see people committ suicide and kill their each other, husbands, wives, even children all before they are caught. The scenes with the children broke my heart. Make no mistake about it "Downfall" is a brutally violent film that the squeamish should not see.<br /><br /> But despite the depressing tone and violence "Downfall" is a movie that needs to be seen by as many people who think they can stomach because if for any reason it will serve as a constant reminder of the horrors which were committed and how future generations must learn about the past so incidents such as these will never be repeated.<br /><br /> And what about Bruno Ganz performance? He is surely a front runner for an Oscar nomination. For people who condemn the movie for its portrayal of Hitler, you must realize the complexity of his performance. It is harder to present Hitler this way then in the fashion most wanted. For that you have to give Ganz his due credit.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: At times an all too powerful film depicting the final days of Adolf Hitler. Brutally violent and even depressing this is still a must see so it will serve as a constant reminder of what these people did.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This is very similiar to past movies, "the bunker' and 'hitler the last ten days" and this is the same story too.

Based on several primary sources, primarily through the eyes of a young secretary, Hitler is shown to be a human, although satanic. As everyone met their fate, it was sad to see Goebbels kill his entire family. This is a fascinating movie about the final days of the darkest periods of human history. Four stars. 11/17/10</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>This film really amazed me a lot. Right from the beginning sequence the film grabbed my entire attention and I had my eyes glued to the screen till the last credits. This film is very precise in terms of War, Politics and decent emphasis on Sir Adolf Hitler's persona. The 'Hitler' of whom we had brief flicks in several war documentaries or maybe some films depicting wars, this is a totally different side of the man, have the pleasure to witness Hitler as a plain human being, watch him as he exposes his heart to you in the film, watch him undergo different emotions, the film is a remarkable piece of Biography, a splendid cast following Bruno Ganz as Hitler himself, he is phenomenal and simply breathtaking, a remarkable performance by Alexandra Maria Lara and Juliane Kohler. Definitely worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>Based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge; one of Hitler's secretaries, this movie describes the last days of Hitler's life. It was exceedingly difficult for me to believe, that any actor could portray Hitler as well as Anthony Hopkins did in The Bunker, until I watched Bruno Ganz shines once again in Downfall.<br /><br />The most outstanding aspect of this movie is that it shows how easy it is to brain wash people and turn them into robots that  do whatever they are ordered. Great performance and wonderful direction, enjoy and don't miss watching the interview with Ganz, it is worth every minute.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.  I'm not one that typically watches nor gets excited via foreign films.  And thus was truly amazed with the... power, amazing story line, acting of this movie.  On a tangent, I happened to read the book  on Hitler's last days in the bunker prior to seeing this film and the film is very true to the reality as is best known.<br /><br />2.  Whatever you're preconceived notions of what this film may or may not be about--> just get it because it'll be well worth it.  As noted above, I'm not a foreign film expert, but this is definitely the best German film I've ever seen and among the top films I've ever seen in general.  100% a worthwhile film for most folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>This film looks at Hitler during his last days, when his grasp of reality truly began to slip and Third Reich was overrun. German with English subtitles I felt it probably captured the feel of the times more accurately than Hitler, the Last Ten Days, a movie I also liked. As seen from the point of view of Traudl, Hitler's secretary, the scenes leading to the Hitler's last moments run from the banal to the macabre. The immediate aftermath of the suicide, in which many of Hitler's inner circle began their escape and others also took their lives, is presented during the film. Overall, a great production.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>DOWNFALL re-creates the final days of Hitler's Nazi Germany with an urgency that makes it feel as if it is happening as you are watching.  A finely crafted piece of filmmaking, with stunning performances throughout, never before have I seen an account of WWII that is so vibrantly horrifying.  The portrait of Hitler is particularly mesmerizing - the account rendered in this film paints the picture of a wildly maniacal sociopath with human touches - even traces of warmth.  This juxtaposition was, for me, a powerful one, and offered perhaps the first ever film biography of the most notorious killer of modern history that feels believable. And this film captures Eva Braun with a raw intensity - you actually have a sense of who she might have been.  And the loyalty of Hitler's henchmen - and his countrymen - is painted as so complete that it underscores the audacity of what this man actually did to the world.  A first-class, exceptional film that will have you riveted.  Beware - there are multiple scenes of graphic violence, not to mention ghastly atrocities that are so specific and personal that, in some ways, they are worse than the mass murders we've seen portrayed in other WWII films.</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>Downfall dramatizes Adolf Hitler's life from his 56th birthday until he and his mistress, Eva Braun, commit suicide. The film comes from Germany and has subtitles. It treats Hitler as a human being. He is portrayed as charming and charismatic as well as brutal. Bruno Ganz is the Fuhrer. The fall of Berlin is seen through the eyes of his secretary. We get a sense of chaos and madness. There is partying and suicide as the Russians surround the city. We feel the claustrophobia of Hitler's bunker. Swastikas have been used by various cultures for 3,000 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Superb film set in and around Hitler's bunker in the last few weeks before the capitulation of Germany in WWII - seen through the eyes of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge.<br />Bruno Ganz is superb in the role of the Nazi leader - brilliantly portraying Hitler's wild mood swings and increasing detachment from reality. An altogether remarkable film exploring a remarkable moment in history.<br /><br />The book "Until the Final Hour" by Traudl Junge and Melissa Muller is also available through Amazon.com as is the documentary "Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary", which features extensive interviews with her.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>I have decided to see this movie after viewing a documentary "In the bunker".  It is amazing how close this film is to the factual events of the last days of Hitler and his party.  Bruno Ganz took a lot of courage to portray one of the most hated man in the human civilazation.  His performance is one of the best I have ever seen.  To me this film was the end of personal debate if Hitler was a mad man or something else. After watching both documentary and this film, I believe that he was not mad, but he was so indoctrinated with the idea of national socialism that he was able to gain strong following amongst his own people.  Such a large group did not contain bunch of mad people, it rather contained lots of people of very much misplaced ideas.  The strength of these ideas is no different of communism in East Europe that spread like fury from Russia to the entire eastern side of the continent.  The indoctrination is so overwhelming that I still cannot overcome the feeling of knowing that Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, Goebbels and Goebells' wife Magda were ready not only to kill themselves for their (lost) cause, but also sacrifice all of their six young children.  Magda Goebells beats Medea tenfold and gives a new definition to an act of matricide.  Watching film that shows final act(s) of the most important architects of Hitler's government in the last days of the WWII Berlin is very important history lesson for any person.  This film will leave you dazed long after you have watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>FIRST THOUGHTS ABOUT 'DOWNFALL': BEST FILM DEPICTING THE END OF THE THIRD REICH THAT I HAVE YET SEEN IS DONE SO WELL IT IS TRULY PAINFUL TO SEE<br /><br />DOWNFALL is NOT a film you watch to quietly pass a few pleasant hours. In Downfall, the viewer has a front-row seat and there is much here one may not wish to see or to allow children to see. Essentially, this is gritty, harsh stuff depicting the end of the most tragic and convulsive period in history. That's right, Berlin during the last week of April, 1945 and, more specifically, in and around Hitler's bunker with Adolph Hitler as the central character.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL -- DOWNFALL MAINTAINS AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRAGIC DESPERATION FOR 2.5 HOURS<br /><br />Basically, everything that is depicted in this film has been documented and is true to historic fact, so there are no real surprises to anyone that has studied the Third Reich. Nevertheless, from beginning to end, the viewer is steeped in the tragic circumstances of the soon-to-be beaten Germans. Somehow, it seems very sad and pitiful. Hitler seems like a tragic figure, while Doctor and Frau Goebbels seem like the parents from a horror movie and their sweet, cute children don't know that their parents are the monsters. There is a whole subplot involving the final disposition of the Goebbels' children that might best be skipped over for some viewers. It is all quite true, but truly gruesome.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT -- HITLER'S GERMANY IS DISINTEGRATING & WE ALL HAVE FRONT ROW SEATS<br /><br />The real question here is --- DO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IT? Put simply, this film is an honest-to-goodness downer! If you are prone to feeling blue or miserable from witnessing human misery, you will feel pretty low after this. That's because this is both very realistic and based on historic fact so that, after the film, one cannot take comfort from the knowledge that this was only a movie. The truth is that this film gets as close to the truth as any has to date, but the actual gut-wrenching experience of being in Berlin during this final curtain call for the Third Reich is beyond description. Frankly, those that survived [and so many died horribly] like Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) were put into such a state of shock that they never recovered from the experience. Having Traudl Junge's experiences incorporated into the film as a viewpoint character adds perspective and humanizes this last week of the New Germany beyond where the historic source material, provided chiefly by Joachim C. Fest, could have taken it.<br /><br />ABOUT BRUNO GANZ AS ADOLF HITLER:<br /><br />Ganz gives the best rendition of Chancellor Hitler to date. He is a surprisingly-sympathetic character who is literally being buried alive by the weight of the calamities surrounding him. He appears to be poorly served by his inner circle who are waiting around for him to come up with some brillant master stroke to save everyone's bacon. Of course, Hitler knows he can't pull a rabbit out of his hat this time, and that fact is killing him right in front of our eyes. His coping skills fail him as he turns first on his followers and then the German people as a whole. Clearly, Hilter was pretty much losing his sanity at this point and everyone seemed to simply lean all the more on him as things grew darker. Small wonder he shot himself and took poison along with his new bride [she took only poison in order to avoid tarnishing her looks, before the petrol treatment, that is.]<br /><br />PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT IS SHOWN IS HORRIBLE [ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE HORROR WAS NOT SHOWN]:<br /><br />Yes, we see children being armed and then killed defending Berlin. We see the wounded and the civilians being pushed aside like fodder and we see the death of a great culture in Berlin itself. Throughout this film, one indeed gets the impression that it is far easier to destroy than to create. We see a lot of destruction and self-destruction, such as Germans executing their own people at the very end and then killing themselves. Generals of the Army [Jodl - Keitel] were later executed anyway at Nuremburg, so perhaps they had the right idea.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz deserves an Academy Award and Alexandra Maria Lara and Julianne Kohler are true standouts. The casting and the acting in this film are first-rate and many of the characters (Joseph Goebells, in particular) bear uncanny resemblance to their true counterparts.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: RAW HISTORY -- SORRY, NO HAPPY ENDINGS HERE<br /><br />"Downfall' is a phenomenal film that uses the cold historic facts of sources like Joachim C. Fest's "Inside Hitler's Bunker" to get the story correct. It then adds the additional humanizing effect of Traudl Junge's memoirs, which are effectively inserted into the film from its first scene until its last.<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED: HITLER: THE LAST 10 DAYS, 1973, ALEC GUINNESS</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>So much more than just a canvas for Bruno Ganz Oscar caliber performance `Downfall' earns a spot on my top five favorite films of 2005.  With its wonderful direction and effortless story telling `Downfall' delivers a tragic tale we don't all too often consider.  A lot of people have balked that this plays too much a sympathetic ear when considering the final days of Hitler's life, but it's that sympathy that we have yet to feel and so it's that key difference that stands this film apart from the rest as a landmark film in my eyes.<br /><br />Powered of course by Bruno's forceful performance (complete with subtle conversation, extreme outbursts, ticks and physical transformation...I mean really the whole package) as the hated leader of the Third Reich, `Downfall' focuses on those final days as Hitler's mental state worsened and the very thought of surrender and or hostile takeover drove him to suicide.  `Downfall' to me is less like `American History X' and more like `United 93' in that we never once get the feeling like we're being coerced into believing his prejudice (was it just me or did Edward Norton's character start to make his point after a while) but more or less are just given their viewpoint, as wrong as it may be, without sugar coating or biased conversion.  Hitler is painted as Hitler, nothing more and certainly nothing less.  What I appreciated was that instead of creating this undeniably horrid man we are just given facts and interpretation is left solely to the viewer.<br /><br />`Downfall' carries with it an epic feel and serves as a brilliant biopic upon all biopics.  With acting that surpasses most nominees that year; `Downfall' was sorely overlooked come the big race but deserves your consideration now.  Don't hesitate for fear you'll be shown a film bent of `humanizing' a monster, watch it for the sheer satisfaction that not all of Hollywood is bent on giving us stereotypes and thus they are willing to `humanize' him because as we should all know there is no such thing as monsters, just human-beings gone terribly wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that the company that made this incredible film; Constantin Film; also made the excellent Resident Evil films and the not-so-great Fantastic Four movies (bleh). This war movie is absolutely fantastic and well-deserving of the many awards and critical acclaim it received.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The year is 1945, and the Russians are closing in on Germany and the Third Reich. So the main leaders of the Third Reich; Adolph Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbel along with his wife and children, and various employees and military leaders hide in a bunker to avoid capture from the Russians. The story is basically told from the point of view from Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, who was in the bunker during the last days of the war and a witness to the downfall of the Third Reich and escaping from the Russians.<br />MUSIC: There's not much unfortunately, that's what makes this movie flawed.<br />STORYLINE: This story is well told about these historical events and is beautifully and masterfully carried out.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: This film is brilliant, and near-perfection. This is one of those movies you have to have real taste for, otherwise you might get bored. It definitely isn't for kids. What makes this film all the more authentic is that the film is in German giving the already amazing feel another injection of compelling drama. This is one of the best war dramas (and dramas in general) ever made, it's compelling, the acting is great, it feels very real, and it is a masterpiece.<br />OVERALL: You're not going to find a whole lot of foreign films this great, or for that matter, great films in particular (Hollywood really sucks these days; there is virtually nothing good to speak of). Watch this movie, you owe it to your movie-loving self to watch one of the best dramas, best war movies, best foreign movies, and one of the best movies to come out in years. This is not my favorite movie, but this is one of the more better quality films I've watched in a while amid the many stinkers I've watched.<br />THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, feels authentic, it's brilliant, and it's just a flatout masterpiece.<br />THE BAD: Very little music.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Oliver Hirschbiegel's amazing film "Der Untergang" chronicles the last days of Hitler's Nazi Germany as observed through the naive eyes of his personal secretary Traudl Junge.  Junge played by Romanian born Alexandra Maria Lara was selected by Hitler in 1942 from among a group on young women to serve him against the advice of those close to her.  She remained by his side as the film fast forwards to April 1945 and the underground bunker complex under the Reichchancellery in Berlin.<br /><br />Hitler, played with frightening reality by Bruno Ganz, complete with nervous tics and explosive and frenetic verbal outbursts is still, to the end, trying to maintain a hold on the reins of his dying empire.  He is surrounded by his closest staff most of whom show blind and fanatic allegiance to him.  Cracks, however, are beginning to appear in the resolve of several of his highest ranking ministers and generals.<br /><br />In a wild spew, Ganz vows that he will never allow the Reich to surrender to the Soviet forces that are now encircling Berlin and his compound.  As the end draws closer, many of his devoted followers choose to commit suicide than to live in a world without National Socialism.  This is demonstrated quite disturbingly by Corinna Harfouch playing Magda Goebbels who coolly administers poison to her 5 sleeping children.  Then she and her husband Joseph played by Ulrich Matthes proceed to die by gunshot.<br /><br />While many of Hitler's closest minions are swallowing their guns and shooting those who they consider traitors to their hopeless cause, Eva Braun played convincingly by Juliane Kohler is partying seemingly oblivious to the tragedy unfolding around her.  Finally both she and Hitler commit suicide and even still those remaining vow to continue the fight.<br /><br />Hirschbiegel quashes feelings of sympathy for those players in this realistic drama evoked by virtue of the naivete of Junge.  She is filmed in present day saying that even though she was unaware of the atrocities committed by the Nazis, it was lax on her part to not have been more observent and tuned into their genocidal policies.<br /><br />"Der Untergang" proves to be a stark and realistic portrayal of what really happened in that bunker in the waning days of World War 2.  Director Hirschbiegel accurately captured both the fanaticism and hopelessness of that situation in his film.  My only criticism is that the film was a bit too long and better film editing might have eliminated the tendency for it to drag at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Some good history for those who haven't heard it before. Some great acting for everyone. Well worth your time. Some echoes for our time. "They gave us a mandate... "</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>I never understood why this film caused so much controversy in Germany. It was about about time that the Germans examine their own history and the most notorious leader of the 20th Century. Because the controversy surrounded the portrayal of Hitler as a real human being who could pet a dog one minute, while ordering other people's death the next; or who was kind to his secretary even while he yelled tirades against his staff of military men for their incompetence...I actually expected to see more of Hitler's "nice side." The controversy was nothing but overbloated talk, as this film clearly portrays Hitler as the monster he is. If people don't understand that humans are often contradictory and capable of showing kindness to some people while ordering massive death for complete strangers...then they really don't understand human nature. Just because one shows Hitler as a complex, contradictory human being doesn't soften his reputation. So he was kind to dogs. So he was a gentle boss to his secretary. So what? This film doesn't excuse the fact that he was still a monster of a human being.<br /><br />The actor who portays him is so uncanny in his physical likeness that I did wonder how people might act towards him after this role. The film is so compelling and disturbing to watch...for the same reason as I remain clueless as to how anyone could follow and be loyal to this man's evil vision to the very end. Perhaps the most disturbing part of all is the beautiful, elegant, upper middle class lady Magda Goebbels who decides to poison her six blue-eyed, blond-haired Aryan children because she didn't want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism. She does the deed with such cool, creepy finesse that it downright shocks the viewer just how much the Nazi movement resembles a doomsday cult, complete down to the charismatic leader.<br /><br />After watching this film, as great as it is, I didn't think I'd want to see it again. However, a few days later, I was still thinking about this film and will probably buy it on DVD at some point. It is something that should be seen by all and seen a few times. For one reason, reading subtitles throughout the film only makes me miss some of the facial expressions of the various people. I do like that we get the authenticity of a German-language movie about the last ten days of the Third Reich, but an English language track would have been nice so I could watch it in English once while I concentrate on the images and expressions that I miss when trying to read subtitles. Anyone interested in WWII history, history in general, or totalitarian systems/cults should definitely see this film. After I watched it, I wanted to watch "Schindler's List" and "Band of Brothers" again, as well as picking up my long postponed plan to read "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." This film belongs in that canon of extraordinary work, capturing the chaos of a collapsing government, a ruined nation, and a group of leaders who preferred to commit suicide than face punishment for the evil they unleashed on the world. They knew the Soviets would be harsher in retributive punishment than the Americans. An excellent lesson in history grounded in realism.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie does an excellent job of portraying the mental and physical disintegration of Hitler in the bunkers. Hitler is portrayed as having horrible views on humanity, but showing  kindness to his secretaries and his dog.<br /><br />The movie is seen through the eyes of his secretary Junge. She doesn't realise the full scope of Hitler's insanity until much later after the war.  The really scary element is the people who remain loyal to Hitler when there is no hope and Hitler is obviously insane. There are the surreal elements of the movie. The generals pinning badges on soldiers and in some cases children when the army is destroyed and only a small remnant is left. Goebel's wife kills her children rather than let them live in a world without National Socialism. Men commiting suicide with their last bullet, when their leader dies in cowardice in a bunker.<br /><br />The movie was poignant, powerful and scary. The Third Reich was not Hitler's dream alone, he was just a catalyst. Hitler was a monster, but he was still human. The movie was extremely violent and disturbing.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A very powerful movie which is as much a dramatic and entertaining movie as it a historically acurate depiction of the last 10 days of the collapse of Berlin and the downfall of Hitler and Hitler's principal advisors and Generals. The movie begins and ends with extracts from an interview with Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary). The movie was shot in St Petersburg in Russia. It's ironic that many of the German army extras were Russians. The movie was a very contentious topic in Germany at the time of its release. I shall take a short detour here to make a point. Please bear with me. In Germany Hitler is Taboo. I have myself been to Germany and to Berlin. I've taken those famous walking tours where they walk you through the streets of Berlin where the last days of the Battle for Berlin concluded into. And I have stood at the place of where Hitler's Bunker was and is still supposed to exist as ruins. But it was amazing to see that the site where Hitler's bunker is supposed to be, there are no great markings or plaques. There's just a gutter there and there are residential appartments. There is a notice which says that it is the site of the infamous bunker but if you were to pass the place, nothing apart that notice would really alert you to the fact that this was the epicenter of the world war 2 from where the orders came in the last few weeks of the war. In Germany, Mein kampf is banned. I came to know first hand when I worked in Frankfurt fror 2 years,I could not get a copy of it even in the major book stores until I came to know it's banned. The display of the swastika is banned. You'll be arrested if you display the swastika symbol. The very mention of the word Hitler is like saying Voldemort in front of the muggles in a Harry Potter film. I have had the chance to talk to my German colleagues about the holocaust and most of my colleagues were all new generation germans who express shame about the things that happened but are clear to point out that they are 2 generations apart from those monsters who were brainwashed into becomming mass murderes. They like to clearly make their point that they are not responsible for their grandfathers actions. But still the shame and the stigma can be seen in their discomfort when dealing with the subject. In German Schools they make it a point to take childeren to concentration camps to impress upon them the horrors of the Nazi regime. They take them to aushwitz and show them the bags upon bags of hair, and pictures etc. All this so that no similar blunders are made in the future. The Bunker site is not marked because of fears of it becomming a shrine for neo nazi ideology. But there is this taboo of depicting Hitler as a human being. They just picture him as a monster but not as a human being. If a nation is totally confident of not repeating its mistakes, then why dehumanize Hitler ?. Why not depict Hitler as a complete human being who has the ability to charm and look like a sane man and not this insane lunatic that we make of him through those old black and white jerky news reel which makes him looks like a mad cartoon character. But there was a lot of debate about this movie because it was seeking to remove Hitler from this image of an evil meglomanical enigma and make him into a human being. At the end of the day Hitler was just a human being. Its his ideology and his philosphical thinking that was the monster. And he had the charisma and the oratory skills to inspire a whole nation and sell a whole nation a warped racism concept based on nazism which the whole country gladly bought into. The director here has made valiant attempt to flesh out hitler and Bruno Ganz who plays hitler is the most convincing hitler to date in films largely because of the aunthenticity of the german actors and the german language spoken and also the great acting by Bruno Ganz. So this attitude of fear about this movie was totally unfounded. A nation who are firmly educating their childeren in school about the Holocaust should not have been concerned about Hitler becomming 'too human'. The more Hitler is seen as a common man and not this unspeakable monster the better will be chances that this wont happen again. Because the next possible hitler will be all too human like the last one. He is not someone with pitch-forks and fangs sticking out of his face like the director correctly points out in the inteview sections of this DVD.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz has given such authenticity to the role. Anthony Hopkins's act as Hitler cannot compare in anyway close to Bruno Ganz. There is going to be a difference between an American actor portraying Hitler verus a German one. The movie starts with Traud lunge's appointment as secretary. And then we move 2 years ahead and are into april 1945, during the last 10 days. We see Hitlers slow mental redradation OF logical thinking. We are shown his last few days of discussions with Himmler, Goring, Goebells, and other Generals. His continued denial of defeat and illogical thinking in the last few days cost Germany 1000's more lives that could have been saved. He gave orders to people to kill themselves. It shows a nation so completely hynotised by the fuhrer and his ideas that they followed his orders of suicide even after this death. Nazi officals who pulled a trigger to their head for the fuhrer. What person would kill himself after the leader himself is dead ?. We are shown Hitlers last meal and he and Eva Brown retire to their rooms to put an end to their lives. The cynanide does not work and Hitler shoots himself. We dont know for sure what happend because Hitler's bodies were burnt up. But the movie is a reconstruction based on the many accounts of the people who were there. Then we see the heartless Magda Goebells who puts her 5 childeren to sleep with a drug and then when they are asleep slips cynadide doses into their mouths. What kind of heartless mother kills her childeren ?. It really shows the depth of the infestation of the Nazi ideology. Magda is shown as saying she'd rather want her children to die rather than them live in a world where there is no national socialism which was what the Nazi ideology was called. National socialism at that time meant nazi racism, and aryan racial superiority and deemed inferiority of all others. Then Jospeh Gobells shoots Magda with her consent and then shoots himself. What madness!. What mad mad people!. Also we are shown the stark contrast between Magda Goebells and Eva Brown. Although Eva Brown is Hitler's mistress until the very end (getting married to Hitler eventually prior to their suicide), she was a totally non political person. She was this naive character who loved Hitler and did not really look like she either bought into Hitler's thinking or disagreed from his ideology. For her, she had to please hitler because she wanted to be with Hitler. Everything else was secondary. When Hitler gives the orders to kill her own brother in law, she even agrees with that decision after an argument with Hitler. But Eva Brown comes across as a very apolitical person. Compare this with Magda who was often known as the first lady of the Third Reich, Magda in contrast was the ideal Germanic Nazi women. She totally believed and pledged herself to the nazi ideology. More than her love for her husband was her love for the fuhrer and his vision to the extent she believes that a world with hitler is not a world worth living. She takes that decision not only for her but her childeren as well.<br /><br />When I see all this it is so unbelievable. We see the orgies and the parties that the German generals had during the last few days. As if resigned to death by suicide or death by Russian hands, they saw it as their last days for enjoying the material pleasures of this world and drowned themselves in alcohol and women. What a bunch of mad loonies!. Hitler gave orders to destroy all German infrastructure. His idea was if Germans cant use it,let it not be used by the enemies. But in all this we are shown how he forgot or never even cared about the civilians from the begginning. He saw Germany as a military machinary as this mile upon mile of military robots ready to lay down their lives for his vision, there were no civilans for him. The german people supported Hitler blindly not knowing they were leading themselves to their own deaths. Their Fuherer never cared for any of them, he just cared to build his Germania.He never even cared for the Lebensraum "living space" for germans. All he wanted was extended and dominant power. He craved world attention and he screwed the Germans in the process. This movie brings to us the mindless robotic attitude of the Germans. To an extent comming from personal experience I have to say that Germans are the most disciplined lot. They are a people who can work like machine and robots work. I can see how a german back them could have been influenced by Hitler because a German is like a well oiled machine. If given the right stimulus and instuction , he can work like a robot following rules and that too with unacanny efficiency.Its in the German physche. Efficiency and discipline is part of the German pscyche. It's like its hard wired into them at birth. No offense to any Germany but it is my observation. The movie is all about the destruction of the last shred of the third Reich. In the end Himmler and some other Generals try to make peace to get some concessions in their punishment.<br /><br />We are not shown the Russian plunder of Germany because that is another movie as the director correctly says in the commentary. The Russians soldiers raped 100's of thousands of German women. But some feel it was fully justified and deserved of a civilian poplulation which was as much to blame as the germany military. The army came out of those civilians who were recruited. And they were recruited because of their belief in the noble cause of Hitler. The Germans said they did not know. Thats a bunch of hogwash. Offcourse everyone knew what was going on, they just tried to ignore it, thinking that there was more good in this for the German nation as a whole than bad. But when things went wrong the people tried to portray as if they did not know a damn thing. I think more than Hitler, Germany as a nation and the german civilians back then in that climate of propoganda are the people to be indicted for this monstrous passage of history. They are to blame,to have been so naive, cold and stupid. Without the German people's support Hitler could not have moved a single pebble in Europe. Why was there no major uprising or revolt? Why did not a vast majority see the lunacy of all this ?.<br /><br />I saw the full film and then i saw the full audio commentary by the director. This movie was a historical revelation for me. It was a precious history lesson. Everything about this movie is historically acurate save for just a few characters who were fictional. The fictional parts are very small and dont detract fom the 99.99 percent accurateness of this account. A lovely movie as well as a lovely documentary on a very important historical and landmark event which shaped the rest of world history.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Though it was made in Germany, "Downfall," the story of Hitler's last 15 days on Earth, it is pure Hollywood both in execution and tone....more television special mini-series than serious work of art.<br />With that said, the central story of Hitler's last days in the bunker with Himmler, Eva Braun, Goebbels, Eva Braun and his secretary, Traudl Junge (the real Junge appeared in her own documentary, "Blind Spot" her recollection of her time with Hitler and Eva in the Bunker) and assorted others is so fascinating that it is impossible to avert your eyes from the screen.<br />Director Oliver Hirschbiegel  and his production designer fill the screen with eye-popping, though not particularly sophisticated detail: the dark, claustrophobic bunker with Hitler (a dynamic Bruno Ganz) slowly losing control of his kingdom while his army and ss officers celebrate with the best French champagne and Russian caviar that recalls Nero fiddling while Rome burned.<br />Ganz appropriately chews the scenery with his crazy, ranting portrayal of Hitler on the one hand: been there, seen that. But Hirschbiegel shows a more human, tender Hitler: his warm relationship with Eva, who he marries while in the bunker (the person officiating at the wedding asks Hitler is he is 100% Aryan...a part of the official 3rd Reich wedding ceremony...funny) before he shoots and poisons her as well as his special relationship with his German shepherd, Blondi whom he also poisons. Does this do much to humanize Hitler, arguably the most hated man of the 20th Century? Not really but it does add positive texture to a life that most of us know so very little about. "Downfall" merely and I think naively points out that we are all capable of Evil.<br />Bruno Ganz excels when he digs beneath the surface and adds the little touches that humanize Hitler. He punctuates his performance with small details: the pushing back behind his ear of his unruly, straight, pomaded hair, the twitching of his left hand, which he holds behind him so as not to appear weak or sick in front of his officers and Ganz's use of his huge, bloodhound-like eyes to reflect and divert what is going on in his incredible, insane mind.<br />"Downfall" is an interesting, diverting film: at times silly and melodramatic; at others...fascinating and enthralling. Ganz's performance makes it a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be German. To rule the world and lose that position. Hitler, little do I know, did a lot of wrong things but he did a lot of right to lead men with enough armor in their hearts to fight the world. The Russians were kept at bay. Germany alone did everything and then there was "Der Untergang" ... Stunning storyline, sometimes or better known as history. Sigh. There's so much more to learn in life than how shoes lose their souls or soles, whichever you prefer.<br /><br />I love the way the soldies, german soldiers, have an attitude of nonchalance as if nothing can possibly go wrong and they go about taking orders like they always have. So used to drudgening every possible enemy. I like that side of them. I like that side of humanity.<br /><br />Downfall is a good film. I thought it would have ended when Hitler gives away. Rather than showing what happened to individual characters, if I was the director, I'd show what happened to the world than these few character names I would forget in a hurry.<br /><br />I do not know German. I want to. Now.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Although this is a long film with English subtitles, DOWNFALL is a detailed, powerful dramatization of the last days of Adolph Hitler and his Third Reich.  Told mostly through the eyes of his secretary and other subordinates, you watch as Hitler descends further into illness and madness while his army and country are crushed by the advancing Russian and Allied forces overhead.<br /><br />I believe this film is definitely up there with PATTON and SCHINDLER'S LIST as far as great World War II films go.  It has the same authentic feel as a documentary, and the most professional look of a great dramatic film.<br /><br />This film puts you at the center of the spider's web that caused World War II, and it's even more remarkable since it's a German film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>A superior war movie. As an English speaking person, the German language spoken throughout the film added an extra intensity to the drama unfolding. I have always wanted to see a state of the art film of Hitlers last days in the bunker. Already  knowing history it is facinating to see the impending doom of the Nazi army. Bruno Ganz plays hitlerwith all his idiosyncrasies unnervingly. Observing Hitlers emotions while he realizes his demise is near plays out in an engrossing fashion. I thought the film jumped around a bit much, but considering the amount of charactors covered it seems somewhat reasonable. The scene where the children are "mercifully" killed is very disturbing. However realism is in full effect in this movie so be warned. The blending of sorrow among the SS and others mixed with the outward brutality towards life is strange. But, this is a hard edged war film of the best kind. The city of Berlins war torn streets are striking images that are well filmed. Another aspect to the movie is that it is shot through the eyes of Hitlers personel secretary who was alive as of recently and gives a pre&post film commentary. Reading the subtitles really bring you into the movie, and the dialogue is superb. The film could have been perfect save a few unnecessarily drawn out scenes. Most of the German actors really captured their rolls exceedingly well. The dvd audio is stunning. The sounds of weaponry inside and out of the bunker place you right there. The picture quality is sharp. I suggest you watch this on a high end widescreen tv with an HDMI hookup for maximum viseral impact. Like all films it's not for everyone(especially the historically and artistically stunted)but for those it's for...watch out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>I dont' feel comfortable when it comes to express an opinion about German director Oliver Hirschbiegel's DOWNFALL. I'm not German and I have the feeling that this film is mainly intended to a German audience. As for the facts described in DOWNFALL, I confess that I haven't enough studied these peculiar events to judge if the film is accurate or not. WWII and Adolf Hitler are still too close to me to let me judge with objectivity DOWNFALL. Furthermore, I'm sure that, like me, most of the reviewers here have members of their family still alive who can speak about Hitler and the horrors associated with National-Socialism.<br /><br />Now, if I consider DOWNFALL only as a cine film, such as John Wayne's ALAMO for instance in order to stay in the same film category, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film provides the kind of tension one can expect from a war movie. There are no heroes in the film, except maybe for the German people whom Hitler and his Generals are ready to sacrifice to their self-pride. And, most of all, Olivier Hirschbiegel doesn't find any excuses in the behavior of the last soldiers of the Third Reich. But, as I said before, Hitler's figure is still too close to us to let European directors shoot a Hollywood style movie about him. DOWNFALL is more than a documentary film but isn't still a mainstream movie.<br /><br />A DVD zone yesterday.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>n the annals of film, the greatest screen portrayal of an evil world leader was undoubtedly Anthony Hopkins' 1995 turn as President Richard M. Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon. Within five to ten minutes of one's first glimpse of Hopkins- a Brit who looked and sounded nothing like the 37th American President, one almost forgets what the real Nixon looked like. But, now there's a contender who could knock Hopkins off his perch- or at least give him a good fight, and that is Bruno Ganz's turn as Adolf Hitler in the 2004 Academy Award nominated Best Foreign Language Film from Germany, Downfall (Der Untergang- literally The Downfall). What makes this all the more remarkable is that- unlike Nixon, many actors have tried and failed to get into Hitler's skin, including the aforementioned Hopkins, who took on the role in The Bunker (1981). In fact, Ganz is so great at portraying Hitler- and he looks far more like the real Hitler than Hopkins did Nixon, even sans the Chaplinesque mustache and combover, that the film took much criticism for portraying Hitler as a real live human being. Heaven forfend that art contain some reality, or `truth,' as the PC Elitists claim! Ganz is brilliant- from his wild veering between depression and rages, to his jittery nervousness, and a shaking of his hands which, when held behind his body, seem to devolve almost into the claw of a wounded raptor, grasping for anything to steady his older than he looks fifty-six year old form. In fact, Ganz seems to age and literally shrink in size, as he stoops and hunches, with each succeeding scene. Yet, it's the moments of tenderness Hitler shows his fianc&eacute;e/wife, Eva Braun, his wounded indignation at perceived betrayals, and his timidity toward women, as well as impeccable manners, that really offends the PC. This ability to move a viewer is, of course, the manifestation of the great art of a great artist.<br />  Many big name critics, around the world, though, took the film to task for the most asinine of reasons. The New Yorker's David Denby, a minor thinker, wrote: `As a piece of acting, Ganz's work is not just astounding, it's actually rather moving. But I have doubts about the way his virtuosity has been put to use....We get the point: Hitler was not a supernatural being; he was common clay raised to power by the desire of his followers. But is this observation a sufficient response to what Hitler actually did?' This incredibly idiotic statement, and many other PC comments like it, about film and art in general, are the very reasons I took to writing film criticism. What response could possibly be sufficient to the genocidal crimes of a Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, or King Leopold?.... All in all, Downfall is a movie worth seeing, but it is not one that is `required viewing'- neither for its art nor its historical value. It rises and falls almost solely on Ganz's shoulders. To me, the most affecting moments within come when Hitler willfully denies the reality of his nation's G&ouml;tterdammerung, and pretends that this or that general will save the day with a brilliant maneuver, at the last moment, to cut off the Russians, and save the war effort. Anyone watching the recent change of American military leadership in Iraq is familiar with their nation's leader's utter refusal to face stubborn facts, and it's a scary scene- whether or not that leader is a mass murdering psychotic, or merely a clueless frat boy with a God complex. Yet, like many of the other `historical' facts, this intermittent self-delusion is also considered, by most historians, untrue. Hitler is known to have commented after being repulsed at Stalingrad, and also after losing The Battle Of The Bulge, that he knew that an eventual German defeat was unavoidable. These are two more wasted opportunities to core into the man, and these ill wrought fictions- be they of whole characters or scenes with real personages, are ultimately what kill the screenplay. As a side note, it's worth realizing the fact that the Second World War, despite its horrors and nonpareil bodycount, can now be thought of as the last real war `played by the rules' says much of our species.<br />  That Downfall can succeed as a film, despite some bad acting, and a weak screenplay, also says much for the notion that a single great performance, as well as a historically significant and dramatic enough moment, can overcome abundant mediocrity more easily than a work of fiction can. Bruno Ganz is now the definitive film Hitler, but the definitive portrayal of his true downfall has yet to be made. Where is Ingmar Bergman when you really need him?</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>I can't praise "Downfall" enough for it's historical accuracy and superb acting. I first saw this film in a dark theatre and constantly had the feeling of being in the bunker and actually watching Hitler and his entourage during their final days. Things I love about this film:<br /><br />BRUNO GANTZ<br /><br />"Downfall" would not be the powerful film that it is without veteran Swiss actor, Bruno Gantz. He is the first actor who managed to convince me that it really was Hitler on the screen and just not an actor mimicking Hitler. It's like the man was born to play this role and got it right in every respect--his expression, his gestures, his voice, his speech acts, his posture, really everything.<br /><br />THE LOYAL ENTOURAGE<br /><br />Powerful performances were delivered by the rest of the crew as well. As with Gantz they had me convinced. While they were merely excellent, though, Gantz was perfect.<br /><br />BERLIN<br /><br />The scenes of battlefield carnage in Berlin were completely convincing. Ironically a few blocks of St. Petersburg (Leningrad), Russia were used to film the final days of the capitol of the Third Reich.<br /><br />HISTORICAL ACCURACY<br /><br />The film was beautifully researched and unlike other WW II era films like the incredibly wretched "Pearl Harbor" was historically accurate to the point of perfection. I love it when filmmakers fall in love with their subject to the point where research and accuracy clearly becomes a labor of love for them.<br /><br />THE W FACTOR<br /><br />OK, it has to be said: many of the mad ravings of Hitler and his entourage in the last days of the bunker were eerily reminiscent of the current regime in this country. At a certain point when he hears the bombs falling all around him, a fanatical Joseph Goebels declares that everything happening is right because "the German people gave us a mandate!" Sound familiar? And faced with a military debacle of his own making, Hitler carries on as though everything is fine and going according to plan. Sound familiar? As the curtain draws around them, Hitler and his entourage remain enraptured by their ideology and fanatically resistant to any kind of objective analysis. Sound familiar? Whittled down to their last days in the bunker, their political agenda is finally exposed as nothing more than theatre. Sound familiar? And of course anyone who interprets the harsh reality around them in a different light is branded a traitor. Sound familiar?<br /><br />No, I'm not saying that W and company are mass murderers on an even remotely comparable scale (they've mass-murdered in the tens of thousands not tens of millions). But I am repeating what many educated people have already publicly observed, namely that the mindset between the fascists in that bunker and the fascists in this one is remarkably similar.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Downfall makes its point, if any, in the first half hour and then it's a laborious trawl to the finishing line. Its need to portray every suicidal shot to the head and crushed poison capsule in conscientious detail smacks of the German need for efficiency and one is minded with some irony that it is precisely this type of industrialized slaughter that got them into trouble in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This German film is an apologist's tome.  Hitler is portrayed as tottering, perhaps falling into a type of insanity.  He refuses to believe that there are no more troops, relates his failures in the war to the cowardice of the German people instead of to his own failings, seems to take pride in his lack of education compared to that of the Officer corps, and so on.  By portraying him as sick, one can say that this is not a moral lapse but a physiological one, and that is the problem here.<br /><br />Goebbels and some of the others are painted with the brush of pure evil, but the film's treatment of Hitler has no such clarity.  With his gentle treatment of his beloved dog (until the end of the movie) and his relationship to his secretary, and to the Goebbels' children, and to some others, the film is trying to emphasize a certain humanity in Hitler.  But what's the point.<br /><br />The film appeared to try to lighten the load of this conflict from the point of view of the German people.  It tried to say that Hitler was at heart a compassionate man, and when he did go off the deep end, it was his demons, not his will.  It attempts to lighten the true nature of evil, and that is just plain wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Of course, this is not the first film that features Adolf Hitler in the center -- Charlie Chaplin did it.  Or, this is not the first film that shows the last days of his empire -- Obi Wan did it (no, not Ewan, I'm talking about Alec).  But seeing the downfall of Adolf Hitler speaking in his original language is something you should never miss, especially when he is played by Bruno Ganz.<br /><br />In short, the title of 'Downfall' describes exactly what it is.  It's about the last days of Hitler and Nati, and like a big ship going down, the falling empire sucks many people deep into the dark void.  In this case, however, it's a mental one -- some try to maintain the order; some run away from reality (usual method, booze); or some just do nothing.  And Hitler?  Oh, you know his fate -- Eva Brown and lots of gasoline.<br /><br />ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS about this film is the actors' uncanny resemblance.  The chillingly realistic portrayal of Hitler is done by German-speaking Bruno Ganz (though actually he is a Swiss), whose authentic image and mannerism as Adolf will stay with you long after leaving the theater.  (One irony is that ganz is best remembered by his turn as a winged angel in 'Wings of Desire' set in the same city -- Berlin).<br /><br />Also, see the film's realistic Goebbels and Himler, and compare them with the real-life counterpart.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel (see his gripping prison thriller 'Das Experiment') surely did research.  In a sense, Goebbels and his wife (and children) offer the most unnerving scene in the film, which is, I am afraid, very painful to watch.<br /><br />Though it is obvious that Hitler plays the pivotical role in 'Downfall,' the film is in fact about everyone, soldiers or civilians, who surrounded him in the last days of the Third Reich.  The film starts with memoirs narrated by a secretary Traudi Junge hired by Hitler himself, but soon we realize that the film has multi-layered stories that concern all the people in Berlin.  And it also concerns their downfall.<br /><br />Some words about the negative reviews on political ground.  Some blames the filmmaker for ignoring the fate of Jewish people.  The fact is, it doesn't (see to the ending).  But if the film wants to spend so much time in depicting the last days of Hitler in the claustrophobic bunker, well, it is entitled to it, and any (I mean any) people who received decent education already know the pains and deaths Jewish people suffered during the WWII.<br /><br />The film is always revetting with the convincing atmosphere of the war, and is often terrifying in depicting the atrocious things done during the last days of Hitler, who is clearly losing his mind.  But more horrible thing is many people are faithful to his unreasonable orders, and as Goebbels points out at one scene, no one really forced them to do it.  They are willing to obey, and they actually did.  Perhaps after watching this film, your knowledge about Hitler will not change very much.  But the point is, the film is successful in showing him as he is -- he remains as incredibly contradictory, impossible presence throughout, not as monster, but as human.  And that's why this small man is so frightening.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>I must admit I rarely have the patience to sit thru a subtitled movie, but DOWNFALL is so well done, I did not mind and I think hearing 100% German in relation to the time period and subject helped reinforce the realism.<br /><br />Whenever a movie can make you (even for the briefest of seconds) forget you are watching a movie and really get pulled in, then it succeeds.<br /><br />Downfall does this superbly.<br /><br />On the otherhand, garbage like Hollywood's "PEARL HARBOR" from a few years back looks and "feels" like a Hollywood set and movie and you never really "believe" you are in 1945.<br /><br />With DOWNFALL you can almost get the sense you are in the bunker with Hitler and the SS during the Final Days.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Deserving of all the praise, this beautifully researched and executed film is a combination war film/docudrama that carefully and responsibly chronicles not only Hitler's final days as the Fuhrer, but the literal demise of the Third Reich as Berlin succombed to the Russian forces.<br /><br />The strengths of this marvelous, important film come not only in the detailed accuracy of its script but in the inspired detail in every department: cinematography, wardrobe, makeup, effects, sound and especially CASTING.

Truth to be told, this movie is extremely well-made, and even though it doesn't make direct reference to all the people Hitler (played by Bruno Ganz) killed, it highlights the fact that he was an extremely unbalanced person capable of doing that and much more.<br /><br />Director Oliver Hirschbiegel weaves an engaging if sometimes shocking story, based on true events, as remembered by people who lived with Hitler during his last days. One of them, Traudl Junge (played Alexandra Maria Lara), was nothing less than one of Hitler's secretaries, and as such a privileged spectator of what was happening in the bunker where Hitler and his entourage stayed. The drama of war is well depicted, as is the fanaticism of many of Hitler's followers, and the desperation of former adherents that ultimately realize that they have been following a madman.<br /><br />Those who already know at least a little about this period will recognize characters such as Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen), Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) or Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), and will also probably learn about others that played a part during those last days. On the other hand, if you don't know a thing about this period, don't let that discourage you: you can always learn, and this is a good opportunity to do so.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this film. It is long, but thoroughly engaging, and not to be missed.

Ganz plays Hitler with such realism. A person who's portayed as a monster is seen as a crazy, disfunctional human. Ganz  embodies Hitler's looks and mannerism. Downfall is a great movie, even at 150 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>Of the few WW2 films I have seen, this easily stands out as the most enthralling. The key is that it is very psychological and character grounded, which gives you a look inside the bunker as the days numbered to a close. The film's controversy is obviously bunk. Does the film portray Hitler as kind & loving to his subordinates and dog, Blondi? Of course. He was human. Mad indeed, but in portraying him as "a master of all evil" we turn him into a one-dimensional character and lose sight of the true horror that humanity is capable of. From what I have read, the film remains very faithful to the historical accounts of what was happening those final days. I also think the film had a very good positive message spoken in the end by the real Traudl Junge, herself. While the story begins with her curiousity and blindness to serve her leader, ultimately she realizes that her youth and ignorance was no excuse. All of the information was available to her and she chose to turn a blind eye to it all. This says a lot about the America we are living in today.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Downfall is easily the best of that subgenre of Bunker movies (see also Messrs Guinness and Hopkins), but it still doesn't quite work as well as it should. There are fine performances all round from the strong cast (particularly Juliane Kohler's Eva Braun, part mother hen, part best friend, part party girl, part loyal frau), a good script and strong direction, but something always seemed to be missing.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the way it tones down the material a lot. Of course, this was an extremely risky picture and it's understandable that some characters are whitewashed (such as the 'good' doctor whose real role was much more ambiguous) in an effort to give the audience some human focus to identify with. But the sheer savagery of the fall of Berlin was not really there: the death squads killing civilians were shown in passing (albeit not nearly as prominently as they were in reality), but the understandable barbarity of the Russian troops was very much glossed over (Anthony Beevor's Berlin - The Downfall 1945 - sadly not one of the sources for the film despite the title - gives an excellent account of this). An artistic case can be made for this - the film does make clear that, mad as Hitler and his cohorts were, the civilian population were indeed equally responsible and by focusing on the German characters this is made implicit - but by downplaying the Russians so much, it reduces the almost Biblical scale of sheer horror that they finally reaped. Of course, whether such a film would have been as successful is debatable, and it could have been open to cries of foul for blackening the Russians along with the Nazis, but the film veers too much to good taste in a subject matter where good taste and delicate sensibilities had no place. That's why ultimately it's a fine film with a few great moments rather than a truly great one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>Simply put, one finds out a lot about people when the chips are down.  As it becomes apparent to everyone that not only are the best days of the Nazis behind them, but the coming end of the 1000-Year Reich can be counted in days rather than years, the assorted characters exhibit as wide a range of responses as is possible.<br /><br />Amost the entire cast of characters is portrayed.  The sycophantic Himmler pledges eternal loyalty & immediately attempts to cut a self-preserving deal with the allies.  Meanwhile, an equally sycophantic Albert Speer comes to the realization that, at long long last, enough is enough --- and defies Hitler's order to consign the German people to certain destruction.  Some subordinates realize, too late, that they have been following a false idol.  Others, like Magda Goebbels, never give up the faith & pursue their devotion to Hitler & National Socialism to its horrifying conclusion.  The generals, comprised at this point almost entirely of toadying yes-men, know that Hitler is ordering the movement of phantom armies & is totally divorced from the reality of the war, but their fundamental spinelessness prevents them, even when it is clear that all is lost, from telling their boss that he has no idea what he is doing.<br /><br />Other characters display flashes of humanity.  Some detractors have seen this, along with the portrayal of Hitler's warmer side with close associates, as evidence of a sort of German apologism, but it is only honest filmmaking.  Nobody is a one-dimensional cartoon figure, and even the worst of human beings have their good moments, despite their normally wretched personalities.  In some cases, the dire straits of Berlin's collapse result in some normally vile individuals displaying compassionate behavior because it truly is what the situation must call for.  By contrast, some people (and Magda Goebbels surely must come to mind here in probably the most heart-rending scene in the film) make the most sickening choices possible.<br /><br />What struck me most about this film was the study & portrayal of disintegration.  As Germany collapsed, Hitler's own mind & spirit rapidly unravel.  As Hitler collapses, his subordinates, who by following Hitler abdicated their responsibilities as members of the human race, are forced to make individual reckonings with their deeds and the disintegration of the artificial worlds they have created.  Collapse begets collapse.<br /><br />One will not easily lose the impact of this film.  It is often difficult to watch, but definitely worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>Seeing/hearing a movie such as this in the German language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic.<br /><br />Furthermore the actors who play the key roles, especially Hitler, but also Goebbels, Speer, Himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie.<br /><br />What sets the film apart from other WWII/Hitler films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings -- NOT stereotypical Hollywood caricatures.  What makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine.  Furthermore the the director avoids melodrama.  The events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of Berlin.<br /><br />As good as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan were, this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and over-acted.<br /><br />This is a milestone in WWII genre of film-making.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is an exceptional film that offers a very realistic view of the mental character of Adolph Hitler in the final 10 days of World War II. There were three basic plot lines that the writers and director developed; the collapse of the city of Berlin, the mental breakdown and suicide of Adolph Hitler, and the poisoning of the Goebbels children by their mother Magda.<br /><br />It is the invasion, destruction and collapse of Berlin that remains the constant background to all of the action in the bunker. We see step by step the advancement of the Russians, the despair of the Berlin citizens, and the vigilante groups killing suspected collaborators and deserters. I found the German generals, soldiers, physicians, to be portraits of ordinary and brave humans who are contrasted against the insanity of Hitler. Hitler's belief system would never allow him to take responsibilities for any of his mistakes or actions, but to always project paranoia and blame outward. He repeatedly made decisions that cost thousands of civilian and military lives because he saw the people and military of Germany had betrayed him by losing the war and must now be wiped out. As Hitler's empire crumbles he congratulates himself for at least almost exterminating the Jews of Western Europe.<br /><br />Magda Goebbels thought that the world would not be a fit place to live if National Socialism was extinquished and thus she kills her beautiful children in the bunker. This part of the movie is so creepy that it almost detracts from the fantastic battles in the streets of Berlin and the outrageous outbursts of temper from Hitler to his staff and generals. Magda Goebbels competes for craziness with Hitler in the film - which may be the films one flaw.<br /><br />Albert Speer is played superbly by an actor that strongly resembles Speer. Speer's last scene with Hitler is so telling as Speer admits to Hitler that he has not been destroying Germany's industrial and transportation infrastructure as Hitler ordered because he knew the German people would need such a system to emerge from the rubble. Hitler would have killed Speer if he had known this. Speer offers his hand to Hitler, but Hitler refuses to shake it or look at Speer again.<br /><br />The story is presented through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, who was present during the entire last 10 days in the bunker. Thankfully she survived and was able to tell the details of all the final pathology in Hitler's last days. This film is a classic already.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I was not sure what to think of the hype surrounding this film, but, after seeing it, I realize that the buzz was completely legitimate. We often hear the phrase, "history reenacted," but so often it means "history embellished." That is not the case here as it seemed quite in keeping with the events Anthony Beevor outlined in his historical masterpiece, Berlin: The Downfall. It was as if he redrafted his text with actors rather than words. Speaking of actors, what can you say about Bruno Ganz? Best ever? He certainly surpasses the efforts of Sir Alec Guinness in The Last Ten Days. I'd put this performance right up there with Daniel Day Lewis's in Gangs of New York. I was not prepared for the way his Hitler in the bunker perfectly embodied the Hitler in the bunker I've been reading about for thirty years. The casting was absolutely unbelievable. With Speer, the director's decision was immaculate. That is the Albert Speer of the Nuremberg Trials. If you're a student of history, you'll see that the likenesses and mannerisms of General Jodl and Field Marshall Keitel allow one to instantaneously identify them. Eva Braun looks like the genuine article, but, when personality is figured in, it is as if she were crafted from an A.J.P. Taylor footnote. The only thing that struck me as being unbelievable was Goebbels' comment about how "the German people will have their little necks snapped." Goebbels was a tremendously evil man of whom nothing good can be said, but I do not think that he would have, or did say, such a thing. The lack of compassion of Der Fuhrer for the German citizenry is well documented, however, as two scenes with Speer make allusion to the infamous Nero orders. The great messiah of Deutschland was never much interested in his subjects--except for how they would allow him to be viewed by history. Hitler's mental illness is graphically evident in The Downfall, and that is yet another testament to its excellence. You could give me several days, but I could not find much to criticize about this movie. Even the title shines as it isn't about the bunker or the last days; it's a haunted requiem for the nefarious Third Reich. A state scheduled to last for a 1,000 years, but kaput by year 12. This downfall is as vivid, realistic, and worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Downfall impressed me greatly on a number of different levels.  It can't be easy to make a movie showing your country's destruction and acknowledging the atrocities your own countrymen committed.  The fact that Germany won't allow publication or importing of Mein Kampf even as an historical document has always suggested to me a national desire to just pretend the events of the past never happened.  For obvious reasons, I was exceedingly interested in watching this film.  How would Hitler be portrayed?  Would there be any mention of the Holocaust?  I had these and many other questions.  All those questions were answered with a surprisingly nuanced film of great complexity and depth.<br /><br />Downfall chronicles not only Hitler's last days inside the bunker but the immediate aftermath of his death and Germany's surrender.  To a significant degree, that story is reflected through the eyes of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's personal secretaries.  Video clips of an interview with the elderly Junge from Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary (2002) frame the presentation (ringing rather hollow, if you ask me - but that's really neither here nor there).  In the claustrophobic confines of Hitler's bunker, we witness the final days of the already broken Fuhrer, the individual dramas of those in Hitler's inner circle as they wrestle with the decision to leave or stay, and the total destruction of German society along with National Socialism.<br /><br />The treatment of Hitler is, to my mind, exceedingly well done.  Hitler was a much more complicated man than many give him credit for.  His personal demons came to consume him, but there was a human side to the man, as well - and this film brings that out in a very nuanced way.  This is not to say that Downfall makes of Hitler a sympathetic character - not in the slightest.  His hate and venom are never far from the forefront, but this actually stands to reinforce his exceedingly human weaknesses.  His mood swings are severe, especially as the end draws near - and he's not always rational.  Betrayal drives him into a fury, especially the ultimate betrayal by Himmler.  Yet he remains lucid enough to plan his death in an effort to keep his remains out of the hands of the Russians.<br /><br />Almost as fascinating as Hitler himself, in both history as well as this film, are the Goebbels.  Joseph Goebbels himself remained loyal to the very end, and it can be said that his wife Magda was even more dedicated to Hitler and National Socialism than he was.  She, after all, killed all six of her children rather than let them grow up in a world without National Socialism - and that scene proves to be the most riveting of the entire film.  Eva Braun is an almost extraordinary character in the film; maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think the filmmakers gave an accurate picture of her at all.<br /><br />Then there are the military leaders who watch Hitler give orders their decimated armies cannot possibly follow.  Loyalty is a powerful force in these men's lives - but their loyalty is to Germany rather than Hitler himself.  For this reason, they are the ones asking Hitler to spare the German people and to think about ending the war.  For some, though, the distaste of Germany's surrender from World War I overrides everything else in their determination to fight to the death - and I think that was a most telling point for the film to make.  The only real problem I had with the film was the fact that I was hard pressed to identify several of the most prominent characters.  All of the actors were made to resemble the men they played, but - even though I'm familiar with most of the historical figures - I really couldn't figure out the identities of several characters over the course of the film.<br /><br />You may be wondering if the film actually shows Hitler's suicide on the screen - I wondered that myself.  Unfortunately, I'm not going to tell you how the scene plays out.  You will find a significant number of fairly graphic scenes in the film, though.  It truly is a realistic presentation of Germany's darkest days, with the increasingly devastating destruction of Berlin going hand in hand with the physical and mental breakdown of the man ultimately responsible for it all.  Honestly, I never expected any German filmmaker to produce such an honest, complex, awe-inspiring motion picture about their most infamous national leader.  Downfall is a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I found "Downfall" as both a very troubling yet very satisfying film.  Troubling in so far as the events of the final collapse of Berlin were simply so awful; satisfying in that the depiction of events seemed plausible without ever glorifying war.<br /><br />Let there be no doubt that Adolf Hitler was one of history's greatest monsters.  He catapulted Germany and much of Europe back into the middle ages as he pursued his warped ambitions.  However, it must be said that Hitler was a real person in that he had many emotions common with all people.  "Downfall" shows some of these emotions although it never seeks to excuse Hitler and his barbarous henchmen.<br /><br />In many ways, the end of the First World War was ambiguous.  Yes, Germany lost but it was never totally smashed.  An armistice was signed and reparations ultimately crippled the German economy but the country was never totally beaten.  Hitler played on this fact and the emotions it brought out in the German people.  He was a master manipulator.  The inevitable end product proved to be total annihilation of the Third Reich as Hitler cowered in his bunker.  The Red Army was literally only a few hundred metres away before he ended his life.<br /><br />Bruno Granz portrayal of Hitler is phenomenal.  Here we see all the madness and paranoia brought to the screen in vivid detail.  Granz is worthy of an Academy Award.  But along with Hitler comes all his loopy followers.  None of these is more chilling than Goebbels and his fanatic wife.  Evil is truly at work in these two.<br /><br />See this film.  Yes, it is frightening but it is also one of the best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>The actor behind Hitler is incredible, so believable! One of the greatest "War"-movies ever made, and the fact that it is german only makes it more interesting.<br /><br />I had seen interviews with the old lady (I have forgotten her name) who worked as Hitlers' "desk-girl", and recognized a lot of what happened in the movie from what she told the interviewer. The story and filming is so realistic, and the fact that most of the events taking place in Der Untergang really happened, well, it takes your breath away.<br /><br />It's fantastic, frightening while it gives a documentary-feel. A movie everyone should see...</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I have read "The Last 100 Days", "The Last Battle", as well as other accounts of the last days of Hitler.  I had watched a couple of cinematic accounts of those final days and I generally came away with the sense that the films were excessive.  Admittedly, it's hard to be excessive about this subject but too many accounts seemed to want to shock rather than inform.  As numbing as "Downfall" is, I was most impressed by how comprehensive its' account seemed to be.  This was largely due, I felt, to the focus on such a wide range of individuals.  Certainly Hitler is the primary focal point but this isn't a movie that's just about him and his thugs.  There are real people trying to do a real job while surrounded by insanity and that aspect really drew me into "Downfall".  I have tried to understand what the collapse of Nazi Germany must have been like.  This movie gave me a sense of that Armageddon<br /><br />This film runs about 2 1/2 hours but I never got the sense that it is a lengthy film.  I was engrossed throughout while simultaneously overwhelmed by a sense of shock at the scope of everything.  Frankly, I was surprized I had not previously heard about "Downfall".  It isn't for every audience but it struck me as being in a class by itself.  Only Germany could produce such an outstanding film on this subject.</p></br></body></html>

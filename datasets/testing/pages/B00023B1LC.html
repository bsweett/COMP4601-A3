I had this weird and stupid bias against Matt Damon for whatever reason I can't even remember now, but that's in the past. Once I got wise, though, my very first viewing of this film (as well as the rest of the trilogy) came in the form of their BD releases. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised, especially for this being the first of three parts in an overall story. The film begins with the discovery of a man in the ocean by a group of fishermen; a man with two bullet holes in his back, a Swiss bank account number in his hip, and no memory of who he is. He can fluently speak foreign languages and is apparently a master in firearms and fisticuffs, but still can't remember his name or how he ended up where he did. In reaching the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport. The name inside: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Also in the box are multiple other passports, all with the same picture, but different names. And so, Bourne embarks on a journey to find out who he really is, meeting a gypsy woman named Marie (Franka Potente), in which they face assassins and conspiracy coverups with only each other to depend on. For me, this movie not only re-defined the spy-thriller genre (James Bond should thank this franchise because I think his recent incarnation was really influenced by it), but it made me a huge fan of Matt Damon. It's a gritty, more realistic, and down-to-earth depiction that relies less on flash and pizazz and tells a very humanistic story. If I were to break it down, I would say the appeal comes from about a third in the writing, a third in the acting, and a third in the score. The writing succeeds a lot in terms of subtlety; it doesn't explain a whole lot, but leaves enough for the audience to understand and empathize Bourne without ever getting ahead of him. This, in turn, is brilliantly performed by Damon who's portrayal is just as subtle as the writing; he's cool, calm, and collected, yet carries a certain degree of violence and ferocity when his training kicks in. And then there's the music; John Powell creates a very engaging score with three particularly crucial elements that, in my opinion, really drive the film: Bourne's main theme (which adds a sense of mystery and intrigue), a lot of percussion pieces (which sound great for action sequences), and the trademark whirring effect (that foreshadows Bourne's time to kick ass). The Bourne Identity is a very well-made spy-thriller that, as director Doug Liman puts it, "is made with a lot of European sensibilities," making this a very refreshing take for the time it was made. Not only does it provide the mystery and action of a spy movie, but the additional cerebral aspect makes it that much more enjoyable. And it only gets better in the sequels.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />The Bourne franchise makes its first entry onto high definition with a pretty good transfer. I say "pretty good," which may seem a bit generous considering a couple of gripes I have with it, but all in all, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. Let's start with the good. General detail and sharpness look great, capturing some excellent scenic shots, revealing a decent amount of line delineation between clothes and objects, and showing some of the finer features on peoples' faces and hair during closeup shots. Colors are vivid, albeit slightly de-saturated, with lots of reds and orange being at the forefront of the spectrum. The red bank bag that Bourne wears around the beginning of the film tends to especially stand out, along with the occasional random red object in the background. The jacket he also wears in the beginning and the one big explosion that the movie has literally explodes orange when it does happen. Skin tones are very lifelike with great variation from person to person and reflect accordingly depending on the lighting of the scene. Black levels aren't super-deep, but do enough to help accentuate the intrigue during darker scenes or nighttime shots. The film also supports a nice, light layer of grain and never gets in the way. The two bad things? Contrast and damage. Contrast is generally a tad on the low side giving the movie a kind of murky look with even daytime shots looking a little on the dim side. The detail is still good enough, but compared to other movies I've seen with low contrast that still manage to have a pristine picture, this one doesn't really hold up. Throughout the course of the movie, there are also various instances of dirt and even one or two moments where scratches from print damage popped up for a split second. They're not terribly obvious, but they are noticeable. In the end, though, Oliver Wood's photography looks great and really helps to maintain a very earthy, yet exotic look to the cityscapes, indoor sets, and wider-viewed shots. My favorite parts to look at are the snowy streets of Zurich for it's variation in color around the city, the shootout at the farmhouse for its detail, and the nighttime shots around the end of the movie for the blacks.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />While the video portion of this disc isn't quite perfect, the audio comes much closer. As I mentioned about the music being an integral part of the film, interestingly enough, the movie opens with the Universal credits, but doesn't play the Universal theme. Instead, it's starts out silent and fades into the sound effects, then into the main title theme of Bourne. General immersion is excellent with the score having a pulse of its own through a lot of the drumming beats and tense string pieces. And then, of course, there's that trademark whirring effect, which when played, really enhances the mood of whatever is acting out on screen. Directionality and separation dominate the sound field when action sequences take precedent, though dialogue thankfully remains clear regardless of how loud a crash, gunshot, or broken window gets. In particular, I was very pleased with how well-isolated the effects were in the scene where Bourne is fending off the first Treadstone assassin. When the guy breaks in, it was completely quiet beforehand, and then all hell broke loose. But even then, when Bourne and Marie are being pursued by the French police, the car chase sequence does a bit of the opposite by having a very lively mix of automotive chaos and snazzy Euro-techno that almost felt like a scene out of The Transporter. I would say this scene utilizes the rear speakers best with some very aggressive effects as some of the cars come buzzing around tight corners and others start crashing into one another. And then towards the end of the film when Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character, we get a great example of the middle road. It's isolated enough like the first assassination attempt when Bourne blows up a tanker providing some real pounding LFEs, but then it also feels very immersive when he fires another shot and the birds in the field start flying around. To sum it up, The Bourne Identity has a great sound design and mix. The actual sound quality has a lot of depth to it, with both the high and low ends displaying great dynamic range. As a whole, it's not quite reference material, but I would liken that more to the nature of the film itself having a lot of quieter moments. But rest assured, though, that the sequels will definitely fix that right up.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)<br />This is a very informative track with a wealth of information that covers a wide variety of aspects from the writing, casting, filming, set designs, editing, scoring; you name it. Essentially, what I found most interesting were the comments Liman had about the heart of the story and its presentation; namely, how he wanted to bring a sense of grit and realism to the spy-thriller genre, making it a drama, first, and an action film, second. He goes into great detail about the depiction of Bourne and how he and Damon collaborated to make the character feel subtle and empathetic, yet strong and determined throughout the circumstances of the story. In fact, Liman really stressed the parallels between the Kali fighting style that Bourne uses and how its core philosophy of energy conservation and quick, brutal efficiency ties into Bourne's overall demeanor. He later goes on to talk about character motivations and how Damon and Potente did particularly good jobs at humanizing the character of Bourne in such a way that, I feel, had a gradual impact on the look and feel of other modern spy-thrillers succeeding this one (here's looking at you, Bond). Oddly enough, there were a few very large dead spots, but for the most part, when Liman talks, he really lets loose.<br /><br />- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)<br />Tells us a little bit about the famed author of the series, Robert Ludlum, namely, things like: how he made the transition from theater actor to novelist, how he tied those theater experiences into his writing, how a lot of the locales he came up with were inspired by post WWII-Europe, how he saw conspiracy in authority, and finally how he came to adopt the trend of 3-word titles for all of his works ("The [whatever] [whatever]").<br /><br />- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)<br />Talks about the origin of Bourne's name, Ludlum's personality in general and how it was reflected through the character of Bourne, some of the differences between the movie and novel (such as the omission of Carlos the Jackal), how The Bourne Identity boosted his status as an author, and then the eventual progression that was a result from Identity's success.<br /><br />- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)<br />This piece covers a pretty huge chunk of Jason Bourne's story arc between the first and second movie. If you've seen all the films by this point, then it's an excellent breakdown of the character, his motivations, and the themes they wrote into the plot. If by some chance this is your first time seeing Identity, do no watch this feature, as it will contain some major spoilers for Supremacy.<br /><br />- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)<br />Starts with a brief introduction by the 3 guys listed below and mentions how the movie had to be adjusted after the events of 9/11 for the sake of changed sensibilites. They were concerned about the "datedness" of the subject material and how it would make audiences react. The alternate opening basically would have turned the whole movie into a flashback and tying up in present day at the end. They say they were pretty happy with the ending you see in the final cut (and so am I).<br /><br />- Introduction with Producer Frank Marshall, Co-Writer Tony Gilroy, and Actor Brian Cox (3:33)<br />- Alternate Opening (2:16)<br />- Alternate Ending (4:56)<br /><br />-Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)<br />Listed below are the individual scenes:<br /><br />- Wombosi on the Private Jet (0:59)<br />- Bourne and Marie by the Side of the Road (2:29)<br />- Psychologist Discusses Bourne (1:46)<br />- Bourne and Marie Practice on Subway (1:42)<br /><br />- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)<br />Liman actually makes a quick reference to this in the commentary. He said this scene was left in the European version of the film, but then went on to say it was cut from the American version for "timing reasons." As if 58 seconds really makes that big of a difference in theater showings per day...<br /><br />- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)<br />A pretty generic EPK-style feature that tells you how Bourne is different from your average spy-thrill title. It has very badly-edited interviews that are short and whose sporadic nature doesn't really tell you much at all. I recommend you avoid this if you're looking for actual depth and quality.<br /><br />- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)<br />Mostly recycled information talking about Ludlum's transition from theater to writing. It offers a little more retrospect after the fact, but it's too short and not much more than you can hear about in the other features above.<br /><br />- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)<br />Talks about the essence of Bourne and how the movies had to be adapted for modern times, as opposed to the Cold War mentality they originally had when it started in the '80s.<br /><br />- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)<br />Some interviews with Damon and Potente about the characters they play, how they interpreted their motivations, and the transition they had to make when filming Supremacy. Damon said that Bourne's actions are what he feels develops the character, while Potente praises how non-clich&eacute; her character was and how the chemistry between Bourne and Marie is sporadic throughout the relationship.<br /><br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)<br />Talks about the actual medical condition of the amnesia Bourne suffers in the plot. The psychologist basically says that Bourne suffers from Selective Dissociative Amnesia, but retains a Kinesthetic Memory of how to perform all of his trained skills. He also goes on to point out that the presence of Marie's character was a big help in portraying memory recovery.<br /><br />- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)<br />An interview with an officer of the CIA who talks about the overt and covert operations they actually do perform and how accurate the depiction of Bourne and all the training technicalities were.<br /><br />- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)<br />Shows how the choreography was staged with stunt coordinator Nick Powell.<br /><br />- Moby "Extreme Ways" Music Video (SD; 3:38)<br />A music video to the ending credits song.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />There are 3 different interactive applications you can play along with the film:<br /><br />- Treadstone Files<br />A kind of gimmicky computerization that simulates certain parts of the movie to feel like you're looking through a high-tech dossier. It shows a bunch of trivial factoids and statistics about the characters, the locations, Treadstone, and all kinds of other information.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />PiP that plays like Warner Bros.' Maximum Movie Mode where the current scene and an older scene that may or may not contain interviews will split into 2 individual screens of their own and essentially rehash important plot points.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />A true PiP application that opens up a little box in the corner of the screen with additional interviews not seen in the special features. Altogether, it equates to about 25 minutes and is divided into 8 chapters of the scene selection. Some of the material covered includes: the action and how Damon wanted to do his own stunts, filming in Paris, Liman casting Damon as Bourne and what it was like working with him, the relationship between Bourne and Marie, a more in-depth analysis of Marie's character, and a short look at the other Treadstone agents through an interview with Clive Owen. It's a little disappointing there aren't more interviews, but it's pretty well-worth the information.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />For the starter of the bunch, The Bourne Identity is a very entertaining refresher into, what was then, a faltering spy-thriller genre. This Blu-ray disc looks pretty good with only a couple of minor problems, the sound is fantastic considering there's more drama than action, and the special features are very informative. It's a shame Ludlum never got to see this, but the people that knew and vouched for him are pretty happy with the way it turned out. The Bourne franchise has certainly changed the genre (just look at how Daniel Craig's Bond movies have shaped up) and for the better. If you haven't seen this yet, definitely pick it up, then wait to be amazed by its sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I bought this as part of the Blu Ray Trilogy package and must admit that I didn't get it from Amazon as my local Frys jumbo store had the entire trilogy on sale for 19.99 and I couldn't resist upgrading my original Bourne DVDs for the Blu Ray versions.  And what an update it is.  I felt as if I were watching it for the first time.  Rather than a boring synopsis of the plot, let's focus on the Blu Ray's quality.  The video in its 1080p with a 2.35:1 pull down does leave letterboxes bars top and bottom which doesn't bother me in the least.  Colors are clear and crisp and, most important, clean. In my opinion the video transfer is really quite good and saw not one problem with it.  The DTS-HD Audio, however, stands out as being just excellent with wide use of all the surrounds for very discreet channel usage.  Often, and especially for the rear channels, the audio on discs is more akin to the older Dolby Digital mixes where the left and right rears really produced the same audio. Not on the Bourne Identity sound mix.  Each channel was fed its own discreet audio which really made the movie more immersive for the viewer.  A fine workout is called for the sub channel as well.<br /><br />Being the first film of the trilogy, I didn't expect much from this older film but I was very wrong as both video and audio quality was superb.<br />In addition, there are no filler previews for other films or completely unnecessary extras.  And there are a ton of pertinent extras to choose from.  The alternate beginnings and endings were unfinished in post production and, therefore, their color grading and final post production results were never realized as you can see the blowout whites and artifacting in these two extra clips but they are interesting and pertinent to watch.  The other deleted scenes could all have been included in the movie as an extended version as they did not seem to me to be pointless scenes, yet their non inclusion doesn't affect the movie that is here.<br /><br />Other additional features are an interesting interview with Robert Ludlum and go back to how he got started as a writer as well as an interview with the screenwriter.  From a previous DvD release, a behind the scenes feature on some of the most captivating fight scenes you will see in any movie and how it was choreographed as well as a great many more relevant extras to boot.<br />I strongly recommend Bourne Identity as an update to your collection.<br /><br />post script.  Just noticed that the plastic cover  is stamped on the back 'Made in Mexico'.  I have no idea whether that is relevant or not but, as I said, this is an excellent blu ray dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>An interesting spy experience that unfolds just in time for the viewer to follow.

To give you a brief idea of the storyline- a man wakes up in the ocean (Matt Damon's character) has absolutely NO idea where he is, realizes he doesn't remember anything from the past two weeks prior to the incident, meets an attractive young woman while in the city, and they both spend the entire time running from the police around Germany and France.<br /><br />While it's a pretty easy plotline to follow, it unfortunately does contain some unsatisfyingly dry and quiet moments that feel really tacked on and unnecessary, dragging the overall score down a few notches.<br /><br />Also, I was never really sure whether Damon's character had superhero strengths, or whether these devastating moves of his were just your typical far-fetched action segments on the part of the Hollywood directors.  I'm not necessarily complaining about it- just wondering if those power moves he was delivering to the bad guys had an explanation of some sorts, or were we not supposed to acknowledge Damon's amazing power?<br /><br />Lots of shooting, fighting, and yes, even some romance scenes take up a good portion of The Bourn Identity.  Not a bad film however.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.0<br /><br />When this movie initially came out, I was very reluctant to see it.

He also goes on to point out that the presence of Marie's character was a big help in portraying memory recovery.<br /><br />- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)<br />An interview with an officer of the CIA who talks about the overt and covert operations they actually do perform and how accurate the depiction of Bourne and all the training technicalities were.<br /><br />- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)<br />Shows how the choreography was staged with stunt coordinator Nick Powell.<br /><br />- Moby "Extreme Ways" Music Video (SD; 3:38)<br />A music video to the ending credits song.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />There are 3 different interactive applications you can play along with the film:<br /><br />- Treadstone Files<br />A kind of gimmicky computerization that simulates certain parts of the movie to feel like you're looking through a high-tech dossier. It shows a bunch of trivial factoids and statistics about the characters, the locations, Treadstone, and all kinds of other information.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />PiP that plays like Warner Bros.' Maximum Movie Mode where the current scene and an older scene that may or may not contain interviews will split into 2 individual screens of their own and essentially rehash important plot points.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />A true PiP application that opens up a little box in the corner of the screen with additional interviews not seen in the special features. Altogether, it equates to about 25 minutes and is divided into 8 chapters of the scene selection. Some of the material covered includes: the action and how Damon wanted to do his own stunts, filming in Paris, Liman casting Damon as Bourne and what it was like working with him, the relationship between Bourne and Marie, a more in-depth analysis of Marie's character, and a short look at the other Treadstone agents through an interview with Clive Owen. It's a little disappointing there aren't more interviews, but it's pretty well-worth the information.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />For the starter of the bunch, The Bourne Identity is a very entertaining refresher into, what was then, a faltering spy-thriller genre. This Blu-ray disc looks pretty good with only a couple of minor problems, the sound is fantastic considering there's more drama than action, and the special features are very informative. It's a shame Ludlum never got to see this, but the people that knew and vouched for him are pretty happy with the way it turned out. The Bourne franchise has certainly changed the genre (just look at how Daniel Craig's Bond movies have shaped up) and for the better. If you haven't seen this yet, definitely pick it up, then wait to be amazed by its sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A fine bit of spy-thriller and skillful action movie. This action thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. It has some of the most awesome chase scenes.

You know THE BOURNE IDENTITY and subsequent sequels are so bad. The Bourne movies are so bad they got James Bond to change almost everything about himself except his name. And James Bond probably didn't change his name because he at least has the same initials as Jason Bourne. Seriously they knocked it out of the park with the Bourne films. Don't know which is 'the best' one. Hard to say. Nobody's better than Paul Greengrass (director of the sequels) at doin the realer than real life thing, but Bourne Identity is the first and has the most engrossing story to tell. And 'Shaky cam' is cool, but in much smaller doses than are invariably used. They go over board with the shaky cam. But not here. All that goes overboard is Bourne as he gets shot up and falls off a boat, floats in the sea to be rescued by Italian fishermen, and then goes on a balls-out --- kicken mission to find out who in the world he is. On the way, goes all over cinematic Europe, picks up a pretty German girl, outwits everybody and their mother, and puts on the ground all that get in his way including other elite assassin agents from his own unit. You very quickly understand this dude is like the ultimate bad ---. But here's the kicker -he feels bad about it. This 'action thriller' adventure hero -or make that anti-hero?- has a conscience. Interesting. He actually thinks that it's wrong to kill people as a tool of the government. The Bourne movies are all a step up in action/spy thriller film making. They showed how to do it well and do it intelligently.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have not read the book, but reviewing this as a movie on it's own, it's quite good and much better than the usual action fare! Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne like a robotic killing machine. Fast paced, engrossing with an intelligent script, this film leaves you wanting more!......and more ye shall get with installments 2 and 3! The DVD has a great transfer and the extended edition is nothing more than a small scene added to the beginning and end of the film. Fortunately the theatrical release is intact.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />This movie is loosely based on the 1980 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).<br /><br />Do you like action-packed mystery-thrillers?  If you do, then this movie is a must-see.<br /><br />The viewer along with the main character in this movie, later revealed to be Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), suffers from amnesia, not knowing his own identity (thus the movie's title) or anything about his past.  As the movie progresses, both the viewer and Bourne discover one major thing: he posses a lethal survival skill-set that's light years above that of the average Joe.  The other things Bourne discovers about himself make him unhappy with him, at one point saying:<br /><br />"Everything I find out [about myself], I want to forget."<br /><br />Once the viewer discovers that the premise of this entire movie is about discovering identity, then it can only hold the viewer's attention in one way: through action.  It is on this that the movie delivers especially with respect to incredible fight sequences.  One character summarizes the majority of the movie when he says that Bourne leaves a<br /><br />"trail of collateral damage from Zurich to Paris."<br /><br />It is at the movie's end that all is revealed.<br /><br />Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  If not for his fine performance, I think this movie would have probably been a flop.  I also found that the background music and sometimes gritty photography to be impressive.<br /><br />This movie spawned two sequels: "The Bourne Supremacy" (2004) and "The Bourne Ultimatum" (2007).<br /><br />The only problem with this movie is that the idea of Bourne constantly trying to discover his identity can become tedious.  True, the action sequences attempt to take away from this tedium but I found myself getting a bit restless as the movie proceeded.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie introduces us to a new action hero and his name is Jason Bourne!!<br /><br />(2002;  1 hr 50 min (excluding end credits);  wide screen;  20 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a solid suspense-spy film with an agent-on-the-run scenario. People who like a paranoid theme, where everyone is after you (I plead guilty) will love this.<br /><br />The amount of violence in here was just about right, not too much and not too little. I also enjoyed the Paris scenery, both the street-level shots and the aerial photography. Ovrall, the cinematography is very good in this film. It's an involving story that once you're hooked, you stay that way. The two hours go by pretty quickly.<br /><br />On the negative side, I get tired of American filmmakers trashing their own government all the time, in here its them trying to kill one of their own agents. I hear the third movie is really bad in that regard. I'm sorry to hear that as I liked the sequel ("The Bourne Supremacy") even better, although part of the reason was that I was now familiar with the main characters after watching this film. Anyway, I highly recommend the first two Bourne movies for fans of suspense, crime, intrigue, good locales, etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>In my excitement to see the newly released Bourne Ultimatum, I decided to again watch the Bourne Identity, released in 2002.  The Bourne Identity features the story by Robert Ludlum with Matt Damon as the amnesia addled Jason Bourne.  Directed by Doug Liman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04FG">Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)</a>), this visually pleasing spy thriller boasts excellent fight scenes, chase scenes, and suspense.  Matt Damon does an outstanding job as Bourne.  Having read the book years ago, I was interested in how well Damon would do as Bourne.  He did not disappoint.  Having watched the Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy, I can not imagine another actor better suited for the role.  Franka Potente, as Marie, does a fine job as the girl who gives Bourne a ride to Paris.  Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Chris Cooper provide excellent acting support.  This is a thrilling movie that is incredibly well-done.  Matt Damon as an "average guy" thrown into mysterious circumstances really excels here.<br /><br />The movie features stunning shots from a variety of excellent locales throughout Europe.  A group of assassins are activated to kill Bourne, and the fun begins.  This movie offers two hours of fun filled thrills and suspense.  I highly recommend this 5 star movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>James Bond take notice.  "The Bourne Identity" is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers.<br /><br />I'm not too keen on movies like James Bond and other stuff in this genre, but this one is a lot better. Normally you see the "super hero" using all kinds of weird gadgets, driving extremely fast sports cars and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being normal women.<br /><br />Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets, and no incredibly willing women sharing his bed. Our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence.  The film is genuinely exciting throughout, which is more than what can be said about many recent action films. Great action-thriller, worth watching for most fans of such. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved in it, and fans of action and thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Doug Liman<br /><br />Cast:  Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Gabriel Mann, Walton Goggins, Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles.<br /><br />Running Time:  119 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a cold blooded assassin, but he doesn't know it. He can kill anyone with just a glance, yet he doesn't even recognize his own name. Left for dead when a hit goes wrong, Jason is rescued from his watery grave in the sea and stitched up by Italian fishermen. Set loose in Europe, Jason tries to put the pieces of his life together (including his rapidly emerging ability to inflict violence when prompted) as it becomes clear that this dangerous and mysterious man is suffering from amnesia. Bourne is helped by Marie (Franka Potente from "The Princess and the Warrior" and "Run Lola Run"), a German woman desperate for cash, who takes Jason out of the dangerous hive of Paris to safety, but soon finds herself in deeper trouble than Bourne. On their tail are two dueling government agents (Brian Cox and Chris Cooper from "American Beauty") who would like nothing more than a dead Bourne, and a team of assassins who are sent out to finish the job.<br /><br />The poster for `The Bourne Identity' screams: `Matt Damon Is Jason Bourne.' Honestly, they couldn't be more right. In perhaps his biggest star performance to date, Damon conquers his new film with the authority of a Schwarzenegger, and the sleekness of a Brosnan. His performance is elaborate, moving back and forth from a man who doesn't understand what he's capable of, to a man who uses his capabilities to answer all of his questions. With his natural physicality, Damon can play the role easily. But with his ever-searching actor instincts, Damon finds shades within Jason Bourne to play with; just enough to help elevate the movie into territory Bond stopped trying to reach for three decades ago. Damon's chemistry with Potente is also a treat, as the film never veers too much into romantic territory, but leaves enough room for the heat between the two to seep through. They work very well together.  The real star of the picture is director Doug Liman, formerly of the anemic 1996 comedy "Swingers" and the appealing 1999 caper "Go". There is nothing in those two films that would suggest that Liman is capable of handling a spy thriller. And that's the beauty of `The Bourne Identity.' It's a story (here based on the best selling series by Robert Ludlum) that's been in play many times before, and Liman takes the challenge head on. Directing with a dazzling flair for tension and action set pieces, Liman conducts his "Bourne" very simply and efficiently. There are minimal explosions, no godforsaken quips from the lips of the characters, and the film is one of the fastest paced in recent memory.<br /><br />Liman is helped by fantastic European locations (shot crisply by Oliver Wood), an exhilarating score by John Powell ("Shrek"), and a swift script by Tony Gilroy and W. Blake Herron, but you can easily tell Liman's heart and dedication is really into the story and the characters. His heart is into the action as well, with the film containing many impressive hand-to-hand combat scenes that feel fresh and real, a mid-movie car chase that spells doom for any fingernails in the audience, and a climactic shootout that has Bourne literally riding another bad guy down the middle of a staircase. Wild, unpredictable moments like these are scattered throughout the film, and they make the ride that much more pleasurable. Liman has a clear vision for "The Bourne Identity", and his mission is accomplished.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>The chief interest with this extended version is the new beginning and ending that can be played instead of the original.  Both versions are available so it is up to the viewer as to which to choose.  This is not a director's cut of the film since there is a message (or a disclaimer) that Doug Liman did not participate.  Prior to the start of the extended version is a discussion with the producer and writer as to why the extended version was issued and why, after September 11, the decision was made to tone down the film by removing explosions from the ending.  I found the discussion a bit long-winded and skipped out of it to the movie.<br /><br />The changes to the film relate the action in a flash back.  Jason is in Greece searching for Marie when he gets a positive identification from a tourist and is drinking a bottle of Orangina when he topples over.  Cut to the start of the theatrical version of the film.  I have not read any of Robert Ludlum's books so I do not know how they compare to the movie.  However, a direct translation of the books to the screen is not possible: there is far too much to include.<br /><br />I saw the Bourne Identity the weekend it was released and liked it from the start.  The intent of the film was to make a fast paced action movie but without creating sensational stunts that did not advance the story.  Still the fight sequences and the chase in the streets of Paris are extraordinary.  More important is the chemistry between the amnesic Jason and Marie, the hard-up German girl who agrees to give him a ride from Zurich to Paris.  As we get closer to knowing who and what Jason Bourne is, it is the developing relationship between Marie and Jason that holds our attention.<br /><br />After watching the film to just about the very end, you can switch to the alternate ending. The new ending has Jason Bourne waking up with Brian Cox, who had ordered the murder of Chris Cooper's character.  Mr. Cox seems rather avuncular in this scene and informs Jason of where Marie is but lets him know that Treadstone is not more and he can do the odd killing job if he wants to.  The alternate ending is a little too neat for me and I don't think it adds anything to the film; interesting but not necessary.<br /><br />Of the extra features, there is an interesting look at Robert Ludlum through interviews with the author and some of his friends.  We also get a look at some of the stunts, a professional diagnosis of why Jason Bourne developed amnesia and interviews.  If you already have The Bourne Identity on DVD I do not think you need to buy this version.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon)is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea with two bullets in his back and a strange device with a Zurich address on it.. He also has no memory of who he is. After spending some time on the boat to recooperate, Bourne heads for Zurich to find out who he really is. Almost immediately he is forced to defend himself, and he soon discovers that he possesses the skills of a very dangerous man. With nowhere to go, he turns to the aid of poor German traveler named Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. Racing to unlock the secrets of his own identity, he discovers that he is an elite government agent. His CIA superior (Chris Cooper), sees Bourne as a rogue agent, and dispatches assassins to kill Bourne. Now the government's top agent, has become its number one target... <p>I had extremely low expectations going into &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. Matt Damon has never done anything action related, and there have been many spy thrillers made over the years. I was pleasantly surprised. The action sequences are amazing, the fights are choreographed extremely well, there are tons of twists and turns to keep you guessing, the suspense is nail-biting at times, and the romance between Matt Damon and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente is great. Not to mention the fact that Damon is quite convincing and pulls the role off like he is a veteran action star. This film literally has everything that it takes to make a great movie. As far as the spy criteria goes, I was very pleased as well. The character Jason Bourne does not have any gadgets or gizmos to help him out. He must rely on his hands and his brain to get him out of jam after jam. This results in and excellent cat-and-mouse chase for the whole film. As you can see, the film does have a lot to offer. However, the reason that I cannot give it a five star rating, is due to the fact that it can be slow moving at times, which affects the overall pace of the film. Instead of flowing smoothly, it felt a bit choppy at times. But for the most part, the film is extremely enjoyable.<p>This is the best spy thriller that I have seen since &quot;Ronin&quot;. &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; works so well, because it has something for everyone whether it be romance, suspense, action, or spy related. The DVD offers an alternate ending, deleted scenes, a making of featurette, and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>It's a great movie...There is not a boring seconde.Matt D and the other actors are very good, the FX are terrific and the story is 100% action but quite smart.Nothing negative.If you like suspense, it's the movie u need.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>The story of 'The Bourne Identity' for me is Matt Damon's complete believability as title character Jason Bourne.  I didn't doubt for a second his 'fit' as a top-notch secret agent, capable of all manner of physical confrontation and quick-witted mental acuity.  He also sold me on the all-important case of 'amnesia' that drives the film.<p>I also thought Damon was eye-openingly good in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' especially given it was essentially the polar opposite of the celebrated South Boston poster boy he portrayed so perfectly in 'Good Will Hunting.'<p>Then, I try to imagine buddy Ben Affleck in each of these roles.  Laughable.  Keep your distance, Matt.  Smart career move.<p>The other story here is the continued maturation of director Dougie Liman.  [Son of late legal titan Arthur Liman, he of the famous unruly combover...and unlikely star of the Oliver North hearings.]  Liman takes a huge step here.  His previous films were 'Go' and 'Swingers.'  Nice *little* pictures, but Dougie has obviously been called up to the majors.  He hits a bases-clearing double in his first at-bat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This is a terrifc movie for a weekend and while much fuss was made over particular omissions from Ludlum's great spy novel, the overall feel of the world he created remains. If every element from Ludlum's  novel were left in this would be a five hour movie. The book was that complex and jam-packed.<br /><br />Director Doug Liman has retained the basic feel of the book and left the heart of the story in tact. He didn't try to glamourize the grittier aspects simply because he had a big budget with which to work. There is almost a low-key atmosphere which somehow makes all the action seem more real to the viewer. We see Paris and all the other countries only as background to the dark storyline we hope can have some kind of happy resolution as the film goes along.<br /><br />Franke Potente is perfect as a girl who has no real roots herself, and what begins as a business proposition escalates into love, even if it must be a life on the run with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Damon proves he can really act in this film and does a great job as Bourne, a guy who has no idea who he is but has all the instincts of someone not quite part of everyday society.<br /><br />A Swiss bank account and a dozen passports, along with a large sum of cash and a weapon, tells him something about what kind of life he has led, if not who he is exactly. He ponders the mystery in a Paris cafe with Marie (Potente) while instinctively making note of all the liscence plates of the vehicles parked outside. Why he does so, he doesn't know.<br /><br />The romance that blossoms between Bourne and Marie becomes one more reason Bourne must find the answers to his identity as international assasins come after them at every turn. There is a moment in the film when he tries to make her leave him for safety because he loves her, and it is for that same reason she stays.<br /><br />This is a gritty movie with a heart. The action sequences as Bourne's instincts kick in are terrific and the human elements are not lost along the way, which is a credit to Director Liman and the two stars, especially Damon, who separtated himself from a big pack and proved he had talent here.<br /><br />We are left with a good feeling at the end of this film as both the action and romance are given their moments. I read this many years ago so perhaps the fact it was not fresh in my mind helped me enjoy it more. Taken simply as a really enjoyable film for a weekend, it's A+ entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity is a solid, efficient, old-fashioned thriller that gives us everything we could want in a summer shoot-'em-up. Robert Ludlum's ingenious original story--he made Jason Bourne COMPLETELY alone, hunted by the police and his own colleagues alike, without even memory to help him--is given swift, streamlined treatment by director Doug Liman, with plenty of explosions, assassinations, car chases and double-crosses to keep us on the edge of our seats. Matt Damon gives an assured, charismatic performance as Bourne, his weathered baby face giving the character a certain poignancy without detracting in the slightest from his credibility. He's nobody's male ingenue anymore! German actress Franka Potente lives up to her last name: she's a potent and sexy screen presence, not particularly pretty but far more alluring than many women who are. And it's interesting to see Chris Cooper, normally typecast as a nice guy, give such a thoroughly creepy performance as Bourne's treacherous CIA boss. I was disappointed to see Clive Owen wasted in a role beneath his talents, but the rest of the movie ticks away with the deadly efficiency of a Rolex watch attached to a time bomb.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>I should have learned a long time ago to never watch a movie after having read the book. Well, I did it once again and was disappointed. That does not make this a bad movie, just a movie that has very little in common with the book, so I was confused nearly from the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />A man with two bullet holes is discovered floating in the ocean. When the man wakes up he has no memory. Why is he in the ocean? Who shot him? Who is he? He follows clues, including a clue to a bank account implanted under his skin, and learns that he may be Jason Bourne. However, he also learns that he may be someone else. He also learns that he may be an assassin.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie has Matt Damon trying to keep alive and periodically killing people to do so. However, while his nemesis in the original Robert Ludlum novel was Carlos the Jackal, and he did his very best to avoid killing the spies from his side sent to kill him because they thought he might be a traitor, in the movie there is no Carlos and everyone with a gun he encounters is out to kill him. In substitute for Carlos the Jackal is Treadstone, which was a secret project to field highly trained assassins.<br /><br />The action in this movie is reasonably good, with the requisite chases and fights. However, given that Jason Bourne was a highly trained and expensive assassin, I kept thinking that Treadstone would try harder to find and recover him rather than continually sending people with guns after him. But, just like watching a movie after reading the book, some action movies should not be analyzed, just watched.<br /><br />Jason Bourne was written by Ludlum as a tormented man who hated the thought that he might be an assassin, in spite of the mounting evidence that he was a ruthless murderer. Jason Bourne in this movie is a cold-blooded killer. He is not tormented, just efficient. I struggled to see how Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) could take a liking to Jason. Jason did show mercy to a family and its children, but there was so little emotion in his face when he protected them that I wondered how emotionally involved he was in saving them.<br /><br />As an action movie "The Bourne Identity" is above average. However, I thought Jason Bourne was too cold-blooded. I thought Bourne's motivations for killing were thin initially. After killing the first agent or two the others were definitely out to get him, but you have to wonder how much of that was his own doing. "The Bourne Identity" has lots of action, but very little compassion; lots of adrenaline, but very little heart. For a better rounded story, read the book instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I just watched this one within the last week, and I must say I was duly impressed.  This offering is fast-paced, high tech, very sexy - a wild ride from beginning to end.  I found it rather reminiscent of a James Bond movie, but much grittier and without a clearly defined enemy - at least early on.  One of the elements I most enjoyed was heavy sense of mystery that pervades the first half of the movie.<p>Matt Damon does a slightly above-average acting job as Jason Bourne, who doesn't even know his own name or identity when he is dragged half dead out of the Mediterranean by the crew of a French fishing boat.  The only clue about his past is a micro-laser embedded in his hip, which reveals the name of a bank in Zurich, along with a numbered Swiss account.  Weeks later, still no closer to overcoming his amnesia, he is put ashore and makes a beeline for Zurich, where he finds a safe deposit box containing a stack of passports in various names (one of which is Jason Bourne), as well as lots of cash and a gun.<p>Still quite confused but unsuspecting of any trouble, he heads to the American embassy with hopes of getting some answers.  His reception there, however, is less than cordial, and suddenly he finds himself the object of an intense manhunt for reasons he cannot begin to fathom.  To make matters worse, his pursuers obviously would rather see him dead than alive.  Thus begins a non-stop, pulse pounding race across Europe as Bourne tries both to stay alive and find out who he is and why so many people are after him.<p>Ultimately Bourne does figure out the answers to all his questions, but not before leaving in his wake a string of dead would-be assassins, along with a bunch of stymied police and covert operatives.  Unfortunately, he doesn't like what he finds out, and its clear that his past will never leave him alone.  This leaves the stage wide open for the sequel, "The Bourne Supremacy", which should hit the theaters quite soon.<p>Overall I thought this movie was extremely riveting and entertaining.  The acting wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't a liability either.  The story line definitely carries the movie, much more so than the actors.  If you haven't seen it, please do.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I can't wait to see the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I first happened to watch part of THE BOURNE IDENTITY on cable. I watched the first twenty minutes of the film before I had to leave. What I saw intrigued me enough that a few weeks later I rented the DVD. Overall, the movie wasn't too shabby. It's got some good action sequences (especially the car chase) and a few unexpected surprises. Still, the ending of the movie was a little bit of a let down, almost too cliched. The audience knew from the beginning who Jason Bourne was almost from the beginning and is left with a suspicion of how the film will end. Nevertheless, it's still kind of a let down--I was hoping for more of a &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; type plot.  Anyway. Matt Damon does a great job as the title character and Chris Cooper, well, Chris Cooper can seem to improve any role he plays no matter how cliched they are. Overall, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a decent action/spy flick. You might not enjoy it, but you'll at least feel like you watched a good movie.<p>The DVD includes several deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette promo, a music video, and the usual director's commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>I found it rather amusing to see this film--Matt Damon's first real foray into &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; territory--derail any of Ben Affleck's hopes of becoming a credible action star.  Although not as mysterious as it should be (especially when compared to the book), &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; has several things going for it, not the least of which is a brisk pace, and credible direction.<p>For starters, Europe looks much better through the eyes of Director Doug Liman than it did in Brian DePalma's &quot;Mission:Impossible&quot;.  Filming on location in Europe will always look better than on a studio backlot, no matter what the pundits say.<p>The action sequences are quite good; although they're more violent than spy thrillers from my youth, they're not as over the top as they could be, but still frenetic enough to appeal to martial arts buffs as well as fans of the original novel.<p>Another plus is the use of Franka Potente, who fits the role of Maria far better than any name, plastic-surgery-disaster actress from Hollywood.  At the very least, she and Damon possess far more chemistry than did Affleck and Charlize Theron in the tepid &quot;Reindeer Games&quot;.<p>From top to bottom, a crisp, by-the-numbers spy movie that will keep you entertained throughout, but I doubt this film will age very well.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I was really excited to hear one of my favorite books was being made into a film. I was surprised at the beginning whenn they didn't say &quot;based on the book.&quot; After watching it, I can see why. The only thing it has in common with the book are the characters and some of the first 5 minutes. The plot is completely different. The book is exciting because Jason Bourne (Damon) is up against the deadliest assasin of all time, Carlos the Jackal, and his origins are a mystery until the very end. Carlos is nowhere in this film, and the secrets of the organization Bourne is from is revealed in the first 15 mins.<p>Another thing that I haven't seen in over a decade, is a very anti-climatic ending. No real final showdown with the bad guy, no incredible revelations, just an action scene that's less exciting than the first fight Bourne has.<p>As a standalone film, it's entertaining.

It has high energy moments, like an elaborate auto chase through the streets of Paris, but it eschews the flashy, over-produced special effects of movies like `XXX' in favor of greater focus on the characters and the story. While the plot has a number of hard to believe elements to it, it's still intriguing enough to keep an audience well entertained. <p>The crew of a fishing vessel discovers an unconscious man [Matt Damon] floating in the water off the coast of France. He has two bullets in his back and an odd little gadget sewn into his hip. The man recovers physically but is plagued by amnesia. Using the gadget, the captain learns that their passenger has a numbered bank account in Switzerland. Later, after making his way to Zurich, the confused victim finds out he is John Borne, American resident of Paris. It's more complicated than that, though, because he also uncovers several other passports. Is he Borne, is he someone else, or is he all of these identities? At the American Consulate, he learns one more thing: He is a wanted man whom some group wants to assassinate. Enlisting the aid of a German girl, Marie [Franka Potente], he makes his way to Paris. There, both he and Marie are in even greater danger. He establishes that he was a CIA agent, and, as his memory slowly returns, he comes to understand that he was anything but a nice guy. <p>Damon does a great job of playing an action hero. It's an interesting role for him, almost but not quite as multi-layered as his part in "The Talented Mr. Ripley'. He and Potente make an excellent on screen couple, both in the action scenes and the romantic ones. <p>The movie was directed by Doug Liman, who also did the cult classic "Swingers" and the wonderful [and little seen] "Go". He brings a modern feel to an old genre. Adding to the film's appeal is the excellent photography, which was done on location in Paris, Prague, Switzerland and Greece.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>I'll be honest, I haven't read the Robert Ludlum novel, nor do I remember seeing the original film staring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. So I'm not able to point out differences or inconsistencies, if indeed there are any. Having said that, I can't imagine its predecessors topping Doug Liman's version of "The Bourne Identity." This is the sort of film I like to watch pretty often and each time I find something new to enjoy.<br /><br />The plot, while nothing very original, provides a useful framework around which we get to enjoy some of the most believable action sequences I've seen. Let's face it, an assassin suffering from amnesia is not going to lead a dull life, particularly not after his "friends" decide he's gone rogue. There's only so many ways you can film stunts and action sequences like a car chase but Liman has  managed to somehow make the many action scenes seem fresh. I particularly liked seeing what looked like a mini-minor out driving the police using skill and good planing, rather than a high-powered engine or death-defying jumps.<br /><br />Most of the movie follows Jason Bourne, (Matt Damon), as he tries to reclaim his life and survive to see each new day. In this way, the audience is allowed to discover the pieces of the puzzle along with him. On the way he forms an unequal partnership with Marie Kreutz, (Franka Potente). It is good to see a female lead portrayed without either weakness or an unrealistic macho streak. Hopefully, this film will launch Franka's Hollywood career because she has more than earned her stripes in German cinema.<br /><br />Jason and Marie inevitably bond but despite not taking a major part of the narrative, I felt their stop-start romance suited the film. Perhaps a woman with no home makes a good match for a man with no past. I also liked the several times the couple tried to split up, to  get Marie out of Bourne's troubles but I especially liked the realism when they finally managed to part. The plot really doesn't need her but it seems Liman used Marie as a means of reminding Bourne that there is more to life than survival.<br /><br />To some it would be nice to wake up one day and discover you were a sort of superman; able to speak half a dozen languages, had tens of thousands in a Swiss bank account and could out-fight Bruce Lee. His boss said it best when he described Jason as a $30,000,000 weapon. But more than advanced skills, Jason was gifted with intelligence and the experience of years of spy craft, even if he couldn't remember it. The thoughtful approach taken to achieve each objective, even on the spur of the moment, made the film almost educational. Hey, read a map before running from the police, use distraction and decoys to sidetrack you opponent, use the resources around you and think laterally. It's all good stuff for budding spies.<br /><br />While Matt Damon played the part with little emotion, deliberately I assume, some of the smaller roles were outstanding. Each seemed to wring so  much depth from so few minutes of screen time that I felt like watching a spin-off movie for each of them. Probably the most affecting was the performance of Clive Owen, a fellow assassin who dies describing his constant headaches and bitter loneliness. Also of note is Julia Stiles, the overworked safe-house administrator; she exudes competence while com?plaining of limited resources. All of these perform?ance gems must be a credit to Liman's direction.<br /><br />It would be easy to dismiss "The Bourne Identity" as just another action flick. The action was great, but the true heart of the film was Jason's odyssey to reclaim his soul from the depths of a CIA black-ops hell. He used to be an amoral machine, doing his job without questioning the rightness of his work, just like the rest of them. But amnesia gave him the chance to step back from the abyss and evaluate his fate, eventually choosing to tear a new path into the future. The moral? Perhaps it's that "freedom" is more important than "patriotism."</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a tightly conceived, well directed, well photographed and particularly well acted suspense thriller loosely based on the Robert Ludlum best seller.  True, many liberties have been taken from the novel, but when you take the time to note that Ludlum himself is the producer, then all arguments are off.  Matt Damon and Franka Potente are terrific as the amnesiac agent and his 'only friend' who helps him escape a mad and endless chase from multiple groups of would be assassins.  The characters are well developed - Damon gives one of his better perfomances, doing most of his stunt work himself while Potente continues to prove she is an actress worth watching.  The supporting cast of such fine actors as Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, etc help propel this movie along.  Outside of the French Connection this is one of the best car chases ever filmed - gratefully without the now-boring background of explosions and destruction.  In all a fine film that is delivered on DVD with interesting  and informative sidebars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book "The Bourne Identity". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and  it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and  automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural "Bourne" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff,  portrays Bourne as an intelligent,  resourceful  character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them.  Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale.  Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre.  This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>It seems as though this film/DVD has as many detractors as fans. The principal reason seems to be its faithlessness to the decades-old Robert Ludlum novel. Well, I believe Ludlum was an executive producer of the film, and think that he helped migrate the book into a slick script, which provides plenty of screen satisfaction.<p>At last, someone got the idea, that of an amnesiac spy, to the screen, as the first in what was a book trilogy, and will hopefully produce at least one movie sequel. A lukewarm version of "Identity" played on television years ago (think of the results if it starred Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith!). This version stylishly updates the story to today.<p>I felt that I saw another dimension to talented actor Matt Damon as the action anti-hero of the film, and thought his onscreen chemistry with Franka Potente worked brilliantly. Couple it with a fine performance from Chris Cooper, a jolting assassination, and one of the finest chase sequences I've seen on film....its a winner!<p>The DVD features are somewhat average, although anything filmed this slickly has a lot of interesting background material. The alternate ending was very disappointing.<p>All in all, definitely worth a watch!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2  What exactly is it that determines the moral code by which a person lives? And can the very same person be a cold-blooded murderer in one incarnation, then become a virtual humanitarian when all memory of that previous life somehow gets wiped away? These provocative questions are raised, though never adequately explored, in `The Bourne Identity,' a fairly standard man-on-the-run spy thriller based on the best selling novel by Robert Ludlum. Written by Tony Gilroy and directed by Doug Liman, `The Bourne Identity' tells the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA hit man who has been suffering from amnesia ever since his bullet-riddled body was plucked floating out of the Mediterranean Sea. Initially unaware of his secret agent status, Jason - together with Marie, a young woman he picks up in Switzerland and hires to drive him to Paris - tries to piece together the clues to his identity and purpose. Essentially we are back in old Hitchcock territory, where the story's hero is being chased by all sorts of nefarious figures even though he himself has not a clue as to who these people are or why it is they are so anxious to put an end to him.<p>`The Bourne Identity' might have been a more interesting film had it attempted to explore some of the more subtle implications of its morality play situation. Instead, the filmmakers concentrate almost exclusively on the superficial aspects of its spy thriller premise. There are brief flashes where Jason ponders the deeper issues of a troubled conscience, but they are quickly thrown over for the usual cat-and-mouse accoutrements of this odd-man-out scenario. And, frankly, despite the novelty of the Paris setting and some impressive stunt and action scenes scattered along the way, nothing in the film really much engages the audience's sympathy or interest. Matt Damon does a solid job conveying the underlying sweetness of Bourne's character, but nothing in his demeanor or behavior can convince us that he is a government-generated killing machine. What's missing from this story is any attempt to show how this character, whom we have come to view as compassionate and loving, could ever have done the things he is said to have done. That analysis would have lent the film that extra bit of depth it so sorely lacks in its current form.<p>The film is at its most interesting when it shows how Bourne, because he is himself a product of CIA training, can use the very tools his mentors gave him to stay one step ahead of his pursuers and even outwit the professionals at their own game. <p>The film features a relatively impressive car chase through the streets of Paris (though it pales in comparison to the ones in `Ronin'). But I can't believe that filmmakers are STILL using that old standby - the one where some workers just happen to be transporting a piece of glass across the street just so the careening cars can come crashing through it. I thought that one had been put to rest, finally and irrevocably, 30 years ago in `What's Up, Doc?'</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Fishermen in a boat traveling on the Mediterranean, during a heavy rain storm, find a man floating in the ocean with a flashing light on him.  They rescue him and bring him aboard only to find that he is alive but unconscious.  He has been shot twice in the back and one of the ship's crew removes the bullets from his back.  He also finds along scar on the man's back and he removes a tubular implant from him. It is a laser projector that when activated shows a Swiss bank account number and bank name onto the wall of the ship.<br /><br />When the man suddenly awakes he does not know where he is or how he arrived there.  He has amnesia.  The man helps on the fishing boat crew while they are at sea.  He is always talking to himself in foreign languages and asking who he is.  He tries to remember who he is but he is without an identity.  When the boat arrives at the port the captain gives him a small amount of money to get to the bank in Switzerland.  He takes the train but he does not have enough for a room so he sleeps on the street on a park bench.  Two policemen roust him up and the man suddenly begins speaking fluent Swiss.  He then quickly knocks out and disarms the two policemen in seconds.  He is a master of martial arts and he did not even know that he could do that.<br /><br />He goes to the Bank and opens a safe deposit box that is full of passports, money in many currencies and a gun.  He assumes the name of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) which is from one of the passports....<br /><br />This is a high action thriller involving an undercover operative in a secret department of the CIA.  He failed his mission and now they want him dead, immediately.  The film is a fast moving spy thriller and Matt Damon does a great job in playing the role he is in.  It provides a view into the operations of the CIA and perhaps a real insight into the world of undercover agents.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and it is a first class suspense thriller.  I recommend it to you!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>A handsome young man (Matt Damon) is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat, unconscious. The man who digs a couple of bullets out of his back finds something else beneath the skin of his bottom: a small capsule with a laser that displays the name of a Swiss bank and an account number. It was the flashing of another laser embedded in his wet suit that had alerted the crew of the fishing boat to his presence in the water.<br /><br />He does not know who he is. Thus begins one of the most amazing adventure and chase stories in 21st century films. Even for someone who read the book, it is thrilling. There are enough differences (although the sense of it is maintained) that even though I remembered the book pretty well, I didn't always know what was going on here. When Jason Bourne discovers his passport in the lock box which was connected to that bank account number, he discovers another half dozen, some with the name Bourne and some with at least one other name. The pictures are all of the face he has been seeing in the mirror. There is also a great deal of money in several currencies (the setting is apparently pre-Euro), a gun or two, and some communications devices.<br /><br />So is he a spy? For whom? He clearly has incredible fighting skill, as he discovers when a couple of Zurich police hassle him for sleeping in the park. And a trip to the U.S. Embassy makes it clear there's something very fishy about all of this. He escapes with his life, but only just, and bribes a young woman to give him a ride to Paris.<br /><br />The entire story is really one long chase, but the little red car zipping through all obstacles in Paris is probably the most amazing car chase scene I have ever seen in any movie. (Well, until the next film; I seem to remember there's a pretty amazing one there, too. Bourne tops Bourne?)<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will warn you that you may have to play this one two or three times to follow everything; the pace is just that rapid and the tale that convoluted. Much high-tech spy equipment, much ado about plenty. I defy anyone to predict what's coming next if they have not read the book, and half of those will get it wrong.<br /><br />Four stars for the non-stop adrenalin rush.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Creators do a nice job cutting through the multiple, often murky strands of Ludlum original, to give a clear, clear plot and lots of action. We need no more than to know that a Government Agency has a network of agents who can be used for black bag missions often involving "taking out" some person(s) to protect the nation. Bourne is one such agent, who has been shot and has, thereby, lost his memory, has become, to himself, a man without an identity. The Agency knows his identity, however, and when he surfaces in his search for who he is, they (for very vague reasons of security for the Agency from prying Congressional eyes), set out to liquidate him. He meets a girl along the way, and, of course, they fall in love. With a simple plot to work with, the film produces a series of dangerous situations and heroic feats of combat.<br />The film carries no intellectual baggage to weigh down the action, which is brief, sharp, and, satisfying. The lovey-dovey stuff is kept to a neat minimum, the brief scene showing him to be a killer with a heart, takes no time at all.<br />In short, this is a fine, well played, thriller, which makes two hours melt away to a seeming nothing. No boring scenes here.</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>The chemistry between Franka Potente's 'Marie' and Matt Damon's 'Jason Bourne' sizzles on top the European scenery where it's left to rest on this film adaptation of Robert Ludlum's novel.

At that point he was still struggling to try to get his memory back...<br /><br />When you see the sequel or the two parts together, it makes sense because evidently Jason is still haunted...

I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the "Bourne" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" manages to take a story with a myriad of cliches (the super spy, the spy with amnesia, secret government experiments and cover-ups, etc, etc, etc) and still make a film that's fresh, exciting, intelligent and engrossing.<br /><br />So the question is, why does this film excel when so many other action films fall flat? First, the film utilizes an excellent cast. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the thinking man's action hero, bringing a complexity to the role that flies in the face of the typical cocky, wisecracking American action hero. Veteran actors like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox bring gravitas to their supporting roles, and Franka Potente brings an international, quirky sex appeal to her role as Jason's love interest.<br /><br />As great as the performers are, the script and direction also really deliver. Although the action scenes are all wonderfully executed, the film makes sure not to sacrifice character development either. Jason Bourne is a man who has lost his identity, and as a result is able to regain the humanity he has clearly lost in his previous life as an assassin.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>As many of you probably already know, The Bourne Identity is the first of the three installments of the Bourne film trilogy. It is loosely based on the Novel by Robert Ludlum of the same name. I had already watched this film long before I realized that it was based on a novel and that there were actually three total books involving the Bourne character, all of which would soon have their own film adaptations. With all of that said, I was initially surprised on how good this film really was. I had my doubts that Matt Damon would be able to pull off a character like Jason Bourne. For some reason, Matt Damon just doesn't come to my mind when you think action star, but he really pulled it off here. Not only Damon, but the supporting cast is good as well, with Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Julia Styles all having good performances. But what I loved about this movie was the pacing. This film has very few slow parts in it, but yet it isn't just all over-the-top action either. There's a very good balance to the film. And during the more action-packed sequences, it isn't just senseless action for the sake of action, there's a purpose behind it. The main reason for this is simply because this a good story, and it keeps the audience entertained. There's more than just one storyline happening throughout the film as you get to follow the Jason Bourne character as he tries to find out just who he really is. I really don't have many negative things to say about this film. The only thing I would change would be the last action sequence in the film involving the Bourne character jumping off a staircase and shooting someone. I really thought that was completely unrealistic. Another thing that has really nothing to do with the movie, it's about the packaging of this DVD. This is supposed the the Extended Edition with a bunch of special features. But in reality, there's not a lot of difference in this edition and the regular one. There's a few more little featurettes and an alternate beginning and ending (which I didn't care too much for), and a few little other things, but nothing real special. Heck, this isn't even a 2-disc DVD! So, if you already have this movie and not this edition, then you're not missing much. But if you're thinking about purchasing this film for the first time, I highly recommend it to any fan of not only the action genre, but anyone who just wants to see a well-paced, well written story that will keep you entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Matt Damon is Jason Bourne - an agent of the U.S. government who has lost his memory, yet retains a great deal of intelligence and martial arts skills.  The CIA believes he has failed a mission he was sent to accomplish in Europe.  When they learn he is alive, they quickly use a league of agents to hunt down Bourne before time runs out on the clock, and the men involved with the screw up get in real trouble.  The plot gets very detailed throughout the film, but this is the basic idea.<br /><br />Though there are some nice fight scenes and a great car chase in the film, the plot is always moving along, so there is little need for an abundance of action to keep things rolling.  I love films like this, cause when there is action, it actually holds some meaning when it occurs.  Bourne and the woman he accompanies (who the CIA is also after) share a great chemistry - both as characters and as actors.  The remainder of the cast is solid, and includes stars such as Julia Styles and Clive Owen - both who actually player lesser characters in the film, though nice to see.<br /><br />Best thing about this film is the non-stop running of Bourne.  He rarely gets time to stop for a breather, therefore making this film a very easy one for the viewer to stay alert to.  There is a detailed plot that takes a lot to follow every step of what's going on, but it is just as easy to watch if you prefer to sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Compared to James Bond in a sense, Bourne actually feels much more realistic.  While Bond is more fun and action packed in the long run, Bourne gives us a greater taste of reality.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Wow!

(Elk Grove, California) - See all my reviews<br /><br />In my excitement to see the newly released Bourne Ultimatum, I decided to again watch the Bourne Identity, released in 2002. The Bourne Identity features the story by Robert Ludlum with Matt Damon as the amnesia addled Jason Bourne. Directed by Doug Liman (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), this visually pleasing spy thriller boasts excellent fight scenes, chase scenes, and suspense. Matt Damon does an outstanding job as Bourne. Having read the book years ago, I was interested in how well Damon would do as Bourne. He did not disappoint. Having watched the Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy, I can not imagine another actor better suited for the role. Franka Potente, as Marie, does a fine job as the girl who gives Bourne a ride to Paris. Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and Chris Cooper provide excellent acting support. This is a thrilling movie that is incredibly well-done. Matt Damon as an "average guy" thrown into mysterious circumstances really excels here.<br /><br />The movie features stunning shots from a variety of excellent locales throughout Europe. A group of assassins are activated to kill Bourne, and the fun begins. This movie offers two hours of fun filled thrills and suspense. I highly recommend this 5 star movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity brings to the screen the story of a young man dragged out of the Mediterranean Sea and without a clue as to who he is. His only lead is a bank account in Zurich. His problems, however, have only just begun...<br />Matt Damon is amazing in his respective role though the rest of the cast fail to follow with the exception of lovely Julia Stiles who seems to have quite a bit of potential.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good, but nothing extraordinary.<br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book "The Bourne Identity". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural "Bourne" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book "The Bourne Identity".

This is a story about Jason Bourne, some guys on a big fishing boat find him floating in the sea, and when jason wakes up he cannot remember anything about his life.  He can remember certain things like HOW TO DRIVE, and his bank account #, but can't remember simple things like his name.  So this leads to exciting event after event that leads jason to discovering  more about who he is and the people that are after him.  i could give you all the highlights of this movie, but I really don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />Overall a great movie with exciting stunts, fights, and chases.  But don't think that it is all about that because you will learn all about these characters and this movie keeps you interested all the way through, even the parts that are supposed to be slow.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>First I'm just reviewing this movie and I have never read the Bourne Novels nor have I seen the old Miniseries from 1988 so I am comparing this movie to nothing. My one and only problem with this film is the leading female actress Franka Potente (Marie), I don't know if it was her character that was annoying or just her in general. She was constantly in the way and almost making you want something to happen to her character.<br /><br />It almost seems like the producers thought if they put a girl who isn't all that cute and has mediocre acting skills then there's no way she could out shine Matt Damon and boy did it work. For a minute you start to think Matt is playing his role a bit weak but then you realize he's good at playing a man who has lost his memory. The fight sequences are fantastic and this is where you start to give a little respect because all the fights are perfect but I think they could of used a little bit more of them, maybe two or three.<br /><br />The plot kind of reminds you of the Replacement Killers when Chow Yun-Fat wasn't able to assassinate the cop because the guys son was right there with him when he tried to do it but Chow wasn't trained by the government and definitely not as dangerous or exciting. If your watching this thinking it's a movie where you start to feel for the characters then don't bother with it, Bourne didn't even show too much feelings for his new love Marie. This is a plain old action flick with a nice and interesting story. Overall this is a movie that will have you loving it for the action and the crazy car chase in the Mini Cooper but I really think another leading actress was needed.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Spy movies never cease to do big business at the box office, but sometimes spy movies seem like they are all the same which doesn't necessarily affect the box office, but it does affect DVD sales.  There are several highly successful spy movies that have figured out how to keep things fresh for audiences; such as, James Bond, Spy Game, Mission: Impossible.  When it came time for the release of yet another spy movie, this time based on a classic Robert Ludlum novel, people were excited, that is until it was discovered that this adaptation would not have much in common with the source material, then skepticism set in.  However, unlike most cases where a movie tries to be as different from the book as possible this one works and was hugely successful, wowing audiences from day one.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity", based on the first book in the "Jason Bourne Trilogy" by Robert Ludlum, is about a man who is found in the ocean and has apparently been shot and doesn't remember who or what he is and who or what did this to him.  Now this man must embark on a quest to not only discover who he is, but what he is.  He has martial arts abilities, highly aware of his environment, and is constantly haunted by memories that don't make sense.  Now, the people he worked for at the CIA believe he went rogue, and want to bring him in for questioning or silence him for good.  But upon discovering his name is Jason Bourne, and that he is now wanted by the very people he worked for, though he doesn't remember why, Jason is going to take the fight to the CIA and clear his name once and for all.<br /><br />Superbly crafted thrill ride that never lets up until the credits roll.  Though it is drastically different from the novel it is based upon, "The Bourne Identity" still retains the spirit of the novel and sets itself apart in a way that doesn't alienate fans of the novels, but also doesn't require you to have read any of them either.  Excellent cast that is lead by Matt Damon, in a role that no one thought would fit him, but he proves otherwise.  Perfect direction from director Doug Liman (director of Mr. & Mrs. Smith).  "The Bourne Identity" is an excellent, intense spy thriller, that sets the bar for all other spy movies even higher.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity is a great spy thriller. Keeps you guessing & on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon is perfect as Jason Bourne. Damon pulls off a character that is smart but lost, composed but confused, lethal but child like. From the minute the fishermen fished him out of the Mediteranian Sea & finds out he can't recall who he is. Then finding out thru a capsule implanted in his body...only a bank account in Zurich. Once Bourne gets to the Bank of Zurich all hell breaks loose. Franka Potente as Maria, the German gypsie, is very good. This movie is an excellent action spy thriller that I would recomend to all to see.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO092BYA4VMU.html">ABO092BYA4VMU</a><br/><p>This movie is not classic, but it is really good. Mind-boggling action, mind-boggling story make this movie a good one for ages 15+. The DVD is great too, with both the orginial theatrical version and the extended edition with the alternate ending and alternate opening edited back in to the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente, a beautiful German actress, The Bourne Identity is a huge success.  Fraught with intense action scenes and rich character development, this movie resounds with the passion of a high speed thriller that will bear many viewings.  I must admit to some trepidation about Matt Damon in an action role given his past roles, this trepidation doesn't bear out though, as he performs admirably in the role of a CIA assassin who has lost his memory.<p>The premise:<p>Jason Bourne is a CIA assassin who is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat.  He has two bullets in his back, an odd little laser device with a Zurich address and no memory as to who he is.  After two weeks on the fishing boat, he heads for Zurich and the search to who he really is.  Once he starts on this quest, he finds that he has some absolutely amazing skills and is almost immediately defending himself from being killed in several different ways.  He is then fortunate enough to find Marie, who he pays to drive him to Paris.  The quickly developed relationship between these two characters is quite beautifully filmed.<p>What ensues is clearly one of the best spy/action thrillers to come out in some time.  This films action sequences will leave you exhausted and the plot line will enthrall you completely.  If this is your type of genre, I highly recommend this film.<p>The Special features are also quite interesting; of note are the alternate ending and the "Making of" clips.  {ssintrepid}</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity is probably the best movie I've seen this year because it is the most effective in achieving its purpose.  Matt Damon plays a superspy who has forgotten everything about his past.  On his quest to find out about himself, he must evade assassins and protect Marie and try and stay alive.<p>The plot isn't that important other than to answer the question of will Bourne find out who he is and why people are trying to kill him.  The on-location filming make this movie fun to watch, but the action scenes are the best parts.  They are filled with suspense and realistic violence.  This movie isn't filled with computer generated violence and special effects.  <p>It is a throwback to the old Bond movies of one-on-one cloak and dagger standoffs.  While taking a step back from the special effects, The Bourne Identity might be enjoyable to many people today who weren't alive when the goals of movies was to be bigger and better than the last.<p>I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good action/suspense thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was gonna be a bore but this one is really a keeper. it puts a lot of action and suspense into one ball and lets it explode. damon is excellent as jason bourne and franka potente is beautiful as always. clive owen is great in a supporting part as the professor(he's the one who gets shotgunned by damon in the field). all in all it pays off and its wonderfully made and the stunts are great. damon is really doing all his stunts</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>Has a nice sence of action, can't deny that. The beggining has the guy lost at sea, kind of mysterious. I really just enjoyed the great job they did with it. You knew when Jason was paranoid, you knew when he sensed there was trouble.<p>Basically, if you can't figure it out, he was set up for an assassination, or was he? Kind of set up, mediumish, anyways all I know is that Jason was shot 2 times in the back, and yea he screwed up probably. So what is it. Well theres some nice fighting, some good gun shooting action, even a nice car scene.<p>He lost his memory, so he is trying to retrace his steps sort of. He does a fantastic job of being a spy like guy, and has some good instincts, I just loved it for the first time though. When you rent it, you don't know what's going to happen. I would just rent the movie, I don't want to spoil it, but Jason has gotta go up against some pro assassins.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>the reason i didn't give it ***** is because the beginning was slow paced. i liked it otherwise and would reccomend it. it's confusing , cool , and fun.</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>Here's the film &quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot; wishes it could have been.  It's the story of a near-corpse who is rescued floating in the ocean and can remember everything but who he is, what he does with his life, and how he got there.<p>Yeah, the amnesia angle certainly has a bad rep, but the stylish film keeps the action rolling and makes it work.  Unlike MI2, there's no rock-video posing, no plot holes the size of Hummers, and no escapes from sticky situations that would make 007 blush.  It all fits.<p>And ultimately the mystery is solved for us all, of course, in a legit fashion that shows this action spy flick to have a surprisingly good heart.  The endings (both of them) seemed a bit too cutesy for me, and in two or three places the pacing of the film seems like the editing was done with the theory &quot;Let's cut to some action so they can't think about what a stretch that bit of business was,&quot; but all in all this is certainly one of the better films of its genre in recent memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>In the vein of &quot;keep-you-guessing&quot; movies like the excellent MEMENTO, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is an exciting movie with enough fast-paced action to sustain audiences during the action movie madness that is Hollywood. The film rests largely on Matt Damon's shoulders and thankfully he has enough acting chops to make you believe the character. The compelling story lends itself well to a film, which, while not completly an out-and-out action thriller, contains some fantastically contrived set-pieces, like the exciting car chase and the final showdown where Bourne finds the answers to the thorny problem of who he actually is. One of the few brainy action films of late, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is one exciting ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>Based on the bestseller by the late Robert Ludlum and executive produced by Ludlum and Frank Marshall, THE BOURNE IDENTITY pares down the book and 1988 miniseries while updating the story for the 21st century. For the few thriller fans in the world who haven't read the book the basic story appears rather old: an amnesiac struggling to learn his real identity, while predictably being pursued by people who want him dead. Director Doug Liman's (GO, SWINGERS) first attempt at an action thriller is fairly good with some spectacular stunt work and an OK performance from Franka Portene (RUN LOLA RUN). Julia Stiles also has what is basically a glorifed cameo and Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lecter also co-stars. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a good movie, but don't expect it to remain true to the book. Apparently there are plans to film THE BOURNE SUPREMACY with Damon. I hope that one turns out a little better. And I hope Damon has developed some kind of acting range by them. His Jason Bourne seems to have been "Bourne" prematurely. Not that Richard Chamberlain was much better in the role. It's still worth watching though. Don't let my quibbling put you off.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>First off, when I first heard that they were making a movie version of Robert Ludlum's novel, I had mixed feelings. I had read and thoroughly enjoyed the book many years ago and knew that it had been adapted into a TV movie back in 1988, with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, although I have to confess that I never did get around to seeing it for fairly obvious reasons. <p>So why the mixed feelings? Partly because, for a variety of reasons, movies rarely if ever live up to the novels on which they are based. Maybe this is because we have our own rigidly set perceptions of what the characters look like or because we are already familiar with the plot. Sometimes studios rewrite the plots of our favourite novels and the movie adaptation ends up being so dissimilar to the book that everything that was good about it has either been lost in the editing, or changed to the story's detriment. <p>In the case of The Bourne Identity, the novel is a pretty substantial affair, full of plots and sub-plots, which would be pretty hard to cram into a mere 2 hours, without making significant changes. The Bourne Identity's script was reportedly written and re-written countless times. It took two years to shoot and, during this time, Matt Damon completed two other movies (Ocean's Eleven and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron). With this kind of background it is almost a wonder that this film was ever completed and as a result pre-release expectations were none too high. However, against all odds, Doug Liman (Go, Swingers) has produced a slick and competent thriller.<p>Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac found drifting in the Mediterranean sea after being pumped full of lead and left for dead. After being rescued by a fishing boat and nursed back from to health our hero sets off from Marseille with the intention of trying to rekindle his lost memories. Along the way, much to his bemusement, he not only finds himself pursued by shadowy would-be assassins, he discovers that he has skills and instincts that suggest that he himself may also be a ruthless trained killer. <p>So cue some great action sequences; several impressive fight scenes and an excellent car chase through Paris and enough of the original novel's twists and turns to keep the audience interested. Plus, throw in Franka Potente as an interesting female lead and unwilling companion, Clive Owen and Brian Cox in good supporting performances and two hours slip seamlessly by. However, although detractors will point out that The Bourne Identity is probably not the most memorable movie you will ever see (true), it is also fair to say that this is good old fashioned Saturday night at the movies entertainment and definitely worth a watch if you are looking for something undemanding. Matt Damon, excellent in The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting as a credible action hero? Now there's a pleasant surprise and with several sequels penned by the late author Robert Ludlum, we may not have yet seen the last of Mr Bourne.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Jason Bourne wakes up adrift at sea with no memory of who he is, how he got there, or why he has two bullets in his back.  As he follows the few meager clues he has to find his identity, he attracts the attention of someone or someones who want to kill him.  Yet he seems to already possess the knowledge needed to stay alive.  Can he outwit his opponents to find his missing memory?<p>This movie came highly recommended to me, so I couldn't wait to see it.  I was drawn in from the beginning and the action sequences had me on the edge of my seat.  I was also intrigued to find out what was really going on.  However, as the movie progressed, I began to get very disillusioned with it.  Jason keeps making mistakes that I knew better then to make.  And, sure enough, they get him in more trouble.  For a character that was established from the beginning as a smart spy, this really bothered me.<p>If you're willing to forgive plot holes, there are some wonderful action sequences here to enjoy.  Otherwise, skip this movie in favor of something where the plot makes a little more sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>My wife and I watched this on DVD. We were disappointed that it was available only in &quot;full screen&quot; format -- i.e. with the edges chopped off -- but decided to view it anyhow. She liked it more than I did.  The premise is intriguing, but its potential is not realized. After a while I didn't really CARE who Bourne is, or was. Matt Damon's acting is wooden, and the endless chase-fight-escape sequences just aren't believable. At one point, I half expected the big secret to be that Bourne is a cyborg, or specially enchanced human (a la &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;) as this is the only plausible explanation for his invincibility. But no, he's just a man. Overall, it's not a bad movie; it's just not very good either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Matt Damon plays a CIA agent who loses his memory.  Through the few clues that he can piece together, he begins the quest to find out who he is, and he's not too pleased at what he finds out.  By his side is a German woman who helps him escape imminent danger by giving him a ride to Paris.  This is a fast-paced, exciting movie that keeps the viewer's attention.  My main objections lie with the casting of All-American boy Matt Damon as a cold-blooded killer and the fact that without knowledge of the book, it's difficult to follow the CIA wheels within wheels.  Still, it's an entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K5IMGDCDBCNF.html">A3K5IMGDCDBCNF</a><br/><p>Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, except he does not know he is Jason Bourne.  Damon turns up floating in the Mediterrainian and cannot remember who he is.  So he had to find out who he is.  Almost instantly it is clear he probably didn't work a normal nine to five.  If the movie is about anything, this is what it is about.  What it really is about is the action, good action, and plenty of it.  There is martial arts, a fantastic car chase, and gun play.  The spy talk is slick and interesting.  Damon plays Bourne well and the rest of the cast is also good.<p>Too often, in fact, way too often, movies are made as an excuse to show amazing action sequences i.e. there is no plot (or the plot stinks).  This is one of those films, but Doug Liman, the director, is successful because he never really tells you the film is about nothing because that is what Bourne is trying to find out.  So for a film that falls in the mindless action movie genre The Bourne Identity is exceptional.  Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>As a standalone film, this still works very well. The action scenes, brief and scattered as they may be, are very well done and (mostly) grounded, especially by Hollywood standards. It's not quite as smart as it would like you to believe, but is intelligent enough to avoid becoming a stereotypically brainless puncher, and I enjoyed the constantly-flipping roles of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between Bourne and his handlers. The ending was too abrupt, tying everything up into too neat of a package and omitting a lot of vital details along the way, but I guess that's what the sequels were for.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Matt Damon really comes of age with The Bourne Identity.  A James Bond on Steroids like character that seems to have made the Bond series get more intense with the likes of Daniel Craig as Bond.<br /><br />There is definate passionate action here.  We see a man who is washed out at sea, with amnesia, wondering who he is and why.  Quickly he has an identity, yet too many in the form of multiple passports, and tons of cash, when he goes to a bank vault in Switzerland, that is the only form of information he has on him when he is rescued.  Things go from the darkness of not knowing who you are to a mad rush to escape seeming capture.  Not only that, he has all these amazing skills, martial arts, technical skills, ability to size up things where ever he goes.  What does it all mean?<br /><br />Additionally, as he escapes from one place where armed US Marines are chasing him, he happens along a young woman who is actually a drifter with no real place to go.  He has money, identification, but who is he, and he has an address, lets go there.  We flash back and forth from Bourne on the run and CIA headquarters, where his handlers are wondering where he had been for weeks, now he is run amok.<br /><br />Although a very violent movie from the perspective of fighting and shootings, the movie is simply not bloody or full of gore.  So, you can focus on the action and story, not the gore.  Clive Owen plays a very serious focused asset of the CIA. He is like Bourne, trained to kill.  He says very few words, and comes across as rather intense.<br /><br />Franka Potente does a great job of his unwitting accomplice who gets more and more afraid, yet intrigued as she finds herself a part of international intrigue.<br /><br />Damon, having played in a variety of less action type roles, really pulls off this one.  He still looks like a kid, yet his acting overrides his youthful look.<br /><br />The DVD has some great extras, you are taken behind the scenes with interviews of the actors as they do each part of the movie.<br /><br />More Bourne to come of course as this eventually works its way into a trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>It's an Okay movie with Matt Damon!(Team America LOL) I have not read the book(I don't read novels), So I don't know if it's true to the book or not.Movie is a bit far-fetched,kinda of bond-ish.

I suppose I could get past the stock "CIA-assassination-team" theme, but what I can't get over is the way they turned Bourne from a good guy who lost his memory into a bad guy who lost his memory.  Ludlum (or his family agent) was executive producer, so there's no excuse.  Shame on them for doing that.

With this kind of background it is almost a wonder that this film was ever completed and as a result pre-release expectations were none too high. However, against all odds, Doug Liman (Go, Swingers) has produced a slick and competent thriller.<p>Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac found drifting in the Mediterranean sea after being pumped full of lead and left for dead. After being rescued by a fishing boat and nursed back from to health our hero sets off from Marseille with the intention of trying to rekindle his lost memories. Along the way, much to his bemusement, he not only finds himself pursued by shadowy would-be assassins, he discovers that he has skills and instincts that suggest that he himself may also be a ruthless trained killer.<br /><br />So cue some great action sequences; several impressive fight scenes and an excellent car chase through Paris and enough of the original novel's twists and turns to keep the audience interested. Plus, throw in Franka Potente as an interesting female lead and unwilling companion, Clive Owen and Brian Cox in good supporting performances and two hours slip seamlessly by. However, although detractors will point out that The Bourne Identity is probably not the most memorable movie you will ever see (true), it is also fair to say that this is good old fashioned Saturday night at the movies entertainment and definitely worth a watch if you are looking for something undemanding. Matt Damon, excellent in The Talented Mr Ripley and Good Will Hunting as a credible action hero?  Now there's a pleasant surprise and with several sequels penned by the late author Robert Ludlum, we may not have yet seen the last of Mr Bourne.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>It is first of all an action film in which the whole action goes wrong because the agent did not do what he was supposed to do, he did not kill his target and he got shot at and he lost his memory. The story is unluckily not entirely clear. He forgot his identity. Fine. He did not forget his physical training. Fine because that kind of training has been ingrained so deeply that it has become an instinct of sorts. But how did he remember he had a bank account in Zurich and the number of the bank account, and what's more why did not the CIA close the account since the operation  had failed and the agent was supposed to be dead? This leads to more questions, but that is not really important for the action, though we like it absolutely clean. The message however is not altered at all. The CIA is able to train agents that have become plain robots and that can only succeed blindly in their mission or die or kill themselves if the first two options do not go through. These killing robots are in the hands of bureaucrats who are mostly incompetent and these bureaucrats are in the hands of  politicians who are first and foremost rotten liars. The objective is simple: control the world with puppets who can be anything, democratic tyrants or tyrannical democrats, no matter which or their reverses, provided they serve well, otherwise they die and the human killing robots get into the picture. When this film came out the US were starting to get engaged in the war on terrorism. The picture of this CIA is pretty terroristic to me. We know now, several years later that it was not that competent in gathering information, though it did gather some, but we also know that the politicians who used the information they got were pretty liars and making the incomplete information they got say whatever they wanted it to say. Is that very democratic? At the end of the film, when the politician is engaged in some new lie to the Senate, we are just relieved because the killing robot agent, Jason Bourne, has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into. But the story cannot be finished because the CIA cannot let him live just like that out of the goodness of their heart, for one simple reason: they do not have a heart. In other words, the cold war is maybe finished, but the terroristic spying agencies, politically correctly named intelligence agencies, are still thriving and well. We have not yet reached the country of perfect transparency and total democracy. And we pretend to give lessons to the barbarians who are not part of our club!<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Have you ever seen a movie that was so astoundingly cool, so effortless, so neatly, wonderfully hip, that you wondered why other movie studios didn't somehow find a way to copy its ingredients and bottle it up, maybe weaponize it, releasing into the atmosphere every time they needed a blockbuster?<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" is that kind of movie.<br /><br />Director Doug Liman has taken all of the hyperkinetic and insanely cool techniques he used in the stylish "Go", and translated it over to the espionage genre, playing with the story of Robert Ludlum's best-selling "The Bourne Identity" to create a lightning-paced, sleek, intelligent and absorbing little spy-hunt that manages to out-Bond Bond himself and parallels (and nearly surpasses)Sydney Pollack's white-knuckled thriller "Three Days of the Condor."<br /><br />In many ways, the story in "Bourne" is very close to "Condor": a confused protagonist and his reluctant companion find themselves pursued by a relentless, mysterious and deadly foe. When we first meet up with the movie's nameless protagonist (played masterfully by Matt Damon, who is becoming one of those actor who can charm the camera merely by sleeping---which, in fact, he does in this film)he is clad in a wetsuit, drifing unconscious in the ocean.<br /><br />He is picked up by a Portuguese fishing trawler and discovers he was 60 miles off the coast of Marseilles in the Mediterranean, but how he came there is a mystery. Indeed, everything is a mystery to our hero, for he has amnesia: he can't even remember his own name.<br /><br />He does remember a lot of other things, though: he discovers he can speak German, French, Italian, and Portuguese fluently; he can disarm and subdue two policemen in seconds; he knows how to drive a Mini Cooper *very* offensively; and he's a natural at staking out the opposition. Oh, and he has a laserlight pointer embedded in his hip, with the address of a Zurich bank and a numbered Swiss bank account.<br /><br />A trip to Zurich raises more questions than answers though, as Damon finds a bank-box with a slew of fake passports (one of which has the name "Jason Bourne", his picture, and his 'residence' in Paris), a bundle of money in different denominations, and a gun. Worse still, he has now raised the attention of the police, and is now pursued by them and a series of well-trained and motivated killers who want Bourne dead.<br /><br />To say anything more would spoil the fun of "Bourne", but it is rousingly well paced and intelligently directed. In a sense, "Bourne" is more Bondian than the Bond films, which are slick productions but often try too hard. "Bourne" also boasts excellent acting all around: Damon is great as a man literally searching for his identity while struggling for his very survival, Brian Cox racks up his third great character performance in a year (including his role as General Stryker in "X-Men 2" and his performance in "The Ring"), and Chris Cooper is excellent as a CIA spook.<br /><br />And then there is Franka Potente, one of the most beautiful women in film today, who was the white hot core of the eclectic "Run Lola Run." Potente, who plays a gypsy who helps Bourne, works perfectly with Damon, and the two have great chemistry together. Potente can say more with a quirk of her mouth and a single look than most actresses can with 5 pages of script.<br /><br />The movie has everything you would want from a spy film: good villains, thrilling fight sequences, and a ripping chase through the streets of Paris in a vintage, beat up Mini Cooper. But best of all is Liman's ability to create a very real sense of menace and danger that is ratcheted up with every passing minute. Liman is very good at crafting this mounting atmosphere of peril, and shares much in common with Ridley Scott, particularly a solid feel for juicing up the danger-factor of otherwise innocnet locales.<br /><br />Spymaster John Le Carre once wrote a book called "The Perfect Spy". In praise of Doug Liman, "The Bourne Identity" is The Perfect Spy Movie.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>This is by definately one of the best spy thrillers ever made!

The plot is interesting and tense. The acting particularly by Matt Damon is very strong. The locations in Europe are extremely intriguing.

He wakes up with no idea who, where, or even what he is. He has some skills - languages, and more ominous skills that seem to scare even him. And people are trying to kill him.<br /><br />OK, the "amnesia" plot has been used until it's almost used up. This is really a chases'n'action film, and needed something to get it started. Once the amnesia premise jump-starts the movie, it moves forward very well by itself. Matt Damon did a good job in the title role, except maybe for being too much of a nice guy for the history that eventually catches up to him.<br /><br />I don't normally pay a lot of attention to DVD extras. This has one nice extra, though: a choice of two start and end scenes. The theater edition was good enough, but the extra version was more interesting. It was also more conducive to sequels.<br /><br />If you want a spy/action flick, try this one out.

Entertaining from start to finish, the Bourne Identity is solid crowd pleasing entertainment and a more than solid vehicle for Matt Damon who gives an excellent performance.  The action can lag at some points, and it's nowhere as good as Ludlum's book, but this is still a solid mainstream action pic worth checking out.  Also featuring Brian &quot;the original Hannibal Lecter&quot; Cox and Julia Stiles.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>This film seemed to vanish quickly, so easily confused with about a dozen lesser films about spies and rampant covert operations. That's a shame, because this one is a cut above the rest that may have to wait a few years to get its due. <p>If you like spy films, or just well made action films that don't fizz at the end, you really should add this one to your collection. It's from the Robert Ludlum book, all about a highly and expensively trained covert agent suffering from amnesia. What this film has going for it is the following: <p>Director, Doug Liman, demonstrates an expert hand at action sequences. When master killing machine, Jason Bourne, senses something isn't right, Liman's expert film making begins to ratchet up the tension almost subconsciously. By the time the action comes, the viewer has been expertly brought to the edge of his seat. These action sequences build to a perfect climax of violence that is always satisfying. The fight scenes are among the finest I have seen in any recent film. There is nothing in this director's resume to suggest this, but trust me; he knows what he's doing. All the action has real weight and danger, which is an almost specialized talent for directors. Think Walter Hill. Thing Sam Peckinpah. <p>This movie also has brilliant, believable performances all around. <p>First and foremost among them, Matt Damon simply does everything right in this role. In an action film, often the lead isn't called upon to do a lot of top drawer acting, which is fine. Being believable in an action scene is talent enough, in my book. But in this role, Matt Damon is required to do some old-school, plain old acting, and he more than meets the challenge. See, the hook of this film is the main character, Jason Bourne, is waking up from an amnesia fog and slowly discovers his immense, instinctive prowess as a killer/agent. So the actor must make a shift now and then from moments of confusion and innocence to complete mastery of any physical situation. In addition, the character is slowly coming to the conclusion that the memories he has of his passed life, he no longer wants. In short, he does not want the life he is remembering. Damon is very touching in these scenes, and his acting is very, very solid. His performance here, and in The Talented Mr. Ripley, is so good it makes you wonder why he hangs around Ben Afleck. <p>Franka Potente, the actress who plays his romantic interest, is such an incredible actress. She is simply a pleasure to watch, and she always brings such authenticity to her roles. She is no model turned actress, this one. She demonstrated her action/acting chops in Run, Lola, Run, a few years ago, and it was a brilliant move casting her here. She is simply beautiful in a very unique way, and she can act the socks of the current crop of female leads. Potente always looks in place in al her roles, and it's a damn shame she doesn't get more work. <p>Finally, the smaller parts shine as well. My favorite being the assassin sent to kill Bourne, played with black-eyed menace by Clive Owen. It's a very small part, but crucial, and Owen makes the most of it. Also, the always reliable Chris Cooper and Brian Cox are on board as the sinister, competent bosses of the covert operations. <p>This is really a great addition to any action DVD collection. -Mykal Banta</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>CIA intrigue, political assasins, an amnesiac hero, cool car chases, a lovely damsel in not too much distress, what more can you ask of a spy thriller based on a Robert Ludlum novel? Stop and breathe for a moment and you may realize this is little more than one long chase scene. But the exotic European locations, and believable if not comic book performances move this along faster than a high speed European railway system. It's all pretty exciting, if not complex. Give a CIA assasin amnesia and all sorts of things are bound to happen. But mostly he'll be chased. There's a conviction here that could wipe the smirk off James Bond's face in a moment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Jason Bourne doesn't remember who he is, or why people are trying to kill him.  So begins an extended chase film and action movie.  Considering that Jason has amnesia and doesn't even remember his own name, you can hardly blame him for the mayhem that follows - he's just acting out of self-preservation.  With the help of Marie, he slowly begins to uncover details about his past, including the fact that that he was a highly trained CIA assassin involved in high level operations.  But now the CIA is trying to eliminate him - why?  While on the run from his own government, Bourne slowly makes a transition from confused amnesiac to an efficient combat machine, and at the end shows real touches of being sympathetic and human, even if this isn't entirely credible given his professional resume.  In fact throughout the story he comes across as genuinely concerned for the people close to him, and even while keeping the trained operatives at bay he's presented as a sympathetic character who isn't motivated by revenge or blood-lust, and any violence he causes only happens because there seems to be no alternative.<br /><br />As far as action films go, there's something refreshing about the way that The Bourne Identity has made the transition from Robert Ludlum's popular book to the big screen, despite significant changes to the original.  The plot features a spy thriller narrative reminiscent from the days of the Cold War (although with a post-Cold War setting here), and raises compelling questions immediately from the outset, as viewers share Jason's desperate questions to discover who he is, why he has bullet wounds in his back and details of a numbered Swiss bank account in his hip.  The chase scenes and suspense rarely disappoint, and even though the body count in the film is reasonably high, gore isn't the central interest, and even the fight sequences are for the most part about efficiency rather than eye candy - there's no unnecessary bullets or explosions, and the end result makes the action more believable.  The extended car chase early in the film is one of the best you'll see in the business. Parents should be forewarned about several instances of profanity and blasphemy, but fortunately these don't dominate the film, and even the chemistry between Bourne and his counterpart is muted and relatively tasteful.<br /><br />It's not suitable for children, but mature adults will find some decent entertainment here.  Much of it might be considered cliche and generic, but The Bourne Identity does a good job of it.  Fans of action thrillers will enjoy something that is fast and furious without becoming larger than life or over the top, and with a sympathetic fugitive that is just as much a man as a machine, and who has a real conscience.  This might not redeem the film from all its flaws, but it does go some ways to making it stand out from the average. - GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity brings to the screen the story of a young man dragged out of the Mediterranean Sea and without a clue as to who he is.  His only lead is a bank account in Zurich.  His problems, however, have only just begun...<br />Matt Damon is amazing in his respective role though the rest of the cast fail to follow with the exception of lovely Julia Stiles who seems to have quite a bit of potential.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good, but nothing extraordinary.<br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Just about every Alfred Hitchcock film involved an innocent and everyday man caught up in some plot where he doesn't know what is going on or how to save himself from it.  The Bourne Identity modernises this method.  There's more action, and instead of an everyman in the lead role, we instead have a deadly assassin who doesn't know what he is because he has amnesia as a result of being shot and left for dead.  We follow Jason Bourne as he tries to figure out who and what he is while simultaneously trying to stay alive.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about this film.  The mystery is interesting - we know more about Jason than he does himself, because we see his (former) employers at work, but that only helps keep the plot moving.  I especially like how the action scenes leap out of nowhere - the film turns from exposition or mystery solving to violent, brutish action in seconds.  Finally, the acting and characterisation by the main characters is great - Matt Damon is good as always.  He has a Harrison Ford-like quality of being able to appear frightened and highly competent simultaneously.  He is joined by Franka Potente (little known in America except from "Run Lola Run") who does a very good job in the thankless role of the innocent girl caught up for the ride.<br /><br />The film straddles the line between mystery-thriller and action film.  The two parts blend seamlessly.  Unfortunately, there are a number of little things that pull the film's overall enjoyability down.  Most annoying is the plot surrounding the assassination attempts on an ex-dictator.  Firstly, the dictator is portrayed as a scenery-mashing, bug-eyed monster in a performance that is jarringly out of place in a film of subtlety.  Secondly, there is confusion surrounding the second assassination attempt.  We see in the newspaper the next day that it was successful, but we know (because we saw it) that it wasn't.  What's the dictator's game?  Is he faking his death to escape further attempts?  Is there a cut scene later on where we would have seen him assassinated?  The story leaves this dangling, and it's annoying.  Secondly, when Bourne bribes an official, he uses American money.  Since the action takes place in Paris, why doesn't he use Euros?  Because some people in an American audience wouldn't recognise them?  In a movie that prides itself on being smart, this is a glaring error.  Thirdly, there seems to be no rationale for the CIA to be trying to assassinate Bourne (as opposed to capturing him to find out what happened).<br /><br />While you're watching the film, most would not notice these problems, but upon thinking about it afterwards, you feel like the film was only good and not great.  Another example - if the car chase had taken place in New York instead of Paris, and had Bourne's car been a Lincoln Towncar instead of a Mini, the car chase would not be very interesting.  But it's only on hindsight that these questions arise.  All-in-all, it's a fun and interesting movie, of high quality, as evidenced in the performances of Damon and Potente.<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras like deleted scenes and a director's commentary.  The sound and video are good (as expected).</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>The acting is good, but the directing didn't inspire me. The story has been done countless times, what makes this film so special is Matt Damon's acting. At times when you feel bored and want to walk out of the theater, Matt Damon gives you a surprise, he's actually acting. He adds demension to his character and some vulnerability. The dialogue isn't that bad, but it isn't in the category of "Pulp Fiction", or "Goodfellas." This is way better than the sequal, and I didn't fall asleep, so I recommend "The Bourne Identitiy."</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Matt Damon in his first &quot;action hero&quot; role is very good as the amnesiac Jason Bourne, who wakes up on a fishing ship not knowing anything about his past.  As in all covert agent movies, Bourne is being hunted by his superiors to eliminate him since he failed in his mission.  Damon has the right amount of boyish exuberance and masculine machismo to infuse life and credibility into his unbelievable predicament.  Franka Potente is a good foil and companion for Damon in her role as his reluctant sidekick; her transformation from coquettish flirt to persistent helper is well done.  Clive Owen in a small role as an assassin has a very good scene in which he extols the life of the undercover agent just before he bites the dust. Academy award winner Chris Cooper joins such notables as Al Pacino (Recruit), James Caan (Eraser) as the superior who will go to any lengths to tidy up a mess.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles round out the cast, but their performances are merely acceptable and nothing other talented actors couldn't have done..maybe even better.<br />I didn't see the first version of this (with Richard Chamberlain), so I can't compare; I also haven't read Mr. Ludlum's book..but this is a well done, well directed action movie, and I look forward to the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this.  It was good to see it brought into the 21st century, the 1988 Richard Chamberlain version did follow the book better but Matt Damon was pretty hot as the confused and memory challenged assassin Jason Bourne who wakes up on a ship with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is or how he ended up in the middle of the ocean in a wet suit and a numbered Swiss Bank Account embedded in his hip.<p>Jason soon becomes aware that he is no ordinary man.  He speaks several languages fluently and he can kill silently and efficiently.  All of this adds to his confusion, and we are treated to a mad, frantic dash through the streets of various European Cities as Jason tries to remember who he is and what the word Treadstone means before he ends up on a slab in a morgue...<p>Franka Potente plays the young German woman who helps Jason find out who he is, she is pretty good as his love interest, being both brave and vulnerable in the same breath, you will probably remember her from "Run Lola Run" a quirky little film slightly reminiscent of the concept of "Sliding Doors" but with a sharper more violent edge.<p>"The Bourne Identity" is a fairly fast paced movie that is nothing like the book it is taken from which is a shame because the book is excellent; however this is a good little film in its own right.  Not one that I would have gone to the big screen to see but I do think it is worthy of a DVD and its one I would watch again and again just for the excellent fight scenes and great chases especially the first car chase with a battered mini and some fantastic stunt driving.<p>Enjoyable and very watchable in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a man who's found afloat in the sea with several bullets in his back.

With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.<p>The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller. It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences. What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging. The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes. <p>From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works. Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry. Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond/M:I route with a new love interest in every installment. Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.<p>The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does. Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or M:I).<p>For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris. I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).<p>There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up. Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, &quot;Hey, it's Julia Stiles!&quot;) in a role that could have been played by just about anyone. But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>The story, in brief, is a man is rescued by a fishing boat, with amnesia and bullet holes. In his quest to discover his identity, people try to kill him, and he reacts with professional swiftness. He teams up with a young woman, and together they elude the killers while searching for answers and falling in love.<br /><br />This was obviously written with me in mind. I mean, come on--it's got almost every one of my favorite things: a spy story, action/adventure, amnesia, a romance--heck, the romantic interest is even German. What baffles me is that I'd never read Ludlum's book even though it came out at a time when I was reading a lot of spy novels. I've ordered it.<br /><br />At any rate, I can't say yet how the movie compares to the book, but the movie is excellent. Matt Damon plays a man who doesn't realize he's a professional assassin perfectly--the combination of good-intentioned searching for his identity with the growing realization that he's not just some nice guy who works in an office is very convincing.<br /><br />Franka Potente, too, is very realistic as an adventurous young woman who ends up in over her head, but is reluctant to leave because of her growing feelings for him.<br /><br />The action is nonstop and exciting, and the mystery of who he is and why people are trying to kill him is compelling.<br /><br />This is one of those rare movies I can watch over and over again.

Its cinematic success has launched two equally thrilling sequels to date, featuring Matt Damon as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne.<br /><br />A young man in a wet suit, with two bullet holes in his back, is rescued by the crew of a fishing boat in the Mediterranean Sea.  The young man recovers aboard the vessel, but has no memory of who he is or how he came to be in the water.  His only clue is the number of a Swiss bank account implanted in a metal tube in his hip.<br /><br />The man travels to Zurich and reaches the bank.  His account number provides him access to a safety deposit box, filled with a variety of foreign currencies, a small pile of passports, and a handgun.  The top passport is an American one, in the name of Jason Bourne, with an address in Paris.  The young man goes to the American Embassy in Zurich, where the staff unexpectedly tries to apprehend him and the young man unexpectedly displays astonishing fighting skills in escaping the Embassy.<br /><br />Outside the Embassy, Bourne bribes a rootless young German female named Marie (played with subtle depth by Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris.  Along the way, the two will bond over the mystery of Bourne's identity.  The mystery will deepen in Paris as Bourne realized he is the target of a murderous agency effort to clean up a mistake and as he realizes that keeping Marie alive is now a personal misssion.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" features fast-moving, almost breathless action, lots of spy high-tech and technique, and enough convoluted mystery for at least three movies (and counting).  Matt Damon nicely underplays Bourne as a confused but driven man, aware that the clock is ticking in a game he doesn't fully understand.  The movie narrative proceeds on parallel tracks, as Bourne flees across France, while his nominal CIA boss (played with understated urgency by Chris Cooper) and another CIA chieftain (played with sweaty near-panic by Brian Cox) throw both CIA operatives and law enforcement in his path.  Clive Owen has a nice cameo as another CIA assassin; Julia Stiles is introduced in her recurring role as a Paris operative.  The climax of the movie is Bourne's dramatic entrance into a CIA safe house in Paris, there to learn the truth about his identity.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" is very highly recommended as the thrilling introduction to the Bourne series.  The Extended Edition features a new beginning and ending to the movie designed to the events of 9/11, which somewhat pre-empted the Cold War context of the movie.

This film has one of the best car chase scenes I have ever encountered--with a Mini Cooper, no less!  The book was good, the film almost better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book "The Bourne Identity". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural "Bourne" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff, portrays Bourne as an intelligent, resourceful character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them. Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale. Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre. This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>Matt Damon plays a CIA agent (Bourne) who loses his identity after a botched job. His handlers think he is a rogue agent and call in all "assets" to take him out. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a classy, realistic film. By realistic, I mean not only the various sets in Paris and Switzerland and on a trawler in the Mediterranean, but the fact that Damon, when he is zapping some bad guy, usually finds himself in a hell of a fight. The bad guys are GOOD! That goes to make this a more believeable thriller than, say, MI III, where the bad guys are push overs and our hero is amazing. Damon does a great acting job as a believeably tough guy who can think fast on his feet. There is a sweet, understated love interest with Franka Potente, a fresh screen face, not too beautiful, which also lends to realism, who plays a stranger whom Damon befriends. Adapted from Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name, the screenplay is tight and keeps the viewer wondering, along with Damon, who he is and how he will survive. In essense, this is a chase-and-run flick, with the CIA (again) as the bad guys. They give a good account of themselves, however, but Damon was apparently trained to be the best. I'll take Damon to watch my back any time over Tom Cruise when things go down. Recommended highly.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This has got to be one of the best action films I have ever seen.  Not only does Matt Damon with his superb acting make you believe in the reality of what happens onscreen, but the story is complex and darkly fun.<br /><br />I think what distinguishes this series is how realistic Damon makes it seem.  THere are no techie fixes or superhuman feats, just disciplined improvisation by the ultimate assasin.  Then there is his personal crisis, worked out in amnesia and his desire to start a new life, perhaps with a woman that he is endangering.  Finally, there are the shenanigans of the CIA, with its covert program gone awry and the brutal power maneuvers of the flacks trying to save the situation and their careers.  Very fun and interesting, with a nice space for the viewer's imagination to take hold.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>Yeah, Matt Damon is in this movie.  Yeah, it's got a happy ending.  Ya know what?  It doesn't matter.<p>"The Bourne Identity," based on a classic 1980 espionage novel, stars Damon as an amnesiac fished out of the Mediterranean Sea by a trawling vessel.  The ship's doctor removes two bullets from his back and a strange infrared device from his hip - a device that projects the account number at a Swiss bank.  After spending two weeks aboard the ship and recovering , Damon makes his way to Zurich, where he discovers that he is apparently Jason Bourne, and American who has a dozen passports and millions in foreign currency, along with a gun.  He's also discovering, slowly, that he has training in the art of espionage - fighting, shooting, and getting away.<p>With the James Bond franchise becoming more and more of a self-spoof and a serious lack of decent spy fare since the end of the Cold War, it's a pleasure to see the return of a great action genre.  "Bourne Identity" manages to weave a believable sense of paranoia while introducing enough gadgetry (although it's more of the MacGuyver kind than the Bond kind), nifty fights, and amazing escapes to satisfy.  It's not great, but it's decent enough, and Damon is almost a pleasure to watch in the action-hero role (and the subtle, sexy Franke Portente manages a wide character range in her relatively minor part).  <p>It's worth a trip to a matinee; if not a rental should you happen to miss it.<br /><br />Final Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is a very different thriller, with one of the most intriguing characters I have seen in a thriller.  A body is pulled from the ocean with a couple of bullet holes in the back.  Amazingly, the man is still alive.  He is treated by the ship's physician and slowly brought back to health.  The only problem is that he lost his memory.  The physician finds a metal nugget in the man that projects a bank safety deposit box number.<br /><br />With no clue as to who he is, the man goes to the bank and is able to get to the box with his thumbprint as his identification.  Inside the box he finds a slew of passports, currency and weapons.  Each of the passports is under different names.  He uses the one that says Jason Bourne and when he uses it for travel, the immigration computer sets off a whole bunch of alarms to some CIA operatives that very much want him dead.<br /><br />At a US embassy, Jason eludes his assassins (through some highly refined combat techniques and climbing skills) and asks for a ride from a lady he saw at the embassy.  She takes him, unknowingly putting herself in danger.  The two of them need to unravel Jason's mystery as to who he is, why he has the skills that he has, and why are the government agents trying to kill him.<br /><br />Jason and the woman (Marie) head to Paris to an address that Jason lived at.  There Jason is attacked by a hitman who has photos of both Jason and Marie that were taken back at the embassy.  Suddenly Marie realizes that she is stuck with Jason fighting unknown enemies, just to stay alive.<br /><br />The movie is quite different than the book of the same name but is excellent nonetheless.  Matt Damon appears well cast and all the CIA operatives are excellent as well (Julia Styles plays one of them).  The actress that plays Marie does a passable job and there seems to be a good chemistry that evolves between her and Damon.<br /><br />A non-stop roller coaster ride with some great car chases thrown in.  This movie is one of the best thrillers that I have seen!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity (Doug Liman, 2002)<p>Why we need fluffy remakes of movies has been hotly debated in Hollywood for decades. (After all, it's nothing new. Bunuel's 1977 film That Obscure Object of Desire was the sixth adaptation of Louys' novel Woman and Puppet.) After all, rarely is the remake even watchable, much less on a par with the original.<p>This is one of the exceptions. The new version of The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman of Go fame, contains all the fluff factor of an awful remake yet remains watchable in a turn-your-brain-off way. Jason Bourne is portrayed here by Matt Damon, who shows that he really can be something other than Ben Affleck's geeky best friend. Obligatory love interest Marie is played by indie darling Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), and a well-cast batch of supporting characters keep the acting level higher than one normally gets from this sort of thing while never quite taking themselves too seriously. (The exception to that last bit is Chris Cooper, playing Bourne's boss, but then he's supposed to be a high-strung neurotic.)<p>Good, solid fun from beginning to end. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Action packed...yes...good acting...yes...a bit drawn out...yes...easy to follow...no!!

There are several scenes that keep you on the edge and rooting for the protagonist (though you don't know if he's a good guy or a bad guy).</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Robert Ludlum wrote &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; in the 1980's and it is the quintessential &quot;spy&quot; story. It is a thriller and the characters are so rich and well drawn.  <p>A man is dragged from the sea. He has two bullet wounds and a &quot;chip&quot; embedded into his body. These are removed; the man recovers from this ordeal. He does not, however, remember anything, His name, where he is from from and his entire identity has been lost. He takes the chip and goes in search of himself. In a bank in Zurich he finds his identity- Jason Bourne and several other passports and lots of money. Enough information for Jason Bourne to change his identity whenever he needs to. But what does this mean?  It appears to mean that many people are after Jason Bourne, that he has information that many people want or they want this information to die!! Around every corner is danger and there is no one that he can trust. He meets up with two CIA analysts who appear to be trustworthy, but are they really?  He travels all over Europe and changes identities at every turn. He meets very interesting people at every turn. His life is full of risk and danger.  Jason Bourne is an important person with so much hidden information that he doesn't remember. But as time goes on, the people he meets share some of what he is missing, and he is beginning to put the pieces together.  He begins a love affair, and he thinks this is what he has been looking for. Why can't he be happy as a single man leaving the &quot;spy&quot; profession and finding his true love?<p>The movie stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, and he does a credible job. The action filming is wonderfully done. The car chases and the flights on foot and in trains are very real and I felt I was amongst them. I was part of the action!! Franke Potente plays Jason Bourne's love interest. Chris Cooper is the enemy and as always is a star- a cruel man who completes his job. The scenery is fantastic and brilliant. What I did miss in this movie that was not transposed from the book, is the storyline of Carlos, The Jackal. This is an important part of the book, and is not in the movie at all. Jason Bourne and Carlos have much admiratiion for each other even though they are sworn enemies. This is a significant loss, and the movie does not have the drama, background and richness of the book.  This is, however, a movie to be enjoyed- I understand the sequel, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is out this week. A Must See. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>I was in the mood to watch an entertaining action flick that hopefully had some brains behind it, so I decided to pop &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; into my DVD player (that, and the previews for the sequel looks really good, so I wanted to see this right away).  What I got was exactly what I expected, and then some.  This is a very exciting and sharp movie that is a lot of fun to watch.  There's lots of intense action to be enjoyed from this film.<p>Jason Bourne has a serious problem on his hands.  When he is left for dead and his body is discovered by fishermen, he awakes and realizes that he cannot remember who he is.  His memory is gone and he has no idea why or how he's there.  And even though he doesn't know who he is, he is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat and is a deadly weapon who can take down just about anyone.  When he tries to uncover his past and his identity, he finds people around every corner trying to kill him.  Turns out that he is in reality an agent/assassin for the U.S. government (a very secret branch of defense).  Since Bourne had failed his mission, they cannot afford to have him found out by others, so they know he must be terminated.  Well, Bourne isn't going to take that lightly.  He will take them head on and bring the fight to their doorsteps in order to find out who he is and why they want him dead.<p>This really was a good time.  I haven't been terribly impressed with some of the latest action blunders, so it was nice to see something that was entertaining and was actually smart at the same time.  Another plus is that the film doesn't try to be overly goofy, as a lot of other action flicks tend to be at times.  Granted, there is humor, but it's evenly spread out and is never overused.  Not only does the film have incredible action and fight scenes, but it also has a smart script and great character interaction.  The movie also shows that Matt Damon can be one heck of an action star.  I thought he could never pull it off, but he sure proved me wrong.  He's very believable in his role and he's able to pull of the action scenes with real authenticity.<p>The DVD has a few extras to offer.  First off, the movie looks very good and the sound is also terrific.  Extras that can be found on this DVD include commentary from the director, an alternate ending and an extended &quot;farmhouse&quot; scene, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a great music video by Moby, and some really neat DVD-ROM extras.  I didn't care much for the alternate ending, so I'm glad that they just stuck with what is in the movie.  All in all, not a bad package.<p>&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; can be enjoyed by those who want a smart and clever action movie that delivers.  There's a great script, a fantastic cast, and some out-of-this-world chase/fight scenes.  This was definitely a great time for me and I'm glad I finally got around to watching it.  If you haven't checked it out yet, then I really recommend it, especially if you're an action fan. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>I have neither read the book or seen the original, so taken as a &quot;stand-alone&quot; piece for me, this film works on many levels.  Matt Damon proves his acting prowess here, being able to pull-off action while not being wooden or glib.  Not as easy as one might think.<p>Sure there are the fingerprints of many other films in the genre all over this script and production, but that doesn't prevent it from succeeding where it intends to go.<p>I appreciate the production values and the overall feel -- very consistent and focused.  Franka Potente is a delight as well.<p>All in all, a good start on what is most likely another spy-film franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>In what can only be described as one of the best thrillers to come out of the fantasy factory in recent memory, rising star Matt Damon shows why his career is bound for glory in terms of both incredible versatility and sheer star power. In this loosely adapted version of best-selling mystery author Robert Ludlum, Damon plays the lead part of Jason Bourne, and man who awakes from shock aboard a Portuguese fishing boat with two gaping bullet holes in his back and a terrific case of amnesia. As he lands with some evidence of some puzzling leads in port, he follows the lead and slips into a nightmare world where everyone is chasing him and he has no idea of what is going on. <p>Along the way he enlists the support of an existentially challenged twenty-something woman in search of her life, and the two of them fend their perilous way through the maze of inexplicable violence and mind-boggling subtexts. Thus, discovering through a passport that his name is Jason Bourne, an American living in a sumptuous upstairs flat in Paris, Bourne and the soon to be main squeeze are assaulted by an assassin. And in the midst of all this pounding, he discovers more and more about his assailants, his own mysterious combat capabilities, and finally himself. <p>The cinematography is excellent, and adds to the lure of the film, as does the young main squeeze, a relatively unknown actress (Franka Potente) whose only other screen credit is for "Run Lola Run". One suspects we will be seeing more of her soon. The sets are realistic, and some of the chase scenes are extremely well choreographed, filmed and spliced together in some of the most exciting and memorable heart-pounders in recent memory.  The sporting cast is excellent and quite believable, the plot is a bit sticky but plausible, and as sheer entertainment it is a great afternoon's entertainment. I expect we will soon see a sequel or two, as the Bourne character is certainly an appealing and exciting film figure. Until then, enjoy this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie.  A great little spy thriller, with lots of action and an interesting story.  And the car chase was amazing!  I never got around to reading the book, so maybe I will check that out.  It seems like Matt Damon might have been a little too young to play this part, and I would have expected someone a little older, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.  I would have enjoyed just a little more story in there...things seemed a little too laid out in front of me at times, like they were feeding the story to me, but whatever.  Basically, this is the story of a spy who was thought to have been killed during a mission, but turns up sans his memory.  The agency he worked for, who thought he was dead, seems to have a special interest in not allowing him to live.  He has no memories about his past, but he has these survival skills and abilities that he finds he must use to stay alive.  He slowly starts putting the pieces back together, and discovers his true identity.  All in all, a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  I didn't really care much for the ending, but it didn't spoil the movie.  If you want a tight, fast movie with lots of action and a good story to boot, then get this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a agent for the C.I.A. that lost his memory. While running away from the police he meets a women played by Franka Potente who he offers to pay for a ride. She becomes in danger as well when she's seen with Bourne and now Bourne has to protect her as well as himself.<br /><br />  Matt Damon and Franka Potente's chemestry is excellent. I love the fact that eventhough her life is in danger because of him  she refuses to leave his side even when she can. Franka Potente has an admireable sweetness to her, haven't seen her before but think she's going places as she can act plus the camera loves her.  I liked the Bourne Identity, it's the Fugitive with spys pretty much. It's much better than XXX, I'd rush to see another Jason Bourne movie before I would to see XXX 2.  I really like this movie and I never really get tired of watching it on cable. I love the car chase even if it doesn't last that long. Damon is great as Jason Bourne and I can't wait for sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>This was a fine action movie.  The fight scenes were very good although at times you could tell that the film speed was advanced in order to make it look faster.  It was also a theme that has been explored before (with Jackie Chan's 'Who Am I') with some success.  With all that aside it was still an enjoyable movie.  A movie about assassins and the CIA.  About someone's personal struggle between good and evil and about a fledgling romance and wanting to be a better person.  It was also about betrayal.  This is a decent way to spend a few hours.  Watch it and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>It can be quite disappointing when an actor with screenwriter's talent gets himself tangled up in a genre picture.  Even more disappointing is when said genre picture proclaims itself to be a suspense thriller but turns out to be little more than a punch-and-kick actioner.  With "The Bourne Identity", little Matty Damon grows up, and it turns out that he has a little Steven Seagal in him.<p>That's not to say that "The Bourne Identity" is nothing more than schlocky summer fare.  It can be, at times, quite engaging and provoking.  It's premise -- CIA-trained super-assassin on the run from his former bosses, hampered by severe amnesia -- has a lot of potential for questioning the archetypal hero's persona, and tackling issues of identity.  It further proves the notion, also espoused by "Fargo" and "Insomnia", that the limited palette of beautiful snowy locales (Switzerland and France here) can be an intense and impressive backdrop for a thriller.  And it has a stab at the one storytelling device that I'm a sucker for every time: the unreliable narrator.<p>Damon, plays Jason Bourne, a character that is cold and calculating, but ever ready to spin himself out of his shell and knock the baddies around.  Some of the movie's best psychological moments actually come in these action scenes.  Bourne doesn't know a thing about his previous life, and seeing him realize that he's a lethal fighting machine, right at the moment when he needs it most, is quite thrilling.  Damon does a fine job in these scenes, pulling off both the tormented hero and athletic wunderkind portions of his character.  However, I would have liked to see him inject some more humour into the role.  The opportunities were surely there.  He plays paranoid and coiled the whole time, and after awhile it got grating.<p>One of the film's fatal flaws is that casts, and then wastes, a heap of wonderful actors.  Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles, all actors who've proven time and again that they can deliver interesting and complex performances, are asked to play mere plot devices here.  Cooper is the go-for-broke assassin team leader.  Cox is the worrisome bureaucrat.  Stiles is the prodigious tech-op.  None plays anything resembling a full-fledged character, although all are game in their attempts to flesh one out.  Most disturbing is the work turned in by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje.  He was always terrifying on HBO's "Oz" (as gang leader Adebisi).  But here he is terribly over the top and ludicrous as a recently deposed African dictator.  So much so that the friend with whom I saw the film leaned over to me, after Adewale's first appearance, and asked if we'd accidentally paid to see "Coming to America 2".<p>The one supporting actor who fulfills his/her role nicely is the thinking man's uber-babe, Franka Potente.  The star of "Run Lola Run" plays Marie, who in the hands of a lesser actress would have been little more than a cipher of a love interest.  But Potente injects her with tenderness and vulnerability, while also being sexier than I've ever seen her.  She and Damon have a few truncated love scenes, and what they share together is always sensual, without ever being blatant.<p>Director Doug Liman, whose work I admired in "Swingers" and found problematic in "Go", two movies more concerened with clever dialogue than swift fists, would seem an unlikely fit for a spy thriller.  But he does his best to lay back and let the story take shape.  The opening scene is played almost perfectly, giving the audience as little information as possible, but still allowing them to figure out that the floating body found by fisherman just off Marseilles has an even more terrible story to tell than first expected.  His camera work, for the most part, manages to capture the stunning and stark beauty of his locales.  Unfortunately Liman also, at times, feels the need to play with his new big-budget toys.  So we get a lot of flashy digital information flittering its way across the computer screen.  There's nothing more effective at taking the audience out of a visceral action sequence.  And during the lesser of those action sequences, Liman shows that he too has a bit of Steven Seagal in him (one such sequence has a quick succession of limbs bending in directions they weren't designed to go).  Alas, his editing and choice of close-ups sometimes caused problems: is that Bourne's leg being broken, or the operative sent to kill him?  It got quite confusing at times.<p>In the end, Bourne degenerates from being a perfect, but still humanly flawed, killing machine, to a capital-A, capital-H Action Hero.  Which is far from Damon or Liman's strengths.  I suspect that their instincts should have provided some room for doubt, but the audience never gets the impression that Bourne is in any real danger.  So a film that is still better than your average cookie-cutter spy picture becomes a minor disappointment for all the potential it wastes.</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>Matt Damon plays the assassin whose government employer is trying to apprehend him.

Alas, it will probably not happen because this stupendous film is not perceived as "serious" by the Hollywood snob elite.  Liman is a master of creating breath taking camera shots.  His talent is similar in this regard to the late Stanley<br />Kubrick.  The choreographed fighting scenes and highlights of Europe compel your rapt attention.  You will not be tempted to move your eyes away from the screen even for a split second. I have no idea if the film version is loyal to Robert Ludlum's novel, but this current interpretation is mind boggling effective and beautifully written.  The only thing required of the viewer is to suspend one's logical faculties.  This is not an intellectual Ipcress File or The Spy who Came in From the Cold.  Think James Bond with a dash of Our Man Flint, and allow yourself to be swept away by super spy and assassin, Jason Bourne.<p>Matt Damon surprisingly succeeds as Bourne in this non stop escapist spy thriller.  He easily steps into the role of a CIA controlled agent who has lost his memory.  Why does he have couple of bullet holes in his back?  The lethal talents remain, but is he a good or evil man?  People are trying to either capture or murder him.  One thing leads to another, and our protagonist finds out that he might be a Jason Bourne who resides in Paris.  He also runs into Marie (Franka Potente) who helps Bourne escape from one especially threatening predicament.  And yes, there is the required chemistry exuded by the two lovers during their adventures together.  We learn that a CIA boss (Chris Cooper) relentlessly pursues Bourne to save his own skin.  Bourne failed to successfully carry out a mission and almost certainly will prove to be an embarrassment, if not even a career destroyer of his bosses.  There is never a dull moment in The Bourne Identify.  The remaining cast selection is near perfect.  Damon's youth virtually guarantees that he will be in many more action films.  Another actor who will compete with Damon for these sort of movie scripts is British actor Clive Owen.  Thus, it is only appropriate that Owen shares a few scenes as Bourne's cohort who is now assigned to eliminate him.  Lastly, I predict that a sequel will be made of The Bourne Identity.  This property will be too hot not to do so.</p></br><a href="../users/ANP3R2R4V4GAN.html">ANP3R2R4V4GAN</a><br/><p>I applaud Matt Damon for his writing abilities and The Talented Mr. Ripley was cool too but I'm not sure he's quote an action hero guy.

Matt Damon is cast in the role of a man rescued from the sea by some French fishermen.  He has two bullet holes in his back as well as a small vial under his skin which reveals the number of a Swiss bank account.  He just doesn't know his name or anything else about himself.<p> <p>So far so good.  It's rather intriguing to watch Damon's acting, especially when he goes to the Swiss bank and discovers passports from many countries with his photo as well as lots of cash.  And, by the way, he also finds himself fluent in  French and German as well as English.  <p> <p>All of a sudden, his life is in danger.  And so is the life of the pretty girl, played by Frank Potente, who only meant to give him a lift to Paris and never meant the relationship to develop past that.  Ha Ha!<p> <p>Somehow the CIA is involved and paid assassins are sent to kill our hero.  Chris Cooper is cast as the evil CIA commander.  It's an easy role and certainly below the quality of fine acting demanded in other films such as Seabiscuit and Adaptation.  But I guess that the powers that be know that he'll be good in whatever role is cast his way.<p> <p>There's lots of action, several murders and many chase scenes.  And I think I was supposed to care.  But I found the premise impossible to relate to, and the action similar to that in a thousand other films.  And when the plot got confusing, I actually fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Watching THE BOURNE IDENTITY brings to mind numerous previous spy films in which an agent may be a turncoat and has to be brought in from the cold.  In order for this genre to resonate the audience has to empathise with the agent so that they can feel his concern and his peril.  Car chases, explosions, and exotic locales ought to be used to further cement the relation between viewer and hero, rather than divert the former in accepting the derring-do of the latter. What director Doug Liman presents is a non-stop action thriller that tries so hard to thrill that credibility goes out the window early on.<p>Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is a surprisingly youthful amnesia victim plucked from the ocean by Italian sailors.  He has two bullets lodged in him, yet after only two weeks he is able to do heavy physical lifting.  In a nutshell, these rapidly healed bullet wounds suggest the film's major weakness: the audience is asked to take Bourne's physical presence as reason enough to overlook some pretty big holes placed there by logical slugs.  Bourne does not even know that he speaks Italian, Dutch, French, or German until he faces native speakers of those languages.  His mastery of the martial arts is closer to the fighting of THE MATRIX than to any legitimate style.  <p>There is a scene in which Bourne and a local woman (Franka Potente) are interrupted in a moment of passion by a hired assassin who battles Bourne in a manner more than suggestive of Robert Redford in a like situation from THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, complete right down to a knife sticking out of the assassin's shoe.  Further, the ongoing but futile attempts of the CIA to track what they deem as a turncoat agent seem a pale comparison to a similar hunt from DAY OF THE JACKAL.  What all these logical gaffes suggest is that to create a spy thriller a director need not do more than have a youthful and handsome hero, an equally attractive female lead, numerous hand to hand clashes, and frequent use of exotic locale.  The directors of THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and DAY OF THE JACKAL could offer Doug Liman some useful tips on how to do just that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>C.I.A. Center. Intelligency. Agency. BOURNE !!! ....In the sea almost DEAD ! WHO IS HE ? HIMSELF don't know ! but he know make somethings that only him know ! FIGHT ! KILL ! SURVIVE at any problem ! Somewhere in his memory there is something lost for ever ! THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BESTS ACTION PIRACY that i've seen !!!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>What a pleasant surprise this was!  I had originally hoped to see this when it came out in the theaters, but the multiple bad reviews I read and the two friends I had who disliked it made me take a pass on it.  Now, I am mystified why people disliked it.  I thought it was a first rate spy thriller.  I had only one serious complaint (a scene in which our hero jumps off an extremely high point holding a corpse underneath him to break the fall:  sorry, a corpse isn't a parachute and wouldn't have kept his body from being crushed by impact).  By and large, it was a thoroughly satisfying spy flick.  <p>I never read the Robert Ludlum novel or saw the first version of the film, but I love the premise:  a man is found floating in the Atlantic with two bullets in his back and a tiny canister in his right hip, a canister that contains information about a Swiss bank account.  Gradually, the man, played by Matt Damon, learns that he possesses a perplexing range of skills with languages, fighting, using a gun, being preternaturally aware of his surroundings, and driving a car.  With the help of a young German woman, fetchingly played by RUN LOLA RUN's Franka Potente, he heads off to Paris from Switzerland, where, as they say, the plot thickens.  I like the way that Matt Damon manages to exude a profound sense of self-confusion while learning that his fighting and survival skills were off-the-chart.  He will accidently get into a fight, leaving two or three people severely injured, and he would be profoundly completely rattled by what he had been able to do.  <p>I don't want to exaggerate the merits of the film.  It isn't a masterpiece; it is a highly enjoyable spy flick.  Everything is executed well, and of the supporting cast Chris Cooper stands out as Bourne's "control" in Washington, DC.  I think anyone who enjoys espionage or action films will find this movie well repays the time spent viewing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>DO NOT BE FOOLED: This is not a bona fide "extended" edition. All they've done is scotch tape an extremely poor hard drive quality transferred opening and ending sequence onto the film itself. There is NO seamless branching. Not only that, but director Liman's commentary has been ELIMINATED.<br /><br />To be sure, this is a quality film, but understand this release for what it is: an enticement to rile up attention for the sequel - nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I have been hearing about the Bourne movies for a long time now but I am just getting around to watching them now.<br />I'll make this short as there are already over six hundred reviews for this movie.<br /><br />The good?<br />Great acting, directing, plot, script....pretty much everything was done well.<br />The pacing was perfect also.<br /><br />The bad?<br />I didn't care for the corny, tacked on ending.<br />That's it.<br />Was that short enough for ya? lol.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity comes...<br />Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A5QE86H97FDJA.html">A5QE86H97FDJA</a><br/><p>Slow to get going. The film goes nowhere, and fast. I can't recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>In "The Bourne Identity," audience favorite Matt Damon gets his hands dirty in an role that allows him retain all of his nice guy attitude but also kick tail with the best of secret agents ever portrayed on film.<br />Already having been made into a 1988 TV miniseries, this movie takes some liberies with the cold war plot of the original Ludlum novel but, its still one excellent thriller.<br />A man (Damon) is found floating more dead than alive in the sea by an Italian fishing crew. The captain, who knows a thing or two about surgery, tends to the man's wounds and removes two bullets and a microchip from his back.<br />After he recovers, the man realizes he has amnesia, with no clue to his identity other than a Swiss bank account found in the chip.<br />With no other leads to follow, the man travels to Switzerland and learns that the account is for a safety deposit box. The box contains an exorbitant amount of money, a gun and several passports and identities, one of which is Jason Borne.<br />Deciding to assume the Borne identity, the man barely has time to ponder his next move before a military squad and policemen ambush him.<br />As perfectly cast as Damon is for this role, the real star of the film is director Doug Liman, who hits all the right notes in setting up the drama and delivering with "pulse-pounding high-octane action scenes." Now if that isn't on the next run of commercials I don't know what is.<br />When Bourne begins his escape from his pursuers via a fire escape, Liman doesn't just settle on the quick hop down. Bourne has to scale down the building and Liman pans the camera at just the right angles to show that this isn't something you'd want to try at home...that is, assuming if you lived in a 12-story high-rise.<br />Since no espionage thriller is complete without a romance no matter how trite it may be, Bourne has to meet some unattached female in some manner.<br />While on the run, he meets Marie Krutz (Franka Potente), coincidentally enough, an unattached female in need of some cash. Well, cash Bourne has and he offers Marie $10,000 for a ride to Paris. Guess he doesn't trust the Metro either?<br />Thankfully Marie is not portrayed as the cliched tagalong sidekick and actually significantly helps Bourne in his search for his true identity.<br />Bourne maps out this exhaustive plan for securing some information from a hotel only to have Marie get it by flirting with the hotel attendant.<br />It turns out that Bourne's pursuers are none other than the CIA, or rather a CIA division spearheaded by Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper), who wants Bourne dead while keeping his supervisor (Brian Cox) in the dark as to the real reason he wants Bourne out of action.<br />Rather than prolong the mission any longer than necessary, Cooper sends three assassins to terminate Bourne and tie up the loose ends of the last mission Bourne was sent out to accomplish.<br />Liman introduces the assassins perfectly, having each of them speak as little as possible, and only putting them on camera enough to remind the audience that they are a prevalent threat ... right until Bourne encounters them, at which point they become as threatening as Freddie Prinze Jr.<br />Not that Bourne has it easy escaping the local authorities either. In one of the film's best moments, he and Marie race through the streets of Paris in a mind blowing car chase the likes of which haven't been seen on the big screen in quite some time. Meaning it's done in a manner that won't require audiences to suspend their disbelief to enjoy it.<br />The film's conclusion is a bit unsatisfying but makes sense given the way the story plays out.<br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is certainly an old genre, but the movie turns out good. Although somewhat predictable, it has a much more realistic angle that most films of this type forget. We have a talented professional who forgets it all, which would be a blessing to many in the field, but who shows that what most of us really want (besides freedom) is to know ourselves and to be loved. This film provides both and does it at a good pace.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity doesn't really do anything new as an action film. It just does what it does well.<p>This is just one of those fun flicks to watch, enjoy and quickly forget. In telling the story of Jason Bourne, a CIA super secret agent who loses his memory but retains his spy training and knowledge, the film doesn't break any new ground. It covers all the standard spy genre staples without getting too clich&eacute;d (no outrageous spy gizmos a-la Bond), it tells an interesting story that isn't too overused, but formulaic enough to not be too stimulating, and provides ample excuses to bring on car chases and explosions.<p>Matt Damon adds a star to this flick, his presence always seems to raise the bar of any film he's in. It may not stretch his acting abilities, but it is fun to see him in the role of an action hero, even though his character doesn't remember he is. That amnesia is part of what makes Bourne work as a character. He isn't that confident, self-assured spy you usually get, he's confused and frightened by his physical and mental abilities. This theme of identity adds a lot to the film's atmosphere.<p>In a nutshell, don't expect anything but a good time with The Bourne Identity. It's not a memorable film, but it does it's job well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies where random elements came together to make the movie special. What I mean is: it turned out better than most had expected. There is a lot left to the imagination in such a way that you are not disappointed but actually surprised at it's appeal because you end up filling in the gaps by yourself in a way that is the most entertaining to you. Maybe it's just me, but the Bourne Identity is my favorite movie of 2002.<p>With that said, you won't be disappointed any way it's sliced. It's a spy movie with a ruthless plot and realistic motives that are actually kinda chilling. Nice production value and killer acting. punya. enjoy, don't miss, buy because everything else coming out right now is l-a-m-e (01/03). On a side note, I saw the 80's version and it's pretty dated.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; takes the premise from the marvelous novel by Robert Ludlum and adds a distinctive modern film twist to it. In many respects, Bourne (Matt Damon)is the anti-Bond; he begins as an assassin but, robbed of his memory and hunted because of an assassination he failed to carry out, Bourne tries to stay alive as other assassins are sent to eliminate him. In the meantime, he tries to discover who he is and why they're trying to kill him. He meets Marie (Franka Potenta from &quot;Run, Lola, Run&quot;)and forces her to drive him to the apartment where he lived. While she's frightened, she's drawn to this mysterious and hurt soul.<br /><br /> Director Doug Liman (&quot;Go&quot;) and screenwriters Tony Gilroy (&quot;Proof of Life&quot;, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;) & W. Blake Herron (the forthcoming &quot;Mr. Ripley's Return&quot;) have fashioned a marvelous spy thriller with a number of marvelous set pieces including the infamous carchase with the minis. Visually striking with strong performances by tne entire cast, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is a great way to spent an evening.<br /><br /> I wouldn't, however, recommend the re-release unless you haven't purchased the film previously. The alternate opening isn't quite finished and the alternate ending was available on the previous version on DVD. The biggest drawback, though, is the fact that this edition doesn't have an audio commentary track by director Liman. While there are a number of extras (they are highlighted in the amazon.com list of new features) here that are new, this really isn't all that different from the previous version. If you haven't seen the movie yet, this edition does have a free &quot;ticket&quot; to the sequel so that might entice someone who has rented but not purchased the movie before to get this. Having seen both editions, the transfer appears to be the exact same digital transfer from last year.<br /><br /> A great spy thriller of the type Hitchcock might have made if he were 35 years old and just starting out making movies, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is well worth purchasing but if you bought it before you may want to seriously reconsider getting this edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>Who knew?<br /><br />Because there was all kinds of buzz about The Bourne Supremacy, I decided to watch The Bourne Identity simply out of curiosity. I had never seen Matt Damon in any movie, and was not expecting a whole heck of a lot since I obviously live under a rock and did not realize just what a phenomenally talented actor Damon is.<br /><br />Surprise. This movie is incredibly riveting from start to finish, a true tour de force, and I don't even like spy movies as a rule. The acting is taut, true and not a bit overdone as Damon plays a hired assassin who wakes up on a fishing trauler off the coast of Marseilles with no memory of who he is and what he does for a living. He does not know why he is proficient in several languages, why there are multiple passports, international currency and a heavy duty gun in his effects, and why he has a sixth sense tuned in to danger from bad guys.<br /><br />And bad guys there are, as the CIA et al try to bring him down as a trained automaton gone haywire.<br /><br />Damon runs the gamut of emotions from wary terror to fear to acute frustration to sensitivity (yes, there is a girl, and no, there is no gratuitious sex) in a way that lets him kill in cold blood and still remaine the hero. If you haven't already seen this movie, get your hands on it, because you will not regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>In the commentary on the DVD, Matt Damon admits that this production's intention was to make a gripping film, not one that is faithful to the book.  Director Doug Liman who did "Swingers" in 1996 & "Go" in 1999 accomplishes that with flying colors.  Tony Gilroy who was the screenwriter for "Devil's Advocate" and "Dolores Claiborne" works with W. Blake Herron to produce a screenplay that takes Ludlum's novel as a starting point.  The film is fast paced, moves quickly, is gorgeously photographed on location in Prague and Paris, and is a handsome DVD package to add to your collection.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne surprises us with his action ability while showing the perplexity of someone suffering from amnesia, thrown in an ever-changing situation where his past literally threatens his every moment.  Chris Cooper who just won the best supporting actor Oscar for "Adaptation" and has played increasingly interesting roles in "Horse Whisperer," "October Sky," & "American Beauty," does an excellent job as the manager of a secret program called Treadstone that networks assassins worldwide.  He becomes increasingly agitated until his assassination clears the way for Jason's ultimate freedom.  Franka Potente who played Johnny Depp's girlfriend in "Blow" and is a major German filmstar does a great job as the gypsy-like Maria who is enlisted by Bourne and becomes his willing accomplice.  Clive Owen who was so noticeable in "Gosford Park" doesn't have a lot of lines, but has one of the film's most memorable moments in his death scene in the wheatfield.  Julia Stiles isn't asked to do much, but is interesting in her supporting role as Nicolette who runs Treadstone's Paris office.  This is a film like a roller coaster.  The DVD's deleted scenes are interesting with the one with the psychologist being one I felt could have easily added to the film.  The alternate ending lead me to believe the director picked the right one, but was interesting to view.  I never was absolutely clear on why the agency insisted on Bourne's assassination.  This is a great rainy-day film that I'm pleased to have in my collection.  Enjoy!</p></br></body></html>

The plot throws you into the pool of Sinatra (Bennett marco) nightmare head first. Harvey (Raymond Shaw) is the receipent of the Medal Of honor for rescuing his troop Marco included and saving their lives but Sinatra has these reocurring nightmare where visions of death andn torture are played out ny th ehands of his beloved Harvey, the man who saved his life, the man who is the ultimate good guy! As the film pushes forward we meet some most vile and disgusting people the leader of the bunch is Shaw's mother masterfully played by Angela Landsbury. She not only runs her son life she wants to run the country by controlling her not to bright senator husband poltical career. The utlimate key in to the entire film is a simple deck of cards i truly do not want to give away any of the plot but the ending will leave you jaw dropped! Now as for the atmosphere, acting, and dialogue. Even though color was the mainstay Frakenheimer used black and white to give the film a visual raunch and punch to it in the same vein as Hitchcock's Psycho. The acting is first rate but even though Sinatra's Marco is the central character it's Harvey in the role of the decontruced self loathing Sergeant Shaw who tears the film's dialogue and even adds to the films atmosphere! His cold eyes and chilling english bravado is pure power and the dialogue is witty and always pointed to the plot. For all it's worth The manchurian Candidate has to be seen to be appreciated it never treats the viewer as a viewer but as witness!</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>This is said to be one of president John F. Kennedy's favorite films, and you can see he had good taste in movies. This film succeeds in being a good suspense film and a great psychological drama. Great for smart and  sophisticated viewers, even though it will entertain anyone. Laurence  Harvey and Frank Sinatra are great, but Angela Lansbury is Dynamite as the  cold-hearted mother of Laurence Harvey. Great movie, definitely a  Must-See!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Make no mistake: this movie is about brainwashing. The word "candidate" in the title may make you think it is about politics, and it is, but mostly it is about brainwashing. That the two go together is something the innocent audiences of 1962 found shocking.<br /><br />It is almost impossible to tell you very much about the movie without destroying the complex and subtle plot line, but the basic idea is that the candidate was a hero in the Korean war who spent some significant time in enemy hands. It's not going to ruin it for you to tell you that he was brainwashed by the North Koreans, but the details of the technique make a significant part of the movie, and a significant part of the shock. Angela Lansbury plays the candidate's toxic mother to perfection. Shades of incestuous desire are treated with sufficient subtlety that they got by the censorious early 60s movie review boards. (This was before the days of the rating system, when movies could be killed off altogether if they offended the wrong people.)<br /><br />It's a tight drama with enough plot twists to keep you guessing, no matter how cynical and worldly-wise you are. Keep your eye on the playing cards.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>The 60s and beginning in the 50s, was the age of political assassination.  So many countries including foreign governments used assassination as part of controlling world and  national politics.  This makes the movie fascinating.  There were also instances in the Korean War of attempted brainwashing.  All governments were fascinated by the potential of psychological torture and warfare.  The Manchurian Candidate is a wonderfully made film about a group of soldiers taken prisoner in Korea then brainwashed into being Communist agents without their knowledge.  The American operatives then take hold of them to carry out an assignation of a political leader to gain power.  Very clever, wonderful performances and held back from public view for years after it was released.  Great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Suffice to say the movie had messages from both the Right and Left - with both Conservative and Liberal villains, but politics aside, the film boasts an involving story that keeps your interest for most of the two hours and six minutes.<br /><br /> It featured some very interesting characters who are fascinating to watch. That includes the supporting roles. It didn't hurt to have John Frankenheimer direct, either. His films usually were outstanding.<br /><br />I thought Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey had the best parts of the film. The only really stupid and/or annoying character in the movie was played by Janet Leigh. Her romance scenes with Frank Sinatra added nothing to this riveting film. Eliminated, it would have made for a tighter, even better movie. Also, Sinatra found out too easily where Harvey was hiding in Madison Square Garden. Nobody could figure it out that fast! Nonetheless, the ending was a bit surprising and I won't spoil it for anyone who has not seen this.<br /><br />The movie has endured the test of time and, from what I hear, would have been best left on its own instead of watering down the name of this film with an insipid re-make.<br /><br />This is "The Manchurian Candidate" version you want to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Based on the Richard Condon novel, written by George Axelrod, directed by John Frankenheimer and starring a terrific cast: Frank Sinatra as Maj Marco,tortured by nightmares of an incident he can't remember except as a strange ladies garden party, Lawrence Harvey as a supposed war hero who has been brainwashed to be an assasin when the trigger is used (a little game of solitare) and Angela Lansbury as the most evil mother in the history of movies.  One of the first martial arts fights in American cinema takes place between Sinatra and Henry Silva.  James Gregory plays a McCarthy-like senator who is being manipulated behind the scenes.  A film from another time but still a real tense thriller.  Highly recommended to one and all.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>After returning home from the Korean War, Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is decorated with the Congressional Medal of Honor.  The other members of his unit claim that Shaw saved their lives and showed exemplary courage in the face of daunting danger.  Yet, what each member says seems rote and no one can remember specific details.  When Shaw's commanding officer, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) begins having "nightmares" about his Korean experience, he begins to suspect that Shaw isn't everything he seems to be and that there might be some powerful people with ulterior motives at work.  His suspicions increase when Shaw's mother, Elanor Iselin (Angela Lansbury) begins using her son for her own political purposes.<br /><br />THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is one of the best political suspense films ever made.  The film works on a number of different levels and the issues that it touches upon are still relevant today.  Besides a great story that has been directed with great skill by John Frankenheimer, the film is also notable for its powerful acting performances.  Frank Sinatra might best be known as a singer, but he was just as talented as an actor and stunt person (in the kung-fu fight scene he broke his hand, but for filming purposes it wasn't cast--it never healed properly and he had problems for it the rest of his life). Laurence Harvey isn't as well known as some other members of the cast, but he gives one of the best film performances of his career. Janet Leigh is as beautiful as ever as Shaw's love interest, Eugenie Rose Chaney, but is also allowed to show some range instead of just being a pretty face.  Lastly, Angela Lansbury gives an amazing showing as one of the most evil and wicked woman ever seen on film, Mrs. Iselin.<br /><br />A great drama that anyone interested in film or politics should see at least once.<br /><br />The DVD includes some very good special features including an interview with Frank Sinatra, George Axelrod, and John Frankenheimer; audio commentary with director Frankenheimer; "Queen of Diamonds" featurette with Angela Lansbury; "A Little Solitaire" featurette with William Friedkin; the original theatrical trailer; and a photo gallery.  I most enjoyed the director's audio commentary and the "Queen of Diamonds" featurette.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" was a legendary film when I was growing up. You have to remember that way back then, before cable television and video cassette players, that it was rather difficult to see many of the classic films. I caught "Gone With the Wind" when it was in what proved to be its last theatrical release, stumbled upon "Seven Samurai" on PBS one night, and say "Citizen Kane," "Frankenstein," "The Philadelphia Story," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "Dr. Strangelove," and other classics when they managed to make their way to local art or revival theaters. But back then there were two movies we knew we were not going to get to see, the Marx Brothers comedy "Animal Crackers" and John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate." The former was tied up in some legal entanglement but with the latter the story was always that Frank Sinatra, not only the star but person who owned a controlling interest of the 1962 film, pulled it from release after the assassination of John F. Kennedy until 1988.  However, it appears that the film was shown on television in 1965, 1974 and 1975 (I must have missed it), and then when it was pulled by Sinatra is was because the thought United Artist was cooking the books.  Oh, well.  It was a nice story for all those years and you know the rule about legends turning into truth.<br /><br />With the remake of "The Manchurian Candidate" there should be a renewed interest in the original, which will only serve to reaffirm its deserved reputation in the history of American cinema (#67 on the American Film Institute's list of top 100 movies of all-time).  Few films from that period hold up as well today as does "The Manchurian Candidate."  The story, adapted from Richard Condon's novel by George Axelrod, is complicated enough that a narrator shows up for a few of the early scenes to help us along.  In Korea in 1952 an American patrol is betrayed by their Korean scout and captured by the Communists.  They then return to the United States as heroes, with Sergeant Raymond Shaw being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  He is the step-son of Republican Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory), a Joseph McCarthy like figure whose brains are all in the head of his wife (Angela Lansbury), Raymond's ruthless mother.  But then we find that the leader of the patrol, Captain and now Major Bennett Marco (Sinatra) is having the same nightmare every night, and we have one of the three classic examples of montage in American cinema (along with the shower scene in "Psycho" and the baptism montage in "The Godfather").<br /><br />Marco dreams that he and the patrol are sitting on a stage attending a garden show in New Jersey.  A woman is going on and on about hydrangeas as the camera does a 360 degree pan, but by the time the camera swings back around to its original position the stage is a auditorium in Manchurian and the women on the stage are now communist soldiers.  The scene was shot in six different ways, mixing the two stages, the two audiences, and the two speakers.  As edited by Ferris Webster it seems as if virtually every cut is from one mix to a different one.  The end result is a powerful montage that captures perfectly the unreal sense of what is going on.  It is also a wonderful way of getting a lot of exposition into the scene and if you want a sign of how good this film is then consider how much exposition is worked into various scenes without you noticing that they are going on and on about the big bad plot and such.<br /><br />There are several other nice sequences as well, although nothing could top that particular tour de force.  When a black member of the patrol "continues" Marko's dream the women are now all black instead of white.  Then there is the scene of the press conference for the Secretary of Defense interrupted by Senator Iselin where we see it happening and on television at the same time.  Notice also how Frankenheimer balances these sorts of scenes with those that are done in longer takes usually two shots.  There is more style to "The Manchurian Candidate" than just its most famous scene.<br /><br />Ironically, the biggest probably with believability in "The Manchurian Candidate" is not that Chinese communists could come up with this plot to put their agent in the White House but that Eugnie Rose Chaney (Janet Leigh), would run into Marco on a train, see this shaking wreck of a man, and decide to give him her name, address, phone number, and dump her fiance.  I suppose it was seen as some sort of a red herring, because otherwise you have to wonder what is wrong with that girl?<br /><br />Sinatra considered this his finest performance and I am inclined to agree with his self-assessment, but the same can be said for both Harvey and Lansbury.  Sinatra wanted Lucille Ball to play the Queen of Diamonds, but it is impossible to think of anybody other than Lansbury doing this role and the scene in which she speaks to Raymond, kisses him, and sends him off to fulfill his mission is one of the most chilling in cinema history.  Lansbury and Webster were the only two Oscar nominees from the cast, which is surprising in itself given the film's reputation, but they lost to Patty Duke for "The Miracle Worker" and Anne V. Coates for "Lawrence of Arabia," a pair of votes that are certainly understandable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>In many ways, director John Frankenheimer's 1962 film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE could be considered the first modern political thriller, dealing as it does with the Cold War, the twin threats of Communism and Fascism, and much, much more.<br /><br />Based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel, this masterpiece of suspense and savage political satire focuses on a decorated Korean war hero (Laurence Harvey) who is known for being a cold fish and being manipulated by his politically far-right wing mother (Angela Lansbury, in a performance FAR removed from "Murder She Wrote" and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST).  But a fellow Korean war vet (Frank Sinatra) suspects, because of nightmares he's had, that Harvey may have been brainwashed while both of them were POWs on the Manchurian front.  This leads to all sorts of political machinations, culminating in a climax that was so disturbing to Sinatra (because it had too many parallels to the real-life nightmare played out in Dallas in November 1963) that he had this film removed from circulation for almost a quarter century.<br /><br />Indeed, time has been very good to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, despite the end of the Cold War and the recent, and very good, remake of it with Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, and Meryl Streep.  Sinatra gives probably his best performance as an actor apart from the classic FROM HERE TO ETERNITY under Frankenheimer's incisive direction and George Axelrod's carefully crafted screenplay.  Harvey does a very good job of playing an easily manipulated man; and Lansbury's performance, as mentioned, is absolutely savage.  The chilling implications of brainwashing, humiliation, and political manipulation raised in this film are as important today as they were in the dark days of the Cold War and the anti-communist hysteria of those times, which makes THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE a disturbing classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Although the Cold War is over and George Bush may be best friends with Putin, this scary movie is as timely and valid today as in 1962 when it was released. Some things never change. Ruthless political ambition was alive in Caesar's time; of course Shakespeare's MACBETH speaks to it. Here shortly after the awful McCarthy era, John Frankenheimer directs this great suspenseful political satire. In this movie politicans who disagreed with Senator Iselin were called Communists. Today if you disagree with the political party now in the White House, you are soft on terrorism or don't believe in family values, just to name two. (The list goes on.) One only has to look at the negative TV ads and keep tabs on how much money both political parties raise in this country every four years to be reminded of just how timely this movie is. And directors, God bless them, continue to make movies that resemble-- and sometimes practically mirror-- the actions of those in power. The recent PRIMARY COLORS and WAG THE DOG come to mind.<br /><br />There is no bad acting here although Angela Lansbury is the best of the best and perfect as the ruthless driving force behind her senator husband. (How could she possibly have received co-star billing when she is in the movie much more than Janet Leigh?) We sometimes forget that Sinatra was also a fine actor as well as a great singer although he is wooden in a scene and a bit too much like Joe Friday. The dream sequences are outstanding as are the scenes from the convention. For those who haven't seen the movie yet, the ending is as good as it gets.<br /><br />THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE-- even the name is perfect-- is a great movie to watch on the eve of the political conventions of 2004.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The Manchurian candidate is political fiction at its most forceful on the screen. Laurence Harvey's performance is obsessive fascinating from beginning to end. Frank Sinatra is  top-notch, but Angela Langsbury, as the fanatical communist mother, steals the show.<br />The Manchurian candidate plays fast  and loose with the concept of the brainwashing, with weird angles of shooting as clever device to increase the &quot;dramatis personae&quot; . Many of these camera's positions reminds us several scenes of Citizen Kane (like Senator's murder view from the kitchen's floor). A fluid dolly and truck shots to achieve what is not spoken, let alone explained, as the Gls are put through their paces by an unctuous chinese military psychiatrist.<br />Jarringly powerful, this film is a cold war thriller that typifies the updating and transformations of the film noir. In fact, Manchurian is a contemporary nightmare perpetrated by extremely political thinking. The film uses a great many noir conventions. The atmosphere is corrupt and opressive and even grotesque. The most notable among these correlatives of evil would be Henry Silva as the predatory Chunjin and Angela Langsbury as the aging and ambitious mother. Frankenheimer directed this film with a delicate balance between the physical suspense and an apolinean intelectual puzzle. Eliptical direction and an undercurrent of violence is compounded by the character's overwhelming confussion. But there is still more.<br />The underlying  homage to Hamlet about the troubled relations between  Raymond Shaw and his step father and mother about deciding his future since the first moment he arrives from the war's front, is sealed with the kiss given by Langsbury to his &quot;baby&quot;. So the short speech given by Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra) is a smart device very often used at the theater.<br />This anti-war movie, populated by loosers and con men is replaced by the slick and the pretentious world of politics.<br />Just months after, Dr. Strangelove would crash the screen, and even if both films seems differ conceptually, undoubtly, have common roots.<br />The sixties would produce other renarkable films about related arguments.These were in  crooked  order ; Fail safe (Lumet) , Seven days of May (Frankenheimer again), There comes the russians (Jewison) and the hill (Lumet).<br />And if you order the puzzle with the Bridge over Kwai river (Lean) and then Paths of glory (Kubrick), you'll find once more the archetype cycle of epic, tragedy and comedy.<br />Happily,  there was a film that stopped  (at least by a brief time) all these bitter and dishearten views about the war and renewed the epic sense of the life like Patton was.<br />It's useless to state that Manchurian is the masterpiece  in the notable career of this talented and visionary director.<br />The transfer process on DVD was perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Wanna know why?<br />It has a great story that revolves around a group of men who were brainwashed into being killing machines and the attempt (from one of these men) to solve the puzzle of manipulation and assassination and put their lives back in order.<br />With a screenplay like that, you can't go wrong!!! Director Frankenheimer presents us with a deep study of manipulation vs. character. All the cast is dynamite. The cinematography is superb! The editing is unbelieveble (the dream scenes are a masterclass on film editing).<br />The music by David Amram is unforgetable as is sets the exact tone since the openning titles (the cd is available).<br />Being from a time when the curtain was made of iron, it is a bit dated, but time hasn't dimmed its power to impress us.<br />A multi-layered film that demands multiple viewings, as it deals with social and political paranoia, democracy, personal manipulation and the ultimate individual fight for happiness (which doesn't seem to exist).<p>The director's commentay gives us a lot of interesting information on how the film was made: cinematography, lenses, music, filming process, actors, etc.<p>Playing Solitaire will never be the same!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>It is great. All that needs to be said.<p>But I would like to quibble with the Canadian reviewer who defends Janet Leigh's role. He or she uses the book to illuminate her role in the movie. That same character in the movie may possess more depth than the character in the movie, but that doesn't negate the fact that in the movie the character is poorly drawn and badly written. I wish that they had put the elements from the book into the movie. But they didn't. And her role (though not her performance--she had to make do with the lines she was given) does mar an otherwise almost perfect film.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is director John Frankenheimer's classic. The mesmerizing story of a political and psychological subterfuge is devastating. David Amram's score  is prophetically apt. This is one of Frank Sinatra's finest performances  (he has always been underrated as an actor in my opinion) as is Laurence  Harvey's (also underrated and somewhat forgotten).</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>The original Manchurian Candidate remains a gripping, well executed exploration of paranoia and subterfuge, an impressive feat, considering the film is nearing its 50th anniversary.<br /><br />Those who have seen the remake with Denzel will be familiar with the basic story, but there are enough differences in the plot and plenty of strong performances to make it worth watching this one as well. The original is certainly the stronger of the two versions, with better character development, particularly of the inwardly-tortured, outwardly-icy Raymond Shaw.<br /><br />The special edition has a bunch of interviews with the stars of the original, including Sinatra and Lansbury. I found the restored picture and audio quality to be superb. Highly recommended classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>The Manchurian Candidate is a great political thriller, so timely in 1962 that it wasn't released, and still greatly relevant today.<p>The story of a Sergeant in the Korean War brainwashed to assassinate political candidates was a frightening thought in era it was made. So much that Kennedy's assassination kept this movie from distribution for a number of years. Though the thought of brainwashing a trained soldier to turn on his own country, especially in the manner portrayed in the film, may be a little far-fetched, similar scenarios really aren't out of the realm of possibilities, as the world we live in keeps proving.<p>This early film of director John Frankenheimer (Ronan) is simply very enjoyable. It holds action, drama, and personal conflict all with a satirical edge. The cast, including Frank Sinatra, is good, but Angela Lansbury is particularly impressive as the sergeant's power-hunger mother. More then anything, though, it stands the test of time. The message it gives, that the government needs to be ready for anything all the time, still needs to be heard, learned, and understood today.<p>Even for those that don't like black and white films might take exception to this movie. The story is so modern, it's easy to forget it was made forty years ago. Check this one out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Hard to believe that at the time of it's release that this film's premise was judged to be implausible. As time passes many of this film's ideas have proven to be true.  I have seen the remake with Denzil Washington & Meryl Streep and despite their efforts and Jonathan Demme's skilled direction, they can't hold a candle to this paranoid classic!!  Sinatra has never had a finer role than this and this cements his status as one of the best screen actors of all time!! Laurence Harvey may not have been a great actor since many critics have judged him to be very wooden yet this will probably remain the role he will best be remembered for. As for Angela Lansbury, her Oscar nominated performance as the wicked Mother of Harvey clearly outshines Streep's interpretation of the role.  The only fly in the ointment I find with this film is Italian/Spanish Henry Silva as an evil Mongolian--Hollywood has done it again!!  But this carp aside, this film along with "Seven Days in May" and "Black Sunday" will rank among John Frankenheimer's achievements as a great director.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>John Frankenheimer (no relation to Jerry Bruckheimer) directs this adaptation of Richard Condon's book, with a terrific screenplay by George Axelrod, casting legendary crooner/actor Frank Sinatra as Major Bennett Marco, a former Army Officer plagued by nightmares from the Korean War. Laurence Harvey is excellent as Raymond Shaw, Marco's fellow officer who Marco suspects of having been brainwashed during the war. Angela Lansbury (TV's "Murder She Wrote" and the voice of Mrs. Potts in Walt Disney's classic tale "Beauty And The Beast" [see my review on it]) is terrific in an Oscar-nominated performance as the utterly ruthless Mrs. Iselin, Shaw's mother. Janet Leigh (pre-"Psycho") is cast in a small role as Marco's girlfriend. The film's plot was a little confusing to me at the beginning, but it doesn't detract from the film's greatness. Special features include an audio commentary, featurettes and the original theatrical trailer. Can't wait to see the remake with Academy Award winners Denzel Washington as Major Bennett Marco and Meryl Steep as Mrs. Iselin. This version is rated PG for some thematic elements and mild language.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>A lot of people will disagree with me here, and I won't fault them a bit.  `The Manchurian Candidate' is considered a classic and so just about everyone and their mother is going to be up in arms when they read this review.<br /><br />I just didn't get it.<br /><br />That statement isn't to say that I didn't understand it, it's to say that I just didn't get why this could be considered so grand a film.  It is touted as one of the most chilling and suspenseful political thrillers of all time, but quite honestly I found most of the film rather corny and the other half was plain dull.  The only aspect of the film that kept me entertained was Angela Lansbury's brilliant portrayal of the evil Mrs. Iselin.  She understood how to work with what she was given, stripping away the corn that was so prevalent and delivering a flawlessly chilled performance.<br /><br />So, the film tells of Bennett Marco who is having strange dreams involving the brainwashing of his platoon, all of it having something to do with Raymond Shaw, a decorated war hero whose new title seems to strike Bennett as odd; since Raymond was no hero.  As Bennett starts to unlock the truth, Raymond's dastardly mother Mrs. Iselin gets desperate to have her son complete the task before him.<br /><br />I can understand why maybe this was considered so great back when it was released, but quite honestly, I do see how this can still be considered great.  The plot is simple, yet it is overdone far too much in areas.  The acting aside from Lansbury is decent at best, with Laurence Harvey turning in a dreadful performance (and I thought after seeing `A Room at the Top' that he could do NO WRONG) and Frank Sinatra struggles to define himself here.  He does a decent job in parts, but overall he appears to be struggling.  I also felt that technically the film had some issues, especially towards the beginning, with the voiceover.  I thought that some of the major plot developments were a tad corny, some of them not just a tad, and they took away from the `chilling' aspects of the film.  I also felt that the pacing in the films center was horrible.  It drug out the prose too long and added back story that, if handled properly could have been interesting, but wound up feeling unnecessary.<br /><br />The film starts off on the low side of decent, takes a dive into mediocre and then struggles to redeem itself with a surprisingly riveting ending that just doesn't have enough to completely save the film entirely.<br /><br />Like I said, this is not a popular opinion, but it is mine none-the-less, and any of you who are familiar with my reviews know that I am honest always.  You may love this movie, and if so feel free to defend it (that's what the comment section is for) but I personally just didn't get it.  I adored Lansbury, but as far as political thrillers go, this one lacks any real bite.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I reviewed the subtle subversiveness of the Sinatra version in an earlier issue. How does the update stand up?<br /><br />Well, once they moved the setting to Iraq, cleaned up the muddy surrealism, sobered up the star, and played it straight, there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message. Like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake. Or Chinese cinema. "We will tell you what to think." The locals might mistake it for a documentary. I quit watching after 30 minutes.<br /><br />You just can't carry an entire movie with a "fake war hero via hypnosis" plot. No movie should hinge on a single plot point, and if it does, please don't make it a boring one. No disrespect to Denzel Washington intended. He played Frank Sinatra so well that co-producer Tina Sinatra probably got goosebumps. And what a waste of Meryl Streep. She did a great job and it didn't matter.<br /><br />But hey, one of the beauties of watching DVDs in China is that I don't blow three hours' pay on each movie.<br /><br />As a brief aside, show ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST to 155 Chinese students. This film refuses to tell them what to think, and that confuses the hell out of them. Then they ask you, Mr. Teacher Person, to explain the film's message. Um, it's about your school, but I'm not saying that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>This is a very good movie with great suspense.  The climactic scene was a shocker.  You really should see this movie.<br /><br />Younger viewers may not be familiar with the McCarthy Era in American politics.  Shortly after World War Two ended, Senator Joseph McCarthy went on a witch hunt for communists in American government and media.  The U.S. became paranoid about communists.  It was a very odd occurrence because the communist Russians had just been our greatest allies in the war.  The whole political situation was unbelievable and rather sick.  But it was understandable because friendly Russian bear Josef Stalin was in fact a nut job not to be trusted.<br /><br />This movie gives us a senator to play the part of Joe McCarthy, commie hunter.  The movie makes him a fool, which is very appropriate because he was one, a nattering imbecile.  The movie does an excellent job of portraying him.<br /><br />However, that is where the movie departs from reality.  Yes, Joe McCarthy was an imbecile and a liar, but he did not have a dragon lady for a wife.  In this movie, it is his wife, played by Angela Lansbury, who is the villain of the piece.  She is pulling his strings, and pulling a lot of other strings besides.<br /><br />Her son is a decorated war hero, but his medal was given under false pretenses.  He was not actually a war hero.  He and his entire company were hypnotized and brainwashed by the Russians and Koreans into believing that he was a war hero, when in fact his company was simply captured, flown to Russia, and brainwashed.  The hero murdered two of his own soldiers, at the demand of his capturers, and under hypnosis.<br /><br />One of the best scenes of the movie is when we see the soldiers under hypnosis, acting calm, unaware that they are the object of a demonstration, thinking they are at a ladies horticulture meeting.<br /><br />The war hero returns home to carry out the assassination of a presidential candidate, in order to clear the way for Angela Lansbury's idiot husband (Joseph McCarthy) to move up from VP candidate to presidential candidate.<br /><br />And he is to do it under hypnosis.<br /><br />And his own mother is the American operative in charge of the operation.  Despite the fact that her husband is a commie hunter, she is a communist agent plotting the assassination of an American politician, and using her own son as the killer.<br /><br />I realize that the plot is unbelievable.  It is, and that is a weakness of the story.  The story line is harder to believe than Noah and the ark.  Her own son was used as the killer, without her consent?  What kind of nonsense is that?<br /><br />And what exactly are her plans?  She says that she plans to get even with the communists for using her own son in this project.  Excuse me?  Then why does she cooperate with the project in the first place?<br /><br />Despite the illogical story development and the unreasonable nature of so many of the details, it is still a gripping story with a terrific ending.  There is nothing wrong with Sinatra's acting either, though his character is a bit of a moron for allowing the war hero to disappear for a honeymoon at the crucial time (I couldn't believe what I was seeing when Sinatra allowed the killer to enjoy his honeymoon, putting the entire plot on hold, and leading to tragedy), and for failing to put him on surveillance 24/7 once it was known that he was a hypnotized killer waiting to strike.  Sinatra's character was the most inept G-man I ever heard of, but that's not the actor's fault, it is the writer's.<br /><br />I read other reviews on this site and I see that they all overrated this unrealistic movie.  But it is a very good one because of the suspense and the great ending, despite the fact that it has some very serious flaws as mentioned above.  The biggest flaw is that Angela Lansbury hates the Russians but is still working for them, with the ultimate goal of destroying them, yet willing to assassinate a presidential candidate for the hated Russians.  That whole piece of illogic makes me stop taking the writing seriously.  Whatever, it is a good action flick.<br /><br />The fact that Sinatra, alone, was racing up the stairs to stop a political assassination is pretty dopy.  Why didn't he have a few dozen people on his staff, communicating via walkie talkie, who could have helped him out?  He was an irresponsible idiot every step of the way, though the results are what counts.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>This movies has a great premise, but it's badly executed.  In the end I had more questions than answers.  Like what the heck was Janet Leigh doing in the film?  Her first scene with Ben had absolutely NO chemistry.  In fact, I think Ben only looked at her twice.  He really looked like he wished she would go away.  And what was the whole bit about her name?  Just wasted screen time.  What was the point of the Korean guy coming to work for Shaw?  And if they (The Communist Party) had the whole platoon there why didn't they train all of them to be killers?  10 controlled killers beats the hell out of one.  I kept waiting for someone to *access* Ben as well.  Why did his nightmares stop?<br /><br />How Robert and Joselyn met had me rolling my eyes.  He was bitten by a snake and she just happened to bycling by with ointment???<br /><br />Shaw was just a weak-minded momma's boy and Ben...well, I don't know what to make of him.  He was removed from post and then he wasn't.  There are only two good scenes in the whole film and one great performance by Angela Lansbury.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>I appreciate that this was more or less withdrawn discreetly from public view following the JFK assassination, which it eerily preceded by about a year:  the movie's conclusion shares some elements with that tragic event.<br /><br />But that doesn't necessarily mean it's any good.  The plot is so corny and far-fetched that you will have believability problems throughout.<br /><br />Weeks later, you'll think back on this and won't be able to get the word "corny" out of your head.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This is one of my favourite films because of the performance of the cast and the uniqueness of the story.  One of my favourite scenes of all-time has to be the garden party scene which for me deserves 5 stars already.  I never thought I could hate Angela Lansbury that sweet little old lady from "Murder She Wrote" so much as I did here which to me is a sign of great acting on her part and I thought Lawrence Harvey was excellent here as well.  Sinatra was okay but nothing close to his performance in "From Here To Eternity".  Overall, the film for me was an exciting and chilling thriller although the ending bit with Sinatra's monologue was rather poor as I was hoping for a better way to end what otherwise was a good film.<br /><br />The problem here lies with the DVD which hasn't been restored well leading to a poor overall picture quality although it was nice to have both the Standard and Widescreen versions on either side of the disc but it goes without saying that the best way to view this film is Widescreen.  The sound quality is not that great and there are no special features worth mentioning as well.  Let's hope they make a much better effort with the Blu-ray version with better sound quality options as well as much better picture quality improvements.<br /><br />Entertaining drama although you may want to wait for a better restored version to surface and give this particular version a miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This is a sensational movie, brilliantly directed and acted.  I was not impressed with the Richard Condon novel, and I found it hard to follow.  By contrast, the film moves at a breakneck pace with an exceptionally coherent plot and an electrifying premise and ending.<br /><br />Angela Landsbury is apparently timeless.  She looks the same in this film as she did 20 years later.  Here, she presents her best performance ever as Raymond Shaw's (Lawrence Harvey, putting in a superb performance) evil, scheming mother.  Frank Sinatra is fine in his accustomed tough-guy role.  My favorite actor in this film is Khigh Dhiegh as the sinister, sardonic Yen Lo ("...if kill he must for a better New York, he must do it with humor!...")<br /><br />This film is quite possibly the best and most powerful film ever made about the Cold War.  The basic premise, that an enemy country could manipulate the American political process to gain control of the government, is intriguing and chilling.  Despite the near-demise of Communism, this film has lost none of its impact, and has as much punch today as it did back when it first came out, during the bad old days of the Cold War.<br /><br />The single most striking aspect of this film is the direction.  The manner in which the American soldiers captured by the North Koreans are shown being psychologically conditioned by the diabolical Yen Lo (in the supposed train station in New Jersey) is incredibly well done.  By the way, the film is done in black-and-white, and this is one of those films that benefits from this medium.<br /><br />This film and DVD deserves every one of its five stars.  This is a terrific film and story, with excellent acting and stellar direction.  A must-have.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>For those who only know Angela Lansbury from her Disney connection and her twelve years as TV's Jessica Fletcher, her bold, brilliant turn as the Machiavellian Mrs. Iselin, a role alarmingly slated for Lucille Ball, will startle you. It's a powerhouse performance in a velvet glove, and she is but one of the fascinating characters in John Frankenheimer's prescient, off-balance 1962 masterwork. Obviously a scathing indictment of McCarthyism which has reached mythic proportions, this taut political thriller initially revolves around a platoon brainwashed by Soviet and Chinese officials after their capture in Korea. The plot then settles on two of the soldiers - one is Raymond Shaw, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, whose mother craves power for her Joe McCarthy-like senator husband; the other is Captain Bennett Marco who is haunted by jarring nightmares about the interrogations and a nagging feeling about Shaw. Their storylines eventually merge but not before several unpredictable turns that leads to a breathtaking last half-hour.<br /><br />The writing by veteran scribe George Axelrod (based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel) is shrewd without ever tipping the story's surprising denouement. Of all people, Frank Sinatra plays Marco with often dynamic conviction, though I think he plays the role a bit more heroically and less ambiguously than he should have. Laurence Harvey, on the other hand, plays Shaw, the film's most difficult role, effectively teetering on the cusp of insanity throughout. But hands down, the movie belongs to Lansbury. Whether belittling her buffoonish husband or icily explaining her motivation for attaining power to her son, she refuses to chew scenery and lets the sharp dialogue spew right out of her pouty mouth.<br /><br />Smaller roles are filled interestingly though not entirely successfully. Janet Leigh has a smallish part as Marco's love interest, the best part of which is her seductive pick-up scene on the train. As Iselin, James Gregory captures the bluster and innate naivet&eacute; of a character about to be devoured by his far sharper wife. The stunning Leslie Parrish, an actress who never fulfilled her initial promise, plays Shaw's beloved Josey with a Monroe-like combination of innocence and sensuality. I just wish there was more complexity to Leigh's and Parrish's characters. There are a couple of casting errors - comic character actor John McGiver overdoing it as Iselin's liberal nemesis, Senator Jordan, and Henry Silva, made up as a Korean, as Shaw's manservant Chunjin, who has a wild kung fu fight with Sinatra.<br /><br />Frankenheimer paces the film beautifully and Lionel Lindon's cinematography tightens the close-ups of the characters as the action escalates. The 2004 Special Edition DVD has several extras though none all that outstanding. Frankenheimer's commentary is unfortunately sparse but interesting when he does speak. There is an eight-minute three-way conversation between Sinatra, Frankenheimer and Axelrod filmed in 1988 - too short but interesting, especially for the insight provided on why the film was pulled from circulation after JFK's assassination a year after it was released.  Two rather perfunctory featurettes are included - one focused on Lansbury with the actress participating, and the other on Frankenheimer but only with commentary from director William Friedkin. Regardless, the film is a must-see for anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>MGM has upgraded and repackaged thier DVD version of John Frankenheimer's classic 1962 political chiller just in time for the release of the (pointless!) 2004 remake in theaters. For serious fans of the original version this is actually a good thing, for two reasons: 1. The new anamorphic transfer, and the audio track are a VERY noticable improvement over the first edition. 2. MGM has admirably avoided the usual trick of jacking up the list price-it is the same as the first edition (let's hope this signals a new trend in the industry!). As for the film itself-fellow reviewers have already done a fine job of plot synopsis; just suffice it to say that this one fits snugly into your &quot;Conspiracy A-Go-Go&quot; section right next to &quot;The Parallax View&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Three Days Of The Condor&quot;.

While they're no longer with us, it is fortunate that we, as movie fans, can relish in some of their finest work.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra, Lawrence Harvey, Khigh Deigh, and James Gregory are superb in their respective roles in one of the tautest thrillers in cinematic history. Director John Frankenheimer deserves all the credit for pulling this all together for a film that still rocks after four decades.<br /><br />One can't praise Lansbury enough for her unparalleled performance as the greatest "anti-mother of all time." Lansbury was most certainly shortchanged by Oscar voters when she didn't walk away with the coveted "Best Actress" award the year following the film's release.<br /><br />Supplemental features add "color" to the black and white film as Sinatra, Lansbury, director Oliver Stone, and others, offer their respective opinions on the making of this timeless film.<br /><br />Cast your "vote" for this candidate by adding it to your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"The Manchurian Candidate" was a legendary film when I was growing up. You have to remember that way back then, before cable television and video cassette players, that it was rather difficult to see many of the classic films. I caught "Gone With the Wind" when it was in what proved to be its last theatrical release, stumbled upon "Seven Samurai" on PBS one night, and say "Citizen Kane," "Frankenstein," "The Philadelphia Story," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "Dr. Strangelove," and other classics when they managed to make their way to local art or revival theaters. But back then there were two movies we knew we were not going to get to see, the Marx Brothers comedy "Animal Crackers" and John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate." The former was tied up in some legal entanglement but with the latter the story was always that Frank Sinatra, not only the star but person who owned a controlling interest of the 1962 film, pulled it from release after the assassination of John F. Kennedy until 1988.  However, it appears that the film was shown on television in 1965, 1974 and 1975 (I must have missed it), and then when it was pulled by Sinatra is was because the thought United Artist was cooking the books.  Oh, well.  It was a nice story for all those years and you know the rule about legends turning into truth.<br /><br />Few films from that period hold up as well today as does "The Manchurian Candidate."  The story, adapted from Richard Condon's novel by George Axelrod, is complicated enough that a narrator shows up for a few of the early scenes to help us along.  In Korea in 1952 an American patrol is betrayed by their Korean scout and captured by the Communists.  They then return to the United States as heroes, with Sergeant Raymond Shaw being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.  He is the step-son of Republican Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory), a Joseph McCarthy like figure whose brains are all in the head of his wife (Angela Lansbury), Raymond's ruthless mother.  But then we find that the leader of the patrol, Captain and now Major Bennett Marco (Sinatra) is having the same nightmare every night, and we have one of the three classic examples of montage in American cinema (along with the shower scene in "Psycho" and the baptism montage in "The Godfather").<br /><br />Marco dreams that he and the patrol are sitting on a stage attending a garden show in New Jersey.  A woman is going on and on about hydrangeas as the camera does a 360 degree pan, but by the time the camera swings back around to its original position the stage is a auditorium in Manchurian and the women on the stage are now communist soldiers.  The scene was shot in six different ways, mixing the two stages, the two audiences, and the two speakers.  As edited by Ferris Webster it seems as if virtually every cut is from one mix to a different one.  The end result is a powerful montage that captures perfectly the unreal sense of what is going on.  It is also a wonderful way of getting a lot of exposition into the scene and if you want a sign of how good this film is then consider how much exposition is worked into various scenes without you noticing that they are going on and on about the big bad plot and such.<br /><br />There are several other nice sequences as well, although nothing could top that particular tour de force.  When a black member of the patrol "continues" Marko's dream the women are now all black instead of white.  Then there is the scene of the press conference for the Secretary of Defense interrupted by Senator Iselin where we see it happening and on television at the same time.  Notice also how Frankenheimer balances these sorts of scenes with those that are done in longer takes usually two shots.  There is more style to "The Manchurian Candidate" than just its most famous scene.<br /><br />Ironically, the biggest probably with believability in "The Manchurian Candidate" is not that Chinese communists could come up with this plot to put their agent in the White House but that Eugnie Rose Chaney (Janet Leigh), would run into Marco on a train, see this shaking wreck of a man, and decide to give him her name, address, phone number, and dump her fiance.  I suppose it was seen as some sort of a red herring, because otherwise you have to wonder what is wrong with that girl?<br /><br />Sinatra considered this his finest performance and I am inclined to agree with his self-assessment, but the same can be said for both Harvey and Lansbury.  Sinatra wanted Lucille Ball to play the Queen of Diamonds, but it is impossible to think of anybody other than Lansbury doing this role and the scene in which she speaks to Raymond, kisses him, and sends him off to fulfill his mission is one of the most chilling in cinema history.  Lansbury and Webster were the only two Oscar nominees from the cast, which is surprising in itself given the film's reputation, but they lost to Patty Duke for "The Miracle Worker" and Anne V. Coates for "Lawrence of Arabia," a pair of votes that are certainly understandable.<br /><br />The DVD extras on this special edition of "The Manchurian Candidate" are definitely spartan.  There is a brief conversation with Frankenheimer, Axlerod and Sinatra, and the director provides some commentary on a special track.  My guess is that Frankenheimer talks for maybe half the film at best, but what he does have to say is worth listening to for the inside details on how some of the scenes got shot, production problems, what came from the original novel versus the script, and other fun bits of information.  With the remake of "The Manchurian Candidate" this summer there should be a renewed interest in the original, which will only serve to reaffirm its deserved reputation in the history of American cinema (#67 on the American Film Institute's list of top 100 movies of all-time).</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I saw the remake with Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington and Liev Shrieber about a year ago and liked it but this is much better.  The story captures the obsessions of the era (based on a novel written in the 50's) of the fears of Communism and mind control.  It wouldn't be written today but it's still amazing to watch it.<br /><br />The cast is first rate.  Lawrence Harvey's accent wavers a bit but his stony intensity is perfect for the role of the psychologically damaged young man.  Frank Sinatra is so enjoyable to watch. (I wish he had made more films) Actually I thought Streep did a better job of bringing the creepy psychological stuff to the role; Landsbury is good at being bossy but comes across mostly as a 50's ladies' club woman.  (One can only wonder what Lucille Ball would have done with the role?)<br /><br />The fact that the film was pulled out of circulation by Sinatra after the assination of his friend, JFK, adds another note of pathos to the story.<br /><br />We have a new set of villains these days but this film is so raw and right-on that it's still chilling to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>This is the original "The Manchurian Candidate", released in 1962 and very much derivative of the tensions of the Cold War.  The Cold War context provides its suspenseful and haunting story with a logic denied the recent and convoluted remake starring Denzel Washington and Liev Schieber.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra leads an outstanding cast as Major Marco Bennett, an Army officer recently returned from combat in Korea, who is troubled by strange dreams associated with a patrol for which Sergeant Raymond Shaw (played by Laurence Harvey) was awarded the Medal of Honor.  Bennett, in search of his own peace of mind, makes contact with other survivors of the patrol and ultimately with Raymond Shaw himself.  An encounter with Shaw's Korean houseboy triggers a memory of the patrol different from the account parroted by all the survivors.  Bennett's relentless investigation of this anomaly slowly unravels a murderous plot involving Raymond's manipulative mother (played in an Oscar-nominated turn by Angela Lansbury), and insipid politician stepfather (played by veteran character actor James Gregory), and a group of shadowy Chinese military officers.  Bennett will end up racing against time to defeat the plot, which has as its goal nothing less than a monstrous crime against the American Government.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra has lots of help in this film.  Janet Leigh plays a very understanding love interest.  Laurence Harvey is superb as the lonely and tortured Raymond, manipulated by his enemies in ways he cannot fight and forced into horrific acts.  Angela Lansbury gives a compelling performance completely at varience with her "Murder, She Wrote" personna.  A kiss between Raymond and his mother may be one of the most chilling moments ever captured in an American movie.<br /><br />The DVD provides a crisp black and white rendition of the movie, along with several interesting special features on the making of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to those seeking a superb Cold War thriller featuring a collection of first-rate actors in an excellent story.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>This story of a soldier brainwashed by Reds to kill the President is twisty and unnerving, building to a shattering crescendo.

But this is the great political potboilers of all time. Taken from a novel by Richard Condon, Frank Sinatra wanted to turn it into a movie before he was even approached by the director, John Frankenheimer. "One Take" Sinatra is in his prime. This is his best performance. He had the choice of playing the psychologically damaged, Major Bennett Marco,  or, his sergeant during the Korean War, Raymond Shaw the thoughly "brain-washed & dry cleaned" protagonist. Sinatra's choice to play Marco turned out to be a good one. Lawerence Harvey assumed an American accent & played Shaw to perfection.<br />  Plenty of excellence in acting to go around. I've never seen Angela Lansbury better as the cruel, manipulative, amoral mother of Shaw, Mrs. Iselin. She is the wife of drunk, weak, easily led Senator John Iselin, played by James Gregory in a right on impersonation of you know who. Janet Leigh, John McGiver & Leslie Parrish all give fine supporting performances.<br />  Sometimes you get an all-star cast with everyone at the top of their game. This movie is such a confluence.<br />  The DVD also has a commentary version by Frankenheimer & an interview with Sinatra about the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The story revolves around Sgt. Raymond Shaw ( Laurence Harvey). He has just come back from the war a Medal of Honor winner for saving the lives of his platoon. He is a hero in everyone's eyes from the men in his platoon, to the general public. All except his commanding officer Col. Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra). Marco is suffering from nightmares involving the entire platoon being captured by the Red Chinese and being subject to sadistic mind control experiments, where Raymond is trained as a top assasin. Marco tries to convince the Army that the Medal of Honor was just a front and that Shaw is a deadly killer. However, they also love Raymond and refuse to believe what Marco is saying. Now it is up to Marco alone, to stop Raymond before it is too late. Stop him before he has a chance to play a &quot;little game of solitare&quot;. <p>The performances in this film are phenomenal. Lawrence Harvey is outstanding as Raymond Shaw. We see two sides to the character. The first being Raymond himself who can prove to be a great guy, a jerk, and a nervous wreck all in one. The second is the cold, calculated assasin. Both are done equally well. Frank Sinatra is without a doubt one of the true American legends. Major Bennet Marco is without a doubt the best role that he ever played. I love the struggle of one man against many to prove the truth. This is Sinatra's fight for the whole film. Janet Leigh did a nice job as Sinatra's love interest. John Gregory gives the film's funniest role with Senator John Iselin. He is the puppet and Angela Lansbury is the puppeteer. He does whatever she says. It is hilarious. The best performance of the film, and one of the best I have ever seen period, was given by Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Iselin. One of the most evil and coniving women that I have ever seen in a movie. A truly unforgettable performance. What makes the role so good, is that she is Raymond's mother. <p>&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is the most suspenseful film that I have ever seen. I think the thing that impresses me the most is the fact that the film still holds up extremely well, despite the fact that it was made over 40 years ago. The story itself is amazing. The topic of mind control provides for paranoia, conspiracy, and overall terror and suspense. One of the most chilling phrases that I have ever heard was &quot;How about a nice game of solitare.&quot; The film also provides for tons of action as well. If you are a person who loves suspense, you cannot go wrong with this film. Mind control, government conspiracy, and the fight of one man against many are all woven together to create a well rounded story, and the actors all give the performances of their careers. The DVD is very affordable and offers an interview with Frank Sinatra, and the director John Frankenheimer.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Two actors made this film top notch: Laurence Harvey and Angela Langsbury.  Although only a year apart in real life age, it was completely believable that Langsbury played Harvey's mother in the film.  There is even a malevolent incestuous air about the pair that you can't shake off from the very beginning with Harvey as her helpless, hapless victim.  Harvey returns from the Korean war a decorated hero, much to everyone's surprise, since he's known to be both a mama's boy and a royal pain.  Incredibly, all the men in his unit parrot the same high praise about him and how he is the most wonderful, brave human being they've ever known, despite the fact that they hated him! His mother is married to a U.S. senator who he despises and, worse yet, his mother and this toad have presidential aspirations.  Suddenly, other men from his Korean unit start experiencing hideous nightmares and somehow these dreams relate back to him.  We see them all sitting in a library during the war at a garden club meeting but is that where they really are? Korean military men start popping up in the dreams too instead of the elderly garden club ladies. In 1962, when this film was released, the country was first learning about brain washing that had occurred in the Korean War.  Thus, this film was extremely timely.  It was pulled from distribution for many decades though following President Kennedy's assassination.  The supporting cast, including Frank Sinatra and Carol Lynley, is all quite good.  Harvey was an under appreciated actor in his time and it is good to see that his talent has held up splendidly throughout the ensuing years. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>In order to gear up for Jonathan Demme's upcoming remake of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, I recently caught up with John Frankenheimer's original 1962 film on Public Television (uncut and in widescreen, of course). I had seen this a few months back, but upon watching it a second time, it actually seemed even more brilliant than before.<br /><br /> I won't delve deep into the plot (you can read the Amazon.com review above for a plot summary). I will say that while I did find its satire of McCarthyism just a tad dated, it still has a vivid and even savage bite to it, particularly with its creation of the character of Senator John Iselin (James Gregory), who stands up during a press conference and declares that there are Communists among us. One scene in particular---one in which Iselin pleas with the ultra-controlling Mrs. Iselin (Angela Lansbury) to settle on an exact number of how many Communists there truly are in the State Department---is damn near priceless for its sharp wit. McCarthyism must have been a scary time for many, as mass hysteria took over common sense, and on that level THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE's attacks on it are still pretty potent today (even if it makes the film feel a bit more of its era than some might like).<br /><br /> I can't say I've seen Frank Sinatra in a great many films, but I would be surprised if he ever gave a better performance than he does here as Major Bennett Marco, who eventually pieces together the unspeakable plot of the movie. He brings intensity and some magnetism to the role, and he makes a likable protagonist. As for Laurence Harvey, he nails down Raymond Shaw's cold nature down pat, but when his character starts to bitterly reminisce about his lost love, Harvey is equally convincing in the flashback scenes as a more &quot;lovable&quot; Shaw. (You sorta feel for the poor guy at that point.) And of course Lansbury is memorably evil as Shaw's controlling mother---no wonder her character is considered one of the most memorable villains of the movies. Lansbury certainly doesn't underplay her part, but her performance never becomes distractingly over-the-top either. It's a genuinely classic performance.<br /><br /> You could quibble with the plausibility of the central premise, or even if some of the female characters are absolutely necessary to the plot (I never really figured out why Janet Leigh's Eugenie was in the film---unless of course she was also a controller of some sort, an angle that the movie hardly dwells on). Still, in the face of the intelligent thrills Frankenheimer & co. generate with the premise, those reservations count for little indeed. This is truly one of the classic modern thrillers.<br /><br /> Let's hope the upcoming remake is at least worthy to stand alongside its company.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>Lawrence Harvey was a brilliant actor, but one that tended to put people off with his aloofness bordering on arrogance.  But this movie is not about likable people.  It's about control, dirty politics, communism, and the anti-communist witch-hunts that took their toll on Hollywood and Washington.  Harvey's distance works perfectly as Raymond Shaw, but even in the dis-likable Raymond, Frankenheimer pulls out moments of pathos.  In a tour de force, Harvey is perfect as the man controlled by his mother, by forces the brainwashed him.  He gives a bleak insight into the character of Raymond, a man driven to do things he has no idea why, and man so manipulated by his harpy mother, a 'gun' that has been loaded waiting for the trigger to be pulled, one that kills the woman he loves without hesitation.<p>But his brilliance does not dominate the film, because there are so many other superb performance by this All Star Cast.  And oddly, John Frankenheimer in untypical Hollywood style, cast against roles and demanded such range from all the actors.  Angela Landsbury (Murder, She Wrote) built a career of being the person everyone adored, yet in this film she is the woman behind the man...the true power.  She is hard-edged, totally manipulative, rather ugly in spirit, and determined at all costs to change the face of US politics.  Frank Sinatra, usually Mr. Macho, comes across as a man a tormented by dreams that made no sense, but keep him convinced something is terrible wrong, with him, with Harvey, with all the men of their unit. Many consider this Sinatra's best performance. Janet Leigh is warm as the woman who falls in love with Sinatra, though under used.  James Gregory play Landsbury's husband, the wishy-washy Joe McCarthy-type senator, who is merely his wife's mouthpiece and puppet.  John McGiver gives a fine supporting performance as the voice of reason, a senator who would block at all costs Landsbury pushing her husband's bid for the presidency.<p>The edgy, black and white lensing, gives a dated feel to the movie, but actually enforces the cold war era sensation, a perfect medium for Frankenheimer's anti-McCarthyism rant.  Landsbury won an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe for this performance.  It's well deserved.<p>It's not a likable film, its not a comfortable film and maybe a little hard for younger generations to appreciate the horror, the tension of the cold war and McCarthyism, but is a film so brilliant it needs repeat viewing to appreciate all the small nuances.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>A patrol is captured in Korea and the plot to the Manchurian Candidate begins.<br /><br />Fears of brainwashing, then seen as a weapon of communism, were genuine. During the Korean War normal, patriotic American Soldiers captured by the enemy were seemingly turned, willingly providing statements on behalf of their captors. Psychologically, this was largely the result of torture and mental pressure provided by the communists. But at the time people had to wonder... how far could it be pushed?<br /><br />The scene where the soldiers of the patrol have been placed in a hypnotic state is absolutely brilliant, mixing reality and the perceived reality of the two groups involved. The nightmares and almost reflexive responses given by some of the Soldiers after their return was very well done as well. The directing of the film and the way visuals were used to show differing points of view of the conditioned Soldiers and even the mixing of the reality and the perception as the subconscious mind attempts to deal with what has happened is so wll done as to be a model for future films (if there are any) on the subject of brainwashing.<br /><br />The cast in this film was brilliant, especially Frank Sinatra who had proven by this time to be a very good actor as well as a skilled singer.<br />The DVD's use of the Red Queen in the menu setup is a nice touch and served to bring all the material together.<br />An all-time classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>The Manchurian Candidate is terrifying.  Conspiracy buffs will love this film.  The definition of unsettling is seeing crooner and movie musical star Frank Sinatra giving an Oscar-worthy performance as a terrified man who is in way over his head in a conspiracy he does not understand.<br /><br />This movie had my head spinning with it's description of a powerful corporation and a shadow government.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>After all these years and in spite of a very well done remake, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE of 1962 stands as one of the finest examples of moviemaking in our history.  Director John Frankenheimer and screenwriter George Axelrod brilliantly captured Richard Condon's novel and there are some truly brilliant scenes.<br /><br />*The scene interspersing the ladies club with the communist, Russian and Chinese military men is awesome.  Its calculating manner in which Raymond Shaw is forced to kill two of his comrades is chilling.<br /><br />*When Shaw is playing solitaire in the bar and the bartender mentions "Go jump in the lake", it's repercussions are marvelously chilling.<br /><br />*When Mrs. Shaw informs Raymond of his final task, her evil and chilling portrayal comes to full fruition when she kisses him on the mouth.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury gives one of the best supporting performances on film.  She is brutally manipulative, coldly perverse and demonic.  Losing the Oscar to Patty Duke is understandable in some ways, but Lansbury's performance is just as good in my book.  Laurence Harvey, long panned by critics for his "emotionless" performances is perfect as Raymond Shaw.  Whether his emotionless was intended or not, Harvey still manages to make Shaw a pathetically sympathetic character, who does show his range in his "Gaucho marx" joke and in his love for Leslie Parrish (remember her from Li'l Abner?).  This was his finest moment on screen.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra does an okay job, but his performance is overshadowed by his supporting players.  Janet Leigh is lovely, but her role is so underdeveloped, she could have been left out.  Khigh Diegh (later to be Wofat on Hawaii 5-0) is coldly evil in his brief, but impressive, role.  And good old John McGiver was marvelous as Senator Jordan, a man of conviction.<br /><br />THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a spell binding and still powerful movie.  The people who did the remake were wise to alter some of its plot lines to avoid comparison.  It's rare that both movies are so good but this one has the creative edge.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Richard Condon gained fame with this 1959 novel, which was adapted into a film in 1962 (scenes were shot in Manhattan). This story seemed like science fiction, until we learned about Government experiments in the 1970s. Could a person be hypnotized and made to commit murder? I think the answer is &quot;yes&quot;. But I doubt that the fiction of this film could ever become fact. You should look upon this story as a fable and satire about politics and life.<br /><br /> The opening scenes telegraph that there is something wrong with Raymond Shaw. The scene with the gardening ladies symbolizes use of the military for the wishes of the ruling class. The nightmare of Major Marko tells you that all plans have their faults in the real world. The truth is that the military does teach its recruits to kill on command, and not to suffer guilt afterwards. But it doesn't always work; post-traumatic stress syndrome is the result. Humans aren't machines. Showing traveling by train really dates this film!<br /><br /> The idea behind this film is that of subversion: the leading anti-communists are really Communist agents! Certainly there have been examples of high-level officials who were found to be spies; but they were usually working in the background, avoiding publicity. Marko's attack on Chong-Jee shows how military conditioning can be carried over into civilian life. Eugenia's pickup of Major Marko suggests an E. Phillips Oppenheim story; an intelligence officer should be suspicious of a friendly stranger on a train.<br /><br /> There is symbolism that is troubling. Raymond's mother and step-father are assassinated at the end, but they are Communist spies so its all right. But it raises a question: if a high government official is regarded as a Communist, does this justify killing him? JFK's policies, or sympathies, made some regard him as an agent of Communism. JFK wanted to end the 27.5% oil depletion allowance, advance civil rights, have peaceful relations with the Soviet Union, issue $100 Treasury Notes, etc. Some members of the ruling classes hated him for this. After 11-22-1963 this film was considered &quot;too controversial&quot; to be seen by the public. This novel will be filmed again; I wonder how the story will be changed for modern times?<br /><br /> The costume party shows how opposing politicians can get together and socialize in their spare time. Is politics just another play put on to amuse and distract the voting public? This film portrays politicians as prime movers, not as puppets beholden to their political bosses. [The final scene in the convention auditorium was repeated in &quot;The Parallax View&quot;.] Could a politician sacrifice a child for votes? Dashiell Hammett's &quot;The Glass Key&quot; suggests this could happen. Another troubling feature is placing the solution in the hands of the military (&quot;Seven Days in May&quot;]. Using a foreign-made rifle for the assassination must have put an idea into somebody's future plan.</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>What a movie!!! I got real interested in this movie after they voted Mrs Icelin as the one of the top villianess to the AFI poll on villans and villianess(sic). So I had to see what the fuss was all about, and to be honest, Ms Lansbury was no peach in this role for sure. I am still trying to understand how she could allow her own son to kill folks coldbloodedly, and for personal ambition at that. But the movie itself will keep you hanging on to your seats. My sympathies went to the guys who kept having nightmares on something they actually gone through. And for his wife. She just didn't have a clue nor a chance. A great movie full of suspense, a bit or romance and plenty intrigue. Worth the look</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>1962's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a story of cold-war politics and intrigue that is every bit as engaging today as it was before the purported end of THE cold war. Based on the novel by Richard Condon (author of PRIZZI'S HONOR), the film is usually categorized as a political thriller, though it is often more intense and frightening than many contemporary slasher or horror films due to a depiction of drug-induced brainwashing and subliminal mind control that is not all that improbable (especially now, in light of the vast and astonishing strides that have since been made in medicine and other technologies).  Indeed, after the shooting of President Kennedy in late 1963, many suspected that that THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE may have actually served as a blueprint for the &quot;conspiracy&quot; behind the assassination, and the film's plot seemingly hit so close to home that longtime Kennedy supporter and associate Frank Sinatra, one of the film's stars, used his influence to keep the movie out of reach of the moviegoing public for several years thereafter.<p>The acting in this movie is simply superb.  Frank Sinatra's portrayal of a troubled Korean War veteran is arguably the best of his career, and as the titular character, Laurence Harvey creates a sympathetic yet unnerving portrait of a man whose mind and fate are no longer under his own control.  Angela Lansbury--seen in recent years on TV's popular MURDER, SHE WROTE--gives an outstanding and convincing performance as the conniving and egoistic mother of brainwashed &quot;war-hero&quot; Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey).  There are also good performances from a strong supporting cast, including the beautiful Janet Leigh (of PSYCHO fame) and character actor James Gregory (probably better known as Inspector Luger on TV's BARNEY MILLER).<p>The DVD release from MGM offers a few nice extras, including an interesting and sometimes insightful feature commentary from director John Frankenheimer.  The digital transfer is good, though it could have used some clean-up of scratches and artifacts.  In short, the overall DVD quality and the very reasonable price make purchase of this classic psychological thriller a no-brainer (no pun intended).</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>The very best film of its kind and a must see for Hydrangea lovers.

I was happily surprized at its subtlty.  You get the plot of brainwashing, but then the film explores how it works and how it fits with the psychology of each affected character.<br /><br />Except for his obligatory fight scene, Sinatra is excellent as the ravaged man of duty struggling to fight what has happended to his mind.  While he pales in comparison to Laurence Harvey's psychological journey, this is one of his best acting performances.  The bad guys pulling the strings are also extremely good, and of course one wonders if all of them were exposed...<br /><br />This is such a masterpiece that the only reason I can see to re-make it is that Hollywood has run out of ideas in its never-ending search to make money.  Get this.

The original is more suspenseful than the remake. If you decide you want to see both, even though the endings are not identical, I recommend that you see this version first because the remake has enough similarities to ruin the suspense. Frank Sinatra portrays a Korean war veteran named Bennet Marco who has nightmares about brainwashing with fellow platoon member Raymond Shaw, played by Lawrence Harvey, killing companions upon the order of their captors. The dream sequences are totally surreal, an aspect missing from the remake. Shaw is highly decorated war hero who is dominated by his mother (Angela Lansbury).<br /><br />This domineering mother is married to her second husband, a United States senator who is candidate for vice president of the United States. The plot revolves around attempts of Lansbury's character to make her husband president. Is she just a woman of blind ambition or, is there a much more sinister aspect to the attempt? Meanwhile, Marco (Sinatra's character) seems to be getting a grip and begins to piece together the fact that there is a dangerous plot going on. If I say much more, I will give too much away but, suffice it to say that her son's having been brainwashed plays an integral part in her machinations.<br /><br />In the remake, the brainwashed son, rather than his step father, is the candidate. The remake's version just does not work as well. It is much more plausible that a brainwashed, at times zombie like tool of clever conspirators can be manipulated to be part of a plot rather than being the actual candidate himeslf. Also, the difference in roles played by this character in the two versions leads to a much more satisfying ending in the original. I recommend the original highly. At best, my recommendation for the remake is lukewarm.</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>This is one of those classic films where the remake can never match the groundbreaking visuals of the original.

It is, perhaps, his best movie ever.  Mr. Harvey was perfect for the cold and calculating brainwashed killer.  And Ms. Lansbury is unmatched as the domineering mother.  Never can this tale be told so masterfully as with this cast and this director.  It is a one of a kind gem awaiting discovery by a new generation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>It strikes me that as much as I hate Hollywood remaking its past, the exercise is nevertheless fruitful in getting studios to reissue the original films on DVD and for that I am grateful. In a sort of commemorative celebration of the 2004 remake that has only just hit theaters this week MGM/UA has re-released a special edition of this perversely chilling and suspenseful 1962 thriller. At once a timely and timeless tale of espionage and intrigue, "The Manchurian Candidate" was withheld from distribution for almost a quarter century after President Kennedy's assassination - presumably because its parallels between truth and fiction were just too upsetting for star, Frank Sinatra to get over. Yet despite its disappearance from the spotlight, the film has lost none of its dark potency. The plot is an eerie foreshadowing time capsule of sorts. Former infantryman Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra) is tormented by a perpetual nightmare in which he and his platoon have been brainwashed in Korea. Through a series of conversations with other former fellow POWs, Marco becomes increasingly suspicious of his subconscious as he agonizes ever closer to uncovering the horrific truth. The indecipherable snippets focus on Bennett's decorated war hero, Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey). Like most of Harvey's subsequent roles, he plays a generally cool, aloof loner - this time with a diabolically nattering, hen-pecker of a mother (Angela Lansbury) in tow.  She's a manipulative queen bee, exporting the limited political prowess of her Senator husband, John Iselin (James Gregory) and re-channeling it into something reminiscent of the whole ungodly mess surrounding the McCarthy era. But Shaw is a "sleeper", a brainwashed ticking time bomb set to explode with the detonation of a series of precipitating code words. This is a terrific thriller, one that has suspense, realistic characters, and the kind of riddle within an enigma plot that should both entertain and edify you all at the same time. Director, John Frankenheimer presents this macabre bit of classic film making with all of his usual brilliance and flair for visually stunning and evocative images.<br /><br />The MGM/UA Special Edition DVD delivers very few extras. The best reason for this reissue is a new 5.1 stereo mix and its anamorphic widescreen transfer - both absent from the previously issued DVD. This current incarnation of "The Manchurian Candidate" exhibits a very smooth, surprisingly detailed B&W transfer. The gray scale is generally nicely balanced, though night time photography continues to suffer from a generally soft characteristic and very weak black and contrast levels. Nevertheless, film grain is minimal and fine details are exceptionally realized. Occasionally a hint of edge enhancement crops up, as well as some shimmering of fine details, but these are very rare and absolutely DO NOT distract from one's visual enjoyment. The audio has been remixed and, although sounding strident in some cases, exhibits a vintage quality with good separation and no background hiss. Director John Frankenheimer provides an incredibly detailed and compelling commentary. There's also a very short 1988 snippet from a cast reunion special. Limited reminiscences from Angela Lansbury and another all too short featurette, hosted by Frankenheimer, round out the extras.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>This is a very unsual film, and it's actors fit every part they were cast in.  Story about a group of soldiers kidnaped during the Korean war and taken to Manchuria, where Laurence Harvey is somehow brainwashed and manipulated to respond to commands no matter where or when.  The surreal scene where the soldiers are captured is very unusual, and reminded me a little of the dream sequence in the Hitchcock film, Spellbound, though they are very different.<br /><br />When they all get home, the Major played by Frank Sinatra  begins to have disturbing dreams. He learns that a plot must be uncovered and eventually figures out that Shaw (HarveY) is a trigger man who responds to a card, the Queen of Diamonds, magnificently played by Angela Lansbury.  Frank Sinatra is great as the Major who uncovers the secret and Laurence Harvey plays Shaw the victim of the gross plot.  A true thriller in every sense of the word.  In fact, one the best films I've ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A17D77DFID0GZG.html">A17D77DFID0GZG</a><br/><p>It was an era of great conspiracy and political thrillers -- "Seven Days in May", "Failsafe", and "The Manchurian Candidate" to name a few.<p>I remember seeing this film for the first time years ago in a drive-in movie  theater.  It was the second film to be playing that night (I can't remember  what played with it), and I was all set to use that time to cuddle up with  my date and have some fun.  That, of course, never happened.  This filmed  grabbed me like few others (luckily, my date was just as wrapped up as I  was).<p>This is a chilling, riveting film of political intrigue,  assassination, and ultimate mind control.  It was a film that Frank Sinatra  banned from public broadcast for over 25 years (due, I think, to the  assassination of President Kennedy).<p>Many films have tried to immulate  this shocking thriller, but I can't remember any coming close except those  listed above and "The Day of the Jackel".  (Note:  I said "The Day of the  Jackel" and not the inferior "The Jackel".).  If you've never seen this  film, go out immediately and rent it (you'll want to purchase it after  you've viewed this film -- it is a classic!!).  Between 1 and 10, "The  Manchurian Candidate" gets an unabashed 10.  It is truly one of a kind, and  very, very scary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>I've seen The Manchurian Candidate numerous times now and each time I'm reminded of its classic power. Many movies in the AFI top 100 have meaning in a historical context, but seem very dated when viewed now. In comparison, while The Manchurian candidate "only" reached #67, its message is just as powerful now as it was when released.<br /><br />The story is both simple and impactful. A war hero is "made" by the Communists, and brainwashed. Their idea is to then use him to influence US politics. The brainwashed characters have a variety of mental issues due to the brainwashing, and over time they figure out what is going on. The main brainwashee, Shaw, is unfortunate enough to have his mother involved in the process. In the book she had an actual incestuous relationship with her son, but in the movie it is simply implied that she is that over-the-edge.<br /><br />There are so many little touches here that draw me in. The way the other men have their minds torn by what is going on. The way Shaw himself reacts to what he is going through. This isn't a movie about giant bombs and rockets. It's about the tears and rips in the human psyche when it's pushed beyond all limits.<br /><br />I do have to admit that a scene where Marco (Sinatra) is approached on the train by an attractive woman seems fairly ridiculous to me. It immediately brought to mind the scene from North by Northwest when Grant is approached by the uber-sexy Saint and she pretty much says "hello, sleep with me." Sinatra gets almost the same treatment, and it seemed very over the top. Maybe this is what filmmakers felt happened routinely to any man who stepped onto a train in those days.<br /><br />Another issue strikes me as quite odd. We have three quite powerful females in this story. Shaw's mother is immensely powerful, a force to be reckoned with. Shaw's love, Parrish, is willing to be with him despite the forces that stand in their way. And Marco's bizarre-trusting woman, Leigh, is there by his side. But those three women never interact at all. Their only purpose in the story is to support and interact with their men. Each one is there to bolster their man and push him along to his destination.<br /><br />I don't think in the story that any woman ever talks to another woman. They all are sidelines to their men.<br /><br />It's intriguing to note that this was apparently one of the first ever movies to feature karate style fighting in it. The style seems so normal today, but back in 1962 it was an unusual thing.<br /><br />Highly recommended, both for its historical value and for simply being a fascinating movie with a powerful storyline and fantastic acting.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>URBAN MYTH DEPT.<br />THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE was never withdrawn from circulation after JFK's murder.

Shaw, Marco, and several fellow soldiers are captured during the Korean War. They are transported to China where they undergo intense brainwashing. When they come back, they are all convinced that Shaw (who is well connected politically - his stepfather is a U.S. senator) singlehandedly wiped out countless numbers of the enemy and saved them all. He is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor based upon their testimony.<br /><br />After his return to the States, his handlers intend to use him as a political assassin. Prior to that, Marco and some of the others start having nightmares making them think that everything is not as it seems. Maj. Marco is intent on finding out the truth.<br /><br />I will refrain from telling anymore to avoid spoilers. Suffice it to say, there are lots of psychological machinations and some intense action. This film is very well done. It was made in 1962 so the viewer should not expect lots of special effects, etc. In spite of that, I think that this version is far superior to the more recent one. For those who want to see the movie and don't know which one to get, this is the one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>The remake has nothing on the original(this one),Really good movie, the only good sinatra flick I have seen. A real thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is director John Frankenheimer's classic masterpiece of filmmaking. The mesmerizing story of a political and psychological subterfuge is devastating. This is one of Frank Sinatra's finest performances (he has always been underrated as an actor in my opinion) as is Laurence Harvey's (also underrated and somewhat forgotten over time). David Amram's score is prophetically apt. This is a personal favorite of mine. The images (the deck of cards, Henry Silva's unique appearance, the garden party sequences), situations and dialogue have remained with me ever since I saw it on its initial release. This is incredible filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>The Manchurian Candidate (TMC) not just relic of that Un-War, though.<br /><br />The movie is set in the era just after the Korean War, "now" at the time TMC was released. International communism loomed as the evil empire of the day, represented by the USSR, China, and North Korea in collusion. The idea of mind control also fascinated that time, psychiatry and brain-washing being two of its forms. All of these pieces come together in a suspenseful script: the lead character has been brain-washed as an obedient assassin, and further brainwashed so he doesn't know it himself.<br /><br />TMC's plot builds well, with a few startling turns of script. Almost anything I could say would be a spoiler, so I must be a little vague here. One thing to watch for, though is the irony of the McCarthy character - the scriptwriter found the cleverest possible way to motivate that divisive, destructive character. Another point to watch is in the climactic scene, where the assassin loads the gun meant to kill one crucial man with one shot - count the bullets as he loads the gun.<br /><br />The acting and the style of the movie look a little dated now, especially the fight scenes. All that is in keeping with the time in which TMC was made and the time it portrays. It's a well-made film, one of President Kennedy's favorites, and a strange foretelling of Kennedy's death soon after it was released.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>This is Sinatra's best movie.  There is a great deal of folklore that's grown up around this.  For the record, NO it wasn't taken out of distribution because of the Kennedy assassination: Frank Sinatra owned the rights and withdrew it after a feud with United Artists - eventually forgetting he owned it and was preventing his own best work from being shown.<br /><br />This is another great film the way they used to make them.  The black & white photography is beautiful.  Frank Sinatra plays Ben Marco, a Korean War vet who is plagued by the same nightmare night after night.  Soon, he discovers his whole platoon is having the same nightmare that he is.  The standout performance is Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Iselin - the mother of a brainwashed assassin.<br /><br />Everything about this film is spot-on - the performances, the direction by John Frankenheimer, and the script by George Axelrod.  It is the best, scariest political thriller ever made and it is just as timely as ever.

Career-defining performances and a surprisingly witty, unsettling screenplay make this a film for the ages.<p>Sgt. Raymond Shaw (played with palpable disdain by Laurence Harvey) is thoroughly disliked by his entire unit in Korea . . . that is, until his unit gets nabbed by the North Koreans and subjected to eerie brainwashing techniques.  We don't see the brainwashing, but we see the results in a famous scene where the unit sits politely in chairs in front of what they believe is a sewing circle but in actuality is a who's who of evil communist stereotypes (director John Frankenheimer masterfully cuts between real and imagined audiences, generating laughs as well as chills).  A couple of horrifying murders are committed (poor, poor Eddie Lembeck!), foreshadowing the planned carnage to come.  <p>Back in the States, Sgt. Shaw, winner of the Medal of Honor, refuses to be the political pawn of his mother (Angela Lansbury), who has remarried the fop Senator Iselin (James Gregory, in a masterful performance of boorish incompetence).  Mrs. Iselin, bearing more than the usual motherly devotion to her son, is shocked to hear that Raymond wants nothing to do wtih Senator Iselin's career.  Unfortunately for Raymond, he has no idea how much control Mother has over him.<p>Other members of Shaw's unit, who are robotically convinced that Sgt. Shaw is the best guy in the world, are having nightmares (these nightmares are how we see some of the brainwashing -- very effective).  One, Major Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra, never better on film), is convinced that something is up, because he knows that he never liked Shaw, but that his brain is telling him otherwise.  Initially dismissed as a fatigued loon by his superiors, he doggedly pursues his instincts and tracks down Shaw.  Eventually, they become friends, and Marco learns that not everything is alright with Raymond after Raymond mindlessly walks into a lake in the middle of winter. <p>Raymond, too, has been brainwashed.  In a powerful indictment of the power of political images, the queen in a deck of cards turns Raymond into a robot . . . a robot designed to bring the American political process to its knees.  Senator Iselin, gaining popularity by making baseless charges of Communists in the State Department (in a wonderful scene, Mrs. Iselin deduces a way for Senator Iselin to remember the number of Communists using a certain steak sauce bottle).  <p>The movie constantly unsettles the viewer.  Ben Marco falls for a very unusual woman (Janet Leigh), whose unusual statements keep you wondering if she is a plant by the Communists to keep tabs on Ben.  Repeated images of Abraham Lincoln dominate the picture (and you remember how he ended his presidency).  And most heartbreaking, Raymond is forced to test the bounds of his brainwashing control against the people he loves most of all.  The (near) absolute and total destruction of Raymond Shaw and all that he holds dear (by his mother, no less) is the emotional core of the film.<p>Shot in captivating black and white, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a thriller for the ages.  Pulling few punches, &quot;Candidate&quot; will leave the audience breathless as the tension builds during the final scene at the political convention.  It will also leave you aghast . . . this is the gold standard for political thrillers!</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Frank Sinatra proved time and time again that we was an all around entertainer with his powerful acting job.  Laurence Harvey is outstanding as the doomed brainwashed victim.  But Angela Landsbury steals the show as the power hungry mother.  This movie still sends chills up my spine.  It's director John Frankenheimer's greatest movie he ever made.</p></br></body></html>

The Magician's Nephew probably should've been made a movie. Since it comes first and shows the creation of Narnia, how the animals talk and how the witch got there and how the lamp post even got there. Starting off with everything already there might confuse people who never read the books.<br /><br />  I think since I read the book, it's why I enjoyed the movie so much. But if you haven't you'll be entertained but think the movie is uneven and should explain stuff like how the witch got there and how she got in power. Anyway although those things should've probably been included, this is a very very faithful adaption of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's what it should be like and is pretty much everything I read from the story. I mean the things that are missing aren't from this story, are from the story before it. So this can't be called a bad adaption at all. I guess those critics who gave it ** or ** 1/2 didn't read the books because this is the book about 95%.<br /><br />  Even the casting of Tilda Swinton as the Witch, is just brilliant. She is the part and just the way you'd picture her while reading. The special effects are perfect and should be nominated. The Lion looks great and is sometimes hard to believe he is computer animated. Liam Neeson is well fit to talk for him as well. Like I said Magician'ss Nephew should've been made so people who never read the books know what's going on. Still though the movie is enjoyable either way.<br /><br />  A lot of reviews are even calling the film a yawn. Even Ebert who gave it *** used the word "yawn" in his review header. I don't see how the movie is a yawn at all. Even when you think it will drag on, it doesn't. The movie goes pretty smoothly and isn't boring at all. There's enough wonder and entertainment to keep your attention through-out. Critics are the boring ones. They can sit through a boring 2 hour and 20 minute drama with no complaints. But when a fantasy is 2 hours and 20 minutes with action, adventure and wonder, they call it a yawn ? I doubt all the people clapping afterwards thought it was a yawn. The movie had so many loud and thrilling moments that it should've probably have been PG-13. So no way should the word "yawn" be used to explain this movie. I only think it was probably a little too violent to be PG and the kids voices can be annoying from time to time lol. Those are about my only complaints though.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>There's been quite a few adaptions of C.S. Lewis' book "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe" made. There was a cartoon movie, there was a British TV serial, and now there is a big budget movie, the first in a series of Narnia films. I was very excited when I heard they were doing this, since I'm a very big C.S. Lewis fan. Apart from a couple of very minor hiccups, it was a very fine film indeed.<br /><br />Due to the War the four Pensevie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are sent into the country, where they will be looked after by Professor Kirke. Kirke lives in a rather large house, so there's plenty of places for hide and seek. During on of their games, little Lucy stumbles upon a world within a wardrobe, a world full of talking animals, fauns, nymphs, dwarves and driads, a world where it is always winter and never Christmas thanks to a White Witch named Jadis. Under her reign, Narnia is miserable and oppressed, but there are rumours among the talking animals that Aslan the lion, Narnia's true king, is on the move and that a prophecy is due to be fulfilled.<br /><br />First of all, I've got to say that I'm glad the producers started the series with "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe" rather than "The Magician's Nephew", which as a book worked better as a prequel than as an introduction to Narnia. There's been a lot of fantasies based on books lately, so I'm sure there have been a lot of comparisons to the "Harry Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" film franchises. I've seen most of both of those film series, and I personally like this Narnia film just a bit better than both of them. The plot is fuller and better flowing than the "Harry Potter" films (which I'd be totally lost on without the books, and much more fun and colourful than the "Lord of the Rings".<br /><br />The kids are well cast, they look as I'd imagined them to in the books, more or less. They also look like they care about each other very much, which really helps the emotion and family side of the messages in the film. The White Witch is also played very well. Just like Edmund, you could mistake her for a motherly figure to begin with, but just watch the emptiness in her eyes. Brilliant! The effects are you're typical 2000s blend of computer graphics, prosthetics and blue screen, but they do the job well enough.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien, though a good friend of C.S. Lewis', was never a big fan of the Narnia series. He just couldn't get his head around the fact that all these elements of various mythologies and cultures (fauns, dryads, Father Christmas, etc) were sharing the same imaginary place. Though I think Tolkien was being a little obsessive there (they're just imaginary creatures, J.), he does have a little bit of a point. It must have been a task for the design team of the film to have everything gel together, but they manage to succeed I thought. Narnia's Father Christmas, for instance, is no Santa stereotype in the film. He wears a subdued red-brown suit, is fairly trim, and though he's grey and bearded still has a tinge of red to his hair. Though he chuckles, he never once says "ho ho ho!", and he never once introduces himself by name. This is a Father Christmas that fits in very well with Narnia, I thought.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis was fascinated with both the works of creation around him, and those moments in life where they looked or felt or tasted spectacular. He used to describe them as "the joy". Though the beautiful scenery is mostly in the background, I think director Andrew Adamson had some idea of this, just by the way he sets up some of the shots. As a modern fantasy film, it is rather atmospheric compared to some of its contemporaries, whose plots and scenery just whiz by with no time to smell the flowers. Good job.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis was a devoted and intellegent Christian, and through the plot you can see that (Aslan is like Jesus, who has to die for Edmund's mistakes just like Jesus had to die for ours, etc). In the film, I notice a couple of visual themes had been added. The crossing and falling into the river reminded me a little of baptism for instance.<br /><br />There have been a couple of diversions from the book, some good, some not so good I say. I liked the World War II intro and the 1940s music while the kids play hide and seek, it gave the children's world a little more context which C.S. Lewis (writing in the early 1950s) would have most probably taken for granted. I didn't really appreciate the Hollywood-ness of the wolves. C.S. Lewis (just like Tolkien) was very particular about the words he used, and I don't know what he would have thought about some of the almost action movie villain lines the wolves have. Still, it's really only a minor point, that one.<br /><br />Special features on this version of the DVD include two audio commentaries from the crew and a blooper reel. In this bloopers everyone looks like they were having lots of fun, which is always a good sign. There's also a Narnia "Fun Facts" option, introduced by a relative of C.S. Lewis. When you turn the fun facts on during the film, they pop up, telling you bits and pieces about the making of the film, elements of the story and about the author C.S. Lewis. I'm a pretty avid C.S. Lewis fan, of both his life and his works, but I did actually learn some things. I had never made the connection that he died the same day as President Kennedy. 22nd of November 1963, honestly, that day gets stranger and stranger the more I hear about it...<br /><br />Anyway, I say its a good family film, a great fantasy, great primer for the rest of the series, and though it's not 100% to the book, it's good enough for me. However, I am very much hoping that they do the last half of "Voyage of the Dawn Treader" and the end of "The Last Battle" (my favorite bits of the series) exactly by the book, since they're such vivid and beautiful pieces of writing.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Narnia is another of these tongues in the cheek movies created by Walt Disney Productions as a perfect entertainment device for the family.<br /><br />Four children in the Second War are sent to a big mansion and precisely to run away from the horror of the surrounding reality, Lucy will be the first to discover the magical gate behind of an inoffensive wardrobe who will lead her to Narnia.<br /><br />Once she has discovered it, she will come back with Edmund and finally when the entire crew of brothers trespass the boundaries, the adventure will be  about to start.<br /><br />The inclusion of the sword on the ice remits us immediately to Excalibur, specially when you relate it with the speech of Aslan, once it has returned to life.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is overwhelming as the White witch. The imaginative stages and the rest of the plot are an invitation to us on order to let us carry by the wings of the fantasy in this colossal saga, where the heroism and redemption will liberate to the people of this oppressed land.<br /><br />Or perhaps were we part of a dream into a dream?</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>This movie version of the great novel is very well done.<br /><br />The C.S. Lewis books have long been favorites of mine.  They use the vehicle of fantasy to portray a spiritual message.  The film is very true to the story of the book.<br /><br />It is set during WWII and features four English children who enter a wardrobe and discover a magical world.  They are introduced to Aslan the lion, the White Witch, and many other interesting characters.  The story is full of Christian symbolism.  It is very well done and can be enjoyed by all ages.<br /><br />I highly recommend this superb story.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>Visually stunning, and cast with endearing characters, this was a far more enjoyable film than I ever expected.  I don't know how this could have been done better without making it a much longer movie.<br /><br />Here's all the stuff I loved about this movie:<br /><br />It drew me right in from the beginning in a way I didn't expect.<br /><br />The children were very believable to me.  They acted just as school children of that time period would act, at least to me anyway.<br /><br />Soundtrack that fit perfectly and complimented the story while not overwhelming the visuals and the acting.<br /><br />I really believed those animals were talking!  Surely some breakthroughs were made in CGI.  The voices cast were appropriate for each of the animals.<br /><br />Battle scenes with intensity but not gore.<br /><br />An epic story of betrayal and redemption that one doesn't necessarily need to be a Christian to enjoy.<br /><br />I'll want to watch it through with the commentary tracks someday too.  Here's hoping for sequels!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>Fantasy is probably the best type of story telling out of all the work that has been put on pages and movie screens. With cinema reaching its peek with technology and special effects finally the greatest of the classic fantasy tales can be told. Flying off the coattails of probably the greatest epic ever created: J.R.R. Tolkien's `Lord of the Rings', comes his true life friend C.S. Lewis's Epic: `The Chronicles of Narnia'.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia is 7 stories of a fantasy world that has been under the ruling of Jada the White Witch who was told of a prophecy. Four Human Children would find their way to Narnia and when they did they would allow the true ruler of the world to rise and they would rule along side him as royalty. The first movie `The Lion the Witch & the Wardrobe' is actually the 2nd chapter of the Chronicles and in this story the prophecy is fulfilled. The Pevinse siblings who were sent to the country side of London during WWII stumble upon the world of Narnia through an old wardrobe in their foster home. Then their journey beings as they encounter talking animals, incredible dangers and fantastic magic at every turn. Then the true adventures of Narnia begin.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me I had to miss this movie in the theaters. Being a true fan of the epics like `LOTR', `Harry Potter', `Star Wars' etc, I was eager to pick up the DVD. Unfortunately, people were giving this movie a bad rap. One reason was because it was from Disney, two people were talking about the large amounts of Christian overtones and of course people thought it would be extremely childish and toned down. For once in your lives people, try to forget all of that and just pretend it's an actual movie? I don't think that the people who put this movie together would have wanted to ruin the true story at all. The movie was very well done, it was not the best movie I had ever seen, but it was fun it was exciting and it was not Disneyfied at all. If you are into fantasy and happen to have actually read the book then I am sure you will not be disappointed. If you think about it, no one really was. Because with all the bad rap, Narnia remained in the theaters in the top 10 movies for 4 months and `The Prince Caspian' is set for December 2007 release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I've seen it before so it's not surprising when Narnia did this to me too: it gets poor reviews and it's very polarizing until I watched it and actually liked it. I remember reading the books in one setting and I actually forgot the story to practically all of them. Call it being rushed or just forgetfulness but re-experiencing the story of this one made me like the book even more since it's quite a story anyway you slice it.<br /><br />The Pevensie children are relocated during WW2 and they're sent to live with someone. While playing a game of hide and seek, Lucy the youngest stumbles upon a wardrobe closet. Instead of finding the back of it, she finds Narnia, a magical land with talking animals. Afterwards, she brings in her other siblings, Peter, Susan and Edmund and actually get caught up in a war: Narnians versus those loyal to the evil White Witch. And helping them out is the almighty lion Aslan.<br /><br />It's hard to describe Narnia(or Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter for that matter) without saying stuff like almighty, magical and whatnot but the nice thing about the film is that it doesn't over explain too much. One problem I had with Tolkien books was he explained EVERYTHING, even minor characters got backstories, even swords. Do we care how a magical land exists in a wardrobe closet? I don't so it's great that you just go along with it. There is one big of explaining on a resurrection but that's ok, didn't phase me much.<br /><br />Earlier this year King Kong won for Best Visual Effects which honestly I don't understand, there were composition problems all over the place like they were nearly finished but put in the finished film. Narnia has the same problem but not as extreme. Some shots are actually very well done while other shots are very funky looking(usually involving talking animals). Weta in many respects as a long way to go before they achieve quality shots. ILM has gone past the realm of "obvious CG shots" and Weta is catching up. The better of the 2 in the long run, I got no idea.<br /><br />Acting-wise some have issues with it but I found it pretty solid, especially Georgie Henley as the young Lucy. The other 3 are good but they're not really scene stealers or standouts. Tilda Swilton is of course a perfect White Witch, being over-the-top villainy and relishing in it. And just like Star Wars and Batman Begins and Kingdom of Heaven, Liam Neeson plays Aslan, the all-knowing calm teacheresque lion. Wonder if he'll ever NOT do any father figure roles in the future?<br /><br />It's obvious we're going to get another, and possibly the other 5(apparently Prince Caspian is next) and so far it's a pretty solid entry to the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>The Lion, The With, And The Wardrobe has been a staple of childrens' literature for decades.  Much like The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings.  In fact, Rings author Tolkein and Lewis were friends.  Hmmm.  Drawing parallels.  Peter Jackson took The Lord Of The Rings and awed us and in effect raised the bar for anyone doing a classic series in the future.  Enter The Chronicles of Narnia.  Big budget.  Unknown star.  Walt Disney backing.  What could possibly go wrong.  The answer is nothing.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is visually stunning.  Its epic.  It's envisions Lewis' tale to the fullest extent.  Sure, there are some minor violations of story as prescribed by the novel, and I sure that's going to freak out the purists and C.S. Lewis diehards, but...who cares.  I was always into Tolkein way, way more than the Narnia books.  If the film has any drawbacks it's that, having read the book, it's so exact as to be a bit boring in parts.  You already know what's going to happen.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe was always the most popular of the Narnia saga and it will be interesting to see what they make of the other, lesser-read, lesser-known Narnia books.  Overall...your kids will love this movie because it has everything.  Aldults who read the book may find it sort of tedious in places.  Otherwise, great effort and pure family entertainment.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I was thrilled with this adaption of the C.S. Lewis classic.<br /><br />Since it was a Hollywood movie, I'd hoped that it wouldn't be "Hollywoodized"--meaning that the Christian symbolism would be written out.  On the contrary, it looks like it was happily embraced!<br /><br />(Were there any believers out there who DIDN'T see the visual connection of Aslan's pawprints on the beach in his final scene with the well-known "Footprints" plaque?)<br /><br />For the adults, I'd like to also recommend the 1993 film SHADOWLANDS, which stars Anthony Hopkins as C.S. Lewis and Debra Winger as Joy Gresham.  A lot of insight into his Narnia mindset.  Have plenty of tissues on hand: it will break your heart.<br /><br />For kids, here's to hoping the rest of the series makes it onto film!</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>I grew up on the Chronicles of Narnia books, and was fairly excited to hear that a big-budget movie adaptation was being made. I found that it wasn't terribly disappointing either. The child actors they chose for the pivotal roles did a fine job, and Liam Neeson provides an excellent voice to Aslan. The HD version is very well shot and looks amazing. If you have children, they won't be able to help loving this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>C. S. Lewis was a superb writter. I wrote reviews of all of his Narna books. This film is delightful. It is a pleasure to watch all of the characters, especially the youngest child Lucy who is the most charming. She discovers the magical world of Narnia, which can be entered by going to the back of a wardrobe. The country is suffering a perpetual winter because it is being ruled by the cruel self centered white witch. Fortunately, there is a prophecy that the great lion Aslan will come and defeat the white witch (think of the evils in our world and the prophecy of a coming messiah). He will be aided by four humans who will rule over Narnia. The four are Lucy, her sister, and two brothers. The book and film can be viewed on two levels. People can take the fable at face value and simply enjoy it or they can search for the religious sumbolism that C. S. Lewis intentionally inserted. Either way, it is a delight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.<br /><br />Four children with just their mother in an English town, dodging Nazi bombs, are being sent out to the country for their own safety.  The director starts the movie strong with bombs bursting in air, with one of the kids (Edmond) saving a picture of his father as the bombs are dropping.<br /><br />Their eldest brother Peter takes being the oldest seriously but he is very harsh on his brother Ed as are his two sisters.  Susan is the serious, brainy one.  And little Lucy is the brightest one.<br /><br />With this tense family backdrop, I could relate.  One brother wanting to lead but not willing to take control; a brainy, serious sister lacking imagination; a willful, argumentative brother who takes personal advantage of things despite its consequences; and little Lucy, who is bright with imagination and energy in the face of losing her mother and all four moving in with "The Professor."<br /><br />The bombing scene was a bit fake to me, all CGI.  And the relation with the father is not totally explained.  The family situation with the professor and who he is was unsatisfactorily explained to the viewer (me) as well.  So the beginning gets off the a stuttered start.<br /><br />During a game of hide & seek as they are bored to death in a large house where they're not allowed to run or play (i.e., be kids), Lucy runs into a large wardrobe and off we go.<br /><br />The story moves at a steady pace, has the typical, light Disney magic.  It also has its dark side: betrayal, death, greed, and the use of power to further their own ends.<br /><br />The White Witch is an interesting sort.  Not sure how she became the queen or why winter fell upon Narnia.  Or even why Christmas had not been celebrated there for 100 years.  She brought new meaning to the term "ice princess" in my eyes!<br /><br />The film is visually stunning.  The mountains, the griffins and satyrs, the mermaids and lofty towers of castles.  And the dark & stark white prisons, Aslan's death by assassination -- these are all pretty strong for children and thus the PG rating.<br /><br />Too much is not explained to my satisfaction at the start, more of a background history of some of the characters, why they're acting as they are, what their relationships are, are skimmed over.<br /><br />However, the great acting by Georgie Henley, William Moseley, Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell as the four English children (my, those accents!) lift the movie to be more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Recommended, not only for an exploration into the mind of C.S. Lewis and his brand of fantasy novels but also for the exploration of family and friend relationships, honor and majesty.<br /><br />The DVD is cool as well with fascinating facts (JRR Tolkien & C.S. Lewis were contemporaries and often checked each others' work), some bloopers, and two sets of commentaries by the stars and by the director.  It was also fun to see that Industrial Light and Magic in the San Francisco area had a part in the production of this film.  To see the credits, New Zealand, England, Czech Republic, man these guys have been all over!  But I digress.<br /><br />I well-made piece of entertainment.<br /><br />Can't wait to explore the next film, Prince Caspian, as well as a heightened interest in C.S.

Covered in snow, Narnia is full of weird and wonderful creatures, but is watched over by the evil White Witch, Jadis.

The actors that play the kids could have been better but they do a good job.  The fight at the end isn't that intense, but the execution of Aslan is pretty rough for kids.

And like many families of the time, the parents decide to send them to the country for safer keeping. Peter, the oldest, is told by their mother to "watch over them" and make sure they stay safe. And although this seems like a fairly simple request, Peter's ability to protect his siblings will be put to the ultimate test. But not by WW II, but by an amazing secret discovered by young Lucy.<br /><br />Soon after being spirited into the company of a hermit-like professor's care (Jim Broadbent), they decide to play hide-and-seek, and it's during this game which Lucy discovers a mysterious wardrobe. She tucks herself inside and backs to the rear of the cabinet ...only to discover herself in an entirely different world. Here she meets up with Mr. Tumnus, a strange half-stag, half-human creature who explains much about the wintry landscape Lucy now finds herself in. The place is called Narnia, and it's been locked in winter for over 100 years by someone known as "The White Witch" (who claims to be the Queen of Narnia).<br /><br />Lucy, excited beyond words, rushes back to "the real world" to tell her brothers and sister about what she's discovered and, of course, they don't believe her ...until they all get into the wardrobe one day and find out she's been telling the truth.<br /><br />Soon a prophecy is revealed to the two brothers and two sisters: it is said that when Aslan returns, two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam will come back and reclaim the four thrones of Narnia. But first they have to battle The White Witch, struggle with the internal dynamics of sibling rivalries, and face the death of the very creature who helped create this strange world.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Comparisons abound between NARNIA and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. And why not. Both are fantasy tales. Both authors (Lewis and Tolkien) were friends during the same era. And both stories have recently made it to the silver screen. And although my heart still rests with THE LORD OF THE RINGS, NARNIA deserves much praise.<br /><br />But this praise doesn't necessarily come from me...<br /><br />I went to the theater today (a weekend) and it was packed with children (ranging in age from their teens to five years old), and while watching it I noticed something intriguing: not a single interruption occurred during the entire 140 minutes. No crying child asking to go home; no temper tantrums; no shushing of mothers and fathers to their kids. I think this speaks pretty highly of how engaged this film kept its intended audience. I will say that when Aslan became "injured" there were gasps of dismay from a couple of kids behind me and they quietly asked their mother if "Aslan was going to be okay" (I have to admit, that was pretty cute).<br /><br />Georgie Henley (Lucy) was exquisite as one of the prime characters (move over Dakota Fanning). Her acting was spot-on and brought a lump to my throat several times. Liam Neeson's Aslan voice was also perfect with its deep resonance that seemed to echo through the theater (must've been a good sound recording). Tilda Swinton was also excellent as the sinister White Witch who rules Narnia with a cold, iron fist. And James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was also pulled off very well.<br /><br />There've been several reviews (professional) that have been critical of the film's Christian-based theological leanings. Well ...yes. That's true. It does have that, but so did C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles novels. So did this bother me? Not at all. I don't prescribe to any particular faith, and if you go into NARNIA with an anti-religious chip on your shoulder, I'm sure you could rip the film apart. But if you go into the theater strictly to enjoy good storytelling and for entertainment, you'll probably delight in NARNIA just as much as the ten-year-old who sat behind me quietly throughout the entire movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>If you're going to bring a beloved classic to life, you had better do it right - and director Andrew Adamson did just that, largely because of his own special memories of reading the book as a child.  The timing for this film was also right - not only because it follows in the wake of the masterful Lord of the Rings series (and there will always be comparisons between Narnia and LOTR, despite their vast differences) but, more importantly, because this film really could not have been made any earlier.  I wasn't a big fan of CGI when the technology emerged; I thought it took away from the purity of the medium and, of course, it was oftentimes obviously not real in those early days.  When you watch The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, though, you see the undeniable magic that CGI has now opened up.  This film is heavy with computer animation, and its integration with real actors and sets is virtually seamless.  Aslan, by way of example, may well be CGI's highest achievement to date.  For one thing, he looks bloody real in every scene, but what is truly amazing is the depth of feeling and emotion that comes through in his face and gestures, particularly during the scene at the Stone Slab.<br /><br />There's really far more to praise about this film than I have time or room for.  I'll just say the cinematography and music are masterful, and the creation of the different creatures (be they computer-generated or wonders of costuming) are incredibly detailed and realistic.  I just want to hurry up and talk about the children playing the Pevensie siblings.  Do they give awards for best casting?  If they don't, they certainly should, and this film would take that prize hands-down.  They boys (William Moseley as Peter and Skandar Keynes as Edmund) are excellent, but the girls are nothing short of perfect.  There's just something about Anna Popplewell (Susan) that I find blissfully charming.  Her character is basically the smart and careful one of the bunch, and Popplewell just radiates nobility and a maturity beyond her years.  Young Georgie Henley, though, takes the proverbial cake as little Lucy.  I tend to think of this story as Lucy's for the most part.  It is she who first takes us into Narnia, and we see that enchanted land primarily through her eyes.  Aslan is the central character, but Lucy is really the audience's link to everything that happens.  I think you can experience Narnia just by watching Lucy - the childish wonder, the joy of the land's magic, and the heart-breaking sadness of the White Witch's most evil deeds.  If you listen to the children's commentary on the DVD, though, you'll be even more impressed with these kids.  Georgie is the quintessential child, a fountain of unbridled energy and unabashed honesty, but she also asks the director some incredibly insightful questions about some of his directorial decisions.  All of these kids are smart as a whip, but that Georgie truly is something special.<br /><br />I'm assuming you already know the story here, so I won't go into plot details.  What makes the story resonate so deeply is the myriad of interpretations you can take away from it.  Clearly, there's a strong Christian allegory at work here, primarily in terms of Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia, but you don't have to view the story in that way at all - although the moral implications of this classic contest between good and evil are obvious and beneficial to all.  Your interpretation, in fact, may very well change with each viewing.  Children can just enjoy it as an adventure with talking animals, but as they come back to the film over time they will begin to pick up on the deeper meanings of the story.  This is one of those rare films that gets better and better with each viewing.<br /><br />You have to love the bonus features on the two-disc collector's edition.  We're talking hours and hours of behind-the-scenes footage and insights into the whole Narnia experience (and a few bloopers).  I really love the Kids and Director Commentary, and I would heartily encourage you to watch that.  Filmmaker commentary (and there's one of those here, as well) tend to be rather boring.  I got more out of the Kids Commentary than I would normally get out of ten filmmaker commentaries.  You also have the option of watching the film with interesting facts about Narnia popping up from time to time.  If you really want to know how in the world this incredible movie was brought to life, you'll relish Disc 2 and its hours of interviews and film prep featurettes on the casting, design, costuming, creature-making, etc.  You can also find really nice information on the different creatures you'll meet in Narnia - and you can even explore Narnia's most important locations and hear a little more about what happens in Narnia after the story of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe ends.  The Special Two-Disc Collector's Edition of this movie is truly the complete package - and a must for Narnia fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>For several years, fantasy films were MIA, except the occasional hack job.<br /><br />Then "Lord of the Rings" came and went, leaving some pretty big shoes to fill, as far as fantasy films go. "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe" doesn't quite fit the shoes, but it comes a lot closer than any other movie has.<br /><br />In Andrew Adamson's adaptation, C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy novel comes alive with remarkable fidelity, sparkling special effects, and some truly excellent acting by almost everyone concerned. If "Lord of the Rings" was stern older brother Peter, then this movie is Lucy -- bright, swift and thoroughly charming.<br /><br />With WW II raging, the four Pevensie children are sent to the countryside, at an eccentric professor's mansion. But during a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides inside a wardrobe -- and stumbles into a wintry wilderness, with a faun she befriends. Alas, her brothers and sisters don't believe her -- but they don't know that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) has also gone through, and befriended a sinister, beautiful Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />Eventually all four end up going through the wardrobe, but but they soon find that the Witch is hunting for them, in fear that they will fulfil an ancient prophecy. But Edmund has run off to join the Witch. And so the remaining three must join up with Aslan (Liam Neeson), the leonine god-king of Narnia. But the price for victory against the Witch may be too high.<br /><br />Since "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" is labelled both a kids' book and a Christian fantasy, it's easy to get put off by the description of it. Don't be. Director Andrew Adamson ("Shrek" and "Shrek 2") has obviously given this his whole heart and soul, and it has the right mixture of majesty and humor that a film like this needed.<br /><br />And Adamson does a spectacular job. The the taut race across a frozen river, the bombing of London, tea with the faun Tumnus, and even the cameo by Father Christmas (who gets a medieval makeover) -- all of these come to life with remarkable skill and grace, but with respect for its audience's intelligence. The make-or-break scene is Aslan stalking to the stone table, and the horrifying sacrifice scene that follows does justice to Lewis' novel.<br /><br />But Adamson doesn't let it get overinflated on its own ego. When Edmund tells his horse, "Whoa, boy!" it retorts peevishly, "My NAME is Philip!"; elsewhere, the beavers snipe at each other like an old married couple. Those moments of lightness -- and giving Aslan a sense of humor -- keep the film from seeming self-conscious.<br /><br />And of course, the special effects. WETA workship deserves an award (it's been nominated for a few) for the amazing CGI, ranging from goat-legged Tumnus to the lion Aslan, who looks almost real. They are especially good in battle scenes, which are startlingly savage and brutal, but filled with outstanding moments, such as a centaur leaping over the Witch and nearly beheading her.<br /><br />Young Georgie Henley is probably the most capable actress here, conveying misery, awe, delight, childish glee and sorrow. All this from a small child, when a lot of adult actors can't manage that much. Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell turn in good performances as Edmund and Susan. Swinton and William Moseley (Peter) start off rather woodenly, but they both blossom when the four arrive in Narnia.<br /><br />Though Lewis was reportedly against a live-action adaptation of the Chronicles, it's hard to imagine him having a problem with this rapid-fire, sparkling adaptation. (And stay for the credits for an extra surprise...)</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>Allow me to approach this review in this way, which is as question and answers.<br /><br />IS THE MOVIE FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK?  Reviewers and viewers answer the question differently.  In a sense, both are right.  The movie is faithful to the book as far as basic plot, characters, and atmosphere.  There are changes made that are not in the book, but these changes are usually for the purpose of a) helping the viewer understand the historic setting, such as the movie's beginning, or b) adding to the entertainment value of the movie, adding humor (e.g. the beavers) or suspense (I don't remember the children riding a piece of ice in the original, though it has been well over 25 years since I read the book).<br /><br />IS THE MOVIE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN?  If and only if a parent accompanies them.  This movie lives up to the PG rating.  Other reviewers pointed out there is plenty of scariness in the movie, especially the battle scene.  But I don't think there is anything that would be overly traumatic if the child is accompanied by the parent.  (By the way, I believe that the parent should be with the child in viewing any movie or any TV show.)<br /><br />IS THE MOVIE A "CHRISTIAN MOVIE"?  Disney making a Christian movie?  Seriously, there are themes that a Christian would recognize in the movie, which would need to be there to be faithful to the book.  These allusions are such that a non-Christian would miss them, without losing appreciation for the story.  This is not like "The Passion."  However, a Christian can use the film in witnessing to unbelievers, pointing out the parallels between Aslan and Jesus.<br /><br />Allow me to make a few other comments.  I think Tilda Swinson did a good job with the character.  One reviewer used the term underplayed.  In some stories, the villain is more interesting, memorable, and maybe even likeable than the hero, and Swinson's performance keeps this from happening.  I also loved the beavers.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the release of Prince Caspian, the next of the series.  If it is half as good as this movie, it would be very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I loved the books when I was young, and still read them to this very day, despite being an early 20-something now. Before I could read, my Dad read them to me, putting on silly voices, before I got fed up and learned to read, so I could make up my own voices as I went along. They were one of the first books I seriously got into, long before the Harry Potters of today. This is an instant classic. I never really understood it as a child, as I've grown older I've perhaps understood little bits here & there, but everytime I read the books now, I discover something new. Like today, I discovered I'd been reading them the 'wrong' way the whole time. I've got them in one big book, and it runs The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, The Horse & His Boy (the worst in my opinion) Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader The Silver Chair & The Last Battle. I always knew The Magician's Nephew was a prequel, but I've always read it first. But I didn't know The Horse & His Boy was a prequel too! The running order (as they were originally published back in the good old days) should go: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and His Boy, The Magician's Nephew & The Last Battle.<br /><br />I was actually nervous about watching this film beforehand. I never got to see it at the cinema - due to it being released before Christmas and I work in a card shop - so I had to wait til it was released on DVD, and then had to wait longer as it was a birthday present. And then when I'd worked myself up about watching it, I fell asleep half an hour into it. (But through tiredness, not due it being boring.)<br /><br />Why was I was nervous about watching it? In the late 80s, The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, Prince Caspian & The Voyage of The Dawn Treader & The Silver Chair were was actually filmed in the UK for children's TV. It was released on DVD a while ago, and it was really, REALLY bad. The young actors were nothing how I imagined them to look, the actress playing Lucy had the most awful teeth, the special effects were shockingly bad - but probably terrific for that time - and to this day, I've still never watched it all. And probably never will.<br /><br />Back to the review.<br /><br />I couldn't stay up long enough to watch all of it in one go, so carried on the following night, and found myself getting completely sucked in. It just totally came to life in my eyes, and everything was the way I remembered it. Sure, there were a couple of extra little scenes added in here & there, but only a dedicated reader would have known most of them, and they added to the film, rather than detracted. I was disappointed that some of Mr & Mrs Beaver's best lines were taken out, and Liam Neeson being the voice of Aslan just didn't work for me.<br /><br />The actors of Peter, Susan, Edmund & Lucy were terrific too, although I never liked Susan's character in the books, and found myself hating her in this. Thankfully, Susan & Peter never really feature that much in the books, they grow up, and get too "old" to believe in Narnia, so the younger ones feature much more. I wasn't keen on Tilda Swinton as The White Witch. She was very tall wasn't she? The image on screen just didn't match the image in my head. I felt myself completely sucked into the world of Narnia, and although there some slight quibbles from my Dad (having seen it) about how some things were similar to The Lord Of The Rings, and I did want to shout out "Freedom!" during the big battle scene, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Totally unexpected.<br /><br />Will I be watching this again? Most definitely. I was almost in tears, it matched what was in my head nearly perfectly. I just hope it continues throughout the rest of the films (as all books have been optioned), and doesn't go bad in some, like the Harry Potters. I don't think I can wait until 2007 for Prince Caspian. I'll definitely go to the cinema for the rest of them!!!<br /><br />Keep watching after the credits for a 30 second clip, featuring a little bit more of Jim Broadbent as the Professor.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>CS Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia may very well have been a book intended for children but it was also the result of a life through the Great Wars and the effects those wars had one the individual.  Gratefully in Andrew Adamson's directorial hands that part of the story that lends the need for the fantasy is preserved.<br /><br />The concept of separating children from their parents during the Blitz in London in WW II is now showing up in many novels.  Lewis was one of the first to address the trauma these separations had on children. Adamson opens his film with some fine footage of the aerial German blitz and the terror of the Londoners running for bomb shelters.  The family in focus is the Pevensie family - Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) - and these four children are sent off to a safe mansion owned by the Professor (Jim Broadbent).  The mansion has a wardrobe that begins the fantasy, Lucy being the first to enter the kingdom of Narnia through the back of the wardrobe.  Soon the four children are all together in the snowy place and encounter first a faun, then the Queen of Narnia/White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and there begins the struggle for domination and secrets that gradually resolve the mystery of Narnia, that mystery carefully paralleling Christianity through the forces of the kind Lion Aslan (Liam Neeson).<br /><br />The children are wonderful, especially Georgie Henley, and while the story deals with human creatures it is strong.  As the various CGI animals enter (fine though they may be as creations) the tale for this viewer weakens a bit, but that is a personal response.  In general with work like that from Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent along with the children, the movie form of Narnia is convincing and enchanting.  Quibbles aside, it is a charming film.  Grady Harp, April 06</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>A worried mother puts her four children on a train and sends them to the English countryside in order to protect them from the war.  They arrive on the doorstep of a professor whom the stern housekeeper says they are not to bother.  One day they relieve their boredom by playing a game of Hide and Seek.  The youngest child, Lucy, discovers an old wardrobe in a deserted room and decides to hide there.  As she steps back in the wardrobe, she enters another world, Narnia, where the White Witch has declared that there will be perpetual winter.  So begins the adventure of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe", written by C.S. Lewis who was during the first part of his life, an avowed atheist but who eventually became a strong believing Christian whose literary works influenced many believers and non-believers alike.  The symbolism of the lion Aslin will be clear to Christians and will hopefully introduce unbelievers to the Christian message.  The four children are wonderfully natural in their portrayals and the movie is produced with stunning visual effects.  This is not for small children, but older ones will undoubtedly enjoy the wonderful retelling of Lewis's book.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Based on the classic novel from C.S. Lewis, this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family- type movie that parallels the book very closely as it follows four kids on their journey to the land of Narnia where they find themselves locked in a battle between good and evil.<br /><br />There are many reasons to enjoy this movie but let's start with the film's strongest point of all: Its special effects and make-up. The land of Narnia is populated with many different creatures, some of whom look mostly human; some which look like ordinary animals; and some who resemble a hybrid between an animal and a person. The special effects offered here are excellent, and the team in charge of making this movie deserves extra credit for making these characters seem so life like. Among the characters that are part human and part animal, the ones that stand out are the man/horse creatures. They feature a man's face, arms, and torso attached to the body of a horse and they look very real. With the creatures that are entirely animalistic- like the two beavers- the special effects are still excellent because the appearance is just like the real thing. And the mouth movements are very realistic- so much so that you forget you are viewing something created in a studio.<br /><br />The most impressive of all the characters is that of Aslan, the Lion. This "character" looks just like an actual lion, with a mouth that moves in sync with each word he speaks- exactly like a person who is speaking the same words. Again, the special effects are near- perfect. You cannot tell you are looking at an object created in a Disney studio. It seems very life- like in every way.<br /><br />Besides the excellent special effects, there are many other reasons to enjoy this movie. There is a nice assortment of suspense, humor, fear, and other emotions and many of them come out of nowhere. They keep the film less predictable than it otherwise would be, and that says a lot when you consider that this film is based on a book. I also like the cinematography. The landscape is snowy at first but then switches to a lush, green, mountainous terrain later in the film. This movie was shot in New Zealand (even though it is supposed to take place in England) and the beauty of the New Zealand countryside adds greatly to the film's appeal.<br /><br />Performances in this film are top- notch and I was especially impressed by Georgie Henley, the young actress who plays Lucy. She is the most expressive of the four kid's characters, displaying an array of emotions with conviction, just like a seasoned Hollywood professional. The others are all very good, too, and they all deserve credit for adding so much to this movie.<br /><br />The overall plot of this film is enjoyable and complete- free from any empty holes that leave the viewer puzzled and annoyed. It is also fast- paced, with many scenes depicting fights and open battles as the kids and Aslan take on the evil witch and the various forces of evil.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good motion picture and the type that most people will find entertaining and memorable. It is great for the entire family, and it will likely be one of the top movies this Holiday season.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I LIKED this movie, but I didn't love it.  Perhaps that is because the book upon which it is based is so short.  C. S. Lewis got to the point quickly with his story - there was no time for dilly-dally.  Also, he wrote it with a sense of wit by making wry comments on the action in his authorial voice.  As such, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was definitely a children's book - although it can be read and enjoyed by adults.  However, the movie comes out after The Lord of The Rings, and so tries to invoke that feeling.  The result is sort of a mixed bag - stuff for kids mixed with violent battle scenes.  There is also a lot of traveling time, which slows down the action.<br /><br />However, the special effects are done very well.  The sight of realistic talking animals could have destroyed the film, but it manages to pull it off.  Tilda Swinton is attractively evil as the White Which and Aslan is a wonderful mix of CGI and a performance by Liam Neeson.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE:  There has been some harsh criticism of this film as Christian propaganda.  The only way for that argument to be made is to point out that a central character dies, and then is resurrected.  In the first place, that is not enough.  Second, so what?  Just because C. S. Lewis was Catholic, does that make him a bad guy?  Are we not only suppose to suppress religious literature, but EVERYTHING that was ever written by people who believed in God?  Can the book burnings be far behind?</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>I've never read the literary classics that comprise C.S. Lewis' epic "Chronicles of Narnia" series. Growing up, I know that some of the books were required reading in some of my friends' classes, but never in my own, and then once I began to develop my own taste in books, those novels never really seemed to pique my interest all that much. When the trailers began showing up advertising the release of the first film, in what Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media were hoping to be a hit franchise based on the novels, my initial reaction was that it looked interesting and appeared to have great special effects, but I wasn't sure if it was the kind of movie I would enjoy. I know that the novels had previously been adapted, with a very limited budget by the BBC into low-budget movies, so I figured this new film had to at least look better than those did, but aside from Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" novels, I really hadn't enjoyed that many fantasy films. I personally didn't enjoy the `Neverending Story' franchise, or "Legend" starring a younger Tom Cruise, and generally speaking most movies with kids as the main characters tend to be a bit on the annoying side, so my expectations were coming in a tad on the low side. As low as my expectations were for this upcoming film, when the numerous positive reviews began pouring in, and more action and intriguing story elements were being shown in the TV spots appearing on almost every station known to man, my interest along with my expectations began increasing significantly until the movie finally arrived in theaters giving me the chance to see if all the hype was true or if I would be bored to tears, as I feared could be the case.<br /><br />"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" is the story of four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they accidentally stumble across the wondrous land of Narnia, via a magical wardrobe hidden in their house. As they begin to explore this strange new world, and encounter several of its inhabitants, the children soon realize that this once-peaceful world has been plunged into what appears to be an eternal winter filled with despair courtesy of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) who has proclaimed herself Queen of Narnia. The longer the children spend in Narnia the more they begin to understand that their appearance in this world was not some random incident, but in fact had been foretold in a prophecy, and that these four children, along with a powerful lion named Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), would lead the good creatures of Narnia in a revolt against the evil White Witch and her minions to return Narnia to its rightful state of peace and happiness.<br /><br />So, after going from absolutely having no interest in seeing "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" to being pretty much excited to see it, I was very pleased that once I watched the film I could honestly say that I loved every minute of it. The movie avoided the pitfalls that I expected it to fall victim to, for instance; having the children be too cutesy and/or annoying brats or just being unbelievable as actual kids via their moods, actions, or whatever; having an extremely boring story with the occasional action sequence to excite the audience but not much else to fill the time (i.e. "The Golden Compass"); or knowing that it was a Christian themed story, having the basic story be so cheesy and over-the-top in the delivery of the Christian allegory that it would be laughable and yet another example of a horrible attempt to make a Christian movie. Thankfully `Narnia' maneuvered easily around each of these trouble spots emerging victorious as the first successful entry into what will hopefully become an entertaining franchise for audiences everywhere to enjoy.<br /><br />The story, as adapted by Ann Peacock, Andrew Adamson, Christopher Marks, and Stephen McFeely, and based upon the novel by C.S. Lewis, was incredibly fast-paced and entertaining, even though the beginning had me a little worried that it was going to drag out the pre-Narnia part of the children's lives, but even those scenes were surprisingly well-played and lively. Director Andrew Adamson (who also co-wrote the screenplay) deftly handled all of the fantasy elements and action sequences that the story required, while balancing them out with the much quieter moments as the children begin to understand their place in this new world, and the heavy burdens that accompany such an incredible destiny. I was surprised with how solid Adamson's direction was for this movie, since his previous efforts had been the hit animated films "Shrek" and "Shrek 2" which he was a co-director on for both, so as his first solo outing `Narnia' is an extremely impressive effort that he absolutely knocks out of the park from beginning to end.<br /><br />The primary cast for `Narnia', namely the four siblings, was comprised of relative newcomers to the world of acting, as this was the first movie for most of the kids. It's surprising that Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media would trust newcomers with the starring roles in a movie that could essentially launch a fantasy series that may rival New Line Cinema's epic `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but the gamble paid off and I honestly don't think any other actors could have done any better. Academy Award winner Tilda Swinton ("Michael Clayton") was an ideal choice to play the evil White Witch, and she seemed to enjoy the chance to play such an evil, villainous character and made the most out of every scene she was given. Providing the voice of the majestic lion Aslan, actor Liam Neeson ("Batman Begins"), along with incredibly realistic CGI, gave the character a commanding presence with a calm soothing voice that was firm and authoritative, yet soft and caring.<br /><br />I honestly could continue complimenting the various elements of the movie for several more paragraphs, but you the reader would no doubt grow weary of me and lose interest. So, I only have one more item that I feel must be recognized when reviewing this film, and of course I am referring to the outstanding CGI work produced by the special effects wizards that worked so hard behind the scenes on `Narnia'. Without their expertise and considerable talents, this movie would not have been nearly as impressive, and the various creatures wouldn't have been brought to such vibrant life in a way that you almost believed that lions could speak, centaurs could walk amongst us, and that a magical world of wonder actually could exist on the other side of a wardrobe and all you have to do is be lucky enough to find it.<br /><br />"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" is an extremely entertaining thrill ride of a fantasy film comprised of brilliant special effects, excellent storytelling, and a talented cast that when mixed together delivers a movie experience that audiences can enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" is rated PG for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>And I was not disappointed.  Disney got it right.  They actually made the movie I have been waiting for most of my life.<br /><br />I have read the classic book, The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, literally dozens and dozens of times, and I believe that this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family oriented movie that stays quite true to the original story. A warning to the purists, the are a few minor name changes, for some reason.<br /><br />This movie is excellent, entertaining, and enjoyable on all levels: phenomenal special effects and make-up; breathtaking cinematography; and, of course, top-notch performances.  Performances in this film are across the board superior, extremely expressive, and display a wide range of emotions.<br /><br />The plot is complete, and, as stated earlier, it matches book almost perfectly. It is fast-paced and action-packed; a thrilling ride from beginning to end.  It was truly worth the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a good film.  The special effects are first rate.  If only they were enough to truly satisfy the viewer, but they aren't.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis's beloved classic novel is given a pretty good justice with this film.  The cast of characters is well thought out...everyone from Lucy to Edmund, Susan, and Peter.  Even the White Witch is casted nicely.<br /><br />So, what is the problem you ask?  There simply isn't enough to really get at the heart and spirit of this story.  The characterizations surrounding the four children is good.  But, the novel focuses just as much on Aslan and the Witch.<br /><br />What happens is that even at 2 hours and 15 minutes, the movie's pace is too fast.  It flies through the story at a break-neck speed that it was never intended to do.  Thus, as it occurs whenever a film-maker "rushes" through a film, key elements are left out.  Not enough time is given to Aslan to really be in awe of this character, one of the most memorable in literary history.  Some key scenes from the novel are either rushed or deleted altogether.  We just aren't given that sense of magic about Narnia, that mystical quality that is so a part of Lewis's books.  His literary style captivates the reader, even though it is written simply, you still feel as if you've stepped through a Wardrobe into a magical kingdom.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the same argument can be said of the White Witch.  Especially in regard to her relationship and treatment of Edmund.  Edmund is a brooding, moody character who is only interested in himself.  That spark of potential cruelty is barely felt in the film.  Until he realizes what he's done, and how the White Witch forces him to pull her sleigh over the rough terrain after the snow has melted, do we get an idea of the true evilness of the Witch.  She is cruel and tempermental.  The deleted scene of the Queen turning a bunch of woodland creatures, who are having a tea party, into stone was left out.  And while we get glimpses of this in the film, it doesn't sink in far enough.<br /><br />The scope of the film is very good.  Wherever it was filmed, you get a sense of the beauty of Narnia that readers have come to expect.  The scenery is incredible and a feast for the eyes.  The way they've brought all of these incredible creatures to life is also magical.<br /><br />As good as this film was, it could have been so much better.  Granted it is geared toward a younger audience, and I think the young kids will be overjoyed with it.  However, I still think they could have gone a little deeper with it.  Just because a film is geared toward younger kids, doesn't mean you have to play "down" to them.  Examples such as the Harry Potter films, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and many others have shown the kids can handle more than you think and are just as interested in compelling story-telling as the rest of us.<br /><br />I know they are working on Prince Caspian, and I hope they can do more justice to that great novel than they did to this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CU4L3OK00M23.html">A2CU4L3OK00M23</a><br/><p>There are a few extra scenes in the main movie that are fun to see.

Boy, she is so, so. . . coldhearted, and she is not afraid to show it!<br /><br />The magical sets, awesome musical backgrounds, dramatic and charming acting from the children, as well as CGI cast, all make a harmonious blend of a children's movie that's good enough for adults, and cult lovers of original storybook.<br /><br />I don't have any complaints, and don't mind the brief extras, mainly outtakes and bloopers. The movie is well crafted and totally endearing to watch. Disney really needs to concentrate on making more movies like this one, as well as Pirates Of The Caribbean. I miss the old days when Disney meant good comedy, drama, high spirit adventure, and musicals. Not just animation, and Pixar! The other releases, through affiliates with Touchstone Pictures, doesn't all together do it for me. Back in the real hey days it was "Walt Disney presents. . ." That's the way it should be, and that's the way Chronicles Of Narnia is basically marketed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>For several years, fantasy films were MIA, except the occasional hack job.<br /><br />Then "Lord of the Rings" came and went, leaving some pretty big shoes to fill, as far as fantasy films go. "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe" doesn't quite fit the shoes, but it comes a lot closer than any other movie has.<br /><br />In Andrew Adamson's adaptation, C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy novel comes alive with remarkable fidelity, sparkling special effects, and some truly excellent acting by almost everyone concerned. If "Lord of the Rings" was stern older brother Peter, then this movie is Lucy -- bright, swift and thoroughly charming.<br /><br />With WW II raging, the four Pevensie children are sent to the countryside, at an eccentric professor's mansion. But during a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides inside a wardrobe -- and stumbles into a wintry wilderness, with a faun she befriends. Alas, her brothers and sisters don't believe her -- but they don't know that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) has also gone through, and befriended a sinister, beautiful Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />Eventually all four end up going through the wardrobe, but but they soon find that the Witch is hunting for them, in fear that they will fulfil an ancient prophecy. But Edmund has run off to join the Witch. And so the remaining three must join up with Aslan (Liam Neeson), the leonine god-king of Narnia. But the price for victory against the Witch may be too high.<br /><br />Since "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" is labelled both a kids' book and a Christian fantasy, it's easy to get put off by the description of it. Don't be. Director Andrew Adamson ("Shrek" and "Shrek 2") has obviously given this his whole heart and soul, and it has the right mixture of majesty and humor that a film like this needed.<br /><br />And Adamson does a spectacular job. The the taut race across a frozen river, the bombing of London, tea with the faun Tumnus, and even the cameo by Father Christmas (who gets a medieval makeover) -- all of these come to life with remarkable skill and grace, but with respect for its audience's intelligence. The make-or-break scene is Aslan stalking to the stone table, and the horrifying sacrifice scene that follows does justice to Lewis' novel.<br /><br />But Adamson doesn't let it get overinflated on its own ego. When Edmund tells his horse, "Whoa, boy!" it retorts peevishly, "My NAME is Philip!"; elsewhere, the beavers snipe at each other like an old married couple. Those moments of lightness -- and giving Aslan a sense of humor -- keep the film from seeming self-conscious.<br /><br />And of course, the special effects. WETA workship deserves an award (it's been nominated for a few) for the amazing CGI, ranging from goat-legged Tumnus to the lion Aslan, who looks almost real. They are especially good in battle scenes, which are startlingly savage and brutal, but filled with outstanding moments, such as a centaur leaping over the Witch and nearly beheading her.<br /><br />Young Georgie Henley is probably the most capable actress here, conveying misery, awe, delight, childish glee and sorrow. All this from a small child, when a lot of adult actors can't manage that much. Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell turn in good performances as Edmund and Susan. Swinton and William Moseley (Peter) start off rather woodenly, but they both blossom when the four arrive in Narnia.<br /><br />Though Lewis was reportedly against a live-action adaptation of the Chronicles, it's hard to imagine him having a problem with this rapid-fire, sparkling adaptation. (And stay for the credits for an extra surprise...)</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>If "The Passion Of The Christ" has taught me anything, it's that debating religious issues via film reviews at Amazon.com is a silly thing to do, so I'm not even going to mention the various religious subtexts in either the novel or this movie.<br /><br />What I am going to do is wax (almost) lyrical over this big-screen adaptation of one of my all-time favourite novels, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe".<br /><br />Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are evacuated from WWII-era London by their Mother, to a safer country manor run by intractable housekeeper Mrs. McCready. Running afoul of her strong discipline, they run and hide in a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an abandoned room of the house, where younger sister Lucy claims to have discovered another world at the back of the closet. Literally stumbling into the land of Narnia, the four children become embroiled in a Civil War between the usurperous White Witch Jadis, and the rightful ruler of Narnia, Aslan the Lion.<br /><br />Firstly, the standard of acting in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is what makes this movie so great. Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell as Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan respectively, give great performances, with special nods to Henley and Keynes as two of the most promising child actors I've seen since Pamela Franklin in 'Jean Brodie'. Tilda Swinton as Jadis is absolutely wonderful: regal, detached and most definitely evil, kudos must also go to the casting director for actually hiring an Actress, and not one of the several million Jessica Biels that lurk out there.<br /><br />Direction is fitting: this is not a story where you skimp on showmanship, and Andrew Adamson has done a truly breathtaking job here. There's so little wrong with this visual treatment of Narnia that it's possible to get almost totally lost in the film. And in an age where CGI effects and technical frivolity are so often used to fluff up a pedestrian style of filmmaking, that's a real compliment.<br /><br />CGI effects here are the best I've seen to date. Forget Harry Potter, forget the Lord of the Rings trilogy, forget Episode III: "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is the current king of computer-generated plausibility. There were only two scenes where I felt "fake!! that's fake!", and those were (rather inexplicable) bluescreened backdrops. The creatures, the vistas, the spells, the battles... and Aslan the Lion is indescribable. You just have to see it to appreciate it.<br /><br />Production design is also magnificent. Narnia's various inhabitants are as varied as they are individual. From the mythic, like Giants, Hags and Naiads, to the real, like cheetahs, beavers and horses, the nonhuman inhabitants are memorable because of their sterling design. Jadis is incredible-looking, a sort of tribal queen with a real sense of power about her... and understated, considering what overstatement they could have come up with. And the countryside itself is magnificent: real and generated scenery blend here to create a backdrop that's wholly convincing, and very true to the spirit of the original book.<br /><br />Also, the movie's plot follows the novel closer than anything I've seen for a long time. Sure, there are changes, but for the most part, this huge fan of CS Lewis can tell you that they're not a big deal.<br /><br />My one quibble is with the script. Some of the dialogue feels too modern and a little too grown-up for the children. There's a glaring disparity between some of the comedy and the rest of the characterisation. The Witch and Susan seem to suffer the worst of these excesses, but worry not: it's mostly a convincing and standout screenplay.<br /><br />I can't recommend this highly enough. Easily the equal of the Harry Potters and Lord of the Rings, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" deserves all the praise you can think of, and then some.<br /><br />Buy it now!</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>NOTE: The comments which follow are on the special two-disc Collector's Edition, available with subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.<br /><br />The film is based on and seems remarkably faithful to the C.S. Lewis classic, the second in a series of seven novels. Here's the basic situation. Four siblings are relocated from their London home to a country estate to be with an eccentric uncle, Professor Kirke,  during the "Blitz." While playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and -- like Alice and Dorothy -- unexpectedly finds herself in a magical world. Later joined by her two brothers and sister, Lucy and they become involved in a conflict between what my grandson Cameron calls "the good guys" (led by a lion king named Aslan) and "the bad guys" (led by a witch named Jadis) at a time when a  curse (Jadis') has confined Narnia to perpetual winter but without Christmas. There is one way to break her curse -- best revealed within the narrative -- and eventually that happens but not until after a series of adventures which are always entertaining but never threatening to young sensibilities.<br /><br />As did Alice and Dorothy, Lucy and her companions encounter all manner of strange creatures (both allies and foes) which include hags, soldiers, a German pilot, Rumblebuffin the Giant, red and black dwarves, centaurs, satyrs, wolves, Philip the Horse, fauns, centaur archers, and gryphons. Eventually, after a spectacular battle, Jadis is defeated and the curse is ended. The special effects are stunning and I especially appreciate anthropomorphism which is never "cute." The actors who portray the four Pevensie children, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, are exceptionally talented.  Cloying I can always do without.<br /><br />I think it would be a mistake to force comparisons and contrasts between this film and any of the Potter and Ring films. There are similarities and differences, to be sure, but none which seems to me to be especially significant. I thoroughly enjoyed this film because plot, acting, imagery, and musical score are so brilliantly integrated in the service of effective storytelling. Others may find -- and either admire or object to -- what they perceive to be the film's presentation of Lewis' Christian beliefs. What seems much more relevant to me is the emphasis on values common to all of the world's great religions and, indeed, to codes of ethics which are wholly secular. Faith, for example, as well as love, courage, devotion, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and trust. These values are affirmed but only by implication. Hence young Cameron's immediate grasp of what is "good" and "bad" in character and behavior.<br /><br />The production values are superb, the conflicts and their resolution are plausible, and the film's running of time of 134 minutes seems just right. This is a film which offers a great deal to viewers of all ages. As  my rating correctly indicates, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The additional features provided in the two-disc Collector's Edition really are "special" and include a commentary in which Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, and director Andrew Adamson participate; a production commentary by director Andrew Adamson, production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark Johnson; "bloopers"; Narnia "fun facts"; several featurettes such as an in-depth look at cinematic storytellers, director's diary and the children's magical journey; also "Chronicle of a Director," "The Children's Magical Journey," and "Anatomy of a Scene: the Melting River." It takes about ten hours to view the two discs to completion. My guess (only a guess) is that most people will also view only those special features of greatest interest to them. My grandchildren (ranging in age from five to fourteen) seem to prefer watching only the film and do so again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Carefully marketed to be the next franchisable fantasy film alongside The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter series, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe defeated Peter Jackson's over-hyped juggernaut, King Kong  at the box office in a surprise upset. The combination of a Christmas holiday release date, strong source material (C.S. Lewis' classic novel) and a family friendly take proved to be unbeatable. A sequel, not surprisingly, is in the works.<br /><br />The four children are all excellent and quite believable as siblings. Henley, in particular, does a good job as the adorable and precocious Lucy. Her wonderfully expressive eyes convey her emotions and play quite effectively on our sympathies. The filmmakers wisely cast unknown actors in these parts which helps transform them into their characters because we have no pre-conceived notions about them.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia is a triumph of production design, visual effects and on pretty much every other level of technical expertise as it successfully immerses us in this magical world rich in detail and atmosphere - something that is par for the course for these kinds of films ever since The Lord of the Rings raised the bar so high. The film is also quite faithful to Lewis' novel and manages to capture the sense of wonder while maintaining the right balance of warmth, humanity and darkness. Although, children who are sensitive to seeing animals being hurt (even though faked) might not want to see this film.<br /><br />This film places an emphasis on the bond of family. Only when the four children are reunited and work together as a team are they victorious. Despite Edmund's transgressions, he is forgiven, welcomed back into the fold and given the chance to redeem himself - hence its universal appeal. The fact that the filmmakers did not screw up adapting a book beloved and cherished by so many is an achievement in and of itself. The Chronicles of Narnia is an entertaining and well-made fantasy epic.<br /><br />The two-disc special edition is jam-packed with extras that cover many aspects of the filmmaking process. But we kick things off on the first disc with "The Bloopers of Narnia," an amusing collection of pratfalls, blown lines and general goofing around on the set.<br /><br />One also has the option to "Discover Narnia Fun Fact" that involves various factoids about the film to popping up on the screen as you are watching it. The only complaint of this feature is the infrequency of them. For such a book steeped in trivia (as I'm sure the film is as well) there could have been more facts appearing on screen.<br /><br />Also included is an audio commentary by director Andrew Adamson and actors William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley. Not surprisingly, the older kids, in particular Moseley and Popplewell, offer the most coherent comments while Adamson gamely prods them with decent questions.<br /><br />There is a second commentary by Adamson, production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark Johnson. This is a more technically oriented track as they talk about how WW2-era London was recreated and how Narnia was brought to life.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "Chronicles of a Director" that takes a look at the man who directed Shrek and was subsequently put in charge of this huge epic.<br /><br />"The Children's Magical Journey" focuses on the four child actors. Adamson was looking for real kids and not self-conscious child actors. They clearly had the time of their lives as evident by their tireless enthusiasm.<br /><br />"Evolution of an Epic" is broken down into four featurettes. One profiles C.S. Lewis and examines the inspiration behind his Narnia books and takes a look at their enduring legacy. Various technical aspects, from the weapons and armour to the creature make-up and the costumes are examined. We see how they all contributed to bringing the novel to life. Also, a specific scene - the melting frozen river sequence - is dissected into its various technical aspects: CGI, miniatures and soundstages. The amount of work and the scale on which this film was made is very impressively conveyed in these extras. They provide a snapshot of just how much hard work was put into making Narnia.<br /><br />"Creatures of the World" takes a look at the various types of creatures that inhabit the world of Narnia, from centaurs to satyrs to characters like Aslan and Tumnus. The focus is on the more technical aspects but when you click on the wardrobe icon you get the historical and literary perspective, their traits and physical attributes.<br /><br />"Explore Narnia" presents an interactive map of the fantasy world. It puts key locations into their context within the story and its distinctive characteristics. This is an excellent guide.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Legends in Time" that presents a timeline of events that occur in Narnia and how they compare to time in the real world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>This is a good movie, a good adaption of the book for the most part.

Just like a lot of other kids. The similarity with other kids ends right there.<br /><br />While playing hide-and-seek, Lucy (the youngest) discovers an old wardrobe in one of the rooms upstairs and hides in it, only to discover that the back of the wardrobe is a gateway into a snow-covered world which is ever so different from the one she left behind. The first "person" she meets is Mr. Tumnus, a faun. (He is, by the way, a most charming fellow.) He explains that it has been winter in Narnia for 100 years, ever since the Snow Queen took over. "Always winter but never Christmas." How could a child imagine anything more dismal than that?<br /><br />When Lucy goes back through the wardrobe, thinking she had been gone for several hours, she runs out into the stairway shouting, "I'm here! I'm all right!" The others accuse her of not understanding the game of hide-and-seek, as to them, she was only gone a moment. The dismiss her story of having been to Narnia as imagination, and who could blame them? It is clear that the professor knew about the magic in the wardrobe, because he perked up and became very interested earlier when only Lucy had been through, and the others told him that she had been telling some tall tale about going through it into a magical world. He argues that since she is not mad, and not given to lying, they might just believe her.<br /><br />When Lucy goes back to the wardrobe in the middle of the night, Edmund follows her, and discovers that it's all true. Before he catches up with Lucy, however, a white sleigh drawn by white reindeer drives up with the Snow Queen. She plies Edmund with hot chocolate and Turkish delight, and tells him to go back and get his brother and sisters. You see, there is this prophecy . . .<br /><br />Anyway, all four children eventually get to Narnia dressed in fur coats that had been hanging in the wardrobe, and encounter a couple of talking beavers who take them to their home and tell them all about the prophecy. Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve will be the ones to rescue Narnia from the clutches of the Snow Queen. However, Edmund slips out to go find the Queen, and from there on, I'd be telling too much.<br /><br />You know about Aslan, no doubt. He's a large and very magical lion who is a rather obvious metaphor for Jesus Christ, right down to being slain and reborn. An army of assorted magical creatures is gathered on the side of Narnia, and some truly grotesque demons and nasty animals (wolves, most notably, and Minotaurs and all sorts of vicious beings, including a few giants) fighting for the Queen. There's a huge battle, all sorts of exciting incidents involved in it, and of course the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve fulfill the prophecy and become kings and queens.<br /><br />Many years later, when they are all fully grown, they come across the lamppost that stands outside the "back door," if you will, of the wardrobe. They go through, and come tumbling out the front of the wardrobe, back in the Professor's home, and still children. When asked to explain to the professor what they have been up to, Peter says, "If we told you, you wouldn't believe us." The professor tosses something (I couldn't see what) to Peter and says, "Try me."<br /><br />It's a marvelous movie made from a marvelous book, and I hope they eventually make all seven of the books in the series into movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full Screen Edition) is a brilliant adaptation of C.S Lewis novel with the same title.

So of course I was excited when they decided to do a movie adaptation.  I had a little trepidation as movies are not usually as good as the books, but this one surprised me very much.  It really did justice to the book, and even the scenes that weren't in the book still fit very well into the story.<br /><br />Four children are evacuated to the countryside during World War II.  While there, Lucy, the youngest, stumbles upon a wardrobe that leads her into a different world.  A world named Narnia.  The rest of the children come with her later and learn that they are part of a prophecy.  They will help overthrow the White Witch who has made Narnia into a winter wonderland for the past one hundred years.  With the help of Aslan, the great lion, they will fight the white witch for the hope of Narnia.<br /><br />Characters:<br />William Moseley: Peter Pevensie<br />Anna Popplewell: Susan Pevensie<br />Skandar Keynes: Edmund Pevensie<br />Georgie Henley: Lucy Pevensie<br />Tilda Swinton: Jadis<br />Liam Neeson: Aslan<br />James McAvoy: Mr. Tumnus<br />Ray Winstone: Mr. Beaver<br />Dawn French: Mrs: Beaver<br />Kiran Shah: Ginarrbrik<br />Jim Broadbent: Professor Digory Kirke<br />Elizabeth Hawthorne: Mrs. Macready<br />James Cosmo: Father Christmas<br /><br />I think that all of the characters were well cast in this movie.  I especially liked Georgie as Lucy Pevensie.  She had the right touch of innocence and bravery and really pulled off the part well.  But then again the rest are pretty good too.  Edmund is such a brat at the beginning that I really disliked him.  Mr. Tumnus was just plain cute and sweet and the beavers were also pretty great as well.  The only character I didn't really like was Jadis and that was just because she was more weird than creepy.  But maybe that was the effect they were going for since it was Disney.<br /><br />This movie didn't stray from the book too far.  There were a couple of scenes that weren't in the book, but as said before, I thought they really fit in with the story well.  The special effects were also extremely good.  I had always wondered how they would handle a centaur and a unicorn and they both came out looking extremely realistic. I didn't think the dryads were as good.  I just envisioned a different interpretation for them.  The music is by far one of the best features of the film.  It was just so hauntingly pretty and invoked a "Narnian" sense of wonder through the film.  I especially liked the song that played during the initial train ride.  I don't know its name, but it was beautiful.<br /><br />Great movie adaptation of a great book.  I find it hard to be in any way disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />Review by M.

I mentioned this in my Voyage of the Dawn Treader review, so I won't rehash the same material. Let's just say Narnia has always been held in high regard in my household and I may let flaws that bother some slide because I love the material so much. C.S. Lewis' Narnia books are often compared to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings given their similarities (living trees, created languages, rescues from towers by flying creatures, etc) and the fact that both men were members of the Inklings, a literary discussion group. I never got into Tolkien's literary works, but I prefer the Narnia films in comparison to the LOTR rings films. Despite the LOTR films being epic in their own right, they're a bit too long for casual viewing and I still feel burnt out on them eight years later whereas I feel like I can watch The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe pretty much any time it comes on television.<br /><br />The Narnia films seem to stray further and further from the source material each time a new sequel is released. Prince Caspian veered way off course while Dawn Treader felt like it was more action packed yet still went off and did its own thing at times. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is probably the one true Narnia film we're going to get. A certain character was given a name that didn't have one in the book and certain things were left out, but the events that transpired all took place in the book and weren't added just to be added like a few of the sequences in Prince Caspian.<br /><br />While the cast is nearly impeccable and the story is practically parallel with the book, the special effects are where The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe deserves the most credit. WETA did an exceptional job bringing talking animals, both of the mythical and traditional varieties, to life. The black minotaur general looked really fantastic, but Aslan has to be the film's greatest computer generated accomplishment. He looks incredibly realistic, especially with his hair constantly blowing in the wind. These special effects bringing these spectacular creatures to life are practically the icing on the cake on making a Narnia film work. Without them, the film just wouldn't be the same and wouldn't do the source material justice.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is something special. The cast is able to bring these beloved characters to life in the best of ways and the astounding special effects make talking animals look like something we should see on a day to day basis. The last few lines of the film give you goose bumps as several scenes in the film leave you with that warm, fuzzy feeling inside; that one that makes you feel so happy your eyes well up with tears of joy. Only a certain number of films can trigger that. This film is able to display the magic C.S. Lewis wrote seven glorious novels about as it captures your imagination and doesn't let it go until you see that lamppost for the last time. It's safe to say the The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a defining family film of our generation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>I recently saw this film again after five years, and I stand amazed: it appears, if anything, even more elegant, well designed, and timely than it did in 2005.  With its gorgeously photographed locations, seamless effects, simple yet ambitious physical design, and engaging performances, this movie has withstood several years much better than most can, or ever will.  And its allegory has the potential to instruct children without lecturing them.<br /><br />Director Andrew Adamson creates both the British Blitz and his beleaguered fantasy world with such unassuming grace that it can take effort to recall that these places don't exist in our modern age.  His young actors inhabit both locales with a simple grace, as though they don't realize they are doing anything exceptional.  I never got the feeling of watching a historical pageant or school play, as with prior productions.<br /><br />Beside Peter Jackson's LOTR movies and the Harry Potter films, Narnia marks a reassuring trend in cinematic fantasy: directors depict wonder without childish naivet&eacute;, and they capture the grim underpinnings of magic without maudlin dystopia.  These changes in how films depict fantasy reflect, I think, a more balanced view of reality.  And since Lewis intended viewers to learn something about real life, I think he would approve of this development.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>For several years, fantasy films were MIA, except the occasional hack job.<br /><br />Then "Lord of the Rings" came and went, leaving some pretty big shoes to fill, as far as fantasy films go. "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe" doesn't quite fit the shoes, but it comes a lot closer than any other movie has.<br /><br />In Andrew Adamson's adaptation, C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy novel comes alive with remarkable fidelity, sparkling special effects, and some truly excellent acting by almost everyone concerned. If "Lord of the Rings" was stern older brother Peter, then this movie is Lucy -- bright, swift and thoroughly charming.<br /><br />With WW II raging, the four Pevensie children are sent to the countryside, at an eccentric professor's mansion. But during a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides inside a wardrobe -- and stumbles into a wintry wilderness, with a faun she befriends. Alas, her brothers and sisters don't believe her -- but they don't know that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) has also gone through, and befriended a sinister, beautiful Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />Eventually all four end up going through the wardrobe, but but they soon find that the Witch is hunting for them, in fear that they will fulfil an ancient prophecy. But Edmund has run off to join the Witch. And so the remaining three must join up with Aslan (Liam Neeson), the leonine god-king of Narnia. But the price for victory against the Witch may be too high.<br /><br />Since "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" is labelled both a kids' book and a Christian fantasy, it's easy to get put off by the description of it. Don't be. Director Andrew Adamson ("Shrek" and "Shrek 2") has obviously given this his whole heart and soul, and it has the right mixture of majesty and humor that a film like this needed.<br /><br />And Adamson does a spectacular job. The the taut race across a frozen river, the bombing of London, tea with the faun Tumnus, and even the cameo by Father Christmas (who gets a medieval makeover) -- all of these come to life with remarkable skill and grace, but with respect for its audience's intelligence. The make-or-break scene is Aslan stalking to the stone table, and the horrifying sacrifice scene that follows does justice to Lewis' novel.<br /><br />But Adamson doesn't let it get overinflated on its own ego. When Edmund tells his horse, "Whoa, boy!" it retorts peevishly, "My NAME is Philip!"; elsewhere, the beavers snipe at each other like an old married couple. Those moments of lightness -- and giving Aslan a sense of humor -- keep the film from seeming self-conscious.<br /><br />And of course, the special effects. WETA workship deserves an award (it's been nominated for a few) for the amazing CGI, ranging from goat-legged Tumnus to the lion Aslan, who looks almost real. They are especially good in battle scenes, which are startlingly savage and brutal, but filled with outstanding moments, such as a centaur leaping over the Witch and nearly beheading her.<br /><br />Young Georgie Henley is probably the most capable actress here, conveying misery, awe, delight, childish glee and sorrow. All this from a small child, when a lot of adult actors can't manage that much. Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell turn in good performances as Edmund and Susan. Swinton and William Moseley (Peter) start off rather woodenly, but they both blossom when the four arrive in Narnia.<br /><br />Though Lewis was reportedly against a live-action adaptation of the Chronicles, it's hard to imagine him having a problem with this rapid-fire, sparkling adaptation.

It's based on a novel by the British writer Clive Staples Lewis. The novel has been adapted for TV or cinema several times before.<br /><br />When I saw an old animated version of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", I considered it a very strange story, but nothing more. People entirely new to the Narnia concept will probably react in similar ways when seeing this American movie version. What on earth is this story about?<br /><br />The truth, of course, is that "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is a Christian allegory. If you look carefully, it's all in there. The White Witch is the Devil, the treachery of Edmund symbolizes the fall of Adam and Eve, Aslan is Jesus Christ, and his voluntary sacrifice to save Edmund is the crucifixion. And yes, he comes back and resurrects all the dead. Then comes Judgment Day, when the good battles the forces of evil.<br /><br />Small wonder people think it's a weird storyline...<br /><br />As already mentioned, the story is based on a novel by C.S. Lewis, also titled "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe". (Incidentally, the professor of the story is probably a humorous reference to Lewis himself.) Lewis' express purpose was to write an allegorical Christian novel for children. He later expanded the concept and wrote six additional novels. Together the seven books are known as "The Chronicles of Narnia".<br /><br />Frankly, I think this de-Christianized, Americanized and politically correct version of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is much better than the original!<br /><br />The clean shaven, old fashioned kids of the original story (not to mention a notorious British adaptation for TV) are more modern in the movie version. Also, the Christian references are less overt. But the best change concerns the gender roles. Lewis was almost ridiculously patriarchal, so in the original story the girls Lucy and Susan aren't supposed to participate in the final battle between Aslan's forces and the evil legions of the White Witch. And why is the Devil symbolized by a woman, anyway? In the movie, the poor devil is still female, but at least Susan is a soldier. Interestingly, Peter (the older brother) is something of a sceptical wimp!<br /><br />A covertly feminist version of "The Chronicles of Narnia"? Who could have imagined?<br /><br />The movie even contains unexpected humour, as when the fox delivers the unforgettable one-liner: "I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite". The bickering between Beaver and his wife is also extremely entertaining.<br /><br />This movie adaptation of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" also has an ironic twist. It has *very* obvious similarities with Peter Jackson's successful "Lord of the Rings" movies. Indeed, the rip off was clearly visible already in the trailer. The twist, of course, is that C.S. Lewis was personally acquainted with J.R.R. Tolkien. One of Lewis' science fiction novels, "That hideous strength", contains a partial cross-over with the Lord of the Rings universe of Tolkien. It's therefore ironic that a movie adaptation of Lewis' Narnia stories mimics movies based on Tolkien. It seems you really cannot separate Lewis and Tolkien!<br /><br />C.S. Lewis was an interesting writer of both Christian fiction and non-fiction. I have given Lewis his due in other reviews. I have to admit, however, that I sometimes tend to get tired at his supernatural musings. A big thanks to Walt Disney for remaking this story into a light, entertaining adventure epic.<br /><br />Five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A perfect performance by Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, impressive set design, and a number of effective scenes are enough to recommend this movie despite the uninspired acting of its leads.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I'll bet the kids would enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ALIG0G">Time Bandits</a>....It's a star-studded 1981 fantasy about a kid that accidentally hooks up with a band of hoodlum dwarfs as they pass through a magic time travel porthole. It moves fast, has lots of action, but the FX are very...well...1981.<br /><br />So I heard about Chronicles of Narnia where a bunch a siblings find a way into another dimension, and thought, "Perhaps this is a modern day Time Bandits for my kids."<br /><br />There were some similarities:<br /><br />Narnia: Kids travel through magic porthole in wardrobe to Narnia.<br />Time Bandits: Kid travels through magic porthole in wardrobe through space & time.<br /><br />Narnia: Good vs evil.<br />Time Bandits: Good vs. evil.<br /><br />Narnia: A Witch and mystical creatures.<br />Time Bandits: A Warlock and mystical creatures.<br /><br />Narnia: Good, of course, ultimately prevails.<br />Time Bandits: Good, of course, ultimately prevails.<br /><br />You get the idea. The story is pretty much the same, but all the names have changed.<br /><br />Narnia is a long one too. One of my kids gave up completely and another was playing Gameboy and only "1/2 watching" at the 2 hour mark. Another thought "it was okay". I also thought it was just okay.<br /><br />Narnia is visually cool. The story is pretty easy to follow for kids without a parent having to do much, if any, PGing. But it should have been cut down by 30 or so minutes.<br /><br />So if Narnia was no thrill, I wonder if the kids would prefer Time Bandits with its 1981 special effects? We'll have to perhaps give that a try after they view their most recent request: Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Oy.<br /><br />One other thing: the price of Disney DVDs seem very high.

Since I have not read the books, I am basing my review only on the film.  In this tale, the four Pevensie children are cast into the magical world of Narnia via the Professor's wardrobe.  Once inside, the children learn that they are part of a prophecy that will lift the dark curse of the White Witch and save Narnia's magnificent inhabitants.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, one of the first things that I noticed about this film was how the entire young audience remained quiet throughout the entire film.  In fact, the only real noise in the theater was the whimpers of younger children afraid of what happens to Aslan the lion in the film.  That's a difficult thing to do these days, especially since most kids are either easily distracted or their parents ignore them or don't even take them to the movies, preferring to drop them off at the kiddie show whilst they take in other fare.<br /><br />The story is wonderful.  I've read and watched interviews with the producers, directors, actors, etc. in this film and all of them were posed the obvious "Christian" questions about the film.  It's apparent that Disney wanted to tone down the "Christian" quotient in the film since most of the answers to the Christianity questions were downplayed.  However, C.S. Lewis' Christian aspects in this film are very evident, and I have nothing but praise for Disney for taking a chance and allowing the Christian themes to flow freely throughout the film.  Okay, so a few athiests and non-Christians will miss out on a wonderful adventure due to their prejudices.  As far as I'm concerned, it's their loss.  The Christian aspects of this story are key to its development and if you are only remotely familiar with the Gospels, you will quickly pick up on the symbolism of the four children, the White Witch, and, the most obvious of all, Aslan.<br /><br />There are moments of humor in this film that give youngsters a break in the rather high drama of this tale.  Most of that humor is provided by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, although young Lucy Pevensie almost steals the show with her cheery mood and big, innocent eyes.  The love between the children in this film is almost non-existent in movies these days, and it is refreshing to see a family that actually loves one another.<br /><br />There is also a rather violent aspect to this film.  This violence is doled out by the White Witch and her minions.  There are a number of creatures in this film that will likely frighten younger children, though the outcome of the battle between good and evil should settle most of their fears.  In fact, the only truly scary moment in this film occurs during the sacrificial sequence of a particular character.  In all honesty, this twenty-nine-year old almost broke down and cried at this pivotal moment in the film.  Of course, as a Catholic, this particular part of the film means a little bit more to myself than it may to others.  Also, the action and violence is primarily shot in close-ups, with a few exceptions.  One character does die a rather swift death that is visible to everyone, but most of the other deaths are dealt with tastefully and on a level that most kids can handle.<br /><br />The special effects are very, very exceptional.  Though not quite up to par with "Lord of the Rings" in the effects department, I have to admit that the effects are rather brilliant since there are many more talking animated creatures in this film than in "Rings."<br /><br />The actors and actresses in this film, especially the youngsters, are wonderful.  The two oldest Pevensie children, Peter and Susan, are played by William Moseley and Anna Popplewell.  Moseley's character takes on a father-figure role and while he often hesitates when making decisions, he always does what he feels is right for his siblings.  Popplewell, though sometimes motherly, is best seen as the protective older sister.  She has a deep connection to her little brother and sister and accepts them wholly, good and bad aspects combined.  Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, the "prodigal son" of the four children.  His character probably develops more than any other in the film.  Young Georgie Henley nearly steals this entire film as little Lucy Pevensie.  Her innocent curiousity gets the ball rolling in the adventure, and her face lights up the screen time and time again.  Aslan is voiced by Liam Neeson.  There should be no other choice in my opinion.  His voice gave Aslan a regal quality, yet you could feel the fear within him when he makes a key decision in the film.  Tilda Swinton rounds out the cast of key characters as the sinister White Witch.  She lures young Edmund into her trap with "sweeties" in an attempt to prevent the prophecy from coming true.  She is cold and calculating, and her battle with Peter is one of the most exciting bits of this picture.<br /><br />This film will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen.  For those who consider this film boring or childish, I'm betting that those particular people are, for the most part, non-Christians.  I'm not attacking anyone in particular, but if you don't have the "tolerance" to look past something that might be offensive to you, then you aren't as tolerant as you demand others to be.<br /><br />If you are a Christian, I suggest you let your children watch this film, no matter what their age.  Trust me, it's a lot easier on the eyes and the heart than "The Passion of the Christ."  If you simply enjoy wonderful fantasy tales like "Lord of the Rings," then this movie is right up your alley.  Highly recommended and I will definitely purchase this film when it comes out on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I did not know very much about The Chronicles of Narnia before seeing the film, just the basic thread of the story.  So what I knew of the film and the story I had seen in trailers and a single review that I read.  I found the film to be an extraordinary adventure.  I must confess that not knowing the books when I first saw the trailers I was not at all sure I wanted to see the film.  Seeing is believing, however, and I am hopeful that more of the Narnia books might be filmed.<br /><br />First off, the casting of the film was excellent, particularly the roles of Peter, Edmond, Susan and Lucy.  Also, James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was really excellent and made a perfect faun.  Perhaps the real stars are the people who produce the CGI effects with Aslan being the star in that area of production.  Voiced by Liam Neeson, Aslan truly comes alive as the noble and self-sacrificing leader that he is.  C. S. Lewis would be impressed, I think, on how well his book has been brought to the screen.  Without CGI Narnia would not be half as spectacular.  There are so many different creatures in Narnia that it was hard to single them all out.<br /><br />The violence of the battle has been commented upon by other reviewers and I agree with those who did not find the scene troubling.  There is less violence than The Lord of the Rings and care was taken to make it as bloodless as possible.  Even the death of the White Witch is off camera.  Certainly, the death of Aslan is a bit of a shock but one has the feeling that something will intervene and bring Aslan back.  The touching concern of Susan and Lucy seems to guarantee that this is not the end.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia is a memorable film that I will recall with pleasure and scenes like the White Witch's first appearance in her sleigh drawn by white reindeer with be etched in my memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>In truth, I've never been a big fan of such fantasies, although I knew the general plot outline for the Narnia series. I've seen all three LOTR films, including the 1970s cartoon version (which was superior to the live action version), read only The Hobbit in high school, have not read any of the Harry Potter books, but thought the first three films in that series were superior to the vastly overrated LOTR trilogy in almost every way. As for Oz, I've, of course, seen the 1939 Judy Garland film classic, but only read the first two books of the several dozen in the L. Frank Baum series. I do, recall, however, an early 1970s cartoon film of one of the later Oz books that had Liza Minelli voice Dorothy. Yet, none of these film versions, at least, equal the current film version of the first of the Narnia books: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. In fact, if the book is anywhere near as good as the film then even Lewis Carroll's mighty Alice books and Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio might have to move over as the reigning titans of children's fantasy literature. Yes, I know many J.R.R. Tolkien fans will object to the LOTR series being classified a children's fantasy, but too bad. Narnia is superior in virtually every way to LOTR, and Lewis wore the children's tag with pride.... This is the result of a good screenplay, which is very hard to do for kids, for most children's films lack that child-like wonder, as if the filmmakers have forgotten what childhood was like. Cinematographer Donald McAlpine captures that point of view in many of the child's eye shots of vistas and the whimsy on the children's faces. The only downside to the film is that, like many fantasies, you have to suspend logic. For example, why does Aslan need to wait a hundred years to bring an end to the White Witch's eternal winter? He clearly has the power to do so at any time, but `The Prophecy' has foretold that it can only occur when the four children arrive. But, this is part of the suspension of disbelief that all such tales require. The score works well, and never intrudes on the film, as it too often does in the LOTR trilogy, and the film's credits end with a terrific song by Alanis Morissette.<br />  I hope that this film does well enough that the remaining six books hit the screen, for with the amount of dreck being foisted at kids, these films will prove a nice respite. If only the Alice and Oz books are next on the film franchise conveyor belt, rather than Shrek 13 or Ice Age: Revenge Of The Neandertals. Click the heels of your ruby slippers along with me. Please.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>how could anyone give this film a low rate. what?? i don't get it. excellent picture i absolutely loved it. it had a huge dose of magic, tons of fantasy, and a tad bit of reality. this is for both children and adults, and very enjoyable by both. the story is great, the whole setup, the animals, everything was beautiful. their imagination really went out of the roof with this one. it had four young children, a magic wardrobe, talking lion, icy witch, the cutest beavers, and just about any other imaginable animal you can think of. it's good against evil, and the prophecy will be fulfilled. if you have not seen it, it is a must see. this story just makes you want more of it. i expected good, but not great. and this sure greatly exceeded my expectations. it's okay to escape reality every now and then. first there was neverland and now there's narnia. it's movies like this that make you wish these place really exsisted. just a short 135 minute escape from the real world.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>This film was very eagerly awaited by many fans of the books, and fantasy fans in general. By and large, the film delivers the goods, although it teeters a bit here and there. Narnia, the magical land entered through the wardrobe, is stunningly rendered. The wonder of Narnia in winter as first glimpsed by Lucy is perfect. The White WItch is perfectly dreadful, as she was meant to be. The children, for the most part, are good as well, though a few wooden moments occur during the rather long running time. Happily, the creature effects are well-done, especially the lion, Aslan. He was the epitome of nobility and power. The battle scenes seemed just a bit sanitized, perhaps after seeing the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we need to be completely bowled over to be impressed anymore. Anyway, the religious element wasn't bashed over our heads, just presented as it was in the book, more symbolic than overt, which is as it was supposed to be. There were a few deviations from the book, which again is usual for a transfer to the big screen. Hollywood seems to think a book just isn't allright as it is, and must be "doctored" a bit for translation to film. Oh well. For the most part, the film is very happily very close to the book, and it succeeds as a film. Hopefully this means the others in the series will be as good themselves. The DVD transfer is beautiful, with excellent light and dark contrast, with bright glowing colors. The sound is great without being overbearing. I had very definite ideas in my head when I read the book as to the landscape, the characters, and especially Aslan. Thankfully, the powers that be who created this film had many of the same ideas.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>Not that I am export at how old a kid should be to see movies, but I looked up the Movie Mom, and she has for the aduiance for this movie at 10 and up, so I guess in her eyes a 9 year old is still to you for this movie, now I am to old for the Movie Mom, but I might use her as a refence on movies like this if I have kids, so I am not a parent so I wouldn't breg that I know these sort of films, but I guess that older kids that can handle the Harry Potter movies, can handle this movie. But really decisons like this, should really be best to be left up to parents, since they know thier kids better, and they know what they can handle.<br /><br />Now including the end credits, the movie runs 2 hours and 22 minutes, and not 2 hours and 15 minutes like the disc of this movie says, and I might bet the tape says about the same thing. And how do you just like the title The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Andrew Adamson who co-directed the Shrek movies directed this movie. And will also direct the sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian that will be set for release in 2008, so this might be a good start for a good series, but we have to wait and see. When the movie begins, 4 kids  Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes),  and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), are sent from thier home to a professor's (Jim Broadbent) house, which he lives with housekeeper, that is sent to meet the kids, and warns them off the rules and not to disburb the professior. They play a game of hand and seek, and Lucy discovers a warobe, that on the other side takes her to the country of Narnia. And on her arrival she meets a faun, Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). And she goes to his house with him, and joins him for tea, where they have a visit, along the way she manges to escape from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). And she returns to the prefissor's home, where she notices her brothers and sister are still playing, and have not even noticed that she was missing. She tells them off her visit to the country, and of course they don't beleive her. But in time, she mangers to gets Edmund to the wardob, and gets him to follwo her into and into Naria, where he meets the witch, that he assumes is a queen, and she tells him that she wants to meet the rest of them. And really before you know it, all 4 kids ends up going into the warob, and in the country of Naria, where they have to get the help of the returning Lion King Aslan ( Liam Neeson), to defeat the witch, and return Narnia to its glory that it has lost.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>CS Lewis's story of the four Pevensie children's (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, and Anna Popplewell) adventures in the land of Narnia comes to the screen as a big-budget, digital spectacle.  Although the battle, which was summarized in only a few bloodless paragraphs of the novel, takes up a good part of the running time--and, no doubt, the budget--of the film, the tone of the book is largely preserved.  The children are perfectly cast and Narnia portrayed as a generally friendly place, except for occasional appearances by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and her cronies.  I like big battle scenes, so the shift of emphasis to spectacle from character didn't bother me, but strict admirers of the novel may be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie! "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" is everything I hoped it would be. As a huge fan of the C.S. Lewis novel, I didn't expect the film adaptation to live up to the book, but I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie nailed everything perfectly.<br /><br />This film tells the story of Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. The four siblings are sent away to the home of a quirky professor during World War II. The professor's house is huge and the children spend a lot of time exploring. One day the youngest child, Lucy, stumbles across a peculiar wardrobe. Behind the mothballs and fur coats is an entrance to the magical world of Narnia, which is under the control of the evil White Witch. Lucy and her siblings encounter many colorful characters in Narnia and join with them to defeat the witch and bring freedom to the residents of Narnia.<br /><br />Obviously, since this is a film adaptation of a novel, a few things from the book had to be cut. The original novel is so fabulous and it's a shame that every word couldn't have been included in the movie, but that would have been virtually impossible to do. Overall, I thought the screenplay was wonderful and the film stayed very true to the book. Everything that was depicted on screen looked exactly the way I imagined it would when I read the novel. The cast is perfect...all four children are so cute! (I must admit, I was not thrilled with Georgie Henley [the actress who played Lucy] at first, but she grew on me pretty quickly...and Tilda Swinton was PERFECT as the White Witch...so creepy!) The special effects were also incredible. All of the Narnia creatures looked amazing, especially Aslan (and whoever decided to get Liam Neeson to do Aslan's voice deserves a gold star for the day).<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED this movie! Watching it brought back many fond memories of reading "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" as a child...I'm so glad that the book is being reintroduced to a new generation of children in such a wonderful way. I hope more of the Narnia books make their way to the big screen very soon!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Of epic proportion and sumptuously filmed, this first entry in the CS Lewis Chronicles of Narnia is a cinematic delight.<br /><br />Transported the world of Narnia where animals talk and witches fly, four youngsters find themselves embroiled in a battle to save the people of Narnia from the very wicked White Witch.<br /><br />The costumes, music, lighting, special effects, and direction are all superb, and the cast is a revelation.  The four children are well played by Georgie Henley (the cutest little tyke since Drew Barrymore in ET); Skandor Keynes as the dark and brooding Edmond; William Moseley (looking like a cross between Richard Thomas and a young Heath Ledger) is the gallant older brother destined to be king; Anna Popplewell is the reserved, upstanding older sister; Tilda Swinton is awesome as the witch, conveying a chilling evil not recently seen; and James McEvoy is delightful as the faun, Mr. Thommus.  Under Andrew Adamson's (SHREK) sure direction, the movie is a marvelous fantasy indeed.  Even though it is somewhat violent, there is no lingering gore, so kids should be allright with it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>Is there anything more exciting for a bored child than to discover a portal that opens into a magical world of fairies and fauns, where a majestic lion battles a bad witch? That's the premise of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Walt Disney Picture's version of the first book in Lewis' seven-volume, allusion-rich, and allegorical exploration of Christian theology.<br /><br />During the London Blitz, four English children (The Pevensie children, ages 12 to 17) are evacuated to the country, into the care of an eccentric old professor. Soon, the children stumble upon a wardrobe in an unused room. Like Alice in Wonderland, the wardrobe is the portal to another world. Once they cross the threshold, they go into a magical world.<br /><br />As the Pevensie kids enter Narnia, they have to face some unexpected truths. Jadis the bad-tempered, cold-hearted evil White Queen (Tilda Swinton), holds all of Narnia in her frozen grip. Their sudden, but expected arrival triggers a call to war. And the lion king messiah Aslan returns to lead the way. Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keenness), older brother Peter (William Moseley), sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and, the youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley), will have to face great challenges as they fight alongside Aslan to return Narnia to the glorious kingdom it used to be.<br /><br />As fantasy films go, Narnia tells a relatively easy-to-follow story, clearly designed for a younger audience than The Lord of the Rings. The typical core family values theme of the Disney movies mixes its brand of Christian family values with popular English sentiment.<br /><br />Despite comparisons to The Lord of the Rings, Narnia has more in common with both The Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan, since all three stories involve children who escape day-to-day pessimism to experience wild adventures.<br /><br />High-tech special effects enable the filmmakers to breath life into exotic and beautiful creatures of myth and fantasy. Fauns with the legs of goats, half-human and half-horse centaurs, and a magnificent lion that talks and leads an army of gnomes, fairies, beavers, hawks, and foxes are some of the visual marvels this movie offers us.<br /><br />Director Andrew Adamson (Shrek) makes an impressive live-action debut, getting engrossing performances from his young cast and grafting a nice world of special effects, giving The Chronicles of Narnia an impressive start as another family classic of myth and fable on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>I've been looking forward to seeing this film for months. I read the books and watched study versions of the educational films as a child. It's been years but the stories have always held a special place in my heart. The children were wonderful actors; the sets were beautiful; the special effects were excellent. Everything fit together perfectly. I was completely inthralled. I'll be rushing to buy this on dvd when it is released so I can watch it again and again. It's inspired me to dig out my book so I can read the complete works.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>World War II is raging, bombs are falling on London, and children are being evacuated to the safety of the country.  The four Pevensie children, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy, are sent to live in a big house owned by an old professor.  One day they discover an old wardrobe in the attic...that just happens to be the portal to the magical kingdom of Narnia.  There, it is always winter, but never Christmas, thanks to the evil White Witch.  Opposing her is King Aslan, mighty lion and defender of all that is good.  The children must gather all their courage as they prepare for the final battle between the two sides.<br /><br />Almost everyone and everything we see is CGI, which is stunning!  The four children are natural and convincing. The first half of the story is very slow but the huge finale is worth the wait.  CGI Aslan is such a  sympathetic creature that there were few dry eyes in the theatre during his big scene,  and the Christian allegory is quite touching.  This is a very satisfying film for Narnia fans of all ages.  (Note:  Be sure and stay for the end credits to see a final scene with Lucy and the Professor.)<br /><br />Kona</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and (the continued franchise of sequels) would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S. Lewis and his magical world would have been completely destroyed.<br /><br />But I digress!<br /><br />Walking into Narnia is an interesting experience for me. In all honesty I find C.S. Lewis to be a great writer that I can hardly read. His books are hailed left and right and I just can't read them. It's not Lewis's fault. I realize it's my own media saturated thick head that blocks me up. So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance. I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself. What was my problem? What took me so long to become enchanted by this mystical world? I've come to realize I cannot appreciate the classics. I really think that's my loss and something I intend to work on in the new year.<br /><br />So anyway, sitting down in the movie theater I psyched myself up I intended to be wowed. I wanted Narnia to come alive onscreen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.<br /><br />NARNIA tells the story of four children. When the youngest named Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe that transports her into the magical land of Narnia. Narnia is a land of talking animals, magical fauns, and the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) whose enslaved the land causing it to be forever winter and never Christmas. Her sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and brothers Peter (William Moseley), and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) don't believe her story. Until the day all the children enter the Land of Narnia. A land and get caught up in a war that may fulfill a prophecy that will bring peace to Narnia.<br /><br />NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying. The screenplay is riddled with the problems from the very beginning. It tries so hard to stick to the book that the early moments of the film feel flat. Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way. Narnia feels just like the British Country side the children have come from. Narnia should feel different and it doesn't. Why is their a light post growing in the middle of the forest? Why are the animals talking? Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas? These questions should inspire awe. NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen, but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape. If your like me you'll find yourself thinking "why does this feel like a third rate LORD OF THE RINGS?"<br /><br />I think what's missing is the thing that made the novel so enchanting. It's Lewis's self aware narration. Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation. Admittedly that would be difficult in a film but It would have been nice if they'd tried. Instead they stuck humor in places that seemed out of place.<br /><br />But fear not, all is not lost. Because if you can get through the first hour (which really isn't that bad). You'll come out on the other side and into a much better and powerful movie. Once Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) the Mighty Lion comes on the screen you're in for the ride of your life.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed. That scene involves Aslan and the stone table. They got it right, and oh boy was I impressed. If Aslan is not strong, if Aslan is not seen as a threat even as he is being tormented this scene falls apart. But Adamson and his team make Aslan a character to be reckoned with. If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him, if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment, and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over, I would doubt your humanity ( just a little.)<br /><br />After that the film only gets better, there is an awesome battle sequence, and even Narnia begins to take a life of its own. It gives each character their moment to shine and it wraps itself up neatly enough. After the film was over I can't wait for PRINCE CASPIAN (or THE HORSE AND HIS BOY) to hit the big screen.<br /><br />I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley (watch out Dakota Fanning) the little girl who plays Lucy. She gives the early part of the film a lot more life and fills the screen like very few child actors can. This little girl (in her debut role) has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age. This little girl gives a performance that should really net her an Oscar nod. It probably won't but if I didn't bring it up who would?<br /><br />While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission. Seek it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" presents the C.S. Lewis fantasy classic very well.  (The story takes place during World War II in England where Lucy, the youngest of four siblings [Peter, Edmund, and Susan] stumbles upon a magical kingdom named Narnia in the back of a wardrobe of a professor's mansion while playing hide-and-go-seek.)  The children find themselves in a world of animals, fauns, and other mythical beasts who are captive to a witch's spell casting a perennial winter upon Narnia.  They find themselves in an adventure to help free Narnia from the icy grip of the White Witch, Jadis, and her endless winter. (It is a fantasy much like "The Lord of the Rings" with Christian allegory, but with enough appeal to please a wider audience.)<br /><br />Fortunately, the technical development for the movie lives up to our expectations. Many comparisons have been made to Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, but, while "Narnia" owes a great deal to the former's technical excellence (mainly from director Andrew Adamson's experience with "Shrek"), "Narnia" stands on its own.  Luckily for C.S. Lewis fans, the making of this movie is very timely.  The acting, which has sometimes been undermined, is good all around.  While Tilda Swinton is aptly given praise for her role as Jadis, the White Witch, the child actors deserve accolades for their natural portrayals as the young sojourners to the Narnia world.  (Their emotional range from sibling rivalry to genuine astonishment is good throughout.) The movie is also true to the book in content and  meaning without being watered down.  It presents an absorbing story and a gripping adventure.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG, but it shouldn't scare away too many viewers.  There are some frightening moments, and, indeed, the violence, while not too graphic, will be at least a notch up from cowboy and Indian matinee movies from the fifties. (Some five-year-old viewers survived the jolts at the movie theatre better than this reviewer, and the reader can always control the volume at home.) This movie is great entertainment for people of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Movie makers continually seek out new opportunities to show the world what modern technology can do.  It was probably inevitable that C.S. Lewis's books about Narnia would eventually become a film.  Fortunately, this version is nicely filmed and the special effects are phenomenal.  Avid fans will likely be disappointed because the film takes a lot of liberties with the plot, but everyone else will find this movie fun to watch.<br /><br />During the bombing of London early in World War II, many families sent their children into the countryside.  This plot device has been used in other movies, including at least one other well-known Disney movie, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks."  This movie focuses on four Pevensie children, Peter, Lucie, Edmund and Susan.  The four children are being boarded with Professor Kirke.  Professor Kirke is reclusive and eccentric.  The children eventually discover an old wardrobe that can lead to another world, a world called Narnia.<br /><br />Once in Narnia the children discover that they are part of a prophecy.  The children also learn much about themselves and develop many positive attributes, including compassion, trust, and responsibility.  Most importantly, they learn the power of love and caring for each other.  The children learn these lessons while helping the creatures of Narnia, including Aslan, their leader.<br /><br />Narnia is a magical place caught in a battle between good, represented by Aslan, and evil, represented by the White Witch, who aspires to be the Queen of Narnia.  The four children represent a change in the balance of power that has lasted for one hundred years.  Though the children have their doubts and fears, they have an opportunity to cast their fears aside and to help an entire world change for the better.<br /><br />I have seen many movies based on books.  The most difficult books to film are those based on fantasy because these stories typically rely as much on the characters as they do on the imagery of the stories.  Unfortunately, many film makers fail to understand the distinction between a good story and special effects.  Fortunately for us, the producer and director of this movie did understand the difference and they created a very enjoyable film to inspire us all.<br /><br />This film does have a fair amount of violence, and some younger children and most pre-school children should probably watch the movie only with a parent present.<br /><br />The DVD has a lot of special features.  The special feature that I enjoyed the most is the pop-up version of the movie.  All sorts of tidbits appear with this feature turned on that expand on C.S. Lewis's life and on the Narnia books.  The only problem with this feature is that there are lengthy periods when there are no pop-ups and I was a bit restless in the wait.<br /><br />"The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is a very good adaptation of the first book of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.  The movie does take liberties with the plot and deviates several times from C.S. Lewis's story.  However, the movie does retain the flavor of C.S. Lewis's book and is a worthy addition to the film libraries of most families and those who enjoy a good fantasy film.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I am not a huge fan of children's fantasy movies. I didn't even care to watch anymore Harry Potter after the first two. I did enjoyed Narnia, because it's a visually stunning film and it's got great action and special effects all over. I am a huge fan of Tilda Swinton and have seen most of her stuff since Orlando, but her best work is still The Deep End. I love her icy mysterious looks, very glamorous and powerful. Her porcelain dool face is perfect to play the witch, and she's proven to be a very versatile actress. I also enjoyed the limited participation of Jim Broadbent, who's probably the most overexposed British actor these days, but he's an amazing actor, and I also loved him Art School Confidential. I can't believe enjoyed a children's film.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>This film is almost exactly like the book. While the acting is a little "fake," I know that they will get better over time. My only complaint really is that the movie seemed rushed. Like the actors sometimes seemed to do their lines very fast. I'm not sure what it was, but something about the movie didn't sit right with me. I guess I was spoiled by the radio drama by Focus on the Family, which every Narnia fan should hear. While not as good as I was hoping, there are many pluses. The battle scenes are spectacular, and the resurrection scene, while semmingly rushed, is done very well. The opening is truly original and gives a good foundation for two of the four main characters. The humor in the film, even the added dialogue to add more humor, is great. Take the kids and go out and see classical story telling.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>When I was just a little kid I fell in love with the cartoon version of this story.  The movie followed the cartoon version very closely and it was amazing to see it brought to life.  I was teary eyed through most of the movie, it really moved me. Some of the mystical creatures gave me a chuckle because they looked silly and it almost seemed like watching Xena...but i thought the scenery and especially the music was wonderful.  You really get wrapped up in it and I think I liked the beautiful white snow instead of the lush green.  So, anyway, if you did watch the cartoon version you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I think I may have read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe at some point, but it's all fuzzy.  Mostly, I remember the effeminate lion, known as Aslan, from the animated version.  This left an impression on viewers for sure, because it showed up in a South Park episode (apparently, all lions do is tell really dumb jokes). This movie will make you forget the animated version of the C.S. Lewis' novel.<br /><br />To wit, the children of the Pevensie family are sent away to live with foster parents during World War II. There's brave Peter (William Moseley), angry Edmund (Shandar), smart Susan (Anna Popplewell) and innocent Lucy (Georgie Henley).  The four are eventually transported to Narnia, a land populated by fauns, centaurs, werewolves, minotaurs, ogres, giants, harpies, phoenixes, griffons, goblins, and talking animals.  It is here that the Christ-like lion known as Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) has returned to do battle with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />The four children are each gifted with special weapons by none other than Santa Claus--err, sorry, Father Christmas (James Cosmo)--and ultimately must face their own fears and share their unique talents to save Narnia.<br /><br />The film starts out slow, slow enough to make the children in the audience restless.  But once the war begins, it's a heart-pounding race to the finish.  Never before have so many mythological beings blasted across the screen, Dungeons & Dragons style, to beat the stuffing out of each other. The special effects are so good that when Aslan isn't speaking you forget he's an animated lion.  And amazingly, this is a PG (not even PG-13!) movie.<br /><br />People get hurt and even die.  Big, scary monsters try to murder each other as well as the children.  And they use words like "kill."  This is not the kiddy fare you remember.<br /><br />And yet, not one child was upset.  Narnia harkens back to a time when fairytales were cautionary stories that demonstrated the right choices through the travails of its protagonists.  All four children grow: Peter finds his courage, Edmund his humility, Susan her sense of wonder, and Lucy...well, Lucy discovers loss.<br /><br />The Christian symbolism is rife but appropriate.  Ironically, Narnia may well convert those holdouts that feel fantasy is somehow evil, as opposed to its original roots--allegories for Christian morality.  It completes the work that Peter Jackson started, a sort of Lord of the Rings for the kiddie set.  I for one am glad that C.S. Lewis' vision was realized with such breathtaking imagination.<br /><br />All that, and there's not a trace of a lisping lion.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Narnia is an interesting "animal" in it's marketability. C.S. Lewis' allegory-laden works are more accessible, on many levels for children and church-folk. So, thus the Narnia audience is broader due to its mix of borrowed mythology and Christian imagery. This release is well timed, following the success of both the Harry Potter franchise and the Lord of the Rings "trilogy." Well-timed also because the limits of computer animation has been pushed far enough to reverently envision the world of NARNIA. But you still have to work with those darn child actors, or do you...hmm.<br /><br />  Narnia, unlike the Lord of the Rings' Middle-Earth, this fantasy-land never quite comes across as consistently real. The Special Effects are very mixed: the wolves are impressive and Aslan, voiced perfectly by Liam Neilson, seems infinitely more realistic than his BBC counterpart (which, many of the other creatures are rather, soulless. Some landscapes recreated on sound-stages and matte paintings are plainly artificial. While, some meshing of real and digital works. Some of these moments with the actors do not. New Zealand director Andrew Adamson, of Shrek 1 & 2, doesn't have much experience with live action movies, coming from a Special Effects background, and maybe the child actors are out of their depth when it comes to acting in front of a green-screen. A lot of "The Lord of the Rings" works because the actors convincingly interact with each other as well as with the real or illusion environment. In this film, that doesn't happen. The children are also awkward and foundering when asked to portray some of the more complicated scenes. But I am profoundly pleased that children were cast who look like real WWII evacs and not Sears models.  As for the adult talent, the Evil White Witch, as played by Tilda Swanson was perfect performance for the genre.<br /><br />The film's opening shares more character insights and background than Lewis himself does, foreshadowing Edmund's selfish nature. With a brief but intense air raid on London, leading to the emotional juxtaposition of the evacuation of children to the country. Both beautiful cinematic moments not in the original text. Other classic moments that were from the text, like Lucy finding the wardrobe, were a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Then of course some of the problems lie with the original material, Lewis' book. The Narnia series is heavy on allegory and a mix of global myths in the fantasy world without any important dramatic justification unlike Tolkien's work. While such a miscellaneous fairy-world work in print or in children's minds, it certainly is difficult to portray on screen without appearing hackneyed to today's audiences. "Chronicles" had been promoted as "a Lord of the Rings for kids" this is misleading. It may have been the intention of its makers, but not the end product.<br /><br />But in the end it is a FINE big screen version of a fine book series with many magical moments and I hope it does well enough in theaters and on DVD to warrant more films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I saw the BBC production of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the first installment of "The Chronicles of Narnia" by C.S. Lewis, and even though it had an animatronic Aslan the magic worked because everybody treated it as if it were alive. That same principle holds true for the theatrical version that opened today. The four siblings who enter the land of Narnia through the wardrobe accept what is happening and where they are as well as the responsibilities that fall to them in that land, and we believe as well. This is also because the children come across as being real, consistent in their personality traits until they learn better or the situation compels them to grow up accordingly.<br /><br />The four Pevensie children are sent by their mother from a London that is being blizted nightly by Nazi bombers to stay in the country with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent). They are under instructions from the housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne), to basically do none of the things that children do. It is while playing a game that is probably forbidden that the youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley), discovers there is more to the wardrobe in the spare room than meets the eye. Her siblings, Peter (William Moseley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) do not believe her until they see for themselves. But then they discover that the magic that is Narnia is not as white as the driven snow when they meet up with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />Unlike many of these big production children's movies this one is filled with mostly unfamiliar faces. Popplewell is the only one of the kids with more than a single credit. Broadbent is the most recognizable face, but he has a minor part. James Cosmo, who plays Father Christmas, will look familiar but few will place his name and there will be those who swear that it is Cate Blanchett who is playing the White Witch. Liam Neeson is cast perfectly as the voice of Aslan and once you recognize it is him you can forget who is doing the voice and just enjoy the story. Similarly, when Aalan makes his sacrifice the Christian allegory of Lewis' story becomes patently obvious, but the story still works for those who see Azlan and think of "The Lion King" rather than Jesus Christ. That is why "The Chronicles of Narnia" is the most powerful and popular Christian allegory of the 20th century, and why few fans will find fault with this cinematic adaptation.<br /><br />Director Andrew Adamson helmed all of the "Shrek" movies, where the pop culture references flew fast and furious. In this film he casts his creative net even further in bringing together familiar images and magical moments. I was reminded of Dorothy discovering the Technicolor land over the rainbow in "The Wizard of Oz," the train trip to Hogwarts in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," and the great clash of armies from "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." When the Witch shows up in her polar bear drawn chariot I was reminded of Frank Frazetta's cover painting for "The Eternal Warrior" and the last time we see Aslan recalls Mary Stevenson Parker's inspirational poem "Footprints." So a lot of what is in this movie will resonate with a lot of viewers, which is totally fitting given the chronicles related by Lewis.<br /><br />They did a superb job on the packaging for this two-disc collector's edition.  The DVDs are in a case that has nothing on the cover but the wardrobe, which I learned has carvings that tell the story of "The Magician's Nephew," which is Lewis' prequel to this story.  That fits into a box and when you remove it reveals Lucy in Narnia by the lamppost in the snow.  Disc 1 has the movie and the blooper reel.  You can watch the movie again with commentary by either the kids and the director or by other filmmakers for more of the technical aspects.  You can also turn on the Narnia Fun Facts that will pop up throughout the film.  Disc 2 has featurettes representing the two world of Narnia.  Creating Narnia has bits that look at the director, the children, the creation of the film, the life and work of C.S. Lewis, and various cinematic storytellers.  The common denominator here is that this was clearly a labor of love.  Then the Creatures, Lands & Legends part looks at the various creatures from legend that populate Narnia.  Final Note: Be sure to watch the credits because there is a scene right after the cast credits.  Plus, there is an Alanis Morisette song, "Wunderkind" to listen to as well to let the movie play out to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film version has the outer trappings of the great story, but it is so shortened that it loses a large part of its soul.  In the book, the characters are important and have intricate relationships, which are successfully portrayed in the BBC version.  However, the Disney version cuts most of it out, except for the extremely obvious.  So what is left is an adventure, with baddies warring against the goodies.  The last quarter of the film is the battle itself, which is graphically violent and excessively detailed.  The digital effects are quite spectacular, but again, this masks a rather hollow core.  What you end up with is a visual spectacle that disappoints if you want the deeper themes that are in the books.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly, as a pass time but not a literary experience.  As the recent Lord of the Rings Trilogy shows, a film version can succeed as a literary experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with the professor in a mansion. When they're playing hide and seek, they discover a world that they never thought existed. Here we enter Narnia-where mythical creatures talk and where a cruel white witch reigns over the land. She has a spell to keep it always winter-but never Christmas. No one can defeat the white witch. Except-there is a prophecy- that if 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve sit at the throne at Cair Paravel, the white witch will be defeated. Can it be done? The only hope Narnia has is for the four children to sit at the throne. Led by Aslan-the creator of the land-who will come out victorious?<br /><br />  I really enjoyed watching this movie. Not only is it full of great special effects and plenty of action, but it's filled with lots of symbolism. The books are written by C.S Lewis-a Christian author. In his books Lewis put in tons and tons of symbolism. And the movie follows it.<br /><br />  Now for the effects. This movie is chalkfull of effects. The Lion-Aslan actually looks real compared to the earlier Narnia movies. The battle sequence is great. The scenery is great, too. (it was filmed in New Zealand) So if you like action and adventure, and have read the books-then step into Narnia-where everything comes to life!</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>Although Narnia is far from my favorite genre of a film its a really good movie none the less,as for the the blu ray version all I can say is way to go Disney.Maybe it doesn't have all the special features as the four disc released previously but there is plenty here to keep you busy.Now to the nuts and bolts of the blu ray release,what most wonder most.Is this a good blu ray? Is it really worth the price to have on blu ray.Well if your like me and you enjoy terrific looking blu's with some great audio then yes,yes,yes.I'm thinking of some of the better looking blu rays I own and watched and I'm thinking of some of the greats in the video quality like Swordfish yes Swordfish if you enjoy the best blu ray quality than Swordfish in my opinion is probly the best in terms of video quality.Lets see then there is I Robot,Kingdom Of Heaven,Flyboys,Troy,Blood Diamond to name a few.All these I consider to be some of if not the best demo video material for Blu ray disc.Now we have Narnia and Narnia meets or beats any of the above stated blu disc for quality,the the video is what you expect a "HD" disc to look like plain and simple.There is so many brilliant colors and nice epic settings in this movie and Disney did one fine job for the blu ray realease.The audio has one of my personel favorite audio tracks the 5.1<br />uncompressed and its done well here also.I know its alot for me to go on typing about here considering Narnia isn't my favorite genre of films but this is a blu ray that does indeed deserve the respect.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>"The Chronicles of Narnia" is one of those rare sets of stories that are meaningful to children, teens, and adults.  However, what is especially interesting about these stories is that they mean very different things to people at different ages while retaining their ability to convey it central message to everyone.  There is a reason this set of stories has grown in popularity and reputation over the past fifty-plus years.  C. S. Lewis created his stories drawing on his rich understanding of myth, his Christian faith, and his brilliance as a writer.<br /><br />Kids will love the fantasy and adventure.  There will be moments of great wonder and even some of fear, but all of this great movie will delight them.  Teens will relate to the four main characters and their complete loss of control over their lives during the terrible Blitz of World War II and then having to rise to the challenges that face them in the very strange world of Narnia.  Adults will enjoy all the adventure and fantasy, but also the way ancient myths and characters are used to dress out what is basically a Christological message.<br /><br />Then there is the achievement of the film itself.  The visual aspects of the film are simply marvelous to behold.  It is something you will want to see many times (at least I do).  The achievement of Aslan as a character who exists only in a computer or briefly as three different models, well, that is a tour de force of the animator's art.  Having to get such a beloved and well known story into a film that can be shown at commercial length and still delight fans of the books is also an accomplishment to be proud of.<br /><br />The characters on the screen and the voices chosen for the animations are all spot on.  I enjoyed every performance in the film and am delighted to own this DVD to watch with my family many times.<br /><br />The extras on this deluxe 2 DVD edition are unbelievably rich.  You get a voice over with the director and the four children of the cast, another voice over with the director and a few of the other creative talents who helped make the movie, and another feature with pop up informational bits.  So, you can watch the movie four times and without watching it the same way twice.  Then there is also a montage of bloopers that is a bit of fun.  This is all just on the first disk.<br /><br />The second disk is crammed full of features that will show you what seems to be every aspect of making the film.  We get features of the director, all the principle creative talents including the producer.  Then there are features about the story C.S. Lewis created and how all the other artists had to tell that story through their individual crafts.  So much of the original story has to be interpreted to get it on the screen.  The areas where images, sounds, and effects would have been supplied by the reader's imagination have to be made explicit in a movie, and what we have been given here is amazing.<br /><br />There is another feature on the creating of the creatures and one on a single amazing scene and how it was put together from filming done in a half-dozen countries.  There is even a map of Narnia that the viewer can explore in 3-D computer generation.<br /><br />Even the case of this deluxe edition is interesting and evokes the main idea of the magical wardrobe.  It also includes a couple of postcard-sized reproductions of the concept art for the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this for everyone and especially families to watch and talk about together.  There is a lot in these stories and a lot to draw out of each other about what the meaning each took from the various scenes and images.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>I honestly cannot remember if I ever read these books as a kid. I, like many, have felt a slight itch to read them now, since the movie release was somewhat of a reminder that the books even existed. I wanted to see the movie first, though. I wanted watch with attention devoid of geeky "this-is-nothing-like-the-book" bias.<br /><br />As I lay in bed on my lazy Saturday afternoon watching The Chronicles of Narnia, I definitely had the longing to be sitting in a dark movie theater, losing myself in the action on the giant silver-screen. Seeing it on DVD was not a bad thing, but I think if I had taken the time to see it in the theater it would have definitely been a good thing.<br /><br />In the "books we read as children turned movies" category, The Chronicles of Narnia was geared more towards children than Tolkien/Jackson Lord of the Rings movies.<br /><br />In the "books my children may or may not have read turned movies" category, The Chronicles of Narnia may have even been a little less sophsiticated than Harry Potter. Forgive me for saying that in The Chronicles of Narnia it seemed that a few more things were a little far-fetched. I know it seems ridiculous that I say that a young boy, his brother and sisters leading a war against an evil witch is far fetched, though the fauns and centaurs they lead into battle and a completely different story about an entire school of young wizards were completely acceptable.<br /><br />Some of the effects were flawless. The CG lion was masterfully done, as were most of the panoramic views. There were so many beatiful scenery shots, but some appeared lazily done. Maybe the design team had to cut a few corners, but the kids looked too blatantly super-imposed at times. This is a petty complaint, and my only one really.<br /><br />I had fun watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it to anyone with young kids who are yet to go through the phase where they repress their imagination or anyone who has already come out of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>The Computer Generated Effects are astonishing. I enjoyed the World War II sequence in London and as was the practice, if possible, to move children (the central protagonists) to the countryside which was not the usual target of the Nazis. I loved the slow and methodical buildup as the four Pevensie children eventually discover a secret passage into NARNIA an extra-dimensional Kingdom where good and evil struggle.  If you are unfamiliar with the story it is unfair to say more. The landscapes, colors, music and the overall atmosphere are all very beautiful. I was very moved.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>It's good to see major studios take a chance on Christian themed films. And now that Disney is in production with a sequel. Bravo! I have never read "The Chronicles of Narnia" by C.S. Lewis, but my two son's have the complete set, and have enjoyed reading them. Very moving, and extremely well done. Good family and inspirational film making.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Without the spectacular commercial and critical success of `Lord of the Rings,' no one would have given a green light to the production of the faithful adaptation of `The Chronicles of Narnia.' In that sense, the first film made out of the seven books of C S Lewis cannot be seen without being compared with the Peter Jackson's trilogy. In short, is `Narnia' is as good as that?<br /><br />My answer is `almost.' Disney et al. made a decent fantasy film out of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." It is less ambitious in its scale and story, but the film's impressive visuals make up for its less imaginative direction and sometimes dull screenplay. The computer generated creatures are all remarkable, and the good lion Aslan is realized with the voice of Liam Neeson, who provides the dignity of the character.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is also impressive as White Witch. Probably she is more famous for playing the unique roles in such films as `Orlando' and `Constantine,' and her enigmatic presence perfectly fits in the ice queen character. Of course, that's unless you have already created your own image of the Witch, but her delightfully twisted acting worked for me. The four main young characters, the four children who wander into the land behind the wardrobe - Edward, Lucy, Peter, and Susan - are all played by newcomers, and their acting sometimes shows it. Not that I am complaining, but it must be admitted that the creatures in Narnia like giants, fawns, beasts, talking animals especially Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are more memorable in the film.<br /><br />Finally, about the tone of the film. The religious connotations are subdued, but you may not find it damaging. The producers are obviously aware that they are making a family picture, and the overall tone of the film is less dark than `Lord of the Rings' or recent `Harry Potter' films. And my verdict: "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is no groundbreaking achievement, but still an entertaining fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>Wow, this was so well done. The child actors were perfect, the CGI creatures were perfect, the soundtrack... again, perfect (except for the pop music during the credits).<br /><br />A magical fairy tale, a metaphor for "The Greatest Story Ever Told."  Yes, the Gospel story used to be called this, modern critics would strongly disagree with this outdated sentiment. (Perhaps they'll award this title to "The DaVinci Code?") The strongest critics of C.S. Lewis' book and this mostly faithful movie are generally those who hate Christian belief.<br /><br />Yet consider, many stories borrow Gospel elements... including the epic "E.T."<br /><br />If you're not Christian, no harm, no foul!  This fairy tale has adventure, humor, beauty, tragedy and triumph.

I highly recommend this to anyone and not just because it's a disney movie. It also has great acting, a perfect plot and awesome characters. Especially Aslan the lion {Liam Neeson}. I also think every character was pretty well cast, like the White Witch {Tilda Swinton}, and the wardrobe is where the magic begins with beautiful scenery of Narnia and monster members of the White Witch's army, {that goes without saying} with more than a few great battle scenes that makes everything fit everything perfectly in Narnia as the way it is, like making the entire movie a cross between Indiana Jones and "Lord of The Rings." I remember seeing several different versions of "Narnia" before this movie with the BBC version and the books, neither that I remember that well, but the point is this is just another wonderful adaption that was even better than I anticipated because I didn't know what to think before I saw it and now all I can think of is how marvelous it really is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Normally I write a movie review by approaching the script and the job done by the director, summarizing the plot a little and praising or panning various performances and CGI.<br /><br />I don't think I need to do that with "Narnia".  I reveled in the books as a child, and I found the film experience to be...thrilling.  Beautiful.  Engrossing.  Spectacular.  I hung on every word and scene.  A visual feast.  Bravo to the filmmakers!</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>I'm quite upset with [...] whose editor on their film site lead me to believe that this film would disappoint. That is not the case as long as you know what to expect. One expectation that was set by the pre-release review I read was that the special effects would not be spectacular. They're not. In fact, the CGI is so far from realistic it may have been better to do this as a computer animated feature. Nevertheless, don't let the mediocre CGI steer you away from this otherwise phenomenal film.<br /> I always had a hard time watching the original BBC versions as the special effects and puppets were absolutely abysmal, but it was still incredibly true to the book. My biggest fear with this one was that would resolve the special effects issues, but would stray from the novel so much that it would become unwatchable. My biggest fear was that they would modify the content to loose it's religious allegory in order to "avoid offending people". Thankfully the director was ever true to the novel, committing a few minor sins of omission, but leaving the main story, and it's metaphors in tact, and for that I am grateful. The story follows CS Lewis's novel nearly perfectly, loosing only minor details, and minor bits of dialogue, and not adding anything that would disrupt the flow of the original tale.<br /> I'm really proud of Disney for having the guts to do this film right, and having the guts to keep CS Lewis's original vision intact. Thank you.<br /> Although the CGI effects were disappointing after some of the newer fantasy films such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, CS Lewis's classic has finally been given the definitive visual version of the tale that it has long deserved... and I can finally retire the abysmal BBC version.<br /> The acting in here is fantastic, the cinematography is artistically brilliant, and best of all Aslan is awesome. If you can only see one movie this winter, see this one. You aren't likely to regret it, as long as you don't have too high of expectations for the CGI.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>This almost-epic-length film is far superior to the TV version of a few years ago, as we might expect given the rapid development of SFX technology.  It's also an almost exact copy of the classic book, with only a few scenes (not very vital) left out.  By now probably everyone knows the story: the four Pevensy children are sent away from London during the Blitz and end up at a rambling old country house inhabited by aged Prof. Kirke and his housekeeper; youngest Lucy inadvertantly blunders into the magical land of Narnia by way of a magical wardrobe and is befriended by a faun named Tumnus, tries to convince her sister and brothers of the reality of her experience, is followed in a second time by Edmund (who meets the infamous White Witch, self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia, and is tricked into becoming her agent), and a third time by all three of them; they discover that Tumnus has been arrested by the Queen's Secret Police (wolves), are befriended by a pair of talking Beavers, learn that they are the foretold saviors of the land, and after extended trails (and Edmund's temporary defection) finally meet and make common cause with Aslan, the great Lion, who has assembled an army for them to lead against the Witch and her partisans.<br /><br />Of course if you've read the book you know ahead of time how it's all going to turn out, and the real enjoyment comes from seeing how the scriptwriters and director have translated the story to film and how the SFX department has made the magic of Narnia come alive.  I don't think I've seen better effects since the first chapter of "Star Wars" burst upon an astounded world 30 years ago.  Even though you know that the creatures of Narnia are computer-generated, they seem so lifelike that you root for the good ones and (mentally) hiss the bad guys: standouts include Aslan (of course), whose facial expressions haven't been equalled by an effects-created creature since "Dragonheart," the centaurs in his army (one of whom serves as Peter Pevensy's second-in-command), and the Witch's force, a wonderfully-imagined stew of ugliness including her General, who appears to be a Minotaur.  There are even cheetahs in the good army and tigers in the evil one whose movements are completely true to what you've seen in nature films.  The climactic battle (which was apparently filmed in New Zealand) is absolutely unforgettable, including a clashing, crashing confrontation between Peter and the Witch, the latter armed with not one but two swords and swinging them around like broomsticks.  (And the music that plays under the action makes you want to rush right out and get the soundtrack CD.)  And, as has been mentioned by another reviewer, just when you think the story has ended and the credits have started to roll, there's a little surprise that isn't in the book but looks forward to revelations of a later volume in the series.  (Recently while at my local theater to see another flick, I noticed a poster for a forthcoming release of "Prince Caspian," the second book in the Chronicles, so it looks as if we can hope to see all seven adapted to film in the next few years.)  Well-paced, splendidly visualized, and just scary enough to give youngsters some delicious thrills (and maybe, admittedly, a nightmare or two), this is DVD that should be in everyone's permanent collection; it's definitely going to join mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is based from the first Book in the Chronicle of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis.  The book was actually required reading in my elementary school, so I was already quite familiar with the story.  There was an animated film created years ago, but it was very uninspiring, and I believe it to have been a direct to video release.  I was more than ecstatic when I learned the a real movie was coming to theatres, and the previews looked tremendous.  It was enough to assure that this was going to be big.  Epic big, as in The Lord of The Rings traditional sense.  The movie did not let me down.  It started out a little slow, but by time the climax approached, something triggered all kinds of positive emotions within.  This is a powerful tale, and perhaps even more powerfully transfered to the big screen.<br /><br />There are two ways of looking at this film.  One, is for pure entertainment.  The second, is on a religious perspective.  C.S. Lewis has been known for being a Christian author, and fascinated with placing religious events into fantasy lands.  It is very evident that this movie has those influences, and any watcher will pick up on the Biblical references throughout the story.  I actually chose option three, and that was watching it both for entertainment and for its content, and in the end, I felt I had watched something very satisfying and very complete.<br /><br />Happiness, excitement, despair, hope, and even war.  They are all in this film, and there are all well felt.  Its not just the story alone that shares practically all forms of emotion and character, and not even the characters in the film too, but the cinematography, directing, and musical score add so much to complete the tone.  The camera gives us plenty of wonderful sweeping shots of the landscape, which begins as winter in Narnia and eventually shoots into spring.  The score, is worth purchasing on cd.  Every scene of music fits so well and is so neat with what is going on in Narnia.  Then you have the final climatic showdown, where the good vs evil armies fight in war.  The score is both energetic and iluminating, getting you pumped to cheer on the good guys (or bad, if you wish).<br /><br />Perhaps one of the coolest things about the film are some of the effects, and more specifically, the way the creatures are used.  This isn't like Lord of The Rings where you got some elves and orcs - you generally have a mix of hundreds of creatures and animals in Narnia.  Bears, tigers, bulls, oxen, and wolves are just a few that shine, and all clash in the final battle.<br /><br />Another wonderful thing about this film is it is well suited for people of all ages.  If it weren't for the big battle in the end, this would easily have been a G rated film.  Though the fights go on for maybe a total of 10 minutes, there is no blood and the camera does a smooth job of skipping the details of swords piercing through bodies.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful film that would make most feel really good when walking away.  Though most people will clearly see the religious refernces, there is great entertainment value in this too.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Narnia is a massive film. To compare to Lord of the Rings is unfair (and I won't since I didn't really care for the Ring Trilogy - never read the books either...). I think the more fair comparison would be the Harry Potter films. And even that isn't dead on.<br /><br />Let's start with the actors. The children are all engaging, but I couldn't help thinking that they could have found more earnest and, yes I'll say it, talented actors. Now...to give the devil his due...these children were forced to "act" with nothing! They were working with green screens and disks on sticks. It's extremely difficult for a trained and aged actor to perform their craft in those circumstances. However, it would still seem that the director should have coaxed some better performances out of the kids. Peter, in particular, seems uncomfortable at times acting. His delivery is often stilted and amateurish. Does it make him unlikable? Far from it. Undoubtedly these young actors were chosen, in part, because the expectation is there to carry on the film franchise and these kids are deemed to be up to the task. Having not read the books, I can only assume that the young actor playing Peter was chosen for his angelic looks and his earnest demeanor.<br /><br />Now to the film overall. It's definitely good. It, I understand, is somewhat true to the book (which I think is always good). However, I wanted a bit more. Why is the white queen bad? Why has she turned everything to ice and snow? (By the way, Tilda Swinton is great in the part!). In what is the childrens' appearance foretold? Is it a book? or merely a legend? You get my idea. It would seem that just a couple of sentences of extra "backstory" and expositional material could have made the film as robust as the detailed telling done in the Harry Potter films.<br /><br />The CGI effects...Aslan doesn't always look great. Sometimes he's uncannily real looking and other times, no. The fox never looks real. Occasionally the beavers look quite cartoonlike. I'm willing to bet the CGI effects will improve as the series continues. After all, Dobby, in Harry Potter, looked quite CGI to me and even Golum looked cartoonish at times in LOTR.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great family film and one that adults and kids alike will enjoy. Please don't let my criticism be viewed as anything more than it is. We're lucky that such films can now be made and our expectations of them are for that of reality. We've come a long way from the Ray Harryhausen days of stop motion animation...so much so that we can now criticize the animation and compare it to "reality".<br /><br />Get this film and you'll be happy you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I went in not expecting much, and was amazed with how good this movie is.

Then I HAD to read the book and loved it too. I remember it being a catalyst for my widespread imagination and my desire to be a writer myself... along with Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Yet, maybe I'm jaded and old, but the movie didn't meet my expectation and desire to be taken back to that imaginary rich time of my life. It was good, but I guess I wish that the makers would have taken this as seriously as the makers of Lord of the Rings took their film. This was a hugely important story to me as a child, and I felt like it was missing something. Grandeur. Largeness. Emotional impact was just okay. It needed to be respected and fleshed out in its entirety. Added to. But more importantly, the world just didn't seem as grand and amazing as it did when I read the book.<br /><br />To be fair though. My five-year-old daughter loved it and was actually brought to tears at the stone sacrifice scene. So, I guess I could see the emotional impact the story had on me when I was a child, through her.<br /><br />The movie is good and the effects are PHENOMINAL! They really are. The animals are tremendous and realistic. The wolves are scary as I remembered them. I just wish when it was all said and done that I had more of a feeling that it was better than typical.<br /><br />Was the movie a copy of dozens of movies from the past or are the dozens of movies from the past copies of the original book? I'm not sure. But, I just couldn't help thinking that the movie didn't really take me anywhere that I hadn't already been in movies previous to it. In fact, many scenes from the film seemed to mirror Lord of the Rings... and the ending seemed to mirror the ending of Star Wars.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and my five-year-old loved the movie, possibly as much as I did when I was her age. But, to me, it fell short of my expectations and failed to truly capture the COMPLETE essence of Narnia.

After hearing a year and a half worth of superlatives and castigations, for it seems no one was in the middle of the road about this one, I tried my best to have no expectations. I didn't entirely succeed, but it didn't matter much; this movie is nowhere near as impressive as I was hoping (far closer on the epic-flick scale to Eragon than The Return of the King), but on the other hand, it didn't have anywhere close to as much of the rah-rah-rah feel its critics chided it for as did, say, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes that appeared a couple of months later.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure everyone knows the plot by now-- didn't we all have to read this in school?-- so I'll skip a synopsis and go straight to criticizing the pace of the film, since there were any number of parts of this interminable movie that could have been shortened; I will try to avoid making the same mistake while reviewing it. It's been a good long while since I've read the book (and I distinctly recall not thinking much of it; if memory serves, I made it through this and Prince Caspian, then gave up after struggling through the first half of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader), but it seems to me there was a great deal of butchery involved in the first half of this script; I don't remember the novel being anywhere near this simplistic. And yet somehow it still manages to drag as if it were chained to a wardrobe itself. The first hour of the movie could have easily been rendered down into fifteen minutes. Or, alternately, it could have been used to give us a little more insight into the characters we meet during that first hour, rather than Adamson (who also had a hand in the script) and his collaborators assuming (I'm inferring here, but I think I have a good chance of being right) that everyone, having read the books, would already know these characters, saving the scriptwriters from the chore of having to let us get to know them again. Oops.<br /><br />Once the action starts up, the pace of the movie quickens, but it is sorely lacking the kind of expertise found in the action scenes of Peter Jackson (or, for that matter, Mel Gibson; the climactic battle plays far more like a less-inspired Braveheart than anything in the Lord of the Rings trilogy). It almost feels as if it's a highlight reel from the book that picked up every wrong highlight it possibly could.<br /><br />Just didn't work for me, on any level. The only thing that redeemed it-- kind of-- was some decent acting. * ?</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>My fear when I first heard that a series of films based on C. S. Lewis's marvelous CHRONICLES OF NARNIA books I was simultaneously fearful and hopeful.  I was afraid, on the one hand, that they would somehow mangle the books in translating them to the screen; I was hopeful, on the other hand, that perhaps the filmmakers would do for Lewis what Peter Jackson had done for Lewis's friend J. R. R. Tolkein and his LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  Neither my hopes nor my fears were realized, for while this is in no way a bad movie, it doesn't come up to the level of the LOTR.<br /><br />This is quite a good film, and that in itself is something of an achievement.  In rereading a couple of Lewis's Narnia books lately, I've increasingly wondered if it is possible to do a great--as opposed to merely a very good--translation of these books into film.  The problem is twofold.  First, the books are quite literary in a way that Tolkein's books are not.  So much of the substance of the book consists of the manner in which Lewis addresses the reader and the filmmakers either did not try or did not succeed in finding an analog to this in the film.  On the other hand, this same manner of addressing the reader actually pads out the book, creating far more pages than a more succinct treatment of the subject would have done.  This is not a fault of the novel; far from it.  But it does leave the filmmaker with a problem with a lack of action.  Thus, anyone making a film is forced to think of ways to pad out the action.  This is the opposite problem with most adaptations of a literary source.  Usually you have too little time to squeeze in too much content.  Here there is too much time to contain the content that the novel provides.  Hence, the result is a heavily embellishment of the book.  One finds more in the movie than one finds in the book, and I'm not entirely certain that this is a good thing.  The upside is that not much that was added was bad.<br /><br />If the film just missed that last extra bit of magic that would have made it a masterpiece, it did manage to be at least excellent in almost every area.  They made a great decision at the outset, opting to following the "real" order of the books, instead of the wretched reordering brought about by Lewis's stepson and literary executor Douglas Gresham (who gets co-producer credit in the film, almost certainly an honorary designation, since his insistence on reordering the books shows he really doesn't understand them).  Think of how awful it would have been if the film series had started with the weakest novel in the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, instead of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, which is the finest (though perhaps not the one most suited to translation to film--more of this below).  The music was excellent, the sets were superb, the CGI consistently excellent, the art direction marvelous.  Though the cast featured virtually no name performers, I found no problems in the casting.  I very much liked the kids in the film, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, which is probably the most important of the four children's roles to get right.  Tilda Swinton, one of the great film actresses of the past decade, was excellent as the witch; though I thought her costuming was a bit below par.  The fake shoulders they gave her at times looked quite absurd.  Liam Neeson was a good choice to voice Aslan, though I admit that I regret Brian Cox's having dropped out of the project.  I am not aware what issues were in play in causing him to leave, but I think his extremely gruff voice would have been wonderfully appropriate for Aslan, who is not, of course, a tame lion.  The CGI for Aslan was very good and I wasn't the tiniest bit disappointed with Aslan's appearance.  Since he is the only character who will appear in every film, it was essential to get him right.  Aslan is not, as many suppose, a Christ figure.  Instead, Lewis meant him actually to be Christ as he might have been incarnated as a mighty lion in a magical land called Narnia.  To the filmmakers' credit, they did not mute the religious message at the heart of the books, but neither did they highlight it more than Lewis himself did.  I think they struck the right balance.<br /><br />There is a very real chance that some of the other books in the series will be more successful as films than this one.  THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, for instance, has considerable possibility as a movie, including what is quite probably the finest single character in the series apart from Aslan.  I speak, of course, of the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep.  Even THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which is a fairly weak book, has considerable potential as a film.  And if they get THE LAST BATTLE, Lewis's non-premillenial rendering of the end of the world, right, it could end up one of the great film fantasies ever created.  I no longer fear that they will do a disservice to Lewis's books in these films, but I will continue to hope that they create something magical.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Chronicles Of Narnia" is excellent!

The kids were wonderful, and the story remained fairly faithful to the book.  The CGI was top notch.  The talking animals all looked very realistic.  While a lot of people talk about this being a Christian film, a lot of people would never know if not told.  My wife saw the movie with me and it never occured to her the parallels with Christianity.  I think this is a great film to see with the kids.  It wasn't overly scary and while there is fighting, no blood is shown, and the action cuts away quickly.  Cetainly worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>I have to admit, Narnia is an excellent movie that will stand the test of time! It's a true saga, like the Lord Of The Rings!<br /><br />What moved me most was how each of the four children & teens grew, as individuals, and as a family unit. It's so easy to be selfish and only think about one's own needs. It's refreshing to see characters not only being concerned with each others well being, but also with the the community-at-large. One, which is so incredibly alien, it takes a lot of courage to care!<br /><br />In the world of Narnia, these four young people have real power! Their decisions have incredible consequences! One choice is to take risks, the other to retreat into safety and comfort. The adults in the audience, I'm sure, can identify with this tug-of-war. This quandary effects us all at some point in our lives.<br /><br />Another theme addressed is War. The opening scene shows the bombing of London during World War 2. I knew someone who actually lived through this experience as a child. It left lifelong scars. In the very beginning we see train loads of children being evacuated to family, friends, or even benevolent strangers in the much safer countryside. I said to myself, this is what war is really about: desperation and separation. It brought tears to my eyes. If anyone had experienced what my English friend did, first hand, as a child, they would think twice before starting or supporting war, period!<br /><br />While a war is fought in Narnia, this one is to prevent the collapse of civilization, at the hands of evil geniuses, just like in Lord Of The Rings or World War 2. Perhaps, if that was the standard the human race could agree on to wage war, then this ancient scourge would, indeed, finally become a thing of the past!<br /><br />The filmmakers should be congratulated for bringing a fairly complex story to the big screen with dignity and inspiration. I'm sure C.S. Lewis would be proud!<br /><br />P.S. I saw this magnificent film a second time, and I'm glad I did! The feelings of elation and awe are much appreciated! Memo to Hollywood: Start making more movies which are uplifting and your bottom line will uplift, too!</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I am an enormous fan of C.S. Lewis's (Jack) work regarding Narnia. Reading them as a child lifted me to heights that I will never forget.<br /><br />Now - don't get down on me and trash my review. I loved the film; hence the four star rating. Anyone that has seen the BBC movie released in 1988 or so, understands that there is an enormous difference between the two films. The BBC film was, almost, line-by-line faithful to Lewis' work. Sadly, it wasn't very good. It was excruciatingly slow when it didn't need to be slow. Imagine two minutes of watching fawns and what not simply walk. Ugh. Horrific.<br /><br />This was not a line-by-line rendition of the book. Critics who say it was were on drugs. Today we live in an age where action is more preferable than faithfulness (as seen in the Lord of the Rings), but if the faithfulness is close enough, then we must accept it. I struggled with this viewing, but in the end, I decided that I liked it, that it was close enough in form to Lewis' writing. Sadly, as was Tolkien, Lewis wasn't around to tell us what he thought of it. Many critics have applauded the film for being true to Lewis' work. I can't imagine what they were thinking. Yes, there were the four Pevensies crowned at Cair Paravel. Yes, there was a White Witch (played brilliantly), and yes there was a magnificent lion and very well performed Sons of Adams and Daughters of Eve. Peter, in particular, was marvelous. Edmund, who played both a traitor and a "good guy", was intensely believable. He cast well.<br /><br />But there were serious derivations from the book. HOWEVER, this is not a bad thing. Lewis' book was not an action packed book. To turn it into a film, action need to be inserted, and the directors did just that. I'm not speaking only of the battle scene (which did not occur in the book), but rather a number of other events. However, they were all used to add tension to the story, and they didn't take anything away from the story. To speak freely - the action added events did nothing to harm Lewis' story.<br /><br />Initially I was upset at the changes that were made. Now, however, as I've had time to think about it, I can understand why *most* of the changes were made. Personally, I wouldn't have made certain changes - specifically, how Lucy and Edmund ended up in Narnia together. The change from the book to the screen didn't make much sense to me.<br /><br />All that aside, being a Narnia purist, I would love to see more movies, even if the derive a bit from Lewis' telling. This was terrific and magnificent.<br /><br />And Aslan - well, he needed to be perfect, and he was. Kudos to those who drew him. Utterly believable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>With the success of "Harry Potter" and "The Lord of the Rings," it was inevitable that another British fantasy classic would be shipped into theaters to ride the latest wave of interest in Anglo entertainment (or, perhaps, the latest invasion of Anglo entertainment, as the English seem to have a stranglehold on entertainment imported to the U.S.)  And like these other films, "The Chronicles of Narnia" scores high points in aesthetic achievement:  it's a generally beautiful film to look at and listen to.  Its actors are competent, if not nearly as appealing as those of, say, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks," "Dragonslayer," and other Disney fare plumbing the same basic material.  Where it suffers is in its uneven storyline, from characters that are sometimes annoying in their inconsistency (the "smart" older sister seems pretty dumb and rather annoying all around, for instance) to a Christian allegorical framework that includes - and I'm not kidding - Santa Claus handing out deadly weapons to children.  In fact, I thought it a little disturbing in these trying times of religious extremism to see a film that on one hand purports to have spiritual overtones while at the same time advancing the notion that only through all-out bloodletting can that spiritualism be preserved.  (I'm not sure westerners wouldn't be decrying this idea if the religion were a different one.)  In the end, though, "The Chronicles of Narnia" is good but not great entertainment.  The buildup to the climactic, technically well-conceived battle scene seems to take forever to reach, as the thinness of the plot - a group of displaced British children find a passageway to a secret frozen world through the back of a wardrobe - couldn't quite hold my attention.  Maybe I'm just overloaded on the Anglocentric stuff, or maybe I should read the book, as a friend tells me it's much better.  I'd give it three and half stars, though with Amazon's ranking system, I'll call it even at three.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>C.S. Lewis's "The Chronicles of Narnia" with its seven allegorical books is becoming the latest film franchise. This first movie based upon the second book in the series is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures like centaurs, satyrs, fauns, gryphons, dwarfs, a wicked albino witch, and four charming and innocent British school kids. The movie is entertaining, but it does not seem to resonate with any great significance or meaning despite Lewis's reputation as a Christian polemicist.<br />The four siblings who have been evacuated from the London blitz during War II are staying with a rich man in his country mansion. The youngest, a girl, travels to the snowy land of Narnia by entering a magic wardrobe. She meets a faun and the wicked witch. The most important creature in Narnia is Aslan, the lion.<br />The film is entertaining, well-cast and well-acted, has some great special effects as well as a few hokey ones, the voices of some famous stars, but there's no there there; it lacks the underpinning of a substantive reason for being.<br />William Mosely who plays the older brother is every teenage girl's heartthrob. It's a fun movie for kids as well as adults who'll get a kick out anthropomorphic animals and mythological creatures.

Readers who love good storytelling may be attracted to watch this version of C.S. Lewis' tale of four children who run inside a mysterious wardrobe into a land that remains winter all year round as a result of an evil spell left by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).  The children later become the savior and leaders to the living creatures of the land called Narnia.  The children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) help to restore this enchanting land to its natural splendor from the cold and evil land it has been left to be.<br /><br />The film may echo Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.  However, NARNIA has the Disney touch.  The special effects as shown with the animals and human-animal creatures is quite amazing to see: The beavers, Mr. Tumnus, the faun, (James McAvoy) is a delight, the fox (voice of Rupert Everett), and Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson).  Disney's production brings Lewis' fantasy tale alive with enchantment and heroism.  In addition, the cinematography and the soundtrack are quite dramatic through out the film, especially with aerial shots of the mountainous terrain, the particular lighting that provides a religious backdrop, and the concluding cliche battle scene.<br /><br />What is interesting about reading and watching the cartoon version of THE LION, WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE as a child, the religious and historical references did not occur to me.  I merely read the book for the simple pleasure and the fantasy.  After viewing the film, it follows the same premise as the book with the exception to additional scenes that were made specifically for the film.<br /><br />NARNIA contains historical and religious references.  The opening London bombing scene applies a historical backdrop to the film, and the period in which C.S. Lewis wrote the book.  The theme of good versus evil, and in this case, the German Nazis bombing Britain.  In terms of religion, Aslan represents the God-like creature of the film that Lewis had intended in the original text of his book.<br /><br />Overall, NARNIA is a film that the entire family will enjoy.  The film's PG rating shows minimal violence, but scenes with the pack of wolves may scare some audience members and the scene with Aslan on the stone table may be disturbing.  Otherwise, if you like to see a imagination in movies, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA is the fantasy film to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>This movie was not anywhere near as good as it could have been.<br /><br />There are so many problems with this movie.  The kids don't even act amazed when they enter Narnia.  They act like they see fauns and talking beavers every day.  The beavers look like giant rats.  You can easily tell what was CG and what was not.  I have no idea why they got Andrew Adamson to make this movie.  He made Shrek and Shrek 2.  Why not get a qualified director.  Narnia also seems to be an island where you can get everywhere in a day or two.  The kids go all over Narnia in a day or two.  And why does the professor look like the KFC guy?<br /><br />  There are some good things in this movie though.  Aslan looks great and Liam Neeson was the right voice.  Parts of the battle also looked good but, this was a failure.  This could have been great but it isn't.  What were they thinking?</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Well, it wasn't actually a rabbit hole, but a mysterious wardrobe in the upper reaches of an English country house owned by Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), to which the Pevensie children - Peter, Edmund, Lucy, and Susan (William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley, and Anna Popplewell) - are evacuated during the London Blitz.<br /><br />Out the back end of the wardrobe, the Pevensies find the land of Narnia, currently in the throes of a civil war between the forces of Evil, led by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), and those for Good, led by Aslan, a regal lion, who sounds suspiciously like Liam Neeson. The inhabitants of Narnia aren't normal humans, but talking animals - including wolves, beavers, horses, foxes - plus centaurs, gryphons, satyrs, fauns, dwarves, and malformed monsters too numerous to enumerate. In any case, local legend has it that the power of the White Witch will be broken with the arrival of two human boys and two human girls, so you know that our young adventurers are much in demand by both sides.<br /><br />Cinematically, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA seemed to me like an amalgam of THE LORD OF THE RING series and the HARRY POTTER series, with a bit of King Arthur, Alice in Wonderland, and the Waltons thrown in for good measure. (William Moseley reminded me of a younger John-Boy.) Unfortunately, none of the Good Guys - the Pevensies and Aslan - have as nearly an interesting or meaty a character as the White Witch, and Swinton's performance was, for me, the best and only reason to see the film at all. True, the cinematography and fantastic scenery, both real and computer-generated, are almost as good as those in the RINGS series, but, after sitting through those interminable productions, who needs more?<br /><br />THE CHRONICLES is a pre-adolescent fantasy that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to anyone unless he/she could answer "yes" to the question, "So, what, are you 12?" There's also a blatant parallel between Aslan's role and the death and resurrection of Jesus which is entirely unnecessary though, because I've never read the original stories by C.S. Lewis, perhaps I'm just flaunting my ignorance. Since there are seven titles in the Narnia collection, I assume there are more films to come. Oh, please not. The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy was enough.<br /><br />One particularly enchanting special effect was the manifestation of tree spirits in the mid-air aggregation of wind-blown leaves. And I have to admit that I especially liked the ending, not because it was the conclusion to a film which was causing me to fidget, but because it neatly tied up the Pevensies' years-long experience in Narnia to but a brief second of real-world time. That's the magic of childhood fantasies.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Narnia is a popular series written by C.S. Lewis. Lewis' books were my faves as a child and were packed with Christian symbolism. Aslan symbolized a Christ figure who was killed and then resurrected. Lucy's little healing potion would be the blood of christ, etc..<br /><br />Although I haven't read the books in 4 or 5 years, I remember really having enjoyed them. I can't say the same about the movie. While it does have some very good apspects, it mostly struggles and is in the end too Disney.<br /><br />Most of the people watching it are watching it for the entertainment and not to see how true it was to the books. Most people, such as little children, wouldn't have noticed the religious aspects or really have cared about them.<br /><br />So, all religious aspects aside, this movie isn't the most entertaining. It's in all fariness boring at times and has plenty of cheesy one liners.<br /><br />First off, the world of Narnia just isn't very well made. It wasn't like I would have expected and the path from the real world to there is lame. They just go in the closet, pass the coats and BOOM! they're in the world of Narnia. Then Lucy meets mister Tubmus and I couldn't help but see some bizarre aspects when seeing him. Just his facial expressions, the way he talks to Lucy, etc.. just makes him out as a "you know what". With all of that going on in the world now, I couldn't help but notice how bizarre his movements and actions were. All that aside, the child acting is fair at best. Lucy was good but I could have really seen Dakota Fanning in her role.<br /><br />The White Witch was well made and the acting there was nice. Aslan was the best part of the movie and was stunning (until you see King Kong.). Liam Neeson did a nice job as him also.<br /><br />Aslan was the best part of the movie by far. Then, the beavers and wolves talking were well made and funny and sarcastic at times. As for the rest, well, it was a long ride, very childish and the world of Narnia was just too peaceful for the White Witch and her army to live there.<br /><br />There is no humor despite Disney's harsh efforts at throwing in one liners. In the end, you'll be wanting more and it just wasn't a very good interpretation of the book. It made me feel that it was just too Disney.<br /><br />The PG rating hurts it too. The huge battle scene at the end can't reach its peak like say The Lord of the Rings due to the rating. PG-13 might have helped eliminate the cheesiness.<br /><br />And then when Aslan tells Peter to clean the blood off his sword, um, what blood?<br /><br />Narnia was a fair movie but not at all as good as it said to be. Sure the kids will like it but honestly, I was very dissapointed.<br /><br />And, I just didn't feel that it brought C.S. Lewis' world to life, which is a shame. It's definitely not worth an evening admission, maybe worth a matinee but I'd just wait to see it on DVD. But, for those of you that haven't read the books, it will defintely be a better movie because you won't know how average it is compared to the book.<br /><br />It will leave you dissapointed and the special effects won't blow you away.

The thirty-million dollar budgeted The Passion of the Christ, which then went on to gross more then three-hundred and seventy-million dollars in North America alone by the end of its run in theatres, played brilliantly off of Michael Moore's seething anti-Bush propagandist piece Fahrenheit 9/11 and by November of that year proved to be momentous in the president's reelection victory, although it was far from the true issue which garnered him the majority of the people's vote (that being his stance toward the war against terrorism). The release of the second of six books in the Chronicles of Narnia series comes at a time when American Christians, many of whom side with in some shape or another with the Republican Party, find themselves in pitched battle against the intimations of political correctness and multiculturalism in their retention of the significance and sanctity of Christmas itself. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe will likely play a less indicative role then The Passion of the Christ did toward the political environment of the country last year and yet its direct allusions to Christ and his message will almost certainly be a factor in the way Christians are motivated maintain their traditions and be less reluctant to give them up for anyone.<br /><br />The story for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe remains true to both C.S. Lewis's epic vision of the whimsical world of Narnia and all those who inhabit it and the Christian undertones which encompass the plot and character developments of the entire book series. This said however, the feature film adaptation of the classic children's novel does take its fair share of creative liberties in regards to specific plot elements which, for lack of a better word, fail to translate as effectively onto the screen as Lewis may have hoped they would. Rather then tarnishing C.S. Lewis's epic, they instead enhance the emotional intensity of the plot. For example, there is a scene not presented in the book in which the White Witch's secret police (wolves) are in hot pursuit of Peter, Susan, and Lucy as they cross the thawing river. This accentuates the potency of the situation and makes for a far more engaging experience then any minimal description penned in the novel could have. Furthermore, scenes like the opening sequence of the film in which German (Nazi) planes are seen bombing the city of London, an event now referred to as The Battle of Britain, fills in the gaps of background information left absent by Lewis. And while Adamson falls short of addressing the specifics of either the Nazis who bombed Britain or the Second World War in general, he leaves just enough room to allow parents at their own discretion to discuss these events in more detail with their own children as they see fit.<br /><br />All four child actors in the roles of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie do a splendid job in their respected roles. There are however some issues with their characters. Peter's transformation from a gangling British preteen into a cunning and formidable warrior and inspirational leader of Aslan's army is one point of contention. It comes off as a bit miraculous, if not a bit implausible, and may be difficult for some people to swallow. Nevertheless, this is a fantasy film after all and it can just as easily be contributed to magic.<br /><br />James McAvoy is positively magnificent in the role of Mr. Tumnus, the faun, or half-man/half-goat, who is the first creature in the world of Narnia to befriend the young Lucy when she initially enters the magical wardrobe. His interaction with Lucy, played adorably by newcomer Georgie Henley, is emotionally priceless and works every bit as well as one might have imagined reading the children's novel. The character himself is representative of two crucial concepts author C.S. Lewis introduces in the novel. While the faun is a creature often associated with Greek/Roman paganism, he is not necessarily an evil character. Although he does stray from the righteous path in the beginning, he quickly comes to see the error of his ways and repents. Lewis' point here is that while Christianity is preferred above all other religions, every religion strives toward the virtues of charity and compassion. So when you boil down to the basics of religion, there is a common element that every one of us can relate to. The second point Lewis makes with the introduction of Mr. Tumnus is that while Christians are susceptible to sin and may initially fall prey to it, whether it be out of fear or necessity, we still have the choice to realize we are in the wrong and make up for our mistakes as Mr. Tumnus does.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is emphatically conniving as the white witch Jadis, an evil enchantress who rules the realm of Narnia with a cold iron fist, turning anyone who crosses her path into stone and stowing away the hope of all its inhabitants with continuous winter without Christmas. Jadis signifies the figurative temptation of sin and evil in the world. While on the outside she may emit a certain ambiance about her that makes her attractive and desirable, once Edward gives in to the white witch's desire to capture Peter, Susan, and Lucy, he comes to grips with her true nature which is malevolent to the core. And while some readers are quick to associate Jadis with Satan, supreme rule of Hell, most literary scholars agree that she may very well be a servant of Lucifer but not the actual Prince of Darkness himself since there is no direct correlation between her actions and those of Satan as opposed to the equivalence between Aslan and Jesus Christ. Her demise, however, is not as dramatic as it should have been and feels a bit rushed as soon as the resurrected Aslan arrives on the battle scene.<br /><br />Overall, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is every bit as magnificent as readers dreamed it would be and exceeds nearly every expectation, though certainly far from all of them, writer C.S. Lewis may have set down for its adaptation in the last fifty years since audiences first discovered the world of Narnia. Parents however should seek to take certain precautions with their younger children as there particular scenes in the film, specifically the sacrifice of Aslan on the Stone Table, which are emotionally profound and may be too stimulating for smaller audiences. Nevertheless, if children of a specific age demographic are able to sit through the latest Harry Potter picture with little if any difficulties at all then they should be fine toward this film. The musical score, conducted by Academy Award-winning composer Harry Gregson-Williams, famous for compositions for Shrek and Team America: World Police, is not nearly as memorable as those for The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter franchises, lacking anything related to a reoccurring musical theme, but at the same time it reaches the right emotional depth, particularly in the Battle for Narnia, while not overshadowing the actions or dialogue onscreen. Director Andrew Adamson and, more importantly, the new leadership of the Walt Disney Corporation who have in the past been far from what one would consider a close friend to the Christian community should be commended for not downplaying the allusions to Christian theology, particularly Aslan as a mirror-image of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, in an age where political correctness has dominated modern society. There is still much debate amongst the literary community as to whether the Christian allegories in The Chronicles of Narnia series were intentional or not on the part of adult Christian convert C.S. Lewis. Regardless of the true answer, if one does indeed exist, anyone unfamiliar with the suggested theological prospects of the story will hardly notice and their perception of the film so go unchanged. Though comparisons are likely to made to The Lord of the Rings series or even the Harry Potter franchise, nonetheless the special effects of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe hold their own as dazzling and the physical environment which encompasses the characters of the film, all shot on the island of New Zealand where Peter Jackson's King Kong and the three Lord of the Rings films were also filmed, is nothing short of breathtaking. Notwithstanding allegations from the ACLU quick to label The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a piece of unmitigated brainwashing propaganda from the religious right who seek to convert the `pagans' to Christianity, the film remains a timeless fantasy classic and an emotionally grappling motion picture event, theological allusions or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>(Caveat - none of the contributors to The Rotten Review have actually read any of the original books, so if you're looking for a review that says that Lewis's vision has either been realized or unspeakably violated, look elsewhere.)<br /><br />This first entry of "Narnia" thrusts the Pevensie children into the mystical land where time flows of its own accord, and everybody has something to say regardless of their species.  Dominated by the coldly secular...er...evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton, from "The Deep End"), Narnia is an ice-encrusted realm.  All who yearn for freedom wait for word of Aslan, the Lion-savior of Narnia, and for the prophecy of salvation.  Meanwhile, back in a darker land - called Earth - the Pevensie children have been exiled from their home to escape the "Blitz".  It's 1940, and London is undergoing an epic battle of its own, with nightly raids by German bombers.  Finding a boring refuge in the country home of Professor Kirke, it's only a matter of time before Lucy Pevensie (the youngest and most precocious of the Pevensie kids) finds the old wardrobe that leads to Narnia, and adventure.<br /><br />This was a good, maybe very good movie.  It's not quite great though - the plot twists of CS Lewis have been done-to-death by imitators and little here explores what made them so fresh to begin with.  The Pevensie children are immediately accepted as the "Sons of Adam" and "Daughters of Eve" who will save Narnia with Aslan, luckily with a prophecy, a magic sword, bow & arrow and other mystical forms of moral support.  Clues and other kinds of assistance fall into their lap without the script having to put them through any tests of endurance or pain that might tax them (or shock the flick's target audience).  The movie's emotional climax - the sacrifice of Aslan - comes and goes faster than one of the movie's fleet-footed wolves.  With the possible exception of Lucy, none of the Pevensie's mature into full-blown characters, and too much of the movie is given over to CGI creatures and similar effects.  For kids who feel they missed out not getting into "Lord of the Rings", "Narnia" should be sufficient substitute.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>During World War II, the Pevensie children - Peter (Moseley), Susan (Popplewell), Edmund (Keynes), and Lucy (Henley) - are sent from London to stay with Professor Kirke (Broadbent).  One day, while playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a wardrobe.  She soon finds it is no ordinary wardrobe as it transports her to Narnia, a magical wintery world.  She meets Mr. Rumnus (McAvoy), and finds out that it has been winter there for 100 years because of the rule of the Wite Witch (Swinton).<br /><br />After returning to her world, she brings her siblings back with her.  Edmund disappears, having been tricked by the White Witch, and the rest must rescue him and save Narnia in the process.<br /><br />On the heels of "The Lord of the Rings", it is no surprise that this movie has been made.  There has been a surge in the popularity of fantasy epics as of late, and "Narnia" is a logical coice for the film treatment.  The results are about the same as the "Rings" trilogy.  The acting is solid all around.  This is impressive since the film is carried by four kids with minimal acting experience.  Swinton is menacing as the evil White Witch, and probably the standout performance of the movie.  The special effects are good overall.  Aslan the lion is impressive, and looks completely real.  Some of the scenes look like they were definately filmed in front of a green screen though, and that is distracting.  The story is given a good treatment by "Shrek" director Andrew Adamson, but I was not blown away like I hoped to be.  The result is an entertaining and good film that falls short of greatness.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>The movie is magic.  The most magical moment for me was the entire scene starting when Lucy steps back into the snow and discovers Narnia to when she awakens and the fawn helps her return to the lamp post.<br /><br />About the only thing that I didn't like was Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan.  It was too recognizable.  Everytime Aslan would talk, it would jolt me right out of the movie to visions of Liam Neeson.  He's a great actor, and I've enjoyed his films, but for me his voice didn't work for Aslan.<br /><br />Edmond is truly easy to hate.  They never redeem him fully.  The battle scene was oddly disjointed from the rest of the story.  Like it didn't fit, or was too Return-of-the-King-ish.  The movie really could have stood on its own with the magic and adventure, it didn't need a battle scene.  What were they trying to make it?  Like Bedknobs & Broomsticks?  Disney, &lt;sigh>.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I finally managed to go out and see this magnificent work of art.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Narnia world since I was a little kid growing up in Poland. I remember reading the books and watching any TV movies made about this magical world.<br /><br />Seeing this on the big screen in the dark theater was so powerful, so loud, alive and colorful that I almost forgot I was watching a movie, I felt like I was there in person.<br /><br />The four kids, Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie were totally new faces to me but I trusted them to tell the story well and they sure did. I found little Lucy to be the most adorable little girl ever, she was delightful and heartwarming and a real pleasure to watch.<br /><br />I loved the scenery, from the land to never ending winter to the thawing spring breaking through, to the evil and cold witch, who appeared somewhat nice only to be rigid and heartless, to the animals, the fawns, centaurs, wolves, cheetahs, rhinos, flying gryphon's, beavers, polar bears, buffalos and ghouls and goblins down to the magnificent Aslan.<br /><br />I was a wimp, I shed a few tears along with few other people in the audience at the tender and sad scenes, but overall I felt like I've spent 2 magical hours of land of sorcery and shining armor.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie, and not to be missed whether you read the books or not, do yourself a favor and enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>The star of this parable about good winning out over evil was William Moseley who played Peter (he must have been cast because of his resemblance to Prince William).  Edmund had a starring role as the betrayer of his siblings to the non-human witch, thinking he would get some affection.  The movie itself, based on the Narnia book by C. S. Lewis, was supposedly about four English children who were sent to Coombe Halt from wartime London to a place of safety with an elusive professor and his stern housekeeper who enforces house rules.  However, she was a pussycat compared with the mean witch they have to fight for their lives in the "magic kingdom" of Nardia.<br /><br />Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edmund descend on a scholarly environment (Lewis' actual high-church Anglican school as an Oxford don), which they found boring and restrictive.  To pass the time, instead of reading, they play 'hide and seek,' managing to disturb the professor who told them to act like a family.  Children from selected schools here who finished reading this first volume and wrote about their impressions as an assignment were rewarded with a special screening of the movie.  They attended Regal theaters the day before the public was able to see it.  I'd been planning for it several months but got to the Carmike-owned theater too late for the first showing as it was "sold out."  It was reported that these "low readers" now want to read the other six books about Narnia, based on Christian tenets but are full of demons from hell and a pagan ritual of sacrifice.<br /><br />It looked like a Winter Wonderland as they tramped in the snow in the place Lucy discovered after she "hid" in a wardrobe full of coats.  She formed a lasting attachment to Thomas, the faun.  Edmund had visions of grandeur.  When the ice melted, we saw strange creatures at the fair with green, green grass and beautiful mountains.  Peter rode the mythical unicorn as he led the war against the witch.  It was a fierce battle of medieval warfare with a firebird.  The winged creatures with huge rocks saved the day.  The cast was full of talking beasts and magical creatures signifying Christian symbolism.<br /><br />The chief of police was a wolf, but got outfoxed by a red fox and a couple of talking beavers.  I didn't care much for the witch played by Tilda Swinton; the dresses wore her instead of vice versa.  She told Edmund about the prophecy which had to be stopped from coming true.  She looked like an English Gweneth Paltrow in her overlarge garments.  A defeated woman never gives up -- she fights to the end.<br /><br />After they are crowned by King Alslam (who was dead but arose from the dead), Lucy the Valiant (crowned by Thomas), Edmund the Just, Susie the Gentle, and King Peter the Magnificient rode through some beautiful woods on horseback and find their way back through the closet.  Though they were adults before leaving Narnia, they return still children.  There are two new  biographies about the author, THE NARNIAN, by Alan Jacobs and JACK'S LIFE by Doug Gresham who was a producer of this movie.  His mother Joy married Jack Lewis in later life.  It was reported in 'Time' magazine that 95 million of these books have been sold since Lewis' death in 1963.<br /><br />It was not an enjoyable movie, but it was somewhat different from others of its genre.  It was a little overdone with the war violence and hype of half-human creatures from the underworld to show the theological issues of Lewis' day; his fantasy series for children were the bestsellers then and again today, thanks to this production.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>Am I the only one that thinks this looks like straight to DVD Disney fluff!! It is for sure a children's movie.. nothing here for adults I just came to find out! The effects are under cooked.. this includes the unfinished looking make-up, set decor, CGI, ect.. oh and dont forget the bad green screen. Just not impressed what so ever! So to end this right now I say.. if you have preschoolers to entertain.. go for it but, they will proberly get bored. So who is this movie made for?</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We saw this last night in a crowded theater and I was fairly underwhelmed, but maybe if I hadn't read the book I would like it more?<br /><br />Perhaps an extended version would have played better, because the nagging feeling never left me that something was missing.  I could have used some more establishing scenes that showed the Pevensie children having some camaraderie with the creatures of Aslan's army, in the days before the big battle.  As it is, they just sort of swan in and everyone bows--why?  Just because they're human?  Why would all these beasts and centaurs and fauns etc fight for four little humans to conquer them all?  In the book it was sort of explained, and part of that was a certain amount of interchange among all the species, not just the girls playing and the boys riding talking horses.<br /><br />Compare that to the slow-paced, but ultimately worth it bonding scenes in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and you have an idea of what the emotional payoff might have been for NARNIA.<br /><br />However that said it was a spectacular film with some great action sequences, especially trying to cross the river before it melted, a scene which brought back ancestral memories from the very first days of cinema, when Lillian Gish floated on the ice in D W Griffith's WAY DOWN EAST, which this film seemed to be quoting.<br /><br />I didn't like any of the children very much.  Can't wait till that little girl grows up and the gap shrinks between her three front teeth.  I couldn't bear to look at her except when she was crying and that made me feel like a perv.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton put a lot into the part!  Probably more than was in the script.  When she made her triumphant speech on the stone table about the return of "deep magic," she might have been louder, like take some voice lessons or something, she just didn't have the vocal power to shriek it out at the end; but in every other scene she excelled my highest expectations.  At the end of the movie we voted to award her the Oscar for best actress and to give a special award to the NUT who designed her winter and summer wardrobes.  They were eye popping, Leigh Bowery would have been proud.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I went to this movie expecting to be bored by talking animals and child stuff and was surprised by the quality of this well made film that grabs you from the start.  Four children living in WW II London are sent to live in the countryside by their mother to protect them from the frequent air raids.  They end up in a mansion on a huge estate.  The mansion has one room with nothing in it but an armoir.  The children use it to hide and are accidently transported to a fantasy world with talking animals and a witch that wants them dead.  They are forced to grow up fast if they hope to survive.<br /><br />The special effects are great and the witch is the most memorable since Margaret Hamiliton's Wicked Witch of the West!  The big battle scene rates up with the fights in the Lord of the Rings movies.  This is the best movie I have seen in 2005!</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I don't know what all the hype is about.  I watched the first 48 minutes<br /><br />of this movie.  It's slow, predictable, poorly written, with inauthentic characters.  The children interact like robots and transmit no real excitement, curiousity, or surprise.  The story about the lost king and evil snow queen seems terribly simplistic and well-trodden.  This screenplay has to be a disservice to Lewis' work.  Stone cold dull.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the Narnia books or cartoons, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of Narnia prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia, brings to the screen the story of four siblings, two boys and two girls, who get sent off to the countryside in an effort to get away from the war that is raging in the major cities. There they discover a secret portal in the form of a wardrobe that grants them entry into the magical kingdom of Narnia.  What they find on the other side is yet another war, only this one involves creatures found in myth...<br /><br />The acting is about average with the exception of Tilda Swinton, who just like in the movie Constantine (starring Keanu Reeves), carries out her performance very well.<br /><br />In addition, Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan was a great addition and was rather soothing.  The special effects were also very good.<br /><br />The movie definitely focuses on a much younger crowd than the Lord of the Rings, and let's be serious here, there is no comparison; LOR is a masterpiece!  This is not.<br /><br />As for the Adam and Eve part... No comment.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>My daughter and I went to Narnia (cinematically speaking) at the theatre. Not having been a youthful (or otherwise) reader of the books, I can't judge the film from that perspective, but I agree that Lucy was perfect--what a wonderful young actress.<br /><br />With all the discussion about the story being a Christian fable, it was pretty easy to predict the plot. The many reminders I saw from other movies and stories made me sense how interwoven the world of children's stories is--C.S. Lewis doesn't owe anything to the Lion King, but Disney owed a lot of Mustafa to Lewis and Aslan. I half expected Aslan to explain the Circle of Life to the children. The beginning reminded me a lot of Lemony Snicket.<br /><br />I spotted one glitch regarding Father Christmas, or whoever the gift-bearing gentleman was. Later in the movie one of the children refers to the "man in the red suit"--as we remembered the scene, the man was dressed in brown, not red.<br /><br />Overall, Narnia was a two-star movie for me--too dominated by computer-generated special effects, and too heavy-handed in the triumph-of-good-over-evil story. My daughter, also not a student of the book, liked it better and said she might try to read the book.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>I guess good looking Britain's don't become actors.

Isn't she the same ugly wench that played the angel in "Constantine?"  If they have gotten Elizabeth Hurley to play the role, that might have enhanced the appeal of this movie a tad.<br /><br />Disney seems to like to get British children for their films.  It's really beginning to get old.  Or maybe I'm just getting too old, and I'm just getting tired of the same old predictable casting happenstance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>I sat down to watch this with my young son.

I could tell something was not right in the scene in which we saw him from behind, but I was hoping my son wouldn't notice.<br /><br />But at exactly 1:29:01 (at least by my DVD player), that's when he made me pause it.  "Dad," he queried, "did someone take Aslan to the vet?"<br /><br />Sure enough, the lion savior of Narnia seemed to be missing a pair.  You can see this quite clearly if you pause the movie at certain points.  Sure, you tell yourself that they're out of view behind his prodigious tail, but you know you're just kidding yourself.<br /><br />No, there's no way around it:  everyone's favorite lion was somehow gelded -- possibly in a previous battle with the White Witch.<br /><br />Anyhow.

They are basically the same movie, lost souls searching for themselves and a better world.  The only difference is Wizard Of Oz is a timeless magical tale and there are flying monkies instead of Narnia's talking wolves.  Narnia lumbers along with computer generated talking animals that look fake beyond belief.  They talk like psycho adults bumbling around like fools on a mission.  I'm sure it's great for children, this really is a children's film in the end.  The enchantment is missing from this film.  instead we get harsh winter scenes and a nasty war towards the end.  I never finished the rest of the film, it had me dozing off so I shut it down before the war, I assume.  If you want to see good fantasy films I would recommend The Wizard Of Oz, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy or even The Others.  Narnia just didn't hit me over the head.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>The only reason I watched it is because my sons, especially my youngest, loved the book when he was a teenager.

The good folks run around as half human and half horses; a young guy (Mr. Thomas) in his early twenties runs around topless as he is half human and the other lower part of his body is half animal (horse or whatever), and he's one of the good guys luring young Lucy -- a 7-year old or so -- into his home to offer her tea and then drug her to admit to her that against his will he must kidnap her ... C'mon.<br /><br />Then there are creatures and violence just like in the Lord of the Rings and young children should not watch this film as it should be better rated PG-13. By the way, my 12-year old son liked the movie ... not that he was extremely excited about it, but it was okay.<br /><br />Yes it's the fight between good and evil, and at its time when the story was first published some 50+ years ago, after the second world war it may have been something interesting for people to read because of the then lack of stories available and as it was the dawn of fantasy novels and so forth, but today? If you're a Christian don't think that you will watch any sort of Christian theme or story here other than that C.S. Lewis was a respected Christian and theologian, but you won't find much of it in this flick.

Especially the youngest girl truly got on my nerves! This is probably the clearest resemblence with Lord of the Rings as Frodo and Sam had lots of these tear jerking lines as well.

Lewis was the third children's series which I've read and thoroughly enjoyed as a child (the first being L. Frank Baum's Oz books, the second Lloyd Alexander's five novels of Prydain). I'm in my 30s so it's a bit hard to hearken back to that sense of wonder and delight elicited by Mr. Lewis and his creation. What remains is a whiff of nostalgia and a certain recognition that yes, once upon a time, Narnia was a huge, essential piece of my formative childhood.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent film adaptation of the novel and nicely sets up the series. This opener tells the tale of the four Pevensie children - Peter, the oldest of the quartet; Susan, the maternal, practical older sister; the stubborn, angry Edmund; and the youngest, Lucy. To escape the bombings of WW2 London, the children are sent by their mother to the safety of a professor's rural household. There, involved in a hide & seek game, they go thru a wardrobe and happen upon Narnia, a magical land cursed with a Hundred-Year Winter and inhabited by fauns, centaurs, talking beasts and the seemingly immortal evil White Witch. And inhabited also by Aslan, the wonderful lion and deux-ex-machina of the series. So there -  the stage is set, the personalities introduced, the conflict layed out, and any more details would just be giving the story away.<br /><br />The kid actors are obviously instrumental to the success of the film. William Mosely as Peter and Anna Popplewell as Susan are serviceable. Peter is bland and at times looks awkward as the older Son of Adam; Susan just doesn't have enough to do here, but even in the book, her character is the least filled out. It is the two younger siblings, Lucy and Edmund, as portrayed by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes, who shine in the spotlight. Children in the viewing audience will doubtless be seeing the film thru Lucy's eyes, more so than thru any of the other characters' herein. Georgie as Lucy carries that burden exceedingly well, emoting with a natural skill more suited for older thespians. She has several scenes with Aslan that were key to the forwarding of the movie, as well as the lending of empathy towards Aslan, and she convincingly pulls them off.  Skalar is an even more mature actor and provides the early conflict in the movie and does it with such ease, I found myself disliking him from the get-go. The grown-ups do a credible job, especially James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus and Jim Broadbent as the benevolent professor. Tilda Swinton could've been more demonstrative in her role as the Witch but her under-the-top acting - her intense stillness, if you will - is explained in great detail in the extra features (the kids' commentary, to be exact).<br /><br />The special effects are very good, which is to be expected, given our current technological state. Aslan, the beavers, and the rest of the talking beasts and fairy tale creatures are realized convincingly. The big battle at the finale is a tad reminiscent of the battles in the Lord of the Rings in terms of the combatants involved, but *shrug* given the make-up of these fantastical movies, what else can you expect but to see orcs, giants and sundry magical uglies? The fight scenes are nothing exceptional, but do remember that these are mostly kids in lead roles and they remain somewhat realistic in their military prowess (I did cringe when Peter cheesily pointed his sword at the Witch, when she entered Aslan's camp and demanded Edmund be given to her). There is a fair amount of violence here: swordplays, arrows hitting their mark, the Witch callously turning Narnians to stone and a grim scene with Aslan on the stone table, being brutalized by the Witch's minions and then, finally, by the Witch herself. All acts aren't overly gory (this film is rated PG) and are depicted with the targeted children in mind and they also happen to be necessary to be true to the books, especially the last scene mentioned.<br /><br />There's been incessant talk (to ad nauseam, I feel) of Lewis's insertions of religious overtones in the film (Aslan, whose father is the Emperor Over the Sea, is obviously meant to be Narnia's version of Jesus; in A Magician's Nephew, a later Narnia installment, there is even a blatant scene involving a forbidden apple). Here's my take:  reading the Narnia Chronicles as a kid, I was quite oblivious to all the religious connotations, references to sons of Adam and daughters of Eve notwithstanding; but I don't for one second believe missing out on the Christian themes herein harmed or benefited me in any way.  Listen,  I endorse everyone's personal right to believe in and follow his/her own God. If parents wish to point out these theological aspects to their kids, that is, of course, totally within their purview.  Lewis's religious references do provide gentle guides to the ways of Christianity. However,  I feel that this offering by C.S. Lewis shouldn't be used as a polarizing tool for Christians and non-Christians and should above all be enjoyed as an excellent adventure book/film for children and adults alike.<br /><br />So, overall, four stars for this dvd. There is an abundance of extra features, which are informative and entertaining. There are so-so outtakes; one filmmaker/adult commentary, another commentary by the kids and director Andrew Adamson; an in-depth "making of" documentary, various diaries...all in all, they validate the price of this 2-disc dvd. Why not give it five stars, you ask? Because, in direct comparison with the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, this film falls a slight notch below. But, having said that, I still cannot wait for the sequel and subsequent films. Go Lucy and Aslan!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>This movie has the most outstanding visual effects. The animals look real. You will really think you're seeing a talking lion, talking beavers, centaurs, and dozens of other magical creatures. I read the books when I was really young; I can't say I remember them, but it was nice going into the film without any preconceived notions about what it SHOULD be, when what this movie IS is just a wonderful movie.<br /><br />The movie is about four children, all who are displaced from WWII, made to live with a professor in his giant house. They can't touch anything, run, shout, or disturb the professor. Lucy, the youngest child, says that hide-and-seek is a fairly quiet game, so all the kids proceed to play, with little Lucy running for cover when she finds a beautifully carved wardrobe. It's the only object in the entire room. She opens the door and hides within a bundle of coats. As she scoots back to hide herself a little more, she suddenly realizes: she's not in the wardrobe any more. She's in Narnia, where she meets a goofy half-man, half-goat creature. Of course, her siblings refuse to believe her, until all of them end up in Narnia as well.<br /><br />The plot is really intricate, that I don't want to go into it all. The point is that this is a really fantastic movie. That's all anyone ever really needs to know. It might be a little scary for small children, but any kid who can watch the Harry Potter flicks without flinching should be just find with this movie. You'll love the stunning the visuals and this simply magical story. So much more goes on this movie that I can't even seem to put into words. Yes, it's that good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br></body></html>

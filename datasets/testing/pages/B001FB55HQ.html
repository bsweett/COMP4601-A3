(Doesn't everyone do that?)<br /><br />It picks up long after the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines where we see John Connor (Christian Bale) as a soldier in the human resistance against the Skynet.<br /><br />Before the first battle scene, we're privy to Sam Worthington's character, Marcus - in prison, offer his body for a "good cause".<br /><br />Marcus wakes up amid the battles and finds a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). Together, they make their way towards Skynet and bump into Connor. Reese is captured by the terminators. Marcus infiltrates the machine compound and Connor invades to destroy them once and for all.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation is a nice addition to the franchise. It gives you a look at some of the things hinted at in the earlier films. It also touts some of the fiercest explosions I have seen in movies.<br /><br />However it lacks humanity. Which is pretty much the basis of the film. You don't connect with any of the characters and you really don't care who lives and who dies. Obviously you know Connor and Reese will survive this first film (of which the director would like to make 3). But you don't mind watching the other survivors bite it because you really don't care about them.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Buy or rent? Buy or rent? What to do...what to do? Well, here's a word of advice: If you're like me and you want to see the Director's Cut (the R version) versus the Theatrical PG-13 version, buy this. Because I first rented it from Netflix, but Netflix is sending out a Blu Ray version that's PG-13. I found this especially odd because I can't find a Blu Ray version for sale that's PG-13. So how and why is it that Netflix's Blu Ray version of Terminator Salvation is PG-13?<br /><br />Am I sure? Yes, I'm sure. There is no mention of Director's Cut on the Netflix sleeve or the disc itself. The disc did indeed say Blu Ray. And right before the movie starts it says rated PG-13 by the MPAA. But the solid evidence came from watching the Netflix version and finding that there was none of the Director's Cut extra's so perfectly outlined in Senor Zoidbergo's lead customer review on the Amazon front page for this product.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.<br /><br />And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale; Worthington's performance in Salvation may even get me to get out to the theater to see Avatar and next year's remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKO7">Clash of the Titans</a>. Gotta give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn (the guy who played Reese in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9RB9Y">Terminator</a>.<br /><br />But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2:</a> delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.<br /><br />Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental, but if you rent it at least be sure that you're getting the Director's Cut. One way to be sure that you get the Director's Cut is to add this now to your Amazon cart. Buy or rent? Buy or rent? What to do...what to do?</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Lots of action and thrills here, if not enough decent acting. But that's hardly the point of this franchise, and on that level T4 delivers. The script is ok, and the basic concept is a good one. If all you want is some high-tech whiz-bangery, this should do it.<br /><br />Disconcertingly, at various moments in the film it's not easy to know if Christian Bale is man or machine; his somewhat wooden style is almost uber-ironic here. But McG continues to deliver the goods, visually, though this one feels somehow hollow, despite excellent effects. T4, while better than T3, never approaches T2. But then again, James Cameron has rather more of a sense of humor than McG.<br /><br />Worth watching after you've seen T2 three or four times, perhaps.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie.  I've seen all the Terminator movies, I don't listen to critic's, I never have. I like what I like.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>The film Terminator Salvation, has some good points to it, and some bad points, as well. Plenty of action, good visual effects, we see more about the machines, John Connor's character, as an adult is more developed. Now, for some of the bad points, it's still the same Terminator story, being retold again, compared to the first two films, which were, fresh and original, when they came out. The other characters' in the film weren't so interesting, except, maybe, Marcus. The story isn't resolved by the end of the film, either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>Sometimes, you wonder when it's time to stop, and let a franchise die.  Or at the least, make sure the story is coherent and fits in well with what's come before.  But most importantly, try to give the story weight.  If we don't care about what's going on, pretty much nothing is going to save the film, and that's the problem with Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />Taking place in 2018, the film follows the famed John Connor and newcomer Marcus Wright, as both men fight for their lives in the post-judgment day world.  Killer machines roam the skies and the ground.  While the resistance has found a possible way to shut down the machines for good, the fate of mankind hangs in the balance, as the legendary Kyle Reese, John's father, has been found.  The problem is, the machines are after him.  With both John and Skynet after Kyle, both sides must fight for the fate of the future.<br /><br />When I first saw the movie in theaters, I left feeling that the film was, at best, an average action adventure movie.  After seeing it again on DVD, time has not been kind to "Salvation", as the story feels very disjointed and choppy, as if the film was hacked to pieces and then edited back together.  It feels like entire segments of the film are missing, and the second half of the film moves too quickly for us to get emotionally interested.  By the time the end credits rolled around, I just didn't care.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the story, or even the action.<br /><br />This is probably Terminator Salvation's biggest problem...for all the action sequences, for all the nods to the previous films, the story is the weakest yet in the series.  While the idea of saving Kyle Reese to ensure the events of the future/past happen sounds like a great idea, having the film jump back and forth between Marcus and John makes it feel disjointed.  We don't get time to understand the characters in any meaningful way, besides the most basic of reasons.  John wants to save Kyle.  Marcus wants to find out who he is.  Barnes wants to avenge his brother's offscreen death.  Kyle wants to stay alive.  As a result, we have a cast of essentially one dimensional characters that pale in comparison to the cast of the previous three films.  Some, like Star, are completely unnecessary and could have been cut from the script.<br /><br />Say what you will about Terminator 3 (I personally really enjoyed it), but it had a focused plot that added to the franchise's mythology with the revelation that Judgment day was just postponed, not stopped.  The film had weight to it, making us wonder if the heroes were going to stop Judgement Day once again.  Here, everything is back to the status quo at the end.  There are no long term changes or consequences of the ongoing story.  There's just no emotional weight to what's going on, and coupled with the disjointed pacing and thin characters, the film feels utterly flat.  Considering how all the previous stories have at least contributed much to the ongoing story, "Salvation"'s story is a disappointment.<br /><br />With the poor story and characters, we're left with the action sequences, and regrettably, they don't fare much better.  We have the standard chase scenes with cars, assaults on Skynet bases, and fights with killer robots, but most feel like your standard issue summer action scenes.  The nighttime escape scene in the forest, for example, is utterly flat, save for the sequence in the river.  Then there's the giant transformer like robot at the gas station...I thought it was goofy in the theater, and it's only worse in a second viewing.  Why not replace it with a giant Skynet tank instead?  Why not a whole group of T-600's out to capture human prisoners?  This giant just feels out of place here.<br /><br />Yet, despite it's stumbling, "Salvation" does get a few things right.  The overall mood and art design of the film, with it's shades of greys, blacks, and blues, does an excellent job creating a post apocalyptic world, and I did like the idea of showing us what the war between man and machine looked like before the technology of lasers and time travel is created.  Sam Worthington does a good job of conveying the tough, yet confused Marcus, and Anton Yelchin is outstanding as a young Kyle Reese, and is easily the best actor of the film, making you believe that he really is a young version of Michael Biehn.  It's also a nice treat that Linda Hamilton returned to do voice overs for John's famous audio tapes.  The opening action sequence, an assault on a Skynet Base set amongst dozens of giant satellite dishes, is quite exciting.  But the best part of the film easily comes in the third act, with a cameo appearance by a well known character from the previous films...it's only after this character appears that the film finally becomes really interesting.<br /><br />But in the end, "Salvation" is a disappointing entry into the Terminator franchise.  With it's weak story, weak characters, choppy pacing, and below average to average action sequences, there's really not much to recommend it here.  There are a few good action sequences, and a few good performances by the actors, but that's really it.  Terminator fans will probably get the most out of it, but everyone else should stick to the first three films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>As a fan of the entire Terminator movie series, you would be forgiven for assuming that I would hate this movie. The truth is that I didn't watch this movie hoping it would match the brilliance of the original movies as I knew that simply wasn't going to happen. What we got was not a film that captured the terrifying doomsday essence of what made Cameron's two Terminator films so brilliant. We also didn't even get the cool and slick looking destruction heavy style of the third Terminator film. What we got instead was, what I felt, to be a perfectly captured post-apocalyptic world which contains a marvellous depiction of the human race when faced with what seems as the impossible fight for survival. Director McG has received a lot of doubt about his ability move the Terminator saga into the post-apocalyptic world which we first gained a glimpse of in the first Terminator movie. That doubt had no foundation and what McG presented in the finished piece, although the plot could do with some polishing, was a fantastically frightening environment with some cool effects and worthy acting throughout.<br /><br />The plot sets John Connor in the year 2018. The machine uprising has begun and only small pockets of human resistance movements exist with the soul purposes of surviving and destroying the machine threat. John Connor has finally entered the position he was fated to enter since before he was born and is now the leader of the human resistance. He has encountered the machines before which gives him and his teams the advantage when knowing what they will be put up against as the human/machine war continues. As the resistance fight continues Connors father, Kyle Reese encounters Marcus Wright who we see at the start of the movie receiving lethal injections on death row just before the war begins. Marcus doesn't know what's happened as he woke up in the post-apocalyptic world with no memory of the machine initial attempt at destroying the human race. Marcus quickly partners up with Kyle Reese and a child we know as Star who are also on a mission to find the resistance leader and join the fight. The mystery eventually unfolds and we find out whether Marcus was sent from the future or is merely a survivor of the past and he becomes pivotal in the fight against the machine threat.<br /><br />The film itself was very touch and go throughout. Some parts worked where others didn't but the entire piece presented an enjoyable action movie that doesn't go too much into the fight for survival on the psychological end of things but does retain the aura of desperation that the humans feel in their fight. Christian Bale was surprisingly awful in this and I honestly expected more from a man taking the reigns of the legendary John Connor. Bale presented an ultimately one dimensional character and you had to question his motives of taking the role of this infamous movie character. The mysterious Marcus Wright character, played by the brilliant Sam Worthington is a movie saving character from start to finish. His whole performance is brilliant throughout and manages to drive the plot along successfully with very little to work with in terms of original character depth. Kyle Reese played by the brilliant up and comer Anton Yelchin is also a delightful addition to the movie and adds again a bit of depth to the movies plot. Other supporting cast include Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams and Bryce Dallas Howard as Connor's wife Cate. Also, a cool little cameo piece goes to the delightful Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan who is a Doctor for Cyberdyne Systems and actually turns out to have a more pivotal role.<br /><br />The action is brilliant throughout and with the apparent unbeatable nature of the machines this manages to present quite a daunting aspect to the theatre of the battles that ensue. The scale of the machine warfare is quite disappointing as when we first glimpsed the human/machine war in the first movie, we gained a glimpse of what seemed to be a constantly chaotic battle which left us wanting more. This film doesn't use Cameron's image as McG takes away the futuristic lasers and hoards of machines lined up executing human after human and he exchanges it for the odd flying scouting machine, a large harvester robot which merely collects the humans for what seems to be mass slaughter and of course, the T-600 machines which are a less advanced model of the T-800 machine which we all know as the 101 machine or Arnold Schwarzenegger who we all miss from this movie. This is probably what the movie is lacking the most as the absence of Arnie is certainly a drag for the Terminator franchise and I'm sure that if the effort were put into the writing, they could have found a role for the older Arnold in this film.<br /><br />There's not denying that Terminator Salvation lacks the charm and excitement of its trilogy of predecessors, however, there's a lot that this film brings to the Terminator universe. The possibility of John Connors son, the look at the early models of the Terminator machines and the new machine concepts make it quite enjoyable. Had the acting been a bit better and the supporting cast a higher level of significance, this film could have been on par with the original 3. It's still a good film and a worthwhile waste of just under two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be very good, especially since it finally brought the franchise out of the present day and into the future. Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington give excellent performances. The action and special effects are great. The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film. Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately, but they forget that it has always been Skynet's goal to kill Connor, not Reese, and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor's father.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After becoming a blockbuster series in the making with the one-two punch of "The Terminator" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", the burgeoning franchise went on an extended hiatus at the height of its popularity. Then, in 2003, director Jonathan Mostow took over the reins from departing director James Cameron ("The Terminator" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day") with "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" which delivered to us the opening salvo of the escalating war with the machines. Now, here we are six years later with yet another new director as the much maligned (at least by me) filmmaker McG throws us headlong into the conflict with the surprising, yet extremely entertaining and satisfying follow-up "Terminator: Salvation".<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" begins in the year 2018, the machines have almost completely taken over the entire planet, and only small pockets of human resistance remain intact. Led by an almost messianic soldier named John Connor (Christian Bale), the humans begin to rally together for a pivotal battle that could bring the devastating war to a swift conclusion. However, a recent addition to the rabble, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), presents Connor and the rest of the resistance with a mystery that could either spell certain doom for humanity or be the secret weapon they so desperately need.<br /><br />Truth be told, I wasn't sure how good this movie would be prior to its release. The reason for my uncertainty towards this installment had nothing to do with the previous film in the series being somewhat weaker, and everything to do with this movie's director, McG.<br /><br />To me McG is nothing more than a hack director with only one good movie to his name. His first two films had been the insipidly crafted and overblown "Charlie's Angels" movies. Granted he did follow those up three years later with the amazingly sound, heartfelt and moving football drama "We Are Marshall". But when it comes to his more action oriented movies, I think one would be hard-pressed to find an original idea in his head. A fact which the director almost seems proud of as he has referred to his blatant copying as paying an homage rather than ripping off other directors and their movies.<br /><br />However, as I alluded to earlier, "Terminator: Salvation" proved my mistrust of McG's directorial prowess to be somewhat misplaced. Unlike his previous action work where overblown action scenes featuring extremely exaggerated stunt and wire work became very annoying , this film is a grittier, hard-hitting, and dare I say, more realistic style of filmmaking (which may be hard to believe given that this is a sci-fi movie). Also, there are no ridiculously long drawn out slow-motion shots lingering on any of the female characters flipping their hair all around for no good reason (&agrave; la the "Charlie's Angels" movies).<br /><br />Now, this isn't to say that McG resisted his apparently insatiable temptation to steal ideas from other movies. In fact, there are numerous instances sprinkled throughout this film where it is quite obvious what movie he chose to base a large majority of his action sequences upon. If you've seen the movie or even just some of the previews, then you should know exactly to what film I am referring.<br /><br />Numerous times over the course of the movie, several scenes involving the Terminators, or portions of them, blatantly ripped off camera angles or just the style of shooting from Michael Bay's "Transformers". These moments don't detract from the movie too much, because I know that by now almost every new thing a director can come up with has been done in some form or fashion; thus, complete originality is difficult to come by. That being said, I just wish that some of the inspiration hadn't been so painfully obvious even to the most casual of viewers. Here's a thought, maybe next time McG should try not to rip off a movie that has a sequel in theaters only a month or so after his movie. Due to the closeness of the release dates, McG's copying looks less like an homage and more like somebody trying to cheat off of someone else's work to get better results.<br /><br />Despite borrowing visual effects ideas from "Transformers", that doesn't mean the effects in "Terminator: Salvation" were anything to sneeze at. The work done by the creative minds at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) was superbly crafted and not surprisingly, the best the series had seen thus far. The inclusion of multiple new Terminator vehicles, models, and so on was very exciting, especially from the standpoint of not only a fan of the series, but a fan of visual effects. If you have ever spent time watching the first three "Terminator" movies and wished that you could see more of the vehicles shown in the segments chronicling the future war or see even more Terminators in action, then this movie is definitely the one to see as it delivers on both counts.<br /><br />In regards to the cast of this film, we find an all-new assemblage of talent making their debut within the series. Leading the new grouping is the intense character actor Christian Bale ("The Dark Knight") as the leader of the human resistance, John Connor. Not surprisingly, Christian hands in a solid performance, giving us a John Connor that is tough as nails on the outside; however, behind closed doors he still struggles with doubt and despair. These quieter moments with Connor are vital to the character by showing us more than a one-dimensional caricature of a hero, and also to illustrate that he hasn't become cold and calculating like the machines he fights. Not to mention, these reflective scenes also serve as a connection to the decidedly more insecure variation of the character from the previous installment (as portrayed by Nick Stahl). Thankfully though, most of the whining and "Woe is me" attitude that permeated Nick's performance is nowhere to be found in this film.<br /><br />In the primary supporting role, which one could argue is also a lead role in truth, is up-and-coming actor Sam Worthington. As a rising star Sam is in surprisingly high demand with roles not only in this film, but also in James Cameron's "Avatar" and the upcoming remake, "Clash of the Titans". Based on what I've seen of Sam's acting prowess (which is based solely on this movie as I haven't seen "Avatar" yet), I would say as far as an action star goes, he should do very well. He's mastered the steely gaze of previous action heroes such as, Sylvester Stallone or even Arnold; he appears comfortable in action sequences (some newcomers can appear unconfident in their early work); and lastly, he has a presence on screen that captures the audience's attention. As far as his dramatic skills, well that remains to be seen, but at least he should have a decent enough future in the action genre if nothing else.<br /><br />Rounding out the remainder of the supporting players are Bryce Dallas Howard ("Spider-Man 3"), Anton Yelchin ("Star Trek"), and Moon Bloodgood ("Pathfinder"). Bryce Dallas Howard is given very little to do in her role as John's wife Kate. She is relegated to merely reacting to John's struggles with his doubts or being the strong supportive wife in front of the troops. Moon Bloodgood as Blair, one of John's faithful soldiers, is given more to do than Bryce; however, even then she spends most of her time in action sequences. So, no real depth is given to her character other than that she is an extremely competent fighter.<br /><br />When you look at the characters of Kate and Blair one definitely gets the sense that the writers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris ("Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines") were simply giving a taste of these ancillary characters and that more time would be spent exploring them in future sequels. So with that thought in mind, I say here's hoping for more on these potentially interesting characters in the future.<br /><br />Lastly, actor Anton Yelchin gets the second most fleshed out supporting role behind Sam Worthington as a young resistance fighter named Kyle Reese. Anton brings an earnest quality to Kyle that harkens back to Michael Biehn's portrayal of an older version of the character in the original film. At the same time, Anton displays a youthful enthusiasm to prove one's self worth in a world of humanity comprised almost entirely of soldiers. Throughout this movie I noticed numerous subtle references to either character traits/mannerisms or phrases that Kyle would say that were reminiscent of the previous movies as well (the same can also be said for John Connor too). It's these little nods and insider references to characters and/or events from throughout the series' history that makes the experience all the more enjoyable for me as I try to catch each one.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that I entered this movie with numerous doubts regarding just how good it could be; I must say that the end result is an incredibly fun, fast-paced, action-packed ride that will leave you wanting more. This installment definitely overcomes the weaker points of the previous film (which was still a good movie in itself) and propels this series forward to deliver even more excitement in the future.<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" is available in a PG-13 Theatrical Cut or R-rated Director's Cut; both feature violence and language, with brief nudity in the Director's Cut only.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Skynet becomes aware in 2003 and all hell breaks loose. Machines make the Earth their stomping ground for the next 18 years, while humans find themselves hunted and terminated by specially built machines. All the while, John Connor fights alongside of the Resistance, making certain that the "prophecy" about his future comes true. Skynet also knows about this prediction and begins taking measure to stop this by hunting him and Kyle Reese to keep Judgment Day's purty end machine-based, building all sorts of interesting things into this now 15-year-old storyline. Then there's Marcus, the sub, the signal, and a few dozen other things that are best left to the movie to describe.<br /><br />Out of all of the Terminator movies, i have to say that i liked this one the best. Instead of having one machine going after one person, we finally have the future that we had been promised. Sure, this isn't far enough for Connor to get his wings and take out the net, but it does show just how far he''s come. Scenes like those with him meeting high command also show how much skepticism is going around about him and his supposed future, but that doesn't seem to bother him. The thing he worries about is Kyle and meetting him, not to mention the fact that Skynet has the two of them on a kill list. and then there's Marcus - something that he doesn't have the slightest notion how to deal with.<br /><br />One of the things i liked about the movie were the different types of machines that Skynet had built. It has collection machines, Hunter/Killers patrolling the sky, machines to kill all foot traffic, things on the road, and T-600s everywhere. We are just now up to the T-800 launch as well, and we are just now up to Skynet beginning its "dark times." so, humanity still has a fighting chance when battling and it isn't like the first movie. The fields of skulls may exist somewhere but, along with those, the humans have A-10 Warthogs and other weapons. This makes for some good fights, some interesting moral dilemmas, and some themes I wasn't expecting. It seemed like a thinking person's skynet, which I thought was interesting in the making.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series I figure you will go here anyhow. People who do not like it may want to check it out anyhow because this movie is different. It breaks a lot of cyclical bonds while still keeping the story, making it interesting. Personally, I liked it above all the others, and I even remember the first through a child's eyes - and it was something else. Recommended and then some.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>I'll agree with other reviewers that this will probably be a movie most will either love or hate. Personally, I loved the movie and thought it was a great followup to the other Terminator movies. Be warned, however, that if you go into this movie expecting it to be like the past films- well, you be the judge. Whereas the other films dealt with alot of storyline about the Terminators, Cyberdine and Skynet; this film does very little to push that envelope along. In its' place, all we see are alot of action sequences with different types of machines and some Terminator action but not alot. Other than that, the cast was well chosen with all giving solid performances.<br /><br />The story takes place in 2018. Judgment Day has come and gone. John Conner is hard at work trying to convince the rest of the world that he is the key to their salvation from the Terminators. Marcus Wright is a death row prisoner who submits his body to experiments as penance for crimes he has committed(yet only hinted at in the movie). Awaking in 2018, Marcus discovers that the world has been destroyed and is no longer as he remembers it. Along his way, he meets up with Kyle Reese and that's where the movie pretty much starts.<br /><br />While I think Termintor Salvation is a great movie, it was pretty much done in McG's over the top style of filmmaking that he did in Charlie's Angels/Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed Terminator 4 aka Terminator Salvation, and I hope that if Terminator 5 comes out, it has all the future scenes from Terminator, T2, and T3. This was a radical movie. I got to see new forms of robots that Skynet created. I thought that this movie was a nice departure from bad cyborg-good cyborg fights. it was cool to see Roland Kickinger with a CGI of Arnold's face, as Arnold played a T-800 in all 3 Terminator movies. it was freaky how the cyborg gun turret recognized Marcus Wright, but did not shoot at him, because it knew that he was a Terminator cyborg. it didn't matter to me that Arnold was not in this movie, because I got a good thrill out of it none the less.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>When I heard that Christian Bale was starring in the newest TERMINATOR film, I flipped.  I mean, Bale's portrayal of Batman (or, rather, Bruce Wayne; I have qualms about his Batman voice, but that's another rant) helped rejuvenate the ailing franchise...hell, it brought it back from the grave.  I figured he could do the same for TERMINATOR as well, a series that started strong, became excellent, and then fizzled in the third entry.<br /><br />Well...SALVATION is much stronger than TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.  However, Bale isn't given much to work with--his character, John Connor, wasn't even the principle character in the original script.  SALVATION rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Sam Worthington, who thankfully is an actor worthy of the challenge.  Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a death-row inmate given a second chance as one of SkyNet's failed human/cyborg composites.  However, the film wavers between Bale and Worthington's characters, primarily because the studio knows that ignoring a big-name star like Christian Bale is a big no-no.  Dare I say it: this movie would have been stronger without Bale's presence.  (I know, it's almost blasphemous; but it's the truth.)<br /><br />Also along for the ride is the talented Anton Yelchin (who also hit 2009 blockbuster gold in STAR TREK), as the guy who eventually goes back in time and sleeps with Connor's mother (look for voice cameos by Linda Hamilton).  We've also got a grossly under-used Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Ironside; Moon Bloodgood, who's a good fit for the role, although again there's not much to work with; and Bryce Dallas Howard, who doesn't quite mesh with the action stars she's surrounded with.  Add to that McG's uneven direction, and TERMINATOR: SALVATION comes off as another "what it should have been" film--not great, not spectacular, but entertaining enough to make up for RISE OF THE MACHINES.  Of course, that wouldn't take very much.  Also, let's face it: we would've loved a genuine Arnold cameo, his old age be damned.  Now THAT would have been true salvation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>Well, there's nothing like destroying a franchise, is there? Take two of science fiction and Hollywood's most beloved movies, remove everything that was ever good about them and flush them down the toilet - and Jim Cameron's not even dead yet. I love - LOVE - the originals and it pains me to watch my adoptive children get the George Lucas treatment. Let me count the ways in which this film will be remembered as one of the bedrock events in the destruction of storytelling and a critical step towards Michael Bay receiving the Nobel Peace prize and Best Screenplay Oscar in 2020.<br /><br />I knew from the beginning it didn't look good from having a director called McG - Mr T was the last three-lettered celebrity I can remember but at least he didn't try to direct a film. When Helena Bonham Carter showed up as the stereotyped terminal cancer patient, I knew we were in trouble. And then Sam Worthington showed up (the Gene Hackman of our times, appearing in about 10% of all films currently being made) and couldn't decide on an American or Australian accent for the duration of the shoot. Fortunately, it's not too noticeable since Christian Bale's Batman growl steals the show.<br /><br />If you can cast your mind back to the legitimate Terminator films, one of the rules is that bullets don't tend to do much damage to Terminators whereas molten steel is a pretty effective way in taking one out. In this film, it's the reverse - Christian Bale takes out a T-800 with a machine gun but fails to destroy one with molten steel. Go figure. And that's the most faithful this film gets to the originals.<br /><br />Then there's a whole bunch of new characters introduced that nobody cares about and they attempt to recycle some of the iconic dialog ("Come with me if you want to live," to which the only response is "If the rest of the film is this bad, I'll stay here.")<br /><br />Back to the bad and broken logic, Skynet is no longer trying to exterminate people but rather farm them for some reason that doesn't make any sense. It turns out that Sam Worthington is 50% Terminator too but by the time we find out, it's no surprise because we saw it in the trailer. More of a surprise is the massive Transformers-style bot that's incredibly bad at catching people. And then there's the even bigger surprise of the motorcycle-shaped Terminator that takes a USB Flash drive - thank God the USB2.0 protocol survived the war.<br /><br />At some point Bryce Dallas Howard shows up, thankful that she's in something marginally better than Lady in the Water. Apparently, Claire Danes is still recovering from embarrassing herself in Terminator 3 and couldn't bring herself to this horror show. I don't really remember why she's there.<br /><br />Anyway, plot-wise we get into some really convoluted plan by the machines that makes the average episode of Murder She Wrote look like Agatha Christie. They build this half-human-slash-cyborg thing to lure out John Connor when the real thing was infinitely more effective (or they could have just killed his father when they held him in the farm). Skynet is apparently running Windows ME since their strategic logic wouldn't win a chess game let alone Future War.<br /><br />The ending - slight SPOILER ALERT here - is so far-fetched I had to rewatch a Christopher Nolan film to bring back my faith in the movie industry. There's a heart transplant surgery that would make a daytime soap opera blush and literally I was ready to head out for a beer when it happened.<br /><br />So sorry for the rant but the first Terminator films are largely responsible for my love of movies and McG just did the worst possible job. Terminator 3 was possible to ignore but Terminator Salvation leaves my brain rocking back and forth in my head trying to make sense of the whole thing. As far as I'm concerned, this story ended perfectly when Arnold was lowered into the molten steel and that's the end of it.<br /><br />If you remember how thrilled you were when first seeing Terminator 2, do yourself a favor and relive that film rather than having it trashed by this one. And I didn't even get to tell you how bad the pointless CGI Arnie looked but apparently it cost a *lot* of money.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>This movie is so massively wrong-headed, and so overtly throws sod on the original Terminator film, that I can only assume it's deliberate.  I can only conclude that director McG and the small army of writers who held this film in development hell for several years purposely want to sour you and me on James Cameron's 1984 classic.  What other explanation can there be for such transparent awfulness?<br /><br />Deep in the violence of post-nuclear 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) struggles as a low-ranking officer in the Resistance.  Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), executed by the state fifteen years earlier, awakes not one day older, already in the thick of fighting.  But in a matter of hours, Wright finds the one thing both the Machines and Connor need: the current location of young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).<br /><br />The original Terminator flourished by taking common fears and making them happen on screen before us.  Because many of us distrust ordinary technology, Cameron's 1984 film is justly considered a classic.  This film, by contrast, seems written as a showcase for the special effects.  There is not one moment of tension, not one revealing human moment, not one point at which I feel this movie is telling the truth.<br /><br />This film suffers innumerable orchestrated set pieces, fight sequences, and explosions.  Everything is tightly so choreographed, I never get the feeling anything has really happened.  If you doubt what I mean, I commend to your imagination the image of a CGI Arnold, head surrounded by a halo of anti-aliasing artifacts, tossing Christian Bale like a Frisbee.  Yeah, the whole movie is like that.<br /><br />Then we have all the bits and bobs stolen from other, better sci-fi movies.  You could make a drinking game out of spotting them all.  Beer for Star Wars, wine for The Matrix, liquor for Spielberg's War of the Worlds.  Make 'em double shots for images taken from sequels.  I saw not one original set piece, line of dialog, or piece of physical design in this entire 118-minute disaster.<br /><br />Cameron's original Terminator was one of the greatest works of film ever.  The second film was good.  The third was adequate.  This one is awful.  I don't throw negative superlatives around, because they get abused, but this is the worst film I've seen in at least three years.  I will watch no more Terminator films.  I love the original too much to see the franchise desecrated this way.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>OK, this a must own, I enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy the whole series.

I like many of you am also a fan of the terminator series and yes I know T2 rocked and was the best. Is it b/c Arnold is no longer there, except in the cgi form (which I thought looked really fake and they couldve left out) or perhaps b/c James Cameron didn't direct it? Personally I judge it on its own accord (new actors/new director) rather than comparing it to previous Terminator movies.<br /><br />I liked Mr. Bale as Connor, he did a pretty good job. I liked the story line w/ Marcus revolting and helping to save Connor and the resistance and Connor risking everything to save his teenage future dad from skynet. The action scenes were really intense and the movie does have a modern/futuristic feel to it which is cool. Although I wish the movie was longer, 1 hr 45 minutes(approx.) just seems too short in my opinion, it would've been better say at 2hrs 15 minutes or so and thus allowed for a bit more depth & character development. I dont like the clean PG-13 rating. I would like it to be more violent, bloody, gory, gritty, etc. staying true to a real war situation. Overall, I'm glad they made this movie, it gives the series new legs, and I look forward to more.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When I think of the "Terminator" film franchise, two things immediately come to mind: an iconic leading actor (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) who can carry the film, and an interesting time-travel plot that will keep you engaged while things are blowing up.  This film, by casting Christian Bale and continuing the basic timeline, ensures a successful fourth installment.<br /><br />Basically, in "Terminator Salvation", we finally get a glimpse into the future, where a group of human resistance fighters led by John Connor (Bale) are battling to stay alive as the machines hunt them down one colony at a time.  While the war rages on, Connor listens to the tapes handed to him from his mother at the conclusion of T2 and realizes that he must find and protect young Kyle Reese in order to maintain his (and mankind's) entire existence.  Complicating matters is the fact that the robotic Skynet has created their ultimate weapon...a "terminator" who thinks he is a human, throwing Connor and his gang for a loop.<br /><br />Though not a classic film in any sense of the word, I felt that this addition was welcome to the franchise for its ability to show what the earlier films only hinted at...the human resistance against Skynet.  The casting of Bale lends automatic credence to the entire project, and he lives up to the billing with the best-acted performance of the show, and the human-cyborg plot angle does two things: preview the "terminators" of the future, and set up an interesting ethical dilemma for Connor.<br /><br />Plus, I also loved the subtle nods to the three previous installments in the franchise, such as a cameo from Arnold and Bale's own twist on the iconic "I'll be back" line.<br /><br />Thus, although I feel that this film could have been much more epic, it was, as a fan of the Terminator franchise, entertaining enough to hold my interest until the very end.  It also sets the stage for a possible sequel, which would be the true test of whether this re-boot will be the next "Batman Begins", or instead turn into "Superman Returns".</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>I barely remember the Terminator movies, so the impact was less harmfull on<br />watching terminator salvation. I was'nt really looking for a continuation of the<br />franchise, i just wanted to be entertained.  And that's what this movie does.<br />I found the movie had great effects, good sound and some great robots. The<br />characters in the film were interesting and the acting was decent.  I find it<br />soo weird to see a digitized Arnold near the end...but a must for the movie.<br />A keeper...good to watch multiple times.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Ever since seeing the flashbacks/flash forwards of the future in the first two Terminator movies, I was really hoping to get a movie about the actual resistance war against the machines.  It has been done in comic book form, but I really wanted the big movie story.  I was actually a bit disappointed by this movie.  I think Bale is a fine choice as leader of the resistance, though he didn't really do as much with the role as I would have liked.  I also thought that the world that had endured a nuclear war and the rising of machines should have looked much more desolate and grim.  The first two movies show a world that is shattered and dark.  The story is okay, though much of it feels like a set up for a sequel that may or may not come based on the low box office take.  Good action sequences make this interesting throughout despite many short comings.</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>I've been a fan of the Terminator series for as long as there's been a Terminator series and at the conclusion of each of the films there's been a steady theme to my wonderment: When is John Connor going to fulfill his destiny as the savior of humanity?  Unfortunately, my near-famous question remains unanswered once more in Terminator Salvation but before we get into all that, let's explore the nitty-gritty, shall we?<br /><br />The film represents the fourth full-length motion picture release in the Terminator franchise and the first of which is notably missing T-800 Model 101 portrayal by iconic actor-turned politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger (although there is a segment so well done in his absence that I'm actually going to have to look up how they did it).<br /><br />For years now we've seen glimpses into the future via brief sequences in each of the films, video games, television series and so on.  It's almost always the same: Black skies behind a global junkyard just littered with human skulls for the advancing robotic exoskeletons to crush with their feet and tank treads.  Humans cower behind rubble while taking potshots at the seemingly invincible mechanized armada before them, armed with brightly flashing lasers and odd hovering aircraft.  It's pretty bleak but then again it's pretty tough to imagine a friendly scenario when describing an event labeled "Judgment Day".  Here's the thing- for as long as we've been fed these disturbing post apocalyptic images, we've been given the promise of hope in one man; a man so influential in turning the tide against the machines that they have attempted his assassination (unsuccessfully) across three full movies and two seasons of network television.<br /><br />Set in the post Judgment Day timeline, Terminator Salvation has been perhaps the closest in potentially allowing the lead character to begin displaying the sheer omnipotence that will eventually be the machines' undoing (save for a few brief seconds at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines) but alas, the film makes it clear pretty early on that this is more a Kyle Reese survival tale and an excuse to introduce a new mechanized hybrid (Marcus Wright) then it is John Connor's coming into his own.<br /><br />The setting is bleak, but not near as bad as the scene we've been teased with all these years (I'm assuming that's because those shots must have represented the moments directly after the robot-induced nuclear war).  It's 2018 in Salvation and the world has been pretty much handed over to the machines.  Small human outposts are scattered about but the "Resistance" isn't nearly as well defined here as has been hinted to throughout the franchise.  Rather, both a military and civilian presence coexist amidst the mechanical mayhem.<br /><br />Connor is as a member of the military effort here (along with his wife Catherine "Kate") though his portrayal this time around is closer to that of a low-ranking stereotypical loose cannon than a natural born leader.  In the film's defense, by the end an opportunity for Connor's rapid advancement through the ranks is presented, though there is little along the way that hints to exactly how John Connor's going to inevitably turn the tides once and for all (you'll think it is explained early on, but that thread is a bit of a dead end by the film's conclusion as well).<br /><br />One of the coolest elements of the film's timeline is that it allows for a nice intimate look at some of the weapons and mechanized beasties that the machines have built in effort to keep us lowly humans in check.  Love or hate the influence computer-generated imaging has had on movie making in recent years, there is little doubt that the sheer scale and complexity of many of the sequences here would not have been possible when the earlier films were dazzling movie-goers.<br /><br />Among the mentionables are a single-shot helicopter crash sequence that certainly harkens back to some of the finer techniques used in Cloverfield and a robotic sentry that's absolutely terrifying due to it's sheer size and firepower.  I will refrain from gushing over the motorcycle-piloting droids ("Mototerminators") that dislodge from the large Harvesters to give chase, the slow, methodic machine-gunning of the T-600s, or the very Matrix-esque "Hydrobots" that patrol the waterways.  The point is there is far more going on in the land of the machines than simply mindless marching metal skeletons.<br /><br />And speaking of the Matrix, it would be wrong to skate through this review without at least mentioning the apparent influence the series had on the Terminator's prose.  In all fairness Terminator did it first but while the T-movies were typically set in contemporary time frames with classic horror elements driving a very human emotional chase, this is the first opportunity for the franchise to shift into true science fiction mode.  And I'm pleased to report that it does that well.  Everything from hand-to-hand combat, futuristic weapons, human-mechanical hybrids, to radioactive fallout make their presence felt here.  Couple this to the typical tension-laden "Terminator" sound score and you have yourself a heck of fun thrill ride.<br /><br />Surprisingly, however (especially considering the swing to science fiction), there is really absolutely nothing to do with time travel in this one.  It is mentioned in the dialog and the back story of John Connor attempting to keep young Kyle Reese (his father) safe so that he himself may exist, pays homage to the time-twisting prose of the prior films, but nowhere here is the concept solidified.  So much so is it's avoidance that it leaves viewers wondering such things is how the technology will be discovered, by whom, and so on.<br /><br />Maybe it's for the best such things were left untouched considering the sheer amount of continuity discrepancies already taking up server space just in arguments stemming from the time travel in the first three movies and the Sarah Connor Chronicle TV series.<br /><br />Other minor complaints include an impromptu heart transplant (in the most non-sterile environment imaginable) and a John Connor with an absolute disdain for mechanical organisms (despite, as the other movies/ TV shows have led us believe, having practically grown up around those that protected him as well as tried to destroy him).  Small nit picks, sure, but long time fans of the franchise will surely pick up on these things.<br /><br />In all, and despite what my review may have you thinking, this is an enjoyable film from beginning to end.  If this seems hard to believe considering my abundant criticisms, rest assured that the Terminator pictures have rarely stood up well to scientific scrutiny.  The point is they exist to entertain and Salvation, just like the others, doesn't disappoint in that area.  The action is intense, the pace nice and brisk, and the visuals quite spectacular throughout.  The acting is solid and even the science doesn't require absolute suspension of disbelief (usually a prerequisite in scifi).  At the end of the day it's a fun popcorn flick that manages to make up for its lack of intricate story structure with sheer style.  Just don't go in expecting to finally understand why the robots of the future have made it their number one priority to eliminate John Connor even if they had to invent time travel to do it... It's one of many Terminator discrepancies best left to debate on the fan forums.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>It should really have ended with TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, with the horrific post-apocalyptic future finally averted and that credo "No Fate But What We Make" resounding triumphantly in our ears. At least James Cameron knew better than to muddy up the waters, knew better than to mess up the perfect ending. In Hollywood, though, it's all about milking that cow dry, and the Terminator franchise was too lucrative, much too much of a good thing, to leave alone. Hell, the Governator couldn't turn down a third installment. Except without Cameron helming it and with Nick Stahl's negligible turn as John Connor (and with Arnie no longer looking so spry), TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES came up blah. And they still, still, still wouldn't let it rest.<br /><br />TERMINATOR: SALVATION feels like, looks like, smells like a lead-in to yet further sequels. Putting down the cup of haterade for a sec, I will admit that it's a technically well-executed film. It brims with dazzling special effects, soaks in gritty, ominous atmosphere, and is marked with Sam Worthington's very good performance. It's the story itself that is found wanting. A story with this post-apocalyptic premise, in which the human race is on the verge of obliteration, it should make you want to root for humanity's survival. But, thanks to some weak characterization, I find myself not really giving a toss for anyone except for Sam Worthington's character.<br /><br />If the trailer hadn't already given it away, then the opening sequence, set in 2003, spoilers it but big as death row inmate Marcus Wright (Worthington) signs a contract to have Cyberdyne have its way with his corpse. He does this in exchange for a kiss from Helena Bonham Carter, which would've been a cute moment except that it went by too abruptly. Cut then to the year 2018, and Judgment Day has happened. Everywhere lie the decay and ruins of civilization. The Machines have taken over. This isn't yet the time of John Connor. At this stage he is regarded by what's left of the human resistance as either savior or false prophet. At this stage John Connor is a respected and influential soldier in the Resistance, but, as the movie starts, he comes off as more or less still just one of the guys, just one of the soldiers, even if his peers know all about his perceived destiny. In 2018, John Connor ranks only second on Skynet's hit list.<br /><br />The person Skynet would most like to neutralize is a teenager named Kyle Reese, and even the casual fan is well aware that the Terminator mythos is very dependent on Kyle Reese. However, I don't get the logic in Reese being more crucial for Skynet to stop than John Connor. Connor doesn't know where Kyle is, but we learn that Kyle and a mute little girl comprise the entire Los Angeles-based resistance. Who knows how much longer these two could've waged their losing battle against Skynet's war machines, except that it's around here that Marcus Wright inexplicably resurfaces, asking what day and year it is and seemingly stunned at the rampant devastation stretching to the horizon. Marcus Wright's last memory is being executed in 2003 and his presence now in 2018 has already altered the time line. Elsewhere, John Connor tells his wife: "Something has changed. This is not the future my mother told me about." The only question is whether Marcus is someone from the past or something deployed from the future by Skynet. Either way, Marcus promptly proves to have exceptional survival skills.<br /><br />I liked this movie, liked enough about it that I don't really feel like slamming it too hard. The first two Terminator movies and even the SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES have built up enough good will that, even though I was a bit iffy about this fourth entry, I knew I was gonna be in the theater when it opened up. The story itself isn't all that and feels disjointed in spots. The core narrative follows Marcus Wright, but a key sub-plot involves the Resistance's discovery of a device which emits an override signal and renders the Machines inert. This kill switch is crucial to the Resistance's plan to take the fight directly to Skynet. This is pretty ho-hum stuff to me, and doesn't at all give me what I crave for, which is a series of absorbing character moments involving folks other than Marcus (Marcus has plenty of character moments).<br /><br />Thankfully, the incredibly intense action sequences and the special effects carry the movie, with the CG being wicked spectacular, seamless, really. And I dig the colossal Transforminator! Director McG and his crew really sell the harrowing, dirty, grainy future world and establish that palpable sense of bleakness, that man has lost his place as the dominant species on the planet. Sam Worthington is great, as mentioned, and never mind that his Australian accent peeks out every now and then. The film's emotional core absolutely revolves around the tragic Marcus Wright, and he brings home that central theme of "Do sad robots have souls?" You certainly connect with him more than with the grim and tortured John Connor, and going by the quality of Worthington's performance, AVATAR has got itself a crackling good lead. Anton Yelchin as the teenaged Kyle Reese does a good job of channeling Michael Bienh's mannerisms; he's sure more convincing playing Reese than he is playing Chekov. And to ***SPOILER*** the rest of this sentence, there's a serious fanboy moment when a certain T-800 makes an appearance.<br /><br />When that military defense program known as Skynet achieved self-awareness, who would've thunk it that several of its cyborgs (Marcus Wright & the T-800 from T2) would demonstrate more charisma and soulfulness than would the robotic Christian Bale as John Connor? And someone please tell the guy he's not on the Batman set anymore?<br /><br />TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES taps Kate Brewster as a key figure in the Resistance, except that, here, she does a lot of standing around, and it doesn't help that it's the lifeless Bryce Dallas Howard taking over that role (not that Claire Danes was any great shakes). Moon Bloodgood is sexy but superfluous, and, speaking as a dude, it's irksome that her nude scene was deleted. Absolutely, there's a jarring cut right around before the bandits attack Bloodgood's character, making it very apparent that a huge chunk of scene had been lopped off. The sense is that Bloodgood was supposed to provide a further emotional connection, and possibly even a romantic one, with Marcus. But all that is cut out. The Boy & His Robot theme is offered up again - between Kyle and Marcus, and between the little mute girl and Marcus - but it's not so convincing. And I resent the movie trying to manipulate us even more by introducing the "Newt" element.<br /><br />That old no-nonsense pro Michael Ironside, whom I remember best from the original V mini-series, comes in to provide some much needed fire as the current Resistance leader. So that's good.<br /><br />For someone touted as the savior of humanity, John Connor doesn't really do much until near the end, and so there's a credibility issue here. In the prior films, John Connor was either this shadowy figure lurking in the future or he was portrayed by unremarkable yahoos like Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl and that kid from the TV series. Meaning that, here we are somewhat caught up with the future time line and this is when and where John Connor is supposed to make his mark. He doesn't, and if Christian Bale hadn't insisted on expanding his John Connor role, word has it that the future messiah would've been relegated more to the background, maybe only as a raspy voice broadcasting over the radio, offering hope to the isolated pockets of survivors: "This is John Connor. If you are listening to this - you are the Resistance."<br /><br />And one beef I've always had - but it's minor - is the Terminators' habit of throwing their targets around, instead of just efficiently snapping necks. And - okay, I'm ***SPOILERING*** this sentence - - - when Connor infiltrates the heart of Skynet, he encounters only two Terminators. Two! So, okay, one is supposed to be the very first T-800 model; I guess that's why there's only one of his type. And the second is a T-600. But, dang, this is the heart of Skynet! Where's the rest of its soldiers?<br /><br />I miss Sarah Connor, her presence here relegated to voice recordings frequently consulted by John. But that's how good Linda Hamilton was.<br /><br />SALVATION presents us with a passel of Hunter-Killer war machines (the T-600, T-800, the hydrobot, the self-automated motorbikes, the Infiltration Prototype, etc.) but, probably because this is a PG-13 flick, the threat level isn't as impressive and these metal suckers aren't as frightening. And if you're expecting SALVATION to resolve everything, to provide a capper to the franchise, that doesn't happen. If anything, the hokey ending sets up a new trilogy. And as much as I've been grousing for the past few paragraphs, I'll say again that I like this movie. SALVATION is a gritty war movie as much as it is a sci-fi thriller. It certainly bears repeated viewings for the many very cool fan moments provided, although, okay, a young Kyle Reese doesn't quite pull off the iconic "Come with me if you want to live" line.<br /><br />In 2029, John Connor sends Kyle to 1984 to save Sarah Connor. This story being set in 2018, that's over a decade of stuff to chronicle. Yeah, man, this is gonna be another trilogy; it may even end up being a good one. John Connor still has a chance to convince us as that he IS one righteous mutha and that he's fated to lead humanity. But I still can't help but agree with Linda Hamilton; this thing should've ended with the first two films, with "No fate but what we make" still the relevant rallying cry. TERMINATOR: SALVATION gets 3.5 out of 5 stars from me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Ok, so the "Terminator" films are legend. Arnold, Hamilton and a slew of goofy one liners, chilling murders and mind bending temporal paradox theories really defined a generation for sci-fi. With all of that in my head, I waited with baited breath to see how Christian Bale would handle the Terminator legacy... I was disappointed. I'm not saying I didn't really like the film, but there is more "Transformers" than "Terminator" about it. So, my bottom line: If you like Christian Bale, great action, amazing acting and heart pounding music... you're going to love this movie. I really did like it, but it was definitely NOT "The Terminator."</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Now I will start off by saying that I agree with Cameron that the series should have ended with T2.  I didn't and we have T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and the immortal line "Talk to the hand."  TERMINATOR: SALVATION makes a better fit in that it takes us onward in time instead of having endless Terminators come back in time to save/kill John Connor.  It has a serviceable performance by Bale as John Connor.  Moon Bloodgood and Sam Worthington (actually a contender for James Bond) are worth the price of admission.  The CG Arnie (the head on the body of Roland Kickenger -- who is not going to be Conan) looks fake.  A popcorn film and nothing more.  If you are looking for TERIMATOR or T2 you will be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>You will not recognize the actors, or so little. Even the cameo of Schwarzenegger is computer-generated. The film does not bring much new data. It seems to be mixing time periods, but it does not matter. The machine world has been experimenting a new generation of robots, partly human (brain and heart, etc) and partly machine to infiltrate the resistance. They are capturing human beings now to create that new army of infiltrators. Logical but not revolutionary, my dear Watson, or is it Sherlock Holmes, I was going to say Shakespeare. Then the resistance has been able to devise a signal that can freeze the machines that are always controlled by come kind of wave. Interesting but only experimented at local level.<br /><br />The new thing though is that the only existing hybrid retains enough humanity to be a machine for the machines, and recognizable as such by them, but with a real loyalty to humans to the point of helping John Connor come into the headquarters of Skynet, the network that controls all the machines, liberate the prisoners there, have a final fight with the impersonation of Schwarzenegger, escape with Kyle Reeves, a key to the future and destroy the place, which is a "given back" for a "given gift" because the military headquarters of the resistance had been destroyed because they tried to send a general air strike on Skynet in San Francisco, a move which was successfully opposed by John Connor and thus did not happen, but the signal these generals had sent to all units had had the effect of being detected by Skynet who had sent their taskforce to clear the place in one big airstrike.<br /><br />This episode, that will have to have a sequel since the salvation is not finished yet and has not reached liberation, ends with the hybrid being, Marcus Wright, giving his human heart to John Connor to save him before John Connors dies of his wounds. That human touch, quite in the style of Jesus giving his life to save humanity is going soft on our emotions and that's its main objective. A few tears please. But all together the story has not advanced a lot, except to prepare an eventual next episode that could be at least the first step towards liberation. But frankly the main danger of humanity today is not machines and an eventual take over from them, which would explain the relative flop of this film. It is more the take over the financial tycoons and traders of Wall Street had been able to perform leading the world nearly to the bottom of the abyss, at least to the brink of it.<br /><br />When I see the anti-machine or anti-technology stand of some in our society particularly among educators, I am amazed. This very week a university professor in education is advising us to take into account as the basis of our reflection the children who only have school at their disposal to acquire school-knowledge. I would like that very acute young man to tell me today what school-knowledge is in the knowledge economy and society, and to point out to me the child (a wolf child I guess, since so far wolves don't have TVs and smart phones) who would have had access to no other source of knowledge than school.<br /><br />These fake social-climbing-and-politically-minded-though-not-politically-correct-except-with-Trotskyites intellectuals were those who refused to use the radio in class, and then who considered television as the killing challenger of school, and now consider that all communication tools have to be banned from schools and universities, first of all smart phones. Yes there are some in our universities who think smart phones are nothing but a means of cheating.<br /><br />This ideology is behind the Terminator series, but it is today very pass&eacute;, very pre-historical, if history started with the GUIs (Graphical Users Interfaces). A highly considered communication expert I read in some paper lately considers that the technological revolution of our time started in the early 1990s. What an ignoramus. I would have sworn the Internet was first successfully tested between Stanford and Oakland, California, in the fall 1969, and that the first GUI was invented by Apple for its first McIntosh, and then by Microsoft with Windows 3.1, both at the beginning of the 1980s. Why should we be afraid of machines? The Matrix was a lot more positive on the subject, even if the tale needs a human sacrifice, a Savior of sorts to conquer peace with machines and to rebut for a while the engineering mind behind it all, behind all the Mr. Smiths of this world.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>First off, I can't say Sam Worthington represented a big shock when it turned out he was a Terminator. I mean, they made him up to look like the offspring of a marriage between the original two terminators! They might as well have hung a sign on him!<br /><br />This film is the silliest and most muddled thing I have ever seen. I call this kind of garbage a "gelquel", because it isn't prequel and it isn't sequel except in actual time. To be brief: John Connor (the ever-annoying Christian Bale) is hard at it in the war with Skynet. Inexplicably, his "father", Kyle Reese (a charming Anton Yelchin) is a 16 or 17 year old kid running around alone in Los Angeles. Connor knows he's out there, and that he is a teenager, but....<br /><br />Worthington appears. His determination to "find" someone honks the loud horn that this is a terminator, though as I have said about him before, he is sexy and fun to watch. Not so bad.<br /><br />Forget about trying to understand this over-budgeted time-waster. I'm sure Bale needed the role and the money; Yelchin no doubt needed his role (quite good so naturally it amounts to about 10 minutes total). Worthington needed the exposure as well. That's about it for this thing.<br /><br />All I can point out to the unsuspecting film buff is this movie was less violent and more deserving of a PG than the rotten TRANSFORMERS movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Who is this McG dude again? Oh right, he's some douche bag with a ridiculous moniker (McG??????) and has only directed a handful of movies and a couple rap videos. Yep, that's right, we have a guy with almost no experience in film directing a film in a franchise that's very easy to screw up: Terminator. And you know something's up when T3, which was also a piece of crap, starts looking like a good movie in comparison to the newest crappy entry in the series.<br /><br />Christian Bale is in this movie, which is unfortunately a missed opportunity as well. It's no wonder he had a meltdown on the set of this movie- nobody can blame him. This movie is pure muck. I saw this on opening weekend, and walked away as satisfied as much as I was when seeing "9" (in other words, not satisfied). Like I mentioned before, this is a very easy franchise to f--k up, and McG did just that.<br /><br />There's literally nothing to spoil in here. There's basically no plot except something about protecting the universe. The action scenes are very poorly done, with the shaky camera and quick cutting (WHEN WILL DIRECTORS STOP SHAKING THE GODDAMN CAMERA!!!!!!). I could hardly tell what was going on. The acting is awful- except for the excellent performance by Anton Yelchin, who is someone I don't usually like. But even he can't save the movie from sucking out loud. And Sam Worthington is a wasted opportunity here- he was AMAZING in Avatar, and horrible in this too... also, I'm a real Bonham-Carter fanboy, yet she even sucked in this too. The dialogue is terrible ("We have won the battle, but we haven't won the war"??? I think I heard that on an episode of Power Rangers). Yep, you guessed it, this movie sucks out loud.<br /><br />IN TOTAL<br />Violence: Headache/10<br />Sex: 0/10<br />McG: What an idiot/10<br /><br />***Approach with caution***</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>What's going on?  Why should I care about these characters?  Then I found myself asking why I even care how it ends.  Seriously, try to see this movie without any additional incremental out-of-pocket expenses before you plunk down real money and take up valuable DVD shelf space.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Two very different movies are happening at the same time in Terminator Salvation, one of which is much more interesting than the other.  Usually when this happens it means that a producer liked a previous draft well enough to keep its elements, but a later writing team couldn't integrate them well enough into the script as a whole for them to make sense.  The first movie stars Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood, as well as Yelchin, and is the more interesting of the two.  The characters are more fleshed out than in the other film, and through Marcus Wright we see an aspect of Skynet that we haven't before.  The second movie stars Christian Bale, and is not nearly as interesting.  In many ways, John Connor is essentially along for the ride.  I don't understand this, given that John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the resistance, and a charismatic leader; you'd think he'd be the focus of the movie.  Bale's Connor is bland and unapproachable, through no fault of Bale; the script gives him very little to work with.<br /><br />On the bright side, there isn't much here that's going to tick you off if you're a fan of the Terminator movies, unlike certain aspects of T3 that made me want to chuck a shoe at my TV.  On the down side, after it's over, my reaction was "huh, so that was it," instead of, "that was really cool."  When a movie with killer robots, time travel, Helena Bonham Carter, a nuclear war, and some Road Warrior cars elicits that kind of response, it has failed in its mission.<br /><br />This is fine as a rental, but I wouldn't add this to my permanent collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>ever since i was a kid i have loved the terminator movies.i remember back in the early 80s being upset at the idea of never having a terminator 2.i remember in the early 90s,being estatic when they made a second part.i remember in the early part of the 2000s loving the 3rd part.<br />  but there were 2 things i really wanted.the first was to not have to wait a decade in between parts.the second was to see the actual man vs machine war.a whole movie dedicated to just that and not existing only in flashes and memories.<br />  well,here it is!it only took about 5 years,maybe less and the war is on!i really liked this movie a lot.it is not nearly as good as the first 3,but it is definately a good movie.<br />  i didnt like a few things but they are minor.one was that i kept seein john connor as bruce wayne.a silly quirk i know.2 of the main characters looked a lot alike.it confused me a bit.the only real issue i had with the story was the innefficient death camp.<br />  john connor,the best hope for mankind and terminator hater extrordinaire,makes a deal with a terminator.that rubbed me the wrong way.hes supposed to hate them so much.<br />  i also didnt like that arnold swarzanegger was in the movie.he was ranked as the number one enemy against guns in the u.s. .  now the hypocrite plays in a movie full of guns?ive lost all respect for that guy.<br />  the general consensus is that this movie is a let down.i say it is NOT a let down,only not as good as it predecessers.<br /><br />one of the female soldiers kisses a  terminator at the end.if machines get her hot,she couldve just stuck her tongue in a toaster.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.<br /><br />2/4</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>John Connor could not prevent Judgment Day from happening; he could only delay it. Now the war has arrived, and John (Christian Bale), along with his wife (Bryce Dallas Howard) and any other surviving humans they run across are part of the Resistance, a group fighting for survival against the machines.<br /><br />Marcus (Sam Worthington) is part man, part machine, a rejuvenated murderer who was put to death before Judgment Day. The machines created him to combat the Resistance, but his human soul makes him loyal to that side of himself. After sneaking into a base, John Connor orders him to be destroyed, but an amorous female (Moon Bloodgood) helps him escape. Marcus barters with John; he will infiltrate Skynet to save Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), John's father.<br /><br />As a stand-alone movie, Terminator Salvation is a mediocre action movie which follows a formula set up by others of the genre. It has exciting moments, its predictable moments, and boring stretches. However, as a member of the Terminator series, it is incredibly disappointing, and has such a different mood, it stands out like a wrong note.<br /><br />Somehow the post-apocalyptic world does not seem as scary and desolate as it did in Reese's flashbacks in T1. There is too much daylight in this movie, and the Resistance has too many resources. Furthermore, these actors' renditions of famous lines from the previous films come out cheesy and cheap, like the film makers just threw them in to keep fans happy.<br /><br />There are also several continuity problems. How does Alice in Chains begin playing in the Jeep after Marcus hot wires it? I find it hard to believe that a CD, let along a car, survived the nuclear explosions, but lets just assume they did. How, then, does Guns and Roses play over the radio when there isn't a radio station around to broadcast it? Also, how did Sarah Connor's tapes survive Judgment Day? I found it annoying too that they've been re-recorded, although audio obviously exists of them from previous films.<br /><br />I find it rather annoying that the cast changes with each film; maybe the film makers should take a hint when all of their stars refuse to reprise their roles. The characters seem very shallow in comparison to the previous films. We have spent years getting to know them, John Connor particularly, and suddenly he's completely different, a hardened shell of who he used to be. Bale plays the part like he never saw the other movies in the series, which is made all the more obnoxious because he is a celebrated "Method" actor. His involvement seems is a gross miscasting. The most fascinating character is Reese, who is a bit of a mystery anyway, but if a sequel is made (and I hope one isn't), let's hope Reese is the focus.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I decided to rent it first because I wasnt 100% sure about if this movie was any good.<br />In my humble opinion, this didnt hold a candle to the first 2 Terminator movies..it was flat. Completely flat. Like watching a blank TV screen for 2 hours.<br />It lacked any of the ingredients that made the first 2 superior films. Even the 3rd Terminator film was better than this dribble. The film really just dragged for me and didn't have enough plot or story to hold my interest. This was another 2009 movie that spends a lot for explosions but zero on characterization. The characters were unlikeable & just bland to show any real interest. Who knew John Connor would be a boring/bland character as an adult ?<br />Sure there are a few moments with the Terminator robots going after the characters (what was Christian Bale thinking??) but it wasn't much. It was a whole lot of nothing going on. Even the naked "Schwartzenegger" Terminator running around trying to kill Connor wasn't anything special<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be that great a governor but at least the Terminator movies he did had substance, a good story and a director who knew what it takes to make a good science fiction futuristic story with characters to root for a care about. If they make another Terminator film it should be directed by James Cameron in other words.<br />I would only see it if you like the Terminator series & are curious to see this one.<br />They shouldn've really stuck at 2 to be blunt..</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>Well, this week I've watched three recently released action films.  And in my opinion, CGI is just over the top!  Movies just don't look real anymore.  They look just too animated and kind of fake.  I just watched the new Star Trek, G. I. Joe, and this new fourth installment of The Terminator saga.  The action scenes are now more intense, unrealistic, and overwhelming.  There is so much LESS story, human interaction, compassion, and drama, and MORE visual screen consuming effects.  They even had a computer animated Terminator of Arnold Schwarzennegger.  This goes to show that pretty soon, movies won't even need actors anymore.  Computer animators will create new movie stars (heroes and villains).  Technology, again, is removing the human element of upcoming future jobs and physical social interaction.<br /><br />And, about the argument about Blue-Ray over the standard DVD:  I know that Blue Ray offers a better High Definition picture.  So, if I got myself conditioned to watching Hi Def films, I will then see the reduced quality of all my regular DVD's, and I don't want that to happen.  I'm at a level of tolerance that allows me to enjoy all my regular DVD's.  Blue Ray would just start me on a journey of frustration because I have so many good movies on DVD, and I do not want to buy them again.  Even renting Blue Ray will open the door to hindering my appreciation of my own standard DVD's.  Ignorance is bliss for me.  Blissful, and affordable, because I am done buying movies.  I can put my money towards better things these days.  So, you people just keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.  It's only money.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Boy, this got hammered by most critics. But I don't know what the problem was - I know it's pretty grim from start of finish, and it doesn't have the humor of the earlier Terminator flicks. But I thought this was really well done, and that both Christian Bale and especially Sam Worthington did a fine job, the story moved along quickly for a 2-hour movie, and there were enough twists and turns to keep me interested throughout. Besides, how can you not love a movie who's leading babe is named Moon Bloodgood (REAL name, not her character!)I think it was unfairly maligned because of the high budget and Bale's on-set rant; but taken as a straight sci-fi action movie, it's pretty darn good!</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.

The item description above says it is 2.40:1, but before I read that, I thought it was 2.35:1.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent - lot's of surround sounds and sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />The movie lasted about 1 hour and 47 minutes.  I thought it was pretty good, except for the ending, which I thought was incomplete.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a better than average action film, but compared to earlier 3, it has little emotional pitch and the themes - of fate, heroism, and evolution - are not advanced at all - you get no idea that time lines are converging in spite of tampering with time travel devices and actions, the characters are rather set and do nothing unexpected, and Conor is, well, just kind of superhuman as the robots bounces him off walls, etc.  Still, it is fun and the images are quite good at times.  The acting is very strong with Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington.  Oddly, Conor's wife, who Danes so superlatively acted in T3, is a peripheral character in this film and poorly done.<br /><br />Interestingly, I bought this as blu-ray, and I can't say that the picture, with the exception of a few images, is more than marginally better.  There is no unmistakable, quantum improvement over dvds.<br /><br />REcommended. It is worth owning if you like to dissect the nuances of the series.

Worthington balances "butt-kicking" with emotional vulnerability that certainly make his the more memorable character to star Christian Bale's "John Conner."<br /><br />"Star Trek's" Anton Yelchin is also surprisingly good as the young Kyle Reese, managing to downplay his native Russian accent that he purposely "overplayed" in the Trek film.<br /><br />Welcome "appearances" are made by both Linda Hamilton - in the form of a photograph and voiceover - and Arnold himself in a rather computer-generated way.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Way to many people are trashing this movie for no good reason.

Demo Disc potential. FINAL VERDICT: A MUST OWN.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Terminator is like one of those franchises where if there's enough rumors and speculation about a potential sequel in the future, you can bet some screenwriter or producer is like "hey yeah! we can make a new..." and find someone with the interest in doing it. I mean Terminator 1 and 2 are considered, T2 especially, to be classics so any director would most likely snap at the chance in doing another installment even if the fanbase or the story doesn't need it and so we have Terminator Salvation, a film directed by McG who's predominantly known for directing Charlie's Angels on the big screen. So how's the film? It's strangely not...bad? Well I shouldn't say that as there's clear problems with the film right from the get-go whether it's script-related or just the direction in the film,there's so many off elements that it feels like the good stuff has to battle it out with the bad stuff just to save face. It's not an utter travesty like many claimed but the movie just does so much wrong that it's like doing a guitar solo and for every awesome moment, there's just dead notes.<br /><br />The year is 2018 (a year shown in red against a black background which made it strangely hard to read for me) and Judgement Day has happened leaving mankind to fight to survive not only in terms of supplies and shelter but in their war against the machines developed by Skynet. Found wandering the wasteland is Marcus Wright, a former death row inmate now walking a world he's unfamiliar with and with company he's just met, namely Kyle Reese and small mute girl Star. Also in the former world fighting the machines is John Connor, who some believe to be the savior for humanity while others believe he's just nutty (though we strangely don't get that side of the conflict in the movie much). Marcus and John will eventually meet and form an unlikely partnership as they try to take down Skynet.<br /><br />My problems with the story strangely can be best evidenced in the "Maximum Movie Mode", the innovative commentary/picture-in-picture/analysis of the film you might've seen in the "Watchmen" release. Near the end of the film, McG shows us 2 deleted scenes: the first being one uninterrupted take of John Connor delivering a speech prior to the infiltration on Skynet and urging them not to attack. It's a more personal and indeed more upfront Connor and almost humanizes him more, especially when he brings up his mother Sarah, a woman thought crazy now proven to have been right all along and director just took it out. Then there's the 2nd: Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, reaches into his pocket and takes out a photo of Sarah Connor, the familiar one we all know from the end of the first film. This could've had huge symbolic weight to it. Imagine it: you literally hold your future in your hand, that being a woman you fall for, a woman you conceive a child with and a woman you die for protecting her and all this for somebody what...late teens, early 20's? Yet it's taken out. Then there's nods to the old films like the line "I'll be back", which previously brought with it impending doom (first one) or a welcome rescue hero moment (second movie)...here? It's just any old line of dialogue. They even bring back Guns N Roses "You Could Be Mine" for no other reason than to go "hey remember this from T2?" Then there's weird plot elements that are either missing (what happened to owning dogs to warn them of approaching terminators? Or was that later? Or how a gigantic-ass Transformer-sized robot can creep up on a shack in the middle of nowhere. What, was he on his tiptoes?<br /><br />So obviously you can see I don't like the story but how's the action you ask? Quite good actually...for the first bit. Metal Gear stealth robot moment aside, that whole section which culminates in a high-speed car chase on the highway is awesome and the digital effects are better than ever and with an eye that's noticed bad and good CGI over the years since Jurassic Park, this is some fine CGI,though the surprise cameo at the end is incredibly dodgy. But the film kind of loses steam after a character is imprisoned and 2 others captured and even then the action almost feels ordinary. Acting-wise it's...fine with Christian Bale still doing that "smokes 10 packs a day" voice he used for Batman or he just simply whispers while Bryce Dallas Howard is barely given anything to do, ditto for Common who we see has an arc involving a dead brother but that just disappears. One pulling the weight is Sam Worthington, now seemingly the hottest thing in sci-fi thanks to this, "Avatar" and forthcoming "Clash of the Titans" whose accent occasionally wavers but delivers on a good character arc. And boy-in-a-man's-world Anton Yelchin does a serviceable job as Kyle Reese though was oddly better as Chekov in "Star Trek".<br /><br />Ever since commentaries entered the DVD special features, many directors utilized this bonus to comment on the filmmaking process, scene inspiration or working with a certain actor. Now with Bluray, studios are enhancing it a bit further with what's called "Maximum Movie Mode", a sort of commentary hybrid that mixes picture-in-picture showcasing the filming of a certain scene compared to the final image, storyboards and concept art, interviews by the cast and crew and more prominently, a presentation done by the director that points out certain elements on screen or dissects a certain element. While it's certainly innovative and handy, it can also lead to some parts being missed entirely such as the scene where Marcus discovers the truth about himself (the part spoiled in the trailers) and instead of commenting on the concept behind the scene and the discussion it creates, McG talks about the different acting styles of the 2 and just wants the "camera to do the talking". The rest of the special features are functional though they're hardly on the same level of detail as Star Trek's bonus features was. As far as the director's cut is concerned, like another reviewer pointed out, there's some small omissions and some little moments taken out but it isn't a radical re-design of the film so don't expect the same kind of shift that tends to accompany a director's cut.<br /><br />Is Terminator Salvation worth a purchase? Yes and no though I'm sure people will lean towards a no. It has nothing as far as the humanity elements from T2 yet it's way better than Terminator 3 so this is either hopefully a stumbling block in this "reboot" if you will or we're going to suffer 2 more average-but-could-be-better entries. Either way, it's a Bluray showcase, it's a home theater showcase, just not a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>We rented the movie (video on demand) and loved it.<br />We stopped it 45 minutes into the movie to refresh our drinks.....it felt like only 15 minutes had passed.<br />Definitely worth the rental !</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY 3 DISC REVIEW<br /><br />"Terminator Salvation" created high hopes for the salvation of this profitable franchise for the studio as well as for fans of the original films James Cameron made. While I was initially disappointed with the film and the major gaps of logic/storytelling that dogs the film, there are a number of scenes that suggest a much better movie was steamrolled by studio interference, budget cuts and last minute rewriting. T4 had potential buried in it which makes the film all the more disappointing. Still of you set your brain on cruise control and just enjoy the ride it's a mindless diversion although hardly in the same category as T1 or T2 much less the enjoyable but inferior T3.<br /><br />SPOILERS IN MY PLOT SYNPOSIS:<br />Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington in a terrific performance that seemed destined for a better film)decides to donate his body to a Cyberdyne researcher (Helena Bonham Carter in an interesting cameo) after he is executed for murder. He wakes up not in Hell but subjected to hell on Earth in the year 2018. John Connor leads resistence fighters and discovers a weapon that they can use to destroy the machines and is given an order to test it. Wright encounters Connor's father Kyle Reese. When he's captured by Connor (Christian Bale), Marcus discovers he's a cyborg designed to trick find Reese and trick Connor. Marcus convinces Connor to reluctantly agree to partner up with him in rescuing Reese before he's killed.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and sounds pretty darn stunning.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc includes both the original theatrical cut and the first "Director's Cut" (more accurately called the "R" Rated Cut) that McG submitted when the film was to be rated "R" (Warner had McG trim 3 minutes from the film for a much more friendly PG-13 to attract more viewers). Why Warner couldn't have just had a seamless branched version of BOTH films I'm not sure. It would have been far more valuble to allow McG to integrate the 40 minutes of cut footage into the film fleshing out some of the characters. I suspect we'll see that with some sort of "ultimate" edition later down the line. There are some clever tips of the hat to the first two movies, Cameron's "Aliens" and other science fiction films. To me it appeared that this clearly was a labor of love enough if the finished film does not quite measure up.<br /><br />Also has a number of extras including the Maximum Movie Mode which allows McG to appear on screen in a visual commentary track that gives us behind-the-scenes footage, drawings and concepts for the film. We also get a number of brief featurettes that show us how the Rototerminators were created, how Arnie made his "cameo" (it's actually quite clever)and the creation of the post-apocalpytic future we see.<br /><br />A mindless bit of entertainment that fails to live up to the potential of the first two films, TS has promise but fails to deliver on it due to last minute rewrites and studio interference. Still, the film has a strong cast, a number of memorable scenes and visual effects that hint at a much better film that was terminated prior to shooting/release.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>The Terminator story line is getting a little long in the tooth.

While the action sequences are solid and well-delivered, they do not make up for paper-thin character development and flawed story flow. The problem is that, with the exception of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), we simply don't care about any of the characters or the fate of the Resistance. McG hasn't given us much to invest in emotionally and they're little more than minigun fodder. Not having much to work with, the normally excellent Bale is wasted here. This is the shallowest John Connor by far in the series, never being more than a gun-toting, one-dimensional "blunt instrument" of military force, to quote M from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DSNF8C">Casino Royale</a>. There are bits and pieces from previous Terminator movies sprinkled in here, along with other movies like Mad Max, War of the Worlds, and even some elements that resemble the Matrix's post-apocalyptic world, especially the mech designs. It's still entertaining, but Terminator fans could totally dismiss this version and go on with their lives. This is a superfluous summer blockbuster that brings nothing new to the Terminator franchise.<br /><br />The "Director's Cut" isn't much of a director's cut. It only adds 3 minutes of brief Bloodgood boobage and more violence from the ensuing fight, not the 30-40 minutes of deleted scenes that McG has told fans in interviews would be included. The theatrical version is 115 min, the director's cut: a disappointing 118.<br /><br />The story begins in 2003 with the scheduled execution of Marcus, a death-row inmate responsible for the deaths of his brother and two cops, but I had a hard time accepting the charismatic, handsome, contemplative, and remorseful Marcus as a killer. We don't know anything about his background or crime, except the feeling that he didn't intentionally kill these men and doesn't deserve to die. At the insistence of a freakishly bald and chemo'd Cyberdyne researcher, Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), he donates his body to science. As Marcus receives his lethal injection, the scene blurs out to a text crawl about Skynet's awareness and the extermination of most of the human race on Judgment Day. Then film cuts right to 2018, to the middle of an assault on a Skynet research facility by Connor and his men. From there, it's one shoot-out or car chase after another, with little in the way of character development.<br /><br />I get that the main storyline is about second chances and what it means to be human, but these two threads are clumsily handled. McG doesn't seem to know if this is the story of John, Marcus, or Kyle and Star. In here is the cliched perceptive child mute, akin to Newt's character from Aliens, and a stereotypically callous general (Michael Ironside looking a bit like Jack Nicholson) who cared about victory over all else, even at the cost of hundreds of innocent lives. Some "WTF moments" came with the mech designs, such as the towering Terminator/people harvesters (like War of the Wolds meets Matrix mechs), the robotic serpent Hydrobots, and Moto-Terminators (gun-mounted black chaser motorcycles) launched from the legs of the giant mech. Their art direction felt wrong in the Terminator post-apocalyptic universe, and really out of place, which has up until now, been mostly a 1-on-1 engagement of single Terminator vs hero. An essential story element is missing here: the strong antagonist. This time, we get 2 heroes (with John being upstaged by Marcus), and no unstoppable new super-Terminator. I also thought that there were an awful lot of people hanging around for a desolate, war-torn future. The Terminators just aren't very good at detecting people. They need loud noises and fire to be alerted to human presence. It's not very believable for a race of sentient machines with advanced weaponry.<br /><br />As far as Terminator purists are concerned, the Terminator saga ended at 2, as James Cameron famously stated to the world. No one can replace Cameron (since he and Gale Anne Hurd created the original characters, and it was his creative vision that brought them to life), but that doesn't mean that fans of the series have to write off further efforts to extend the franchise. Though entertaining, McG adds nothing new here, and the ending is especially unsatisfying because it feels like he's taken us in a big circle. The character we care about has to die so that a character we don't care about can live. The humans may have won this battle, but the war is far from over and the ending crawl leaves the movie on a really pessimistic and circular tone, talking about fighting Skynets around the world so there's no closure or finality to the story. You can bet there will be a sequel.<br /><br />In summary, this is an fun, action-oriented blast-fest with lots of nice CG and thrilling sequences, but very short on strong characters (except for Marcus). Terminator fans and action film enthusiasts will still enjoy it a lot. Just leave your brain at the door.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />With the exception of a few interesting action scenes, and decent acting by Christian Bale, there's not much new in TERMINATOR SALVATION. The only exception is that we're fully immersed in the post-apocalyptic world and not time-traveling into the past ... which is why it got two stars from me instead of one.<br /><br />I do love Christian Bale's acting chops. He is, to me, the complete action hero. His <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">Dark Knight</a> performance cemented that. But you need more to make a good movie, and Terminator Salvation fails to give us a new (or even interesting) storyline. What's more alarming is that rumors are circulating that a Terminator 5 film is being considered. Oh boy. Perhaps it's time to lay this series to rest. I'm not saying that T5 will be bad, but if the track record for this series remains unchanged, then we won't be in for a highly successful sequel.<br /><br />If you're familiar at all with any of the other three Terminator movies, you're aware of John Connor (played here by Christian Bale), the quintessential hero against the thinking machines; machines that have brought mankind to near extinction. In T4 we stay firmly in the future, fighting the crazed machine-made mankillers (with the exception of a brief stint in the present that rapidly moves us forward) and discovering that Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, AVATAR) - a man from the past awakened in the future - has become a weapon for the machines by being an unawares accomplice in trying to eradicate the human population. When his true identity as a machine is finally revealed, it is as much a surprise to him as to the "humans." With the help of a young and feisty Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVCFK6">Star Trek</a>), Marcus fights his way through the machines and into the safety of the humans. Here we see him battle with the knowledge of his new internal, metallic identity, and throw himself into the war. But who's side is he really on? This is "The Big Question" that the audience is supposed to ponder but, to no one's surprise, the embittered and oft-conflicted anti-hero makes "The Right Choice."<br /><br />In addition to being a clich&eacute;, the movie even reinvents a scene from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a> in which a Terminator gets frozen and tries to break free. Been there. Done that. Let's move on people!<br /><br />The final word I have on this film is that it really doesn't do what it should, which is to show us a great story about characters we've come to know through cinema. But instead, we got a rehashing of old themes with a bit of action eye-candy. Not much to it, really.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>Gads! All the whining!<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" did what it was supposed to do. ENTERTAIN! So the Blu-Ray edition had a director's cut, so the DVD didn't have extras. So all the folk who saw it at the theaters were stupid?<br /><br />"Terminator: Salvation" is first and foremost, a Sci-Fi film (which means that it most likely will play fast and loose with things like physics, technical jargon, weapons with an unlimited supply of ammunition, among others. All three of the previous films of the franchise did the same thing (but it didn't stop any of the grousers from seeing it, anyway).<br /><br />The story is only a snippet of the story of John Connor, meaning the franchise has a looooong way to go yet. I happen to like the "new" terminators (and there were a bunch!) introduced, and the pace was lightning quick, meaning I had to watch certain segments over, to get full effect. Yes, the acting was two-dimensional at times, but this is a Sci-Fi/Action film, and considering Schwartzeneggar's portrayals in the first three films, not unexpected. Still, the film doesn't suffer because of this. The story is still engrossing for those devotees of the franchise.<br /><br />It's funny that with the exception of Christian Bale, the better known actors like Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander were relegated to what were essentially bit parts. It's sad, too, because Jane Alexander is such a wonderful actress! The rest are relative unknowns, with maybe Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog) and Bryce Dallas Howard being notable exceptions. Still, the performances were good.<br /><br />I won't go into specific details of the story, as there are many here who just had to jump on their computer to get their reviews in FAST, so as to lay it bare, thinking they were doing us all a favor. Suffice to say, "Terminator:Salvation" is as good a Sci-Fi/Action film as you are likely to see, until maybe...."Avatar".</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>- The special effects are not as exciting as Terminator 2.<br /><br />- There's no suspense in this movie.

You know why its a "R" rated release now? Inside those three minutes, you will see a actors.. wait for it... Breast!<br /><br />Instant Rate R!.....<br /><br />I didn't like it when I watched it in the theaters. Something there that seemed to nag at me when I walked out at the ending, and I certainly don't like it even more when I found out what was happening behind the scenes to bloat this movie into the 200 Million dollar turkey it turned into! James Cameron spent close to 120 million ('80s/'90s bucks!) to make T2 -which was an Rated R movie no less!- and made a summer blockbuster. Mgee-whiz dumped something equivalent and laid a rotten egg because he couldn't control an actor.<br /><br />Typical hollyweird in action.</p></br><a href="../users/AFMUUJT7J32LN.html">AFMUUJT7J32LN</a><br/><p>I really like the terminator series of movies. What is wrong with the movie? The robots are way too stupid. The people are pretty stupid too.  Thats the main problem. If the director understood warfare tactics only alittle it would move made the movie the best yet.IT would be have more suspense and really more interesting. Id of liked all the people to hide and dart around. That is a major let down.<br /><br />This is suppose to be the future. The people and machines have been battling for awhile now. They should be expert in killing in each other. I would of liked the people to know where to shoot and robots not to miss. It would of been good if they had some kind of technology to trick the robots. An example, Have the people have remote control toys that drive out and fly around. The terminators can not track more then 10 objects at a time. Something clever. IT would of been so much better. It would of gave a glimpse of the future. The humans and machines merging into one.<br /><br />Its kind of stupid that the robots shoot and miss and the people are better shots. The people stupidly run away and get killed.  At this time it would just not be possible to be that stupid.<br /><br /> I can understand the use of firepower to suppress an and stop the enemy. The blind shooting and unlimited firepower of terminators is stupidity. The flying robots could afford to use alot of rounds but the humanoid terminators need to be smarter in using firepower.<br /><br />Then the stupid moments of love and girls are in love and stuff like that. That was pretty disappointing. Id liked some fun and smart alec language. This movie could of had some memorable moments. IT had plenty of opportunity for great banter.<br /><br />Seeing the movie once is enough. Polish up the movie like I say and people will say its the best yet. PLEASE LISTEN IF YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR.<br /><br />The first terminator movie is the best of the series. T2 is ok. T3 is going downhill.Terminator salvation is an improvement but does not meet the high standard of Terminator original.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>T4 isn't as good as the 1st.<br /><br />I had a movie ticket to use, & Paramount wasn't showing Star Trek that night.<br />It was OK.<br /><br />I rate it Z4, as in ZZZZ.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I did not really like Termin. Salvation too much.  Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring.  There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me.  For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>The first couple Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmaker's decision to set the fouth installment in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance.<br /><br />A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad -- Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) -- who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand is Conner's babe Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter, who's somehow hooked up with Skynet.<br /><br />On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that's merely an excuse to string together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, people we neither know nor care about. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. It's simply too much. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfire due to extreme overkill. That's why they call it "overKILL." It's a curious thing but all too true.<br /><br />Be that as it may, there are enough worthwhile elements to give the film 3/5 Stars.<br /><br />- Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until Blair informs him otherwise.<br />- At about the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between Marcus and Blair sharing a brief warm moment in a world gone mad. If the film contained more scenes like this it would have been more effective.<br />- There's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters.<br />- Bryce Dallas Howard has a very uniquely beautiful face. She also has better curves now that she's older. (Would I even be mentioning inconsequential stuff like this if the movie were engrossing?)<br />- There are a some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you love action you'll get it here -- there are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots, Schwarzenegger-bots -- all trying to terminate the protagonists. Yet, strangely, none of the myriad actions sequences rival the ultra-thrilling ones in the previous three films and it's difficult to discern why beyond the reasons already cited.<br /><br />The first two films successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. "Terminator Salvation," on the other hand, fails to ever truly captivate and instead opts for wall-to-wall action, creating dull overkill. That's too bad, but it has it's moments; it's thankfully not as bad as "The Mummy Returns" in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot.<br /><br />The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico.<br /><br />Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings:<br /><br />T1: A+<br />T2: A+<br />T3: B+<br />T4: C</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>I'm guessing this is a contentious films for die-hard fans of the Terminator series and you'll either like it or loathe it. O.K., I'll admit from the start I am fan of the Terminator franchise and although I went to see this with some trepidation after T3, I have to say I came away pleasantly surprised. As a stand alone film (which may the best way to look at it) this is pretty good and as part of the overall series it develops the story well and has something to add to the previous films. It will never be as good as the first two films, but I'm glad to say it's better than T3. Bale is good as John Connor, if a little wooden at times, but the real surprise was Sam Worthington who has the best role in the film. The CGI effects are good, but not overbearing and McG's direction was ok, but a little too jerky for my tastes. You do get some cheesy lines in this film and plenty of nods to the previous films, but nothing too excessive and most produce a wry smile rather than outright groans. The main problem with this film is that you don't care about the characters that much. In the first films you wanted to know what happened next and considered the lives of the main characters, but in this film they are just faces on a screen delivering lines. It's sad but true and the main downfall of this film. If you go expecting your typical Hollywood action movie you'll be fine, just don't expect anything of great substance or anything as good as the first two films and you won't be disappointed. 3.5 stars<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong - this movie isn't terrible. Special effects are good, and the storyline is actually interesting and considerably more engaging than the one found in Terminator 3.<br /><br />But it feels like they're just in it for the money. John Connor meets his (teenaged) father in this film (before Daddy time traveled to the past to help Sarah Connor) and while this was a interesting twist, I felt it was a rather unneccessary story to be told. The part with the cyborg/former prisoner was more interesting, though, and it gives Skynet some more dimensionality than in previous films.<br /><br />All in all, a decent thriller like the third, just don't hold HIGH expectations and you'll probably enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>I thought Christian Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard had zero chemistry, though.  I felt no intimacy between the two of them.  His radio addresses seemed overly repetitive and empty.  I also thought it was odd how much fully functioning base infrastructure and military hardware still existed after J-Day.  I can suspend disbelief surrounding Connor having to rise up through the ranks to some degree.  And I thought the production values and action were excellent.  The opening sequence is breathtaking.  CGI Arnold worked.<br /><br />I still think the Sarah Connor Chronicles was vastly deeper and more thoughtful.  Fans who'd like to see more of TSCCs should know there's an effort underway to get direct-to-bluray or feature films done, possibly even the series brought back after Dollhouse and several other shows have been canceled and Glee is waning into cameo ridiculousness, but you will have to be vocal about it.  So post on the net.  Send letters.  Spread the word.  Don't just rely on a few of the actors and production people to push it through, as it's likely to never happen otherwise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>Terminator Salvation is the weakest of all the Terminator films, with one exception: Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright - he is terrific. He's even better in Avatar. And this year, he stars in Clash Of The Titans. Something to anticipate. Besides Wright, the film is pretty much just a lot of noise and special effects that don't add up to much. Even Christian Bale is the weakest I've seen him.

Bale is sort of waste here as this is a sci-fi action film and he really doesn't get to show his chops. That's not to say I don't appreciate an excellent actor to help make the film more convincing. Terminator Salvation is not the best in the series nor the worst, but if you're in the mood for so good sci-fi fun then this might do the trick. I know it did for me!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Wow, Terminator Salvation is actually a really exciting movie!  I went in already a big fan of the original three Terminator films, but Terminator Salvation really does a fantastic job continuing with the series.<br /><br />It's not a secondrate or cheesy attempt in comparison to the previous three Terminator films either- it's actually really darn good.<br /><br />I admit I mostly like the Terminator films because, well first of all, they are action-packed in a way that's pretty easy to understand and follow.  I simply *enjoy* them.  I know what's going on.  It's not science fiction created in a completely confusing way.  The storyline is what it is- machines are designed to kill humans and take over the world.<br /><br />Secondly, I feel a LOT of tension whenever I think about humans trying to run away from an enormous, dangerous machine created for the sole purpose of destroying anybody that moves.  I can't tell you how many dreams I've had where I was running and hiding as much as I could ONLY for a huge machine to suddenly show up and force me to continue running.  I love it!<br /><br />As for Terminator Salvation, there's some really cool additions to the machine creatures.  I really fell in love with the robot snakes (as I like to call them, hehe).  They are actually huge metal claws that hide in the water.<br /><br />Also, let's not forget the scene out in the desert with that HUGE machine that actually has motorcycles stored as a last resort inside his legs (I kid you not!).  Apparently whenever someone is out of shooting distance for this particular machine, he opens up his legs and sends machines on motorcycles after them.  Awesome!<br /><br />The storyline is typical affair however.  You *know* what to expect.  There's nothing especially hard to grasp about what's taking place.<br /><br />Overall, with todays technology and the way Hollywood delivers action flicks these days, the action scenes involving the robots going ballistic is just incredible and seems more believable now than it did in years past.  The same remains true here.  Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>TERMINATOR SALVATION<br /><br />STARRING: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, Anton Yelchin, Helena Bonham Carter, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Jane Alexander, Michael Ironside and Chris Browning<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: McG<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 21 May 2009<br /><br />It's fair to say that most everyone has a favorite movie franchise they like to geek-out on. As I am no exception, the Terminator series has always been my favorite. Unfortunately for me, I'll have to pretend Terminator Salvation doesn't exist.<br /><br />The futuristic post-apocalyptic side of this story is indeed long over do; but making a Terminator film without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is like making Jaws without a shark. Throw in the facts that James Cameron walked away from the franchise (that he started, I might add), two films ago; and that this is the first installment to be watered-down to a PG - 13 rating; and it seems absurdly pointless. Nevertheless, the film exists anyway.<br /><br />It's been six years since we left John Connor and Kate Brewster in a fall-out shelter at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You would think the look of the Terminator would only improve with time, but you'd be sadly mistaken. For whatever reason, yet again, a character that was visually perfected years ago (1984), has now shown up computer generated.<br /><br />I ask the redundantly un-answered question again, with a breath of desperate annoyance - WHY? Why does Hollywood continuously feel the need to take amazing characters and transform them into computer generated pieces of garbage? George Lucas did it to his very own Yoda, nearly twenty years after he looked more than real in 1980; so why should I even be surprised anymore? Rumor has it there is to be a remake of Spielberg's classic, Jurassic Park. At first I was excited, but will God actually allow them to do the T-Rex with CGI (computer graphic imagery)? Let's hope not.<br /><br />As if using CGI wasn't bad enough; did they really need to make the new Terminators appear to have some sort of physical birth defect to their face? Why are their heads so small? If you haven't seen the film and don't know what I'm talking about, check out the cover of the single disc DVD. If the filmmakers aren't going to take their own movie seriously, how do they expect us to as audience members?<br /><br />The character of John Connor has not once been played by the same actor in any of the four films. This time, Christian Bale gets a shot, and surprisingly was the worst Connor yet. Bale plays Connor with less human emotion than the Terminators have. And I'm not sure if they began shooting a few scenes of this while he was wrapping up with The Dark Knight; but he randomly has the same annoying scratchy voice he had as Batman! What is the deal?<br /><br />The problem with the Terminator movies is that you really need to have an open mind when it comes to the plot. They ask us to buy that John Connor had his father Kyle Reese sent back through time, to save his mother Sara Connor, from a pesky Terminator. If you go with it, it's a lot of fun. If you stop and dwell on it though, it will give you a splitting headache. For the sake of this review, we'll just go with it.<br /><br />In this one, we are in the future nearly the entire time; with the exception of the first few minutes, where we start back in 2003. We meet a new character named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Marcus is on death-row. For dark personal reasons to be revealed later in the film, he volunteers the use of his body to research, for Cyberdynde Systems (the company that generated Skynet - a stream of computers that became self aware and created the Terminators, thus causing Judgment Day).<br /><br />From there, we jump to 2018 in the middle of the nuclear holocaust between what few humans remain alive, and the self aware nightmare Skynet. John Connor is the only survivor in an attack and stumbles across Skynet's hidden secret: a massive assembly line of T-800 Terminators. Schwarzenegger's brand, in case you were wondering.<br /><br />Connor delivers the message to his chain of command. They plan on taking Skynet out, based on data that leads them to believe they can stop the hellish machines, with some sort of signal.<br /><br />Where did this signal come from? Who knows? Why didn't they use this signal to begin with instead of the excessive sending back through time drama? Because this is the third sequel and let's face it, they're reaching. Folks, that's the best explanation I have for you.<br /><br />Something I could not figure out for the life of me, no matter how many times I re-round the DVD; was why the character of Marcus goes skipping across a river like a thrown rock. He falls from a bridge that has been blown up (which looked awesome, by the way), and then sure enough, goes skipping down the river, bouncing like a ragdoll. Aside from bad directing and editing, what could have possibly caused this to happen?<br /><br />Also, in the scene with John Connor and Marcus sharing a conversation in the water, everything seems to be hatched out quite nicely between the two of them when Marcus turns to leave. So why on earth does Connor scream at him angrily, "What are you?" Was this accidently placed in the film out of order? On the day when Christian Bale lost his cool with that sound guy, perhaps?<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of the series or not, Sam Worthington will be the most rewarding element the film has to offer you. By now, you surely know him from Avatar (ironically also generated from the mind of James Cameron). He is a true gift to action-movie fans: a guy who can play the butt-kicking hero, while being able to act extraordinarily well. You won't find too many of those.<br /><br />Had it not tried to be a Terminator film, it may have been a little better. The action is intense and the cinematography is breath-taking. We see some really cool new machines that were done very well with CGI. But this only made me question again, why the Terminators looked so horrible.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film was its ridiculously un-original third act. If you've seen the first two films, then you've already seen the ending to Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />Remember when the T-100 was first frozen and then sent into a vat of hot liquid metal at the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day? Same thing happens to a Terminator in the climax here; only in reverse order. And do you recall in The Terminator, when they had that climatic showdown amidst all of those machines, and Sarah Connor went toe-to-toe with the Terminator; and there was the suspense of the Terminator climbing up the stairs and her having no-where to go? Yeah, well if you don't, it's all here again for you; nearly frame for frame.<br /><br />This may be considered a SPOILER, to some, but I like to think of it as more of a friendly courtesy; to point out that they also CGI'd Arnold's face onto the body of another actor, for a cameo. I guess these filmmakers didn't realize the technology that now exists to digitally reduce wrinkles and make someone look incredibly younger; as used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. They didn't have to make Arnold look like he did in the first two films, either. All they had to do was take off six years; he looked great in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Guys, come on.<br /><br />If I had to guess, they probably did this because they weren't able to get Arnold on-board, with their poor excuse for a script. And of course Arnold would have had to train insanely to get his body back to where it was; as he did for the third film. But if that's the case, then you don't use a shot of Arnold at all, hello! You come up with something else, original. Why do these huge studios and directors insist on settling for crap? Crap may very well be cheaper, but it's not as appealing to the eye.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Not as bad as I was expecting it to be but certainly the worst TERMINATOR movie (yet). SALVATION has got the action, the chases and the explosions but one really couldn't care less about the characters, with the women being the very worst (what was the point of bringing Jane Alexander out of retirement for a bland two minute role?). It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor often, grab his shirt and throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators seem to be too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon. No wonder the sense of excitement has pretty much gone from this series.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version of Terminator Salvation, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.<br /><br />And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale. And you've got to give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn (the guy who played Reese in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9RB9Y">Terminator</a>.<br /><br />But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2:</a> delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.<br /><br />Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I just finished watching this movie with hubby an hour ago for the first time. I never seen or new there was a Terminator 4. I just new about Terminator 1 and 2. When I looked up 1 and 2 to order off of Amazon I found out about 3 and 4. I now have all 4 Terminators. I've been watching each one in order the past few days. And I think Terminator 4 is a good movie. I don't think it is the best Terminator. The 3rd Terminator is the best one, but I enjoyed it just as much as the other three.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>It's more than 25 years since Arnold Schwarzenegger first uttered the words "I'll be back" in Terminator (1984) and in that time there have been three further instalments about the rise of the machines under Skynet and of the mother and her son (Sarah and John Connor) that would become pivotal to mankind's ultimate victory in the end. While the first three Terminator films dealt with time travel and Skynet's attempts to kill John Connor, McG's Terminator Salvation is set during the war that we have only previously had glimpses of.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation begins in 2003 where Dr Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) convinces a Death Row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to donate his body to science. Wright duly obliges and after being given a lethal injection his remains are at the mercy of Dr Kogan. The devastating Judgement Day occurs the following year in 2004 when Skynet is activated and perceives mankind as a threat, opting to wage a horrific war on the world. Our focus quickly switches to 2018 where John Connor (Christian Bale) is part of the Resistance against the machines but is not yet the leader we are familiar with from the prophetic visions in the other films. Connor is revered by many as a future saviour and treated with utmost respect while others question the validity of these claims. Connor's problems in the war mount when the Resistance learns that Skynet are planning to assassinate specific members of the Resistance within a week. While Connor is second on the list, another Resistance member, Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin) is the primary target, being the one later chosen to go back in time to protect Sarah Connor in the 1980s but also to become John Connor's father during that mission. Meanwhile Marcus Wright emerges in 2018 and begins searching for Dr Kogan but along the way he meets Kyle Reece and they join forces. Following Reece's capture by Skynet, Wright heads for a meeting with John Connor to enlist the help of the Resistance in a daring rescue mission. Connor, eager to prevent Reece's death and therefore his own, also volunteers to test a new radio frequency the Resistance believes can shutdown Skynet and its machines and lead to the end of the war.<br /><br />As with the other Terminator films there is potentially the path to some head scratching as the protagonists look to ensure not only John Connor's survival but more importantly that of Kyle Reece. It was interesting having John Connor as just another member of the Resistance and during the film he has the chance to demonstrate his potential as a leader. Connor is somewhat stubborn, abhorrent of the authority and orders of the Resistance leaders whose scepticism of him as mankind's saviour mean they are happy to forsake Kyle Reece once he's been captured by Skynet, despite Connor's pleas. In the end victory is all that matters, but with Connor having been through encounters with terminators prior to Judgement Day he knows how crucial both he and Kyle are. In an interesting twist Kyle is a young rookie in Terminator Salvation, already adept in combat but not yet the battle-hardened soldier he was in Terminator.<br /><br />This is the first time we have been fully immersed into the war between mankind and the machines and inevitably it's effects galore throughout. Only released in 2009 I somehow expected some of these effects to be better and I felt there was too much emphasis on them to carry the film. I can't blame McG too much for this. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was so groundbreaking with its effects that anyone trying to do similar with future incarnations would inevitably struggle. The historical context of the film sees Skynet only just developing the T-800 Terminator that featured so memorably in the first film. Instead we have older models that are still reminiscent of the terminators with a metal skeleton infrastructure but they don't have the same fear factor. While some terminators patrol the barren wasteland looking for human prey, others burn rubber on motorbikes while Skynet's machines scour the world from the sky and even send giant robots to capture humans and take them back to the main headquarters. As fascinating as it was to see the war in detail I was left lamenting the loss of the mystery built up in the first films with those teasing glimpses. Brief shots of Terminators crushing skulls beneath their mechanical feet and opening fire on the Resistance stayed with you long after the film, but Terminator Salvation has undone all that. The original films always seemed to depict the future war to be conducted beneath dark skies which seemed to emphasise the bleakness of the struggle. Terminator Salvation veers between day and night but is most effective during the twilight exchanges. The addition of dialogue used in the previous films and even the odd image just made me nostalgic for the other instalments.<br /><br />While John Connor fights continuous battles against both the machines and his superiors we have the story of Marcus Wright unfolding. After Kyle Reece is captured, Wright befriends a Resistance member Blair (Moon Bloodgood) in what is a weak romance plot. Blair leads Wright to Connor but even before stepping on a mine and revealing the truth of what science has done to him it's already pretty obvious what Marcus Wright's secret is. Both Connor and Wright join forces to storm Skynet and rescue Reece and we do get a welcome introduction from the newly developed T-800 models and in one instance a familiar face returns! In the end an average plot is resolved with a very corny ending as Connor and Wright put their differences aside with one making the ultimate sacrifice for the future. Terminator 3 was quite good but had it not been made I wouldn't have minded, while Terminator Salvation is nearly two hours of a very thin storyline, elaborately decorated with glossy effects.<br /><br />As interesting as it was to see the war between mankind and the machines Terminator Salvation offers very little that is engaging. The absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot be ignored and though Bale and Worthington do try they sadly cannot fill the Austrian's shoes. I'm sure I read three Terminator films were planned depicting the future war so one can only hope Arnie will return in some capacity, otherwise I will approach any further films in this series with some dread.</p></br></body></html>

However due to the almost universal praise of this film by reviewers that I have come to trust, I gave it a try and got the Amazon Video on demand purchase last weekend. I got the Hulk on a rental for the above listed reasons, and quite liked it as well, and was happy I watched it first, to get the tie in of Tony Stark industries...<br /><br />In any case I watched it by myself first because my wife is really not a "Comic Book GUY" but I thought it was so good I asked her to watch it, and surprisingly she enjoyed it as well. So why does a comic book work as a movie? It is an interesting story about a life changing epiphany, and how the things you want, may not be the ones you need or love. It is an interesting story about the futility of bargaining with evil. And how any evil thing we do may come back to bite us in the backside, no matter the motives.<br /><br />Also... Iron man is a fun movie with wonderful CG's a very cool visual experience. So, leave your disbelief at the door, and enjoy this very fun ride of a movie!<br />4 1/2*</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>IRON MAN moved along at a break-neck pace, and for the most part, the plethora of CGI effects were never allowed to clobber some of the first-rate acting by Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow. There was also some extremely funny dialogue, and excellent physical humor by Downey, who for my money, is far less wooden than most of the super heroes buzzing around screendom these days ( with the notable exception of Ron Perlman ). Fun stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>I haven't read any of the comic books of Iron Man, so I came into this as something of a blank slate. I knew, from reading other Marvel comics back in the day, who he was and a little of his origins. I also knew he was an alcoholic, so I couldn't help but snicker when I found out Robert Downey Jr was picked to play Tony Stark. "How perfect," I thought. "Bound not to be much of a stretch for him."<br /><br />Thankfully, he turned out to be far, far better in the role than I had expected! He really owns every single seen he's in, and brings a real sense of confidence and ease to the picture.<br /><br />You know the plot by now: Tony Stark, billionaire weapons designer, is captured by terrorists while on a visit to a place suspiciously similar to Afghanistan. They try to force him to build a new weapon for them, and instead he builds it for himself, emerging in a suit of armor and becoming Iron Man.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, but it works very well. The film succeeds on several levels due largely to the good writing, excellent pacing and wonderful action. But what really brings it home is the great acting on the part of Downey, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow. They make this film what it is.<br /><br />There's really not much else to say here. It's an entertaining, well-done popcorn flick. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a stunning example of what the genre can do and easily the second best super hero film of 2008.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>To consider Comic Book character Movies as a serious genre.  I know some people think there are a lot of them out there and might be getting sick of them...but you have to face it, they are a great source of material.  And they are getting better as a whole.<br /><br />With the release of three superhero movies this summer (Iron Man, Hulk, The Dark Knight), you would think one of them really stunk.  Not so.  And with the release of Watchmen next year, I gaurentee many people will see a much different side of comic book heroes then they have before.  But I digress.  Let's talk Iron Man.<br /><br />Iron Man is an iconic character in the Marvel universe.  Everyone knows his name, partially thanks to Black Sabbath.  But bringing him to the screen could have been really tricky.  Especially when you announce Robert Downey Jr. is going to play Tony Stark, the ambitious, brilliant and self centered billionaire industrialist who becomes the title character.  Downey might seem, to fans, too smarmy for the role.  But thankfully he is a great fan of the character himself and choose not to make any great changes.  For the most part, he plays Stark brilliantly, but adds his own touch as well.  In the comics, Stark is a brilliant playboy, with very little sense of humor.  As for Downey's version, he brings wit and a sense of being aloof.  It's just what the character needed.<br /><br />Plot wise, it's simple.  Stark is captured and forced to build a missile for a terrorist group.  He rebels in his own way; he builds a suit of armor from the pieces in order to escape.  Since he realizes the weapons his company makes are being stolen by or sold to the enemies, he announces a halt on all weapon producing industry.  He starts working on his own project of creating a suit of armor based around his heart supporting energy source.  At first, he just wants to fly.  But then incorporates weapons to take out the terrorist group.<br /><br />Director Jon Favareau deserves a lot of credit for balancing the serious with the brilliant with the humorist on this one.  Iron Man is one of the best Superhero movies ever to be made and Downey makes Stark his most entertaining character to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) military/industrial weapons mogul just finished demonstrating his newest rocket in the Middle East, when he is purloined by ruthless locals with dirty faces and a penchant for power. Who could be behind the dastardly deed? Of course everyone knows it is the last person you would suspect as in any good mystery.<br /><br />Well as luck would have it, in Starks efforts to escape he invents the fundamental technology for, you guessed it, Ironman. In the process he inadvertently gives the world a new weapon. How can he correct his faux pax?<br /><br />In his quest for the answers he solicits the help of his very efficient and devoted assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow.)<br /><br />For those enthralled in the Ironman comics, nothing has changed; except maybe the storyline. O.K the era in which how superhero exists. Well maybe a tad more gratuities sex. O.K. I guess I could go on for a few more paragraphs but you get the picture that we can not rely on the comic book character to be anymore than an inspiration for this movie.<br /><br />For people that are more music orientated, among the popular background songs they included the original theme from the animated series.<br /><br />It has all the formula and characters for today's super hero movies. By not making it a period piece we get to incorporate all the latest technology and social attitudes.<br /><br />Only saw the Blu-Ray version. Had the standard extras and flexibility. I am pretty sure future versions will add more insight or at least more footage.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPPBEQ">The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray</a>]</p></br><a href="../users/A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST.html">A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST</a><br/><p>In summers that are now filled with super heroes vying for cinematic dollars, Iron Man climbs to the top of the mountain, with the human side of the story not being overwhelmed by high-tech gadgetry.<br /><br />With a neat twist to the comic book top gun, Robert Downey Jr. portrays industrialist Tony Stark, who creates the power armor that ultimately becomes the Iron Man power suit while being held captive by terrorists. Stark is assisted in the task by the ill-fated captive Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub). The plot then takes a roller-coaster ride of betrayal, redemption and avenging the death of his fellow captive, while building up to something called the "Avenger Initiative".<br /><br />This character may become a surprising franchise in the crowded marketplace of super heroes in the contemporary settings of war and politics. The 2-disc Blu-ray edition is an outstanding way to start on the adventure or to see it again....for the very first time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>I've heard both good and not so great comments about Iron Man. Let me toss in mine. Tony Stark is a Mcgyverish, haunted James Bond. If you can picture that blend, great, if not, think highly intelligent and handy with whatever is lying around playboy who has a bit of a heart change after facing death and barely cheating it.<br /><br />From a female point of view, the machines, effects and equipment were cool and not overly technical to the point I lost interest. Techie geeks may have issues with the details, so read a techie focused review if you fit that category. The film clipped along at a fast, tense pace. Plenty of humor, a little love, sarcasm and some skin are tossed in.<br /><br />The language is pretty clean. I either missed some or was caught up enough into the story that it didn't grate against my ears. Downey plays an anti/super-hero like he was born to play it. The film felt comic booky with sharp visuals and colors, and should appeal to the lovers of the comic book films. Bridges gets kudos for his portrayal, as well.<br /><br />Sensitive parents may want to take note of the playboy Stark who has a quick, not too subtle romp with a female reporter. Iron Man is not as squeaky clean as the traditional superhero films (think Peter Parker). Violence isn't gory as much as shoot-em-up. Kids in danger might be frightening for some children and a scene in the car with soldiers is sad and might bother some who have soldiers currently serving.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>I've got to be honest, I was skeptical about this film as I wasn't sure the could do this legendary Marvel character justice. The turning point was when my own father (who's around 60) went to the film and liked it! I then said, "I've got to see this one now!"<br /><br />I am glad I did! While it isn't an Oscar winner, it is definitely for action lovers and comic fans! Robert Downey, Jr. definitely had Tony Stark down cold! A selfish industrialist who is forced to change his ways and outlook on life after an attack leaves his body shattered and forces him to create the machine that would become his "costume" for justice as Iron Man.<br /><br />Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow do a great job as their respective characters. I've personally never thought of Paltrow as hot but she did change my mind with the shape she got herself in for this film! HMMM!<br /><br />Back to the movie, this isn't a waste of money. That's for sure! Buy it today!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Iron Man works on many levels--as an action movie with lots of explosions, fights, and great special effects--but also a sophisticated comedy poking fun at the genre--or finally a character driven drama that explores complex and conflicted characters. Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect choice to play bad boy/genius/arms merchant Tony Stark. He could almost be playing himself, except for the arms merchant part. It is great to see Robert Downey Jr. clean and sober after his well publicized bout with drugs. But his checkered past gives him just the edge to play the jaded Stark:<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: [walking in on Stark's robots trying to get him out of the Iron Man suit] What is going on here?<br />Tony Stark: Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: Are those bullet holes?<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />According to an interview, Downey got off the drugs after an epiphany involving a cheeseburger from Burger King. An interesting parallel developed in Iron Man where Tony Stark was captured in a foreign land, then when he escaped and got back on US soil, the first thing he craved was a cheeseburger. Product placement? Perhaps, but what could be more American? Someone said after Elvis died that it was as if there would suddenly be no more cheeseburgers. Of course, Tony Stark and Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) also love pizza from New York. One more thing, there is a really clever reference to the game 'Operation' a generational touchstone familiar to those of Stark's generation, but one that went right over the heads of the young Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow).<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. did a lot of ad libs, and his quick quips and clever comebacks added quite a lot to Iron Man:<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Christine Everheart: Mr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?<br />Hogan: [whispers to Stark] She's cute.<br />Tony Stark: [whispers to Hogan] She's alright?<br />[turns around]<br />Tony Stark: Hi!<br />Christine Everheart: Hi.<br />Tony Stark: Yeah. Okay, go.<br />Christine Everheart: You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?<br />Tony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.<br />Christine Everheart: And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?<br />Tony Stark: That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?<br />Christine Everheart: Brown, actually.<br />Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.<br />Christine Everheart: Rehearse that much?<br />Tony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.<br />Christine Everheart: I can see that.<br />Tony Stark: I'd like to show you firsthand.<br />=================================================<br /><br />Jon Favreau did a great job of directing. Like I said, it works on many levels, much to his credit. He's come a long way since 'Swingers' but I noticed right away his obvious talent. He proved he could do a movie with a small budget, but Wow, look what he can do with a huge budget! This film reminds me a little bit of Transformers, what with the special effects and giant robotic battles, but that film also had compelling human characters to give meaning to all the sound and fury. The teenage traumas and dramas of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) made it all signify something, which was quite a feat, considering it was a movie based on toys. 'Iron Man,' thanks to clever direction by Favreau and the personality of Downey Jr. managed a similar feat. In the tsunami of Super Hero/comic book blockbusters, it really stands out. Favreau really 'got it' that as much as machines and technology fascinate us, it is still the human element that finally connects. In 'Iron Man' there are plenty of examples of machines becoming more human--and vice versa. The whole Tony Stark with a mechanical heart, and then when he puts on the Iron Man suit? Or how about the other way around, when he talks to his machines as if they were people? There is a robotic arm that follows him around, eager to do his bidding. When he chastises it for being over zealous, it droops in despair that is so human and familiar.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, that reminds me. When Tony Stark is working with his machines and computers he is listening to "Institutionalized" by Suicidal Tendencies. Pepper Potts comes in and turns it down and he yells at her as if she were his mom. There is some cool music in 'Iron Man' but you keep waiting to hear the Black Sabbath tunage of the same name. Finally, as the credits roll, we get to hear that fabulous riff. Though just an instrumental version, it sounds fresh and I wondered if it was rerecorded for the film. Whether it is a new or old version, according to the credits, it is performed by Black Sabbath. After holding back and teasing us with it, Jon Favreau finally lets us hear it, and it sounds great.<br /><br />Jon Favreau ...

Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. It is the perfect blend of comedy, and a movie that stays true to the comic. The special effects are great! Jeff Bridges does a great job as the villian and I must say that the bald head looks cool as hell on him. Even Pepper Potts is good. I am not a fan of Paltrow but she is great in this part!<br /><br />GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Robert Downey Jr. doesn't strike the average viewer as superhero material, which is probably why IRON MAN works so magnificently. Based on the Marvel Comics series about industrialist Tony Stark who builds a metallic suit chock full of high-tech gadgetry and dedicates his life to saving the world, IRON MAN is a witty and intelligent action film.<br /><br />Downey is near perfect playing the multibillionaire Stark. One minute he is the Playboy of The Western World a la James Bond. The next minute he rivals Al Pacino's Tony Montana of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AMRJC">Scarface</a> for crassness. He is a workaholic, a hedonist, and an eccentric loner, whose only close relationship is with his secretary, Pepper Potts, played here by Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Beautiful yes, but more so translucently lovely, Ms. Paltrow has an inborn grace that softly overwhelms the viewer. To date, this reviewer has seen that quality of elegance onscreen only in actress Natalie Portman and in Ms. Paltrow's own mother, Blythe Danner. Paltrow's competent but feminine Pepper therefore, is the perfect counterpoint to Downey's brash Iron Man.<br /><br />In this version, Stark is wounded by terrorists. Escaping, he takes on the Iron Man persona and returns to wreak vengeance. Unfortunately, the terrorists are being aided by a business rival of Stark Industries, who builds a similar suit and engages Iron Man in a battle for New York City.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a cut above most Superhero films, a real Summer Movie. Marvel is constantly perfecting their cinematic craft.</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>Yes, I am one of those irritating people who have never read the comic (sorry, but I am simply not a comic reader--more so because I never had the opportunity to become addicted) and had barely heard of Iron Man until I saw the trailor for this very movie back in the day.<br /><br />So... my review will be based simply on my impressions of the movie with no reference to Marvel or comic anything else.  Because I don't know any of that.<br /><br />To begin, this is a fantastic movie.  I don't know enough about movie making to disect the details, but I like to think I can avoid the truly terrible and I do know what I like.  So in my humble opinion this is a truly wonderful movie, having everything I think a truly wonderful movie needs:  good plot, decent effects, great acting, and lots of heart.  Yes, I was honestly touched by this movie.<br /><br />And that is because what truly got me was the theme.  I'm not a fan of war (I don't think anyone truly is) and there was something about the whole fight-for-peace thing that got to me--and this is doubled by the change of heart for lead character Tony Stark.  Sue me, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.<br /><br />So this theme leads into a delightfully action-y storyline that is simple enough to carry itself through without being brain-killing.  The cast is SUPERB. I can't think of anyone else I could get to play a part in this assortment of characters.  And these characters?  A great blend of humanity mixed with a definite "fun" feel.  Wonderful combination.<br /><br />And I can't get over how the screen sizzles when Downey and Paltrow have a scene together. And they never even kiss. That is a testament against all those that think rampant sex is the only way to show passion on the silver screen.<br /><br />Apparently this movie was enough to please someone who does not read comics.  It has the action, romance, and heart to make a quality movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Iron Man" is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen. With sharper dialogue than "Spiderman" 1 and 2 and more irreverent energy than Tim Burton's "Batman" films, which would be its only competition, this is pure fun and a great start to a superhero franchise. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a self-absorbed playboy industrialist and wunderkind of the arms industry. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile, he is kidnapped by a militant faction who insist that he build them one of his new-fangled weapons. Assisted by the Afghani doctor (Shaun Toub) who saved his life, Stark constructs a bullet-proof, firethrowing, flying suit of armor to use in his escape instead. Upon returning to the United States, Stark finds that his priorities have changed. He plans to take Stark Industries in the direction of energy technologies, not weapons, which doesn't sit well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />As the first film in the franchise, "Iron Man" spends a lot of time on Stark's transformation. I never felt like the story was filler in between a bunch of overblown action sequences. The action never lasts very long. This is a good thing. It pushes the pace of the film while avoiding prolonged duels that can become tedious. I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work "mediocre", but I have to admit that "Iron Man" is a triumph. Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen. The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working. Not every actor would have been so amusing talking to himself, but Robert Downey, Jr. makes Tony Stark a lovable reformed rake. The film's only weakness is that Stark's leggy personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) seem to be there only for decoration.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): The only bonus features on the single disc edition are 11 deleted or extended scenes and a publicity spot (1 min) for the upcoming Iron Man animated series. Plus there is a short but sweet Easter Egg (2 min) in which "Iron Man" co-creator Stan Lee talks about Robert Downey Jr. and his cameo appearance in the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish,  French. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>I am not going to rehash the plot of the movie the way WAY TOO MANY reviewers do these days.  Instead I am going to give you all you need to know.  Go watch this film!  It is BY FAR the BEST Marvel presentation to date.  Granted, the original story was "updated" for the current audience, but the major points of the story remain the same. While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days.  That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming).  However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST.  WHY?  Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero.  What  novel concept!  Way to go Marvel and everyone else involved.  You got this one right!  This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>IRON MAN went way beyond my expectations. I was blown away. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible. He seems to get better with each film he makes. He makes Iron Man and true to life hero despite the implausibility of it all. He literally gives this character heart (no pun intended). IRON MAN is a thoroughly entertaining film thanks to a great script and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. I like the way the film makers updated the setting and integrated the origin of Iron Man into the current socio-political situation in the Middle East. I was totally surprised how good this film was. This is one you just have to see. It entertains but works on such an emotional level and  that's what really makes it work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. This will certainly be a movie I pick up when it comes out on Blu-Ray later this year. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>I saw this at a local theater with my co-worker friend on a very rainy day while on a two and a half hour lunch from work (ok, we played hooky).  It was the first show of the first day that this film was released.  I think there were about 30 people in the theater.  I had to wait 2 weeks to let my "giddies" subside enough so that I could write a somewhat coherent review.  I've gotten in the habit of writing in little, categorized chapters.  Here goes;<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!.....<br />  Sorry about that.  I promised myself I would never do that.  I can't seem to help myself.  This might be the most excited I have ever been about a movie since seeing "Star Wars" nearly 32 years ago.  Not even "Lord of the Rings" got me this stoked (and I love that series).  I read an interview with Director, Jon Favreau in the Detroit Free Press.  He described his initial meeting with ILM at their facilities.  In a conference room full of ILM staff and notables he uttered these words; "I hate CGI".  As you would guess they were quite stunned.  It's because of this attitude that Favreau is quickly becoming my favorite Hollywood Director ( "Zathura" was also surprisingly good).  His belief in using practical effects whenever possible is leading to more realistic and believable films than most of his peers.  Of course, his desire to see really cool and smart movies (like most people) does not hurt.  He really has faith in his audience and it pays off tremendously.<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!<br />  Pardon me!!  MAN, 0 for 2!  I'm being completely honest when I say this; by the time Stark invents his first "Iron" suit to break out of his prison, this had already become my favorite live action superhero movie.  That was roughly half way through.  The film could have ended there and I would have been completely satisfied.  But wait, there is so much more.  We spend the next 3rd of the film watching him transform technically and personally, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  We get to laugh at his failures and impulsive behavior, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  He starts to save the world, one person at a time and it is spectacular and... ...it is a joy.  But wait!!  Well, you get the picture.  By the time the final climactic battle comes around, you might think it was unnecessary; however, it is a joy<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!<br />OK!!  Now it's just getting annoying!!  Despite the great visual FX and the outstanding action and nearly perfect story, it is the characters that make this film.  I have never been a huge fan of any of the actors in this film.  I thought they were ok but never was too wowed.  Now, I am having a serious case of man-love for Robert Downey Jr.. I thought his casting as Tony Stark was a good idea before seeing the film.  Now I'm convinced it was pure genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow's secondary role as Pepper Potts (assistant savant) actually stood out.  She brought a huge amount of depth and realism to a fringe character; impressive.  The rest of the characters/actors were equally believable and performed above my expectations.  Again, I think this speaks of masterful direction.<br /><br />THIS FILM RO....<br />That's enough!!  This is the first solo film production from Marvel Entertainment.  HUGE KUDOS!!  They obviously know their core product much better than the Hollywood regulars.  They recently announced their plans through 2011.  In the next few years we will get to see a new and hopefully better Hulk, Captain America, Mighty Thor, more Iron Man and Nick Fury; Agent of SHEILD.  All of these films will be connected in some way and seem to be pointing at a culmination in an "Avengers" film.  If Marvel keep their focus and stick to what worked so brilliantly in "Iron Man" we are all in for a real treat!!<br /><br />A WORD TO PARENTS<br />There is one sex scene in this film.  It's a bit rough (physically speaking). Though no real nudity occurs it might be more than you'd like your kids to see.  Some of the violence could be too intense for younger or sensitive kids<br /><br />Did I mention that THIS FILM ROCKS!?!?!?  Just checking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>If not for my mother being hell bent on seeing this movie on Mother's Day, I probably would've never seen it. I'm not big on superheroes, fighting crime, and action movies (unless it involves speeding cars), but I sat through this movie patiently to please my mother. However, somewhere along the line, it stopped being about my mother, and the movie grabbed my interest. This movie took an interesting spin in an updated way by making the plot about a weapon's expert who originally made products to fight against terrorists, but when he was captured as a war prisoner and forced to make weapons for the terrorists, the expert had to figure out how to escape. His escaping escapade led him to perfect the Iron Man suit (full of humorous scenes) and find out that back in America, there were some sneaky issues going on with his business and personal life around him. I enjoyed the sarcastic comments and dry wit of the Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man character, and of course, Terrence Howard's character was as smooth and charismatic as Howard is in every movie. The very beginning was interesting, then the next 20 minutes were slow, and the movie picked up after that and took off. I'm surprised to say I'd go see it again because I enjoyed the action, plus I loved the costume!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Smashing special effects and action scenes.<br />*Good, straightforward filming style.  A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.<br />*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.<br />*Pretty good, straightforward story.  Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.<br />*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to "Lord of War", but not as serious).<br />*Pretty good characters; pretty good acting.  In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be.  Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero.<br />*Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again!<br />*Great sound effects.<br />*Awesome music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*One or two slow parts.  The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it.  But it's still not too dull at all.<br /><br />Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie.  Much of the action and effects are quite memorable.  The characters are not too shabby.  The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening.  Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing), I would say that it is better.  It's still not extremely deep or profound, but is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than "The Fantastic Four."</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>While I'll admit that I haven't been a fan of Marvel Comics "Iron Man" series, this big screen adaptation of this fan favorite is absolutely sensational. Indeed, it is quite simply the best cinematic adaptation of a comic book character I have seen so far. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best screen performances as billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, whose near-fatal encounter with Afghani terrorists literally leads him towards a new path in life. The supporting cast is just as superb, most notably Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's lovely - and brilliant - assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as Stark's complicated business partner Obediah Stane. Director Jon Favreau does a fine job handling both the intense, often bloody, action sequences and the more introspective scenes featuring Downey and Paltrow. Of course the special effects are absolutely top notch, courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Not being a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, I thought this movie would be bad.  On the contrary.  This is the role that Downey Jr. was born to play!  The movie is not only good it is one of the best action films to come out in years!  Everybody cast was perfect from Terrance Howard as Tony Stark's military friend, to Gwyneth Paltrow as a very sexy version of Pepper Potts (Stark's fawning and overprotective Administrative Assistant).<br /><br />Stark is a wild playboy genius who reminds me of the Mozart character in Amadeus.  After being almost killed by a mine explosion from one of his own company's weapons, Stark becomes a changed man who is more interested in saving the world than creating weapons.  Unfortunately his evil partner and mentor, Obadiah Stane has other ideas.<br /><br />The action is great and Iron Man's suit is very believable.  It is amazing to see Stark dressed by robot helpers and to see how the armor goes on.<br /><br />Warning - Make sure you stay past the end of the credits or you will miss an important few minutes of added story that will set up the movie continuation and also introduce a familiar face.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.<br /><br />To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1NXJ0">Good Night, and Good Luck</a>). I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws.<br /><br />You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB4898">Tideland</a>), I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost.<br /><br />We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNM3">Proof</a>), Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.<br /><br />Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue:<br /><br />Stark: "Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest..."<br /><br />Jimmy: "We can talk, sir."<br /><br />Stark: "Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright."<br /><br />Ramirez: "You intimidate them, sir."<br /><br />Stark: "Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."<br /><br />Ramirez: "I'm an airman."<br /><br />Stark: "Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?"<br /><br />This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.<br /><br />Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily -- and easily -- gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title "blockbuster." And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>There will probably never be a "superhero" movie that will stand the test-of-time as a full-blown movie CLASSIC.  Could there every be a CITIZEN KANE of some guy in a brightly colored costume flying around saving people?  Probably  not.<br /><br />But as POPULAR entertainment, some superhero movies offer more pure entertainment snap and sizzle and fun than others.  SPIDERMAN 2 overcame the silliness of the comic-book genre with some genuinely exciting and eye-popping action sequences.  BATMAN BEGINS created a visual feast of a world, and populated it with actors full of gravitas.  Even HELLBOY won out by bringing a tongue-in-cheek attitude to the whole thing.  But for me (and I'm NOT a real "fan-boy"), IRON MAN is the most well-rounded effort in this genre that I've yet seen.  The highest complement I can think to pay is that when I left the theater, I was ready to see more IRON MAN movies right away.  I  was so thoroughly enjoying myself that I wasn't ready to leave yet.<br /><br />This is due in HUGE part to the splendid performance from Robert Downey Jr.  Certainly the least likely superhero casting since Michael Keaton donned Batman's tight garb...but also perhaps the most inspired.  Downey is convincing as Tony Stark, the brilliant, hedonistic and fabulously wealthy arms manufacturer.  Stark pops with Downey's trademark under his breath, quickly mumbled jabs and bursts of wit.  He's on edge, always on the go.  We can see that his mind is moving a mile a minute...juggling a dozen things at once.  Downey's intelligence is palpable...and so is his devil-may-care-attitude.  It's nearly perfect for Stark.  And the good thing about IRON MAN is that he's really a "weapon" designed and built by a brilliant man...not a super-power brought on by circumstance from a spider bite.<br /><br /> Early in the film, Stark is visiting Afghanistan to show off a new weapon.  He's soon kidnapped and nearly killed by a Taliban-like band of terrorists, who hold him hostage and force him to build a copy of his latest weapon.  Instead, with the help of a fellow prisoner (a doctor who both saves his life and dooms him to a lifetime of heart problems)...Stark brazenly builds an escape mechanism.<br /><br />I really hate to give away more plot...because it's fun to watch the story unwind.  Downey is fully of great energy, and could carry the movie on his own.  Fortunately for us, we've also got Gweneth Paltrow (Stark's unfortunately named assistant Pepper Potts).  Paltrow has been away for a few years raising a family (GREAT for her!), but I'd nearly forgotten that in the right role, she can really be a lot of "saucy" fun.  It's a clich&eacute;d role, but she makes the most of it.  Jeff Bridges is Stark's business-partner (and later nemesis), Obadiah Stane.  (Great name.)  Bridges is shaved bald, but has a big beard...making him a striking figure.  He's smooth, silky and creepy.  Shaun Taub, who was SO good in THE KITE RUNNER, is Stark's fellow prisoner, and he does another masterful job portraying a wise older gentleman with a streak of frisky humor and a big soft spot.  He's a very good character actor, and I hope to see more of him.<br /><br />Two fairly minor quibbles with the film.  1)  Terrance Howard, as Tony's longtime friend and military liaison...is somewhat lost in his role.  To me, it's now been awhile since he gave a performance that did much for me.  He's not fulfilling his early promise.  2)  The film needs a little more action.  This is also a back-handed compliment.  For once, the flying character actually looks fairly convincing...and I wanted to enjoy more pure thrills.  I love the witty banter, the crackling dialogue and I liked the action scenes.  I wanted just a bit more of Iron Man blowing stuff up.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like this movie is stuffy and unexciting...it's just that the action was just so much fun, I actually wanted more  (unlike the action in an overstuffed film like PIRATES 3, for example...where I was craving a break!).<br /><br />So while this movie is ONLY popular entertainment...it's the best kind.  Fun, fast, witty, exciting and well-acted.  And with Robert Downey firmly in charge...it's a far cut above the average.  Absolutely for "non-fans" too!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>As usual, I didn't know a thing about Iron Man before going to see it. I'm one of the many who probably hasn't read the comic books. And as a smart person said when we were sitting in a (very packed) cinema, 95% of the people in the cinema wouldn't have read the comic books either.<br /><br />So what did I know about Iron Man? Well, from the endless photos of Gwyneth Paltrow looking gorgeous, wearing very short skirts, and very high heels, in the press, I guess that she has a small role in it? I didn't see any photos of Robert Downey Jnr promoting the movie, it all seemed to focus on Gwyneth's very long legs.<br /><br />From the impressive beginning, you know that Iron Man is going to work. Although the VFX do feel similar at times to Transformers (done by the same company, Industrial Light & Magic, don't you know), it succeeds where Spiderman 3 spectacularly failed. Not only is Robert perfect for the Tony Stark/Iron Man role, he's cute as well. Hello!<br /><br />The story is basically like this: Tony Stark is CEO of Stark Industries, which produces really hi-tech weapons for the military. After his father's death, Tony inherited the company, and is now a billionaire. He has a fancy house, and a love for women. Who he then gets his assistant to throw out once he's finished with them. When in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test, his convoy is attacked, and he is injured, and taken hostage, but his life is saved by a doctor. When the terrorists force Tony to reproduce the weapon, he builds an impressive suit of armour, and escapes. The suit gets destroyed but is rebuilt in the US, where it gives Tony what else, but superhuman strength. He wants revenge.<br /><br />The special effects & technology used in this movie will absolutely blow you away. I mean, wow! It's absolutely breath taking. I'm not going to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but go, go, go! The action scenes in themselves are unreal. Not only do they work, but they take your breath away.<br /><br />The supporting cast was amazing. Gwyneth played the part for Pepper really well, and even managed to run a little in skyscraper heels. How does she manage it? I can barely walk in heels never mind run. Terrence Howard I have a feeling might get a bigger role hopefully in the next movie, it's certainly hinting that way. Jeff Bridges as the bad guy was unbelievable. The bald head really gave me the creeps, and gave the character an extra something. He's a seriously unlikeable character, and makes you root for Tony even more. And for all those reviewers who have complained that Samuel L Jackson is listed in the cast, but doesn't appear - hello duh??? I'll give you a hint. His scene was not left on the cutting room floor. He does appear. You just have to find the fast forward button. Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get this movie on DVD. Hopefully, it will be two discs (no bare bones DVDs for me!), loaded with extras and I want LOADED!!! I want to know how they did this, how they did that, and I want to see Robert in training. Woohoo. They can go all out with the extras on this DVD so lets hope they do.<br /><br />All I can say is go see this movie. You will not regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Wow. Wow. Talk about a great film forget about the people who say this movie fails. Iron Man the movie is not only a great adaptation of the comic hero but is a great movie in general. It has it all: Special effects, great acting, interesting, realistic characters and a very modern story. Of course this is also attributed to the fact that comic book itself has all these qualities as well. For anyone who wants more of Iron Man after watching the movie, I would highly suggest getting in the comic you won't be disappointed!!!<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br />The comic of course was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck.<br /><br />The film follows the comic book very well (with a couple of alterations such as it taking place in the West Coast instead of the East Coast for example).<br /><br />Backstory: Iron Man or should I say Tony Stark (who in my opinion is one of the most underrated comic book heroes who doesn't quite the same publicity as Bob Kane's Batman) is a wealthy socialite who makes his life building and selling weapons. In a way just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark is a business superhero. Also, unlike Spider-Man, The Hulk and other comic book heroes there isn't a mutant or radioactive, gamma force that gives the hero his power, the power lies in the man's own ability to use his intellect, wits, bravery and judgment to combat the villains and problems he encounters.<br /><br />Tony Stark, Iron Man fights against a corporation/terrorist group known as Ten Rings in Afghanistan. In the comic book, Iron Man has many adventures fighting groups that have profited and used his own weapon systems from Stark Industries.<br /><br />Stark is forced to create a replica of one of his Jericho missiles for the group or face death. Worse yet, Stark having felt a blast that has left shrapnel near his heart MUST wear a chest plate to protect his heart. Yinsen (another prisoner) is the man who has kept Stark alive and  helps create the prototype of Iron Man with him. Yinsen helps Tony get the necessary time to get Iron Man up and running. This leads to an impressive special effects action sequence that led to a lot of clapping and cheering with the audience I saw it with.<br /><br />After this recovery from death and from the words of Yinsen who tells him not to waste his life, Stark has a major epiphany. He no longer wants to make weapons of destruction, he wants to save lives. His business partner Obadiah Stone does not share Stark's new vision and this leads to several dramatic scenes and more superb special effects with Iron Man. I will not spoil what else happens except that it's excellent.<br /><br />Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with Jon Favreau who said he was going to make a movie that would make lovers of the comic book happy but also make a movie simple enough that you didn't have to be an expert in it. What a smart guy he is. Jon is a good director but this was by far his biggest project. I mean Marvel wants to make a franchise of Iron Man just like they did with Spider-Man so a lot was riding on the line and Favreau delivered a home run!!!<br /><br />Speaking of home runs, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was unbelievable I cannot think now in retrospect a better pick for the role. Jeff Bridges was great and Gwyneth Paltrow were also very good.  I'am glad they went with this cast and didn't go for the younger cast which would not have achieved the same results of this very adult oriented comic book hero's life.<br /><br />Again going back to why this movie is so successful: It's not dumb down, we got a moral dilemma with a guy coming to grips over the destruction that comes from his business but is starting to correct it, we got several shots at the corporate culture putting profit ahead of lives, we get a nice romantic storyline here, we  have multidimensional characters, and lastly we got great special effects. On top of all this we have a good attempt to follow the comic book hero.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say if what I say hasn't convinced you that Iron Man is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie in general then there's nothing I can do. However, you will be missing out on one heck of a great movie. Thumbs way up!!!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This movie was everything that I had hoped for. Once again a Marvel<br />comic book hero has made a good movie. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent<br />job of portraying Iron Man(Tony Stark). Tony Stark is the CEO of Stark<br />Industries who manufactures weapons. He is in Afghanistan when his<br />helicopter is blown from the air and he is captured. He is held hostage<br />by al-Quaida terrorists. He is ordered to construct a Jericho missile.<br />On the sly he builds an Iron Man suit. It has weapons and flies at supersonic speeds. He stages a daring escape. He also suffers heart damage during his capture. He comes up with an instrument to help with this condition. He returns to America and fine tunes his invention. He decides to use his invention to fight the forces of evil. Jeff Bridges<br />plays his business mentor and pardner who is trying to take his company away from him. They wind up in a pitched battle. The special effects used by Iron Man are breathtaking and fabulous. This is a must see movie. The<br />scene after the credits adds to the dimension of the movie. A fantastic movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. As for it's Blu-Ray value, it's a must-own. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I try not to get too wrapped up into movies based on comic books (er, graphic novels, excuse moi); I tend to find them too trite and superfluous.  But I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, and Downey's astounding performance in IRON MAN is the stellar exception to my disdain for this action hero genre.  Downey brings a rich authenticity and ebullient eccentricity to every role he plays, and this is certainly the case here; his portrayal of billionaire weapons designer Tony Stark is humorous, compelling, and--yes, even in an over the top super hero flick--believable.  Even rocketing through the skies in his IRON MAN suit Downey's Stark is funny, vulnerable, and pragmatic--in other words, all too human.  While demonstrating a new weapon in the Afghanistan wilderness before assembled Army VIPs he nonchalantly sips his drink while behind him chaos reigns supreme, and it's grand fun to watch.<br /><br />Is the story silly and farfetched?  Yes.  Is it occasionally sophomoric and extreme?  Yes.  Does it require a titanic suspension of disbelief?  Of course, but who cares?  Following a nasty stint as a hostage to some snarling jihadists (and escaping via an iron suit of his own making), Stark disavows the weapons of mass carnage his company has made, and focuses entirely on the technology to replicate the iron suit utilizing state-of-the-art technology.  This places him at odds with longtime business partner Obadiah Stane (played magnificently by Jeff Bridges), who, incidentally, is working on a suit of his own.  And of course this leads at breakneck speed to the ultimate battle of the Iron Men, who create carnage and mayhem in overload volume in downtown LA--all while Stark's personal assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning) looks on in terror and dismay.  The special effects are terrific, the action sequences heartpounding, and the pacing fast and furious; IRON MAN may be based on comic books, but this is one super hero film worth relishing again and again.<br />--D.

Robert Downey Jr. gives an impressive performance (along with the rest of the cast) and the effects are eye-popping. Awesome movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>IRON MAN, I saw it when it first came out, it's a Very Good movie, Robert Downey Jr Nailed it on the head in the role, I don't like that Cheadle replaced his friend in the upcoming Iron man Movie. I figure you don't mess with a good thing. It's funny,fun and lots of Action and seems true to the comic book from my point of view. Hope the next installment is as good as this.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Downey has a great, manic energy about him, and it shines through in this movie. Iron Man one of the hippest, best-written and best-directed superhero movies. Can't wait for Iron Man II.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Several years ago when rumors really began heating up about the possibility of an actual Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, I thought that there would be no way it would really work. Sure, comic book movies were on the rise, and director Sam Raimi had shown to us that a man really can web-sling and wall-crawl, and Bryan Singer proved that super-powered mutants do exist; however, a man in a metal suit flying around still seemed like an awfully daunting task to make us believe. Now, these weren't the first rumors of an Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, they were just the most credible. No, rumors of this project have existed since around 1990, when it was being bounced from studio to studio. Even some Hollywood A-listers, such as Nicolas Cage and Tom Cruise, were being tossed around as possible stars for the vehicle, and director Quentin Tarentino was one of the primary contenders for the directing job (who knows what the movie would have ended up like if any of this had actually come true). However, none of that ever came close to fruition, and the project lay dormant for almost 20 years. That was until director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey, Jr. made the movie into an incredible reality that took the 2008 summer box office by storm.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a rich, powerful, and undeniably brilliant weapons manufacturer, womanizer, and self-centered man who lives the life so many dream of. But that all changes when he finds himself captured by a terrorist organization who want to use him to create weapons solely for their own evil purposes. With his options limited, Stark does the one thing no one ever expected him to do, he becomes a hero. Clad in a metallic suit of his own design, Tony finally knows what his purpose is in life, and as the hero known as "Iron Man" he now has the means by which to protect the people he once put in harm's way.<br /><br />Truth be told, the long wait between those first rumors in the 90's to now, was probably just what the movie needed to become a true success, for several reasons. For starters, the technology necessary to create the obligatory visual effects sequences (of which there are many) involving the metal-clad hero have finally become available, as proven by the smash hit "Transformers". Prior to that film I don't believe some of the visuals achieved in this movie would have been nearly as convincing to audiences. Second, the perfect casting choice was made in the form of Robert Downey, Jr., a talented actor who has had his fair share of troubles (many of which are surprisingly similar to Tony Stark's in the comic books), and one whose star power wasn't great enough that his private life would outshine anything done on the screen. Lastly, Marvel was finally able to create their own movie studio, allowing them full creative control and ensuring that the character and story were as true to the source material as possible. It's for all these reasons listed here, and even some that aren't, that "Iron Man" became such a successful adaptation, and had the film come to fruition sooner, who knows what the outcome would have been.<br /><br />The story for "Iron Man" is two-fold: on one hand the story is a tale of redemption for a man who has lived a life of self-indulgence and freedom from any sort of consequences to his actions; while on the other, it is a fairly faithful to the source material origin story of a new kind of superhero that was born out of one man's sheer will-power to live. As a moviegoer and comic book aficionado I love when an adaptation of one of my heroes comes to life on the big screen as both a faithful representation (or as close as one can get to decades of comic history in only a couple of hours), as well as a really strong film that isn't just a bunch of summer popcorn movie fluff.<br /><br />The screenplay written by the writing teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby ("Children of Men") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway ("Punisher: War Zone") was surprisingly cohesive given the number of hands stirring the pot, so to speak. Generally, when the number of writers goes beyond two, the chances for the film actually working out all that well dwindle significantly; however, "Iron Man" proved to be one of those rare exceptions to the rule. Filled with plenty of humor, action, drama, and a dash of romance, the story for "Iron Man" is easily one of the best origin adaptations for a superhero that I have ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />As great as the story was, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few of the minor problems that crept into the film. These problems aren't in any way overtly distracting from the end result, but they should be addressed all the same. First, from a purely comic geek standpoint the film's location was completely wrong, Stark is based out of New York City (as are most of Marvel's heroes), yet the film takes place predominantly in California. Personally, this alteration to the origin didn't actually bother me, but I know it did some purists, and I can understand why. Second, the attempted twist involving the film's villain was poorly executed, and was easily seen from the very beginning; however, I don't believe the intent was to actually make the primary villain's reveal all that much of a shocker. But there was obviously some attempt made to surprise the audience, and if it actually succeeded it would only be for those not paying close attention. This problem wasn't like the first, where I didn't really care either way, because it did kind of frustrate me that more effort wasn't put into this twist to make it somewhat surprising. Like I said, in the end these problems weren't anything major, but they still existed nonetheless.<br /><br />For this film, fledgling Marvel Studios wisely chose to sort of buck the Hollywood system by going with some truly surprising, yet inspired choices for both cast and crew. Choosing Jon Favreau ("Elf") as the director was a shock to many, and even caused some to wonder just how good this film could actually be. Sure, Favreau proved he could handle family comedy with "Elf", and some of his early work is fairly dramatic, and as far as visual effects goes, he did a decent enough job on "Zathura"; yet, would he have what it takes to tackle something as big as a comic book icon's first major film adaptation? Apparently, the answer was yes, and any questioning of the decision was quickly silenced when Favreau debuted some footage during Comic-Con, much to the vast delight of many a comic geek. The other shocking choice, and arguably the most disputed was that of casting troubled actor Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Even though he hardly seemed the proper fit for the character, Robert perfectly captured the very nature of Tony Stark right down to his physical appearance, quick-wit, and attitude, for all intents and purposes Downey, Jr. was Tony Stark through and through.<br /><br />Comprising the supporting cast of characters, were a group of talented actors and actresses whose hiring weren't nearly as scrutinized. Gwyneth Paltrow ("Shakespeare in Love"), although not my first choice for the role, turned out to be the perfect Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's personal assistant. It was a decidedly different role for Gwyneth who typically does more dramatic work, and even more surprising, while at the same time a very smart move on her part, was that this was the role she chose as her first project post-pregnancy hiatus. Joining her was Jeff Bridges ("Arlington Road") as Obadiah Stane, Tony's mentor and right-hand man in operating the day-to-day activities of Stark Industries. For fans of Jeff's work, many will be surprised by how different he looks as this character, with his shaved head and full beard, Jeff is almost unrecognizable from his appearances in virtually every other movie he's ever made. Rounding out the main supporting cast members is Terrence Howard ("Four Brothers") as James "Rhodey" Rhodes, an Air Force pilot, and close friend to Tony Stark. Terrence was again another terrific choice, and he really played well off of anything Robert Downey, Jr. would throw at him. Their typically light-hearted conversations full of playfully intended put-downs and sarcasm really helped to solidify their close, almost brotherly bond the two men share with one another. All in all, the casting for this film, whether heavily questioned or just unquestionably accepted, couldn't have been any better as each of the cast members delivered top-notch performances.<br /><br />"Iron Man" was one of 2008's biggest blockbusters, second only to "The Dark Knight", and the film rightfully earns its place amongst the best comic book adaptations ever made. Boasting a strong story, visually stunning special effects, brilliant casting decisions, and just some good old fashioned fun, "Iron Man" is not just a comic book blockbuster, but a great movie that audiences will enjoy over and over again. By the way, be sure to watch after the credits for a bonus scene that offers a hint of things to come.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and brief sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>My favorite comic book character has always been Iron Man.  I was excited when I heard that there was going to be an "Iron Man" movie, and even more thrilled when I saw the first trailer.  The movie more than lived up to the hype.  I mean, come on...who wouldn't dream of owning a powerful suit of red/gold armor like this?<br /><br />There are two big reasons why the movie is so well done.  First, there's Jon Favreau.  Favreau is a comic book fan.  I've said for a long time now, that you have to know the comic book character in order to do a good movie.  Richard Donner read Superman comics.  Nolan is a Batman fan.  Sam Raimi has been a Spider-Man fan since he was a kid.  Favreau knows the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man.  And Favreau pulls out all the stops to turn in one of the best superhero movies of all time.  I put this one up there with the two Batman movies, Superman: The Movie, and Spider-Man 2.<br /><br />The second big reason is Robert Downey Jr.  He makes Stark jump off the screen.  Downey Jr. gives Tony Stark all of the suaveness of the multi-billion dollar tycoon as well as his humanity.  Downey Jr. can deliver a line as good as any of the best actors out there.  He's always been that good.  It's a shame that his various "distractions" have prevented him from showing everyone how good he is...until now!  This is Downey Jr.'s "coming back" role.<br /><br />It seems Stark only cares about making money, no matter who it hurts.  And in this case, he's given a rude awakening when he finds out that his company, which manufactures weapons, is killing many people around the world.  It is at this point that he decides to put an end to the company, and Iron Man is created, initially to save his life, but also to help bring his own company down and destroy the weapons that he has created.<br /><br />Enter Obadiah Stane, wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  He's Stark's second-in-command, and there's more going on within Stane's own agenda than meets the eye.  The last thing he wants is to see the company go under.  After all, helped get the company off the ground with Tony Stark's father.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is perfectly cast as Stark's loyal secretary, Pepper Potts.  She seems to be the only one who sees that the change in Tony Stark goes beyond the damage to his heart.  For Pepper Potts, Tony Stark has finally found his heart.  Paltrow plays Pepper Potts without going over-the-top.  She seems to have an attraction for him, but something holds her back, and the scenes with Paltrow and Downey Jr. are very good.<br /><br />Finally, we have Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, James "Rhodey" Rhodes.  While in the comic, Rhodes is a former pilot.  Here, he's an air force colonel with a lot of power within the military.  Howard does a decent job with Rhodes, and who can forget his great line as he's walking by the suit of Iron Man armor, "Next time!"  (If you aren't familiar with the comic, Rhodes takes over the mantle of Iron Man for a time and even eventually becomes "War Machine.")<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely brilliant.  Seeing Iron Man soaring through the skies with his boot jets is a treat.  He looks real slick in that suit of armor, and it's especially enjoyable seeing him go into action for the first time in his red and gold suit.<br /><br />The best superhero movies are those in which the focus is on the character, rather than the superhero.  Tony Stark is a character we like, and Robert Downey Jr. is the reason for bringing him to life on screen. And through Tony Stark, Iron Man works all the more when he's finally on screen.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I wished for the movie, it's that there was a longer climactic battle scene between Iron Man and Iron Monger.  I was also hoping that some of the battle would take place in the sky instead of entirely on the ground.  I wanted Favreau to really show what Iron Man can do.  But something like this is easily overlooked because the movie is so well done.<br /><br />Also, "Iron Man" is just plain fun!  It never takes itself too seriously, nor does it really tread into darker realms like some superhero movies.  But then, Iron Man isn't supposed to be a dark character.  Wearing bright red and gold armor, he represents a hero from way back when; when heroes were knights who wore armor and helped to defend those who couldn't defend themselves.  Stan Lee himself said that this was a big reason why he created a superhero who wears armor.<br /><br />I can't wait to see more of Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. in "Iron Man 2."  I have a strange feeling that it will be even better than this one...and that's saying a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />I first saw the movie in theaters with zero expectations. I never followed the comics, let alone pay any attention to the fact that Robert Downey Jr. was starring in the lead role. Thank goodness that happened, because I was blown away by the end. The whole guilt and redemption angle on the character of Tony Stark struck a very deep resonance with me, as I'm a big fan of "comeback" stories where the protagonist falls so far off his high horse, only to realize his mistakes, then use those events as a learning tool and lead himself to do greater good. Nowadays, it's hard to see the good in most people because of how lost we are in the desires and routine ineptitudes of society. More often than not, our lives revolve around either money, sex, or some other kind of self-indulgence. Granted, it's not a bad thing to wanna' be happy, but I thought this particular story put a certain kind of perspective on the corporate and war profiteering elements that exist in today's world. And what better an example of how to explore the truth and consequences of this by having a billionaire weapons manufacturer have a a change in character and try to make a difference from the heart instead of the wallet? I really enjoyed the movie's plot and characters from beginning to end. Downey Jr. plays Stark down to a T, and the supporting cast is fun to watch from Pepper to Rhodie (too bad Howard won't be back, though), even to Jarvis. If anything, my only problem is the lack in depth of a true supervillain. While Jeff Bridges does a great job as Obidiah Stane, the movie iss missing that extra sense of ambition that really separates the ideals of most bad guys. As a setup movie, however (for the supposed trilogy), I rank this in the upper echelon along Batman Begins as one of my favorites. And if history has dictated anything, it's that the 2nd act of a trilogy has always greatly outdone its predecessor. Can't wait till the next one comes out.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Colors are very vibrant from skin tones to backgrounds to all the shiny versions of the Iron Man suits. Paramount has done a spectacular job on the transfer, making this instant demo material for friends, family, or business alike. In particular, the cave break and liberation of Gulmira (including the jet chase) scenes are worth watching over and over again just for the flashy lights and sleek cinematography. Black levels handle extremely well during cave, night, and other dimly-lit scenes keeping most, if not all, kinds of object detail looking crisp and sharp. Contrast is equally suiting and really helps the overall photography adding a complimentary sense of depth and dimensionality between people, objects, and backgrounds. The only slight problem one might have is with the darker cave scene. They used a different camera for those shots resulting in a slightly noisier presentation, which is what happens on a normal basis with darker shots anyway, but that's about the only possible imperfection and may not even effect your own personal score if you're not being picky. But other than that, show off your Blu-ray setup with this movie.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Accompanying the flawless video transfer is an equally flawless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track. Ramin Djwadi's score, while a tad underwhelming composition-wise, is displaced well-enough to help create just the right amount of immersion for each scene, and dialogue is clear through the center channel. Directionality and separation are especially notable during scenes of gunfire or jet-propelled flight. Again, refer to the cave break and liberation of Gulmira with the jet chase to hear what I'm talking about. Maybe even thrown in the Mk. II's test flight for good measure. LFEs are astounding in terms of bass depth and other low frequency presence. I personally like to use Stark's takeoff to Gulmira and jump into supersonic speed during his run from the F-22s as go-to showcase material. So make sure your theater system has all the right settings, then crank that baby up to wow your guests.<br /><br />Extras - 5.0<br /><br />Thanks in big part to the hours of extras on both the feature and additional 25GB disc, I actually learned quite a bit of informative things about the Iron Man franchise as a whole and the respectable hard work that went into producing this summer blockbuster. Ironically enough, I now see Iron Man as a sort of Marvel parallel to DC's Batman, only with less of the dark psychology and grimness involved with Bruce Wayne's tragic childhood. On top of being presented completely in HD, the special features are loads of fun to watch in themselves, and I don't think I've ever been as thoroughly entertained by just the making of portion. If you like the movie, you'll really like these extras.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />For a setup of an eventual trilogy, I rank this as the top tier with Batman Begins as the other best of its kind. The characters and script are highly entertaining, and the story has just the right amount of depth to bring about my empathy. Throw in the demo quality video and audio and a largely informative array of special features, and you've got yourself one of the years best Blu-ray packages. A must own for comic book fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>This film has a little of everything for everyone.  Great writing, great actors and wonderful CGI.  I was never a comic book fan, but in the past decade Marvel has lured me into seeing what the big fascination has been all about.  When one franchise begins to falter (Spider Man) a new one comes onto the scene and takes everyone's breath away.  I only had a few gripes-one Downey's 1940's fast talking/ scarastic delivery some times comes off muffled and who's big idea was it to have such small font on the scenes where translation was needed?  It reminded me of the small print in shady contracts.  Do they really expect people to be able to read it?<br />Other than that-it is great entertainment and I'm looking forward to the next installment to the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>The first disc features 11 deleted and extended scenes. There's more of the opening ambush with Tony Stark being more proactive. We also see more footage of Rhodes and it quickly becomes apparent that he was the character with the most scenes cut from the film. We also see Tony and Pepper Potts attend another party.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the impressive "I Am Iron Man," a 108 minute making of documentary that can be viewed in seven segments or altogether, taking us through various aspects of the production. For example, we are taken step-by-step through the construction of the Iron Man armor with Robert Downey Jr. cracking jokes while being fitted for it. It's amazing how much of the suit is practical and looks really good in person. This is due in large part to the genius of the late-great Stan Winston and his company. Also included is plenty of soundstage footage of scenes being filmed.<br /><br />"The Invincible Iron Man" is a six-part documentary on the comic book, tracing the history of the character. Stan Lee says that he modeled Stark after Howard Hughes, for the most part. He also mentions that he was never fully satisfied with the look of the armor - hence its many changes over the years. This doc also covers various key characters and storylines in excellent detail with several people who worked on the title over the years talking about their contribution to the mythos. This is a very well done overview of the comic book.<br /><br />"Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man" examines the CGI work that went into realizing Iron Man's powers, like flying, his repulsors, and so on. Director Jon Favreau says that he likes to use practical effects whenever possible, which is wonderfully refreshing to hear, and in this film he mixed the practical with CGI.<br /><br />"Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test." Incredibly, the actor had to do a screen test because the studio deemed him a risky proposition and this footage shows that he had a handle on the character very early on.<br /><br />"The Actor's Process" features fascinating footage of Jeff Bridges and Downey rehearsing a scene with Favreau. It's great to see these guys at work and offers insight into how they put together a scene from the film from an acting point-of-view.<br /><br />"The Onion's Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full-Length Film" is a funny satire where a newscaster "breaks" a story of how the Iron Man trailer will be made into a film that pokes fun at the rabid nature of the hardcore fanbase of the character.<br /><br />Finally, there are "Galleries," featuring concept art, technology stills, behind-the-scenes photographs, and poster art.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Once again I begin with a warning that you need to sit through the really, really long credits for what might be the best cameo appearance since Sean Connery showed up as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T6M">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</a>."  That was the last time I remember people really applauding a cameo in a film, although I should point out that everybody left at the end of the first showing of "Iron Man" were True Believers who instantly recognized the actor and the character as soon as the first words were out of their mouth.  Ironically, the cameo by Stan Lee in the film seemed to go right by the audience, because there was no reaction to what was a pretty good gag (it happens when Stark shows up at the big party).<br /><br />Now that I have that bit of business out of the way, let me say that "Iron Man" is the best comic book superhero movie I have seen since "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2</a>."  I would say that the latter is better, mainly on the strength of Alfred Molina's wonderful performance as the villain and the great fight sequences between Spidey and Doc Ock that take place on the vertical as well as the horizontal axis, but "Iron Man" might be the more solid film (i.e., lower top but higher bottom).  There was a point when the number of comic books that Marvel was putting out exploded (e.g., the New Universe titles) and I dispaired over all of the idiotic cloning with Spider-Man and was down to reading only two Marvel titles: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785107576">Daredevil</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078512764X">Iron Man</a>.  This was back when Frank Miller was doing DD and Tony Stark was a full-blown alcoholic.  Daredevil might have been cooler, but as Iron Man, Stark always had the advantage that he was a regular guy, by which I mean that he did not have any superpowers.  He was just a really smart guy who could invent the gadgets that would make Iron Man work (eat your heart out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000294TC4">Ned Kelly</a>).  That is certainly what we get with director Jon Favreau's pre-summer blockbuster, with the added angst of Stark growing a conscience and using his armored alter-ego to help restore balance to his own little corner of the universe at war.<br /><br />Ultimately the best parts of the movie are the opening act, in which Stark is captured (Afghanistan today instead of Vietnam of the Sixties)and has to built the metallic grey Tin Woodsman on roids prototype armor, and the second act, where he works out the new suit.  This movie has two or three of the best violent slapstick gags you have ever seen in one of these movies, which engenders some of the biggest laughs.  The origin of the character is fairly faithful, for being updated, to what happened in "Tales of Suspense" #39, which was plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by his brother Larry Leiber, drawn by Don Heck, with a cover art by Jack Kirby (who created the character's original look, although it was Steve Ditko who first drew the red and gold armored version).  There certainly is more than a touch of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a>" to the way Stark dons the Iron Man armor, but as much as I would give credit to the specific effects in this movie, attention must be paid to the screenwriting teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I">Children of Men</a>") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway.  For all of the humor in the script, there is a strong thread of serious stuff extending throughout this film.<br /><br />As Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., a superb actor whose skills in the verbal repartee department were honed on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V8952K">Ally McBeal</a>," may well be the most glib superhero we have seen on the silver screen.  Certainly he is more glib than we would every have suspected Stark to be, but of course Downey's personal life clearly echoes the character ark of his character (it is that resonance as well as his undeniable talents that make him perfect for the role).  As Pepper Potts, Gwenyth Paltrow is more of a romantic  figure for Stark than she was in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785118608">comic book</a>, especially since Happy Hogan (director Favreau) has been relegated to a minor role as Stark's bodyguard to make room for the character of Jim Rhodes.  However, the point is not so much potential romance as it is the fact that with Paltrow we have an actress who can go toe to toe with Downey in quick paced nuanced conversation (although many will think that Downey's best scenes are with his robotic assistant with the fire extinguisher).  Besides, by have Rhodes instead of Hogan we not only get another acting talent on the level of the Downey and Paltrow with Terrence Howard, but as fans of the comic book know (and the movie acknowledges), one day down the road Jim is going to get to be in the red and gold suit.<br /><br />Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is set up as a godfather to Tony Stark and a regent to Stark Industries instead of being a rival munitions magnate, which provides a bit of Oedipal conflict to the proceedings and compels the big fight at the end to be with Iron Monger (I was actually hoping for Titanium Man even though I was half expecting the Mandarian).  But most people who come to see this movie are not going to know any of this stuff, and even most of the comic book fans who will end up making repeat trips to the theater to see this one are not going to be old enough to remember the original Virginia "Pepper" Potts who ended up with Happy Hogan versus the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785121382">The Ultimates</a>" version of the character.  All that really matters is that the cast and characters are a perfect mesh and the people who put this movie together should be thinking not just about a sequel but about a series.  With this launching platform, Iron Man could well replace Superman in the Big Three of comic book superheroes in the movies along with Spider-Man and Batman.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Seriously, thanks god for Robert Downey Jr., the actor was brilliant in the movie, after watching the movie i couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the role of Tony stark, the guys was simply brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself. It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now as Iron Man..<br /><br />Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely and brought Comic successfully back to life. "Iron Man" has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means. Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon Favreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the flavorless "DareDevil" from 2003.<br /><br />So "Iron Man" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. This is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies, it's great; for those who enjoy a good message movie, it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true; and as a summer film, it's large and captivating, never letting the viewer go till the credits (and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with 5 stars for this film, it's a very strong 4. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes "Summer" films.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Please Note: Opinions are like...well you know how the saying goes. If you have one, write a review the voting system is for those who HAVEN'T purchased the item and whether or not the review was helpful in that decision.<br /><br />"Titanium Alloy Man" just doesn't have the same ring to it as "Iron Man". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is "The Merchant of Death" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark almost literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of iron that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by becoming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. Heck, even the DVD is one of the top notch ones I've seen in recent years. As for the issue with TrueHD sound--Paramount has fixed that issue remanufacturing the BD and still meeting their release date.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary "I AM Iron Man" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette "Invincible Iron Man" that gives us an idea about the development of the characterwith interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, "Wired" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film. "hall of Armor" takes us into the development of the "suits".<br /><br />Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of "The Dark Knight" (ironic considering that "Iron Man" is really Marvel's version of "Batman" except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the "Spider-Man" films directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />The nice thing about "Iron Man" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).<br /><br />Marvel's first in-house production "Iron Man" demonstrates that the comic book company turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or BD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third "Iron Man" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of "The Incredible Hulk".<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 9/30/08 FYI, if  you are having problems playing your disc select "No" if a menu comes up asking if you want to turn on BD Live or change the options in your settings for your PS3. I didn't have this problem however since I elected NOT to watch it on my PS3 but on my stand alone Blu-ray player.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Iron-Man doesn't mess it up when it could have been easy to do so and Robert Downey Jr is on top form in a story about him being a multi-billionaire weapons tycoon who finds his products used against Americans and so develops an Iron-Man suit to combat Muslim terrorists that kidnapped him, killed his friend and tried to use his technology in ways that he didn't foresee. Things go from bad to worse when he finds his company has been double-dealing and business partners have turned bad.<br /><br />In short Iron-Man is Robocop for young adults but Downey Jr actually puts on a worthwhile performance that overshadows when he puts on the suit. Even with the suit on the flying through the sky moments are well worth the wait and while the fights and finale are kept on a somewhat small scale they are still good.<br /><br />Overall Iron-Man delivers on an interesting balance of action and content. If you like quality superhero movies then you can't go wrong with this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>I could already tell this movie would be a lot of fun from the trailer, but I was surprised just how good it really was.  This could easily be one of my favourite Marvel Comics movies, better even than Spiderman or X-Men (forget Daredevil or Electra or Punisher or Ghost Rider).  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect casting choice, a la Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  Marvel movies are usually well casted anyway, with the exception of Toby Maguire as Spiderman (he's popular, but I'm of the opinion that James Franco would have been better as the image of Peter Parker from the comics) and Ben Affleck as Daredevil.  Jon Favreau, the brilliant writer of Swingers, clearly has as much fun with the character as Sam Raimi has with Spiderman, and Tony Stark is very well fleshed-out and real.  Comparisons would abound with Batman - both were born rich, have reputations as playboys, lost their parents, head giant corporations, have no super powers of their own but are good at stocking up on useful gadgets -  but this film is better than any of the Batman flicks for my money (keeping in mind I haven't seen the latest one).  Great background story of how Stark became Iron Man, and also a fantastic technology sequence where Stark is perfecting his machine.  The battle at the end is not bad, although not as cool as the fight scenes in Matrix 2, and the movie has the best ending/closing line of any movie in recent memory.  I also loved the use of the song "Iron Man" by Black Sabbath in the closing credits of the film, spot on.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>I must say that when I was growing up I did not read comic books.  I am still unsure if the Ironman movie is based on some Ironman comic book or not, but if it is, it really does not matter.  This is why.  The cast in this film:  Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges (who you will barely recognise), Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are amazing.  In the first 20 minutes I almost thought "where can this film possibly go from here?", but then the plot was so well thought out that you will want to see what are all these amazing characters up to.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the Ironman, a gifted scientist who inherits his father's weapons making corporation only to learn that it is time to grow up and take a responsibility for the damage that weapons can do not just to the rest of the world but also to the americans themselves.  He is indulgent, overconfident, rich but stilll likable.  A kind of a bad boy only Downey Jr. can profile.  Several comic parts are so memorable because Downey Jr. is such a gifted actor that no matter how much bad press he can get about his personal conduct in his personal life we still love him, adore his talent and those dark piercing eyes of his.  I actuallly really like this action movie where the main character does not have to be another muscle but can charm us with his sense of humor, genuine smartness and charisma.  Robert Downey Jr. is all of that.  Enjoy! Oh, and if there is another Ironman movie coming out, I will want to be the first one to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Director Jon Favreau's "Iron Man" may lack the epic stature of "The Dark Knight," but it's more entertaining. Thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s inspired brilliance, this Marvel adaptation captures the fun and wonderment missing in the "Spider-Man" franchise. Favreau maintains the ideal balance of humor and action without resorting to CGI overkill. Downey  receives excellent support from Gwyneth Paltrow and classic villainy from Jeff Bridges. "Iron Man" is the rare comic-book movie that transcends its source material.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Iron Man" entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial performance of Robert Downey Jr.  While his song "Your Move" from the 4-year old CD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064AFK0">The Futurist</a> is just now in my personal top ten sounding like a new record from Yes, I picked up a copy of "Iron Man" for my rainy day video shelf.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for "Chaplin" and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TV's "Ally McBeal."  As weapons dealer Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a conscience.  I understood why Jeff Bridges' character Obadiah Stane would want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasn't altogether clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker.  Perhaps it was jealousy.  The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better.  There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGOH">Shakespeare in Love</a>.  Terrence Howard has been a favorite actor of mine since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a> and his Oscar-nominated role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUWU">Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning "Crash" as the Iranian store clerk.  In captivity, Stark meets Toub's Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony.  Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent.  John Favreau who is currently acting in "Four Christmases" directs the film and keeps the pace breakneck.  This is a great action/special effects picture.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>My review is on the movie itself, rather than the DVD itself. I borrowed from a friend to watch it, and I was NOT disappointed. While I don't collect Iron Man comic books, I do know of the story. While parts had to be changed for the movie, it was not at all disappointing.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie greatly and its characters and story development (and the acting by Robert Downey Jr. was awesome!). Even a die-hard Iron Man fan should not be disappointed in this movie.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was when he flew to the Middle East in his new suit, and dealt with the terrorists while saving the civilians, and then leaving the leader of the terrorists to the villagers to do with what they wanted. Sweet justice, indeed!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>After sitting through some rather lackluster Marvel adaptations, such as the overrated "Spider-man" and "X-Men" films, I sat to watch "Iron Man" with cautious optimism. And it proved to be worthwhile. This is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a Marvel comic book character to date. Dispensing with over-serious storylines, such as in "Spider-man 2" and "The Hulk," the story never takes itself too seriously, bringing the fun and excitement back to the superhero movie. The storytelling, visual effects and action sequence all deliver.<br />And the performances? What can I say? Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark, the playboy/weapons seller turned superhero. His performance is truly believable and clever, and gives this superhero movie its heart. The supporting cast, including Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, plus a cameo appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, add to the film's richness. After what seemed like an eternity, a Marvel superhero film truly delivers! If you enjoy superhero films, then "Iron Man" will blow you away!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>I've been a big fan of the Iron Man comic book series for such a long time and from the "Tales of Suspense" comic books, as a young child, I would always be into the "Avengers" and even be this happy child with his "Secret Wars" Iron Man toy.<br /><br />Years before "IRON MAN" became a movie, I've always pictured Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  He had the look and even back then with Downey Jr.'s personal life, there is some instances that mirror Tony Stark's challenges in the comic books.  So, suffice to say that I was quite happy with him being cast for the film.<br /><br />As for the the film, I had no doubt in my mind that "IRON MAN" would be a blockbuster hit in the Summer but I purposely waited for it to come out on DVD, so I can watch it on my own personal home theater and watch it with no distractions.<br /><br />This film focuses on Tony Stark, the millionaire who runs Stark Industries which creates weapons for the military but while on a meeting to the Middle East, Stark's military escort are gun down and eventually the suave millionaire gets caught in a blast (from weapons created by his company), next thing you know, Stark is being operated on and being held by prisoner by terrorists.<br /><br />While under captivity, Stark creates his first Iron Man uniform and uses it to escape his captors.  Upon returning back to America, Stark's perspective of the world and his company has changed.  Also, his goal to develop a more technologically advanced mobile suit armor becomes his obsession and leads him to take on the terrorist who have been using his companies weapons for evil but most of all prepare for the lies and deceptions that await him.<br /><br />AUDIO & VIDEO:<br /><br />The version that I am reviewing is the regular widescreen DVD, not the awesome Blu-ray version packed with a lot of extras.  But the audio for this version is Dolby Digital 5.1 and video is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This "IRON MAN" DVD version features deleted and extended scenes.  Deleted scenes that I'm glad the director chose to eliminate from the final cut of the film.<br /><br />There are three versions of this release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  This version is the single disc version, the double disc version features many featurettes including a 108-minute documentary, a six part documentary and more.  The Blu-ray version has received almost perfect stars for its amount of content and BD-Live.  So, if you have a Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray version of "IRON MAN" is what is recommended.<br /><br />After watching it, I definitely enjoyed the film but like any superhero film, as the first film always focuses on the origin, this series will be judged on its continuing storylines.  Similar to like the "X-Men", "Spider-Man" and the "Fantastic Four" films, there is always the "origin" that not many people are too enthusiastic about and want to see more battles.<br /><br />Fortunately, "Iron Man"did offer quite a bit of kick as battles but I loved the scene where Iron Man just rescues a village being terrorized by the enemies.<br /><br />Again, Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as Tony Star, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane was pretty good.  As for Terrence Howard's James Rhodes... it was OK but I was expecting more of a no-nonsense Rhodes.  But with Don Cheadle replacing Howard for the next film, I hope that Cheadle can bring the attitude especially if he's going to be War Machine.<br /><br />But definitely enjoyed this film.  With "IRON MAN", unlike any other top tier Marvel superheroes, Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of inner demons to contend with and is such a complex character.  For the comic series, the alcoholism consumed him and I'm curious to see if it happens in the films.  It will definitely be interesting to see how his character is explored and what new Iron Man outfit we will see him sporting next Silver Centurion Iron Man?  Maybe even see some Hulkbuster or Thorbuster?  Who knows.  And of course, there is James Rhodes as War Machine and I look forward in seeing that character come to play in the films.<br /><br />But all in all, "IRON MAN" was an enjoyable film for the first version.  A lot of action, special effects but definitely would like to see where they go with the characters in the next upcoming film.<br /><br />All in all, a very cool movie and enjoyed it so much, now I'm going to have to pick up the Blu-ray ultimate edition next!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I was totally over the moon with the set. The first I hear of this movie was an internet promo with the very cleaned up audio from BLACK SABBATH's song the same title, and  some basic visuals. And so, I waited until the film came along, but due to circumstances beyond my control I could not get to the theatre to see it, and wow did I want to see it in the Cinema.<br />Anyways, the film is just totally fiery from start to surprise finish. After reading Ironman in the 70s, he has appeared as everything I wanted. The re-writes in recent years will no doubt try to cheat me of that from what I can gather, but this is something that a long term fan can really get into.<br />The DVD even has some really cool, IPOD style interfaces. The Computers that Stark uses are just ultra cool, and the virtual generation gear is amazing.<br />For the first time ever, I totally agree with all the deletes they made on the movie. This one has no commentary, unfortunately, and I think that they could have done one quite easily for total entertainment value.The Ironman Suits from the basic, made from Necessity, to the ones done through Technology, all have the iconic Ironman Appeal.This is one DVD where only the double set will suffice. The extras tell the story that the commentary does not.John Favreau has crafted another piece together with a team of people who each do their own superb thing. It was also great to see a bit of video of Stan Winston, even though it was his studio and not him, himself who did the work. The Cover is very cool too, since the outer cardboard image comes off to reveal the man underneath, truly a well thought out package.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>It is very entertaining, above all.

It is a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>A little worried about Iron Man being just another so-so Marvel movie, such as Fantastic Four? Well don't be. Actually you can stop reading my review now if you want and get up and go watch this movie.<br /><br />If you're still here (oh ye of little faith), then I'll try and help you with that tendril of doubt still holding you to your computer chair preventing you to get up and spend the 300 dollars it costs to go see a movie now. 600 if you are taking a date.<br /><br />Let me first start off with Rob Downey. I for one was hesitant with him being the man who is playing Tony Stark (Iron Man). I rolled my eyes the first time I saw his name a year or so ago when I found out about this movie being made. Even when I saw the first pics for it. But let me tell you right now... the man IS Tony Stark. He's got this role down. I haven't seen this good of a Downey movie since `Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and `Wonder Boys'. At first I thought he was a total jerk at the beginning, but then realized it's just his way of being funny, and it's absolutely fantastic. Through the whole movie Rob will have you laughing quite a bit. He's not only funny, but he's also quite laid back with his genius. He doesn't bash your face in with how smart he is. To show you how smart he is the film shows a bunch of scientists trying to create something that just isn't possible with today's technology. Though Tony Stark was able to do it an Afghan Cave with spare parts from junk.<br /><br />The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore (can't think of the word for this... sorry). While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story (I promise I haven't ruined anything yet, I told you mostly what you can see in the trailers), lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.<br /><br />The special effects were used just right. I honestly didn't think they would be able to make Iron Man look that cool or move that cool. Well let me just say, have no fear, because he rocks. From the classic Iron Man suit to the new. The old Iron Man walks just like you think he should, a bulky machine. The new, well, lets just say you would almost not think he's wearing a suit it's so human like, but just enough machine movement to know it's not completely fake looking. I don't know how to explain it, but it looked great.<br /><br />Also the action scenes were great. I think one of the biggest reasons why they were so good is that they were used sparingly. The movie isn't action packed but has just enough to not tick you off that there wasn't enough and also not to many to over do it. It was just right. Which in turn helps the story out, because it helped give us that character development that a lot of people complain about in these Marvel movies.<br /><br />One last thing I want to say about the actual movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't bad. I'm someone who really isn't fond of her acting. But she plays Pepper Potts, Tony's `assistant/butler... whatever', and she did a really good job. Paltrow in a supporting role, instead of a lead, is a much better combination, in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end, I think everyone will enjoy this movie. Go take a second loan out so you can pay for gas, movie tickets, and popcorn and coke (maybe some twizzlers if you go donate some blood first) and enjoy a day at the movies! Make sure you stay past the 10 minute credits to see the special ending.<br /><br />P.S. When you see Iron Man fighting, imagine him being 2 or 3 stories tall. Just imagine it. Now picture him with an Autobot or Decepticon emblem on his chest. Now watch him fight. See how cool it is to actually see what the heck is going on during his fight scenes? Maybe in Transformers 2, Bay will be able to put a coherent fight scene together that the viewers can actually tell what is going on instead of watching a bunch of polygons mish mashing together.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Jon Favreau (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADFY">Swingers </a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE">Elf</a>) effectively directs the screen adaptation for the comic book superhero Iron Man.  Favreau has some fine-tuning ahead of him in terms of directing action films but Iron Man is still among the very best comic book character based films so far.  It is about as entertaining as you can get and the few flaws that are present are almost entirely forgivable due to Favreau's knack for developing characters and also understating drama effectively.  It might be important to note that it is hard to contain myself and write an honest review, because in all of my years of reading comics, Iron Man, along with perhaps the Silver Surfer, is my favorite comic book character of them all.  Fortunately for me, unlike last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMPW">Fantastic Four sequel</a>, this particular film truly delivers in terms of satisfying the little long lost comic book geek-boy dwelling in my brain.  There were actually moments during the film that I looked over to my brother in full wide-eyed geek-mode and said things like "that stands for S.H.I.E.L.D.!"  The kid in me absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />Iron Man, for the uninitiated, is really Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Chief Executive Officer of weapons manufacturing giant Stark Industries (think Lockheed Martin run by Donald Trump).  He is an arrogant womanizing alcoholic who just happens to be an MIT graduate and a technical genius unlike no other man of his time.  It is as if Leonardo Da Vinci was sent into a time machine, given a mansion, several bottles Johnny Walker Blue, and no reason not to celebrate his lust for women.  In other words, this is not Superman.  Stark is flawed and Favreau so graciously provides us an opportunity to watch him grow as a man and as a machine in his ever-evolving nearly indestructible self-made super armor.  In the beginning, Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and unbeknownst to his enemies, he is shown the error of his ways as a weapons manufacturer and begins building his suit as a way to escape his kidnappers.  A new man with new motives, Stark develops his suit further and becomes an unlikely but befitting hero.  Look out terrorists and look weapons manufacturers, including you Iron Monger!  I only wish he could've cleaned up that ugliness in Iraq on his way home.<br /><br />One can tell by the promotions that the special effects are great and they are amazing from beginning to end.  However, the screenplay is very solid, especially the humorous, fast, and witty dialogue for Robert Downey, Jr.  The chemistry between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) works remarkably well and far better than I would've expected.  Jeff Bridges is also great as the villain Obidiah Stane and the rest of the cast is solid all around, with the exception of perhaps Terrence Howard he unfortunately seems to be going through the motions here.  But overall, the magic of this film is the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role.  He is perfect for the role in almost every way.  Somehow he gives us a hero we feel compelled to find a reason to root for despite his flaws.  I'm not sure another actor could've pulled it off.<br /><br />This definitely receives a high recommendation from me for pretty much anyone looking for a fun and compelling action movie.  For fellow lovers of the Iron Man comics and other crossover stories (i.e. Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D.); do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are done rolling, you won't regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1.

I have to admit that I was starting to worry about the future of Marvel's films after seeing the pathetic "Spider-Man 3", "Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer", "Ghost Rider" & "Elektra", but "Iron Man" has put life into a franchise that has seemingly been going downhill, ... quality wise that is.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. has done something with his Superhero that other actors have yet to try with theirs, ... loosen up, have fun and add some humor. The screenplay does a wonderful job of adding issues that American's fear at this particular point in time, using the war on terror to make the film more realistic and envolving. Also, Jeff Bridges really does break out in the second half of the film to create quite a villianous character.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Man, this thing has been advertised like crazy - I've seen way too many commercials, trailers, action figures, and news all over the net.  Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreu have been more than confident they have a winner in Iron Man.  With the amount of hype I think I got burnout and I wasn't that interested in seeing Iron Man afterall.  Everyone I talked to loved it so I figured why not.  Turns out everyone was correct and you can believe the hype folks - this is one great film, and sure enough one of the best of 2008 already.<br /><br />This isn't your typical superhero movie, its better than that.  For the most part I didn't feel like I was sitting through a typical superhero film.  There is almost a realistic feel throughout this film unlike some superhero films (but don't expect things to be believable sometimes).  Details are laid out on how everything is built and works.  There is a definite maturity within the storyline and actors.  In fact, the top four actors in the film have all had some big awards in their past.<br /><br />There are two parts of Iron Man.  First you've got the Afghanistan storyline and the Obadiah Stane story (Jeff Bridges) who turns out to be the movie bad guy (and gives Iron Man one heck of a fight in the end).  The creators have done away with the outdated evets on how Iron Man came to be in the comic books, and placed the film in a touchy present day situation, placing Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) as a captive within Afghanistan.  This has a huge impact on Stark's life and the man he will become throughout the film (not just the superhero he becomes, but the person he becomes too).  Obadiah doesn't like it and next thing you know we got quite a villain to deal with.<br /><br />The visual effetcs were provided by Industrial Light & Magic and the sound by Skywalker Sound, in other words you can expect incredible effects that don't dissapoint.  Accompany that with great comic relief, great actors and characters, and an impressive story and you got one film you can't miss out on.<br /><br />And as a bonus, this is just the beginning.  Iron Man 2 is already in works.  Though I missed it in the theatre, a glimpse of Captain America' shield can be seen in Tony's lab.  And don't forget to watch the new Hulk film this June (ditch the old one with Eric Bana).  There is to be a Robert Downey Jr. cameo in that film...something is happening with Marvel.  Oh yeah, and don't miss the end of Iron Man, like after credits end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Marvel Comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and its share of profits in the films made by other studios based on their characters, recently started their own film division. The first film from this endeavor, "Iron Man" starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard, is a lot of fun, and sure to generate a number of sequels based on the huge amount of money made on opening weekend. This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, "The Incredible Hulk" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer. Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />But I digress. "Iron Man".<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) is a brilliant man who grew up in his father's shadow, an inventor, Starks Sr. & Jr. both learn they can make any of their ideas a reality Sr. was one of the people who helped build the Atomic bomb, so it probably comes as no surprise that Stark Industries sells weapons; weapons of every size, shape and megaton. When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team - Stark handles the inventions, Obadiah handles the business side of things. Stark takes a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. Driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. During the attack, Tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. When Tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. He then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. Naturally, Obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. And Stark's personal assistant, Pepper Pots (Paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. After a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, Stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in Afghanistan. Then, some trouble begins to brew back home.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau ("Elf", "Zathura" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. This is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. I am an eternal optimist.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark. A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. But he also plays hard. Living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu, Tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. He is also a lothario, sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. He picks up a reporter in Vegas and the next morning, in his house in Malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, Pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. This system allows him to view 3-D holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.<br /><br />As we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah. When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. But this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides Iron Man with a formidable foe, the Iron Monger.<br /><br />When Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to Stark's sheltered persona. Because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.<br /><br />Favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in. His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references. Hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's father's business partner who helps run the company until Tony becomes old enough to take the reins. Tony continues to work with Obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations. Obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable. Naturally, he feels threatened by Tony's change in attitude and works behind the scenes to ensure the company will remain as profitable as ever. He also steals Tony's plans and begins work on his own version of Iron Man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon. Obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result. So in his mind, lethal is good.<br /><br />Obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than I am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.<br /><br />Terrence Howard plays Colonel Jim Rhodes, a longtime associate of Tony, who acts as a liaison between Stark and his government contacts. When Stark is taken hostage, Rhodes leads the rescue mission. When Stark becomes Iron Man, Rhodes helps him out in various ways.<br /><br />As you watch the story unfold, you get the sense Howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time. He plays the role with a certain sense of tongue-in-cheek but this quality is played subtlety, which makes the role all the more appealing and real.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film. The actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen. The performances, in combination with a well-written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make "Iron Man" one of the more memorable summer films in many years. I can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge "Spiderman" in popularity.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Disc One<br />*********<br /><br />Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Disc one information<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 2:06:01 (h:m:s)<br />Movie size: 33,44 GB<br />Disc size: 47,22 GB<br />Total bit rate: 35.38 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 27.13 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  3493 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 3493kbps (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English / English SDH / French / French / Portuguese (Brazilian) / Spanish / Spanish<br /><br />Number of chapters: 15<br /><br />#Deleted/Extended Scenes (HD, 24 minutes)<br />#Documentary: The Invincible Iron Man (HD, 49 minutes)<br />#Hail of Armor (HD)<br />#Iron Man IQ - BD-Live<br /><br />Disc Two<br />********<br /><br />#Documentary: I Am Iron Man (HD, 111 minutes)<br />#Featurette: Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man (HD, 27 minutes)<br />#Rehearsal Footage (HD, 11 minutes)<br />#Still Gallery (HD, 5 minutes)<br />#Theatrical Trailers (HD)<br /><br />It's been reported that the Blu-ray's Dolby TrueHD track is activating  Dynamic Range Control (DRC) in many AVRs.

Our hero has his flaws; a passion for dumb women and an awkwardness with smart ones.  Our villain has a believable motive; greed, and represents a realistic threat to society, the military - industrial complex.  Iron Man also has a female sidekick who does know his true identity.  And best of all, our hero is not suffused with enough humility to keep his identity under wraps.  What a great movie!  The only flaws were some of the action scenes in which Iron Man takes quite a pounding.  Yes, the suit kept the man whole, but any person going thru those types of G-forces would suffer internal bleeding at a lethal level.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>From the moment that `Iron Man' began I knew that this was going to be a fun ride.  My wife and I were talking recently about how the whole concept behind superhero movies has really shifted focus in recent years.  The major studios have realized that more than just teenage boys go to see these movies; and while there are still critical clunkers and high octane action popcorn munching fluff films thrown into the mix; there are also a slew of very intelligent and dramatic superhero films to come out recently.  While `Iron Man' may lack the moral dilemmas that made `The Dark Knight' one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, it definitely earns a spot next to `Spider-Man 2' as one of the most exciting and most watchable superhero movies in recent memory.<br /><br />We can all get on our knees and thank Robert Downey Jr. for that.<br /><br />From the opening scene, where Tony Stark is conversing rather charismatically with soldiers while crossing the desert, Downey Jr. embodied his character with so much natural charm that we were sucked in.  He was funny, he was touching, he was bold, he was confident, he was vulnerable, he was angry; he was all of these things throughout the course of this film, and each emotion was portrayed effortlessly.  He understood each avenue of his characters development and he worked very hard to create a man out of Iron Man.<br /><br />The film starts with a savage attack that leaves Stark in the hands of terrorists that want him to build for them his newly designed superweapon.  Instead, he builds himself a supersuit that enables him to escape with his life.  After witnessing the atrocities that his company has helped create (he builds weapons for war) he decides that he doesn't want his legacy to be mere death but he wants to do something meaningful with his life.  That's when Iron Man is born.<br /><br />The film, much like `Batman Begins' and the first `Spider-Man' film, focuses mostly on Stark's transformation from man to hero.  We see him struggle with his secrets and his plans, not knowing who to trust since everyone who appears to be on his side also appears to be using him for their own gain.  His decision to stop making weapons comes as a blow to the company and to his partner, Obadiah Stane, and it places him on a rocky path with his friend Rhodey, so Stark finds himself secluded and alone as he attempts to create something huge from his very noble idea.  We get to see Stark grow as a person, and thus become a hero on the inside before truly becoming one in the flesh.<br /><br />The performances here are all wonderful, each and every one.  Downey Jr. owns this movie (this was such a great year for him) but he is helped along by a wonderfully talented cast.  First, we have Jeff Bridges.  This man is gold to me, and here he is just brilliant.  Not only is he dashing in every scene (I really want his wardrobe) but he is also engaging and intriguing (and he has the best character arc).  Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous here as well.  She has received lots of good press for this performance, and rightfully so.  She is the typical conflicted best girl to the hero, but she plays it with such fresh spunk.  Terrence Howard is also very good here.  I'm not a usual fan, but he sold me and I'm actually a little upset they are replacing him with Don Cheadle (I am a huge fan of Cheadle by the way) for the sequel.<br /><br />The film is not as `important' as say `The Dark Knight' was.  `The Dark Knight' was a rare gem in the genre, exposing raw humanity within its scope; but Batman is a much different breed of superhero than Iron Man is.  Marvel comics were never as dark as DC, thus the colorful and action filled approach taken to films like `Spider-Man' and `Iron Man'.  Director Jon Favreau (who also co-stars) does a splendid job of making every scene bounce, giving it this vibrant energy that keeps the audience hooked from the very beginning.  This is a truly enjoyable and memorable superhero movie, filled with effortless charisma, engaging action and truly inspired performances.<br /><br />This has been a great year for superheros.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Most people on Amazon -- and I count myself among them -- reviewing movies or TV shows primarily review the film or series and not the product.  As a rule, I think this is more helpful than focusing on features, extras, packaging, and such.  Because these change and usually (though not always) Amazon links the old versions to the new, comments about these can become irrelevant.  I am making an exception to this product, the Blu-ray 2-disc edition of IRON MAN, simply because it is the first movie that I bought on Blu-ray.  I previously had bought two TV series on Blu-ray, but this is the first film.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Sony Playstation 3, primarily for watching movies, though secondarily for playing games.  I limiting my Blu-ray purchases until the prices for the discs come down to around the same level as DVDs.  On the other hand, I'm virtually cutting out my purchases of DVDs entirely, since the new format is already on hand.  I wouldn't be surprised if overall DVD sales started to drop if more people follow the kinds of buying patterns I'm currently practicing.  We are in an in between period.  The format war is over and Blu-ray has won, but not enough people own Blu-ray players because they are priced too high.  But just as I stopped purchasing LPs and cassette tapes once CDs were released, so I'm ceasing buying DVDs.  But my purchasing of Blu-ray is minimal.  Mostly I rent from Netflix.<br /><br />Which leads to the question, why buy Blu-ray at all?  Well, only if there is enough in the product to justify it.  In the case of IRON MAN, I believe what you get justifies the cost.  I was a little nervous the first time I put a Blu-ray on, wondering if the difference was going to justify the money I had expended.  I'm delighted to say that it did.  The main feature, of course, looks extraordinary.  But IRON MAN is unique in contrast with the other Blu-ray films and series that I have watched in the format in the amount of extras also in 1080 high-def.  I think this will change quickly as Blu-ray matures as a form, but currently many releases have the main feature in 1080 high def, but many of the features in a lower resolution.<br /><br />IRON MAN also has an amazing number of special features that I actually enjoyed watching.  Too often special features just seem to be filler, put there to make the purchaser that there is more to the item purchased than there is.  And frankly, more often than not I don't bother with special features at all.  But I find projects like IRON MAN to be quite fascinating, since it involves combining several technologies to create the final main character, including the main actor, stunt doubles, high tech suits, robots, and extensive CGI.  Frankly, going behind the scenes of most movies -- even most very good movies -- is not terribly interesting.  But in the case of a high-tech super hero movies, it is very nearly as much fun as the main feature itself.  I especially enjoyed the series of short features documenting the making of the film.  I find that I enjoyed the movies itself more fully on rewatching than I did the first time through.<br /><br />IRON MAN is important not merely for being a very good movie, but for being the first movie by a new studio that is certain to be among the greatest producer of box office smashes in the next decade.  After watching several Marvel characters drive some of the greatest box office hits of the past decade, Marvel has established its own production company.  The goal is ultimately an Avengers movie and to that end they are bringing out a string of movies over the next 3 or 4 years, introducing potential new members of the Marvel answer to the JLA.  We have already been introduced to Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (and I hope everyone who has watched IRON MAN stuck around after the closing credits to be introduced to Nick Fury, who gets his own movie something early in the next decade -- this will almost certain star Samuel L. Jackson, who gave his permission to serve as the model for Fury in The Ultimate Nick Fury comic release).  Marvel has announced movies based on Thor, Captain America, and Ant-Man, all of whom were members of the Avengers in one or another version, along with Iron Man and the Hulk.  Marvel's formula, based on IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK, as well as the movies they are striving to cast (the word is that Daniel Craig recently turned down the offer to star in THOR), is to make a character based film focused primarily on a high-profile actor (Robert Downey Jr., Edward Norton, and if he had taken the offer Daniel Craig), and then build the action around him, instead of having the character as an afterthought to the action.  It has worked wonderfully in the Spider-Man movies (which was primarily a Sony production).  When and if they do an Avengers movie, the cost of the cast alone should be jaw dropping.  However, Marvel isn't focusing on the Avengers alone.  They have also announced their intention to do a film based on my own favorite Marvel series, Brian K. Vaughan's The Runaways, about a group of empowered teens in California who discover that their parents are super villains, causing them to become runaways (hence their name).  Though the Runaways have been tangentially included in Marvel Big Events like the Civil War and the Secret Invasion, they aren't centrally involved in the rest of the Marvel Universe.  There will also be a Silver Surfer film, hopefully with Galactus as his foe.<br /><br />My fear is that Marvel is going to be exclusively focused on producing titanic box office smashes.  Though I will add that both IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK focus on character enough to make both far more than cinematic comic books.<br /><br />My last comment is that as a Robert Downey Jr. admirer, I couldn't be happier that he seems to have conquered his personal demons to enjoy the greatest commercial success of his career.  He is a first rate actor who has been in many, many fine movies over the years, often in independent productions, but for a while it looked like his career might be over.  Although he proudly points out that even during the years when he struggled with drug addiction and never missed a single day of shooting on any film, after his final rehab and jail stint insurers would not insure his films.  I know that Woody Allen had to drop him from one project because they couldn't get insurance for him.  Gradually, however, he managed to work his way back.  He is especially good to see in this role because his own personal problems parallel those of Tony Stark in the comics.  Like Downey earlier in his life, Tony Stark struggles with alcoholism.  The film only shows him drinking.  I wonder if IRON MAN 2, which was just announced, will show Stark dealing with his drinking.  I hope so.  It has been the focus on things like this that have made several of the Marvel movies so enjoyable.  Although there is great action, ultimately they are about believable, very human individuals who become heroes.  The more human you make the characters, the more delightful they become as heroes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>Batman and Spider-Man beware: there's a new hero in town and though he may not have all those "wonderful toys" or be able to throw sticky webs, he's packing a serious arsenal.  Born from the imaginations of Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and penciled by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby in 1963, "Iron Man" is the second Marvel Comic hero come to life on the big screen this year.  Boasting big names (Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard) and even bigger visual effects to boot (courtesy of the illustrious Industrial Light and Magic), "Iron Man" was the box office grand slam of late spring 2008 and upon viewing it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The film doesn't waste much time before it jumps right into the action and gives us a keen character establishment of its main man.  Tony Stark (Downey Jr) is a man made rich off his father's munitions business of Stark Industries and lives rather recklessly as a result, cavorting about the world in private jets and expensive cars, bedding beautiful women and drinking at all hours of the day.  Beneath a seemingly spoiled rich boy exterior lies an astounding brain for engineering, Stark's company reaching new and glorious heights with his brilliant fabrications of innovative and powerful weapons for the US military.  When he travels to Afghanistan for a dramatic unveiling of his new "Jericho" missile, his small convoy is ambushed and he is taken prisoner by Afghan radicals.  Rigging his heart to a device that would mean certain death if he dismantled it, they order him to replicate the Jericho missile for their own purposes in exchange for his release.  Knowing he's a dead man no matter whether he accepts or refuses the terms, Tony sets to work on his greatest design yet, something that brings meaning to the saying "necessity is the mother of invention".  Breaking free from a desert cave in a colossal suit made of metal, Stark blasts the baddies and returns home to America with a renewed perspective, determined to veer off his long course of war profiteering.<br /><br />Something's afoot however and Stark encounters a curious amount of resistance to his plan from business partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges).  While the fragments of truth slowly piece together, Stark perfects his original design and with the help of his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) keeps the project hush-hush while testing its limitations and using its power to right the many wrongs that Stark Industries has caused.<br /><br />Being a comic book adaptation, you can expect some impressive visual effects from "Iron Man" and you get them in spades.  Not only do we see the streamlined red and gold suit in CGI but some of the fun parts are watching Stark piece it together in his vast workshop as well as test its radical capabilities (he gets comically blown into the wall more than once testing its rocket thrusters).  No greater magic can be felt than when a superhero takes flight and there are plenty of heartracing aerial stunts that have Iron Man soaring far and wide through the clouds and the stars, as well as taking treacherous falls from thousands of feet back to Earth.  The mere concept and engineering of the suit will get some mental gears turning, for in this age of rampant and advancing technology one can only wonder whether such a wondrous contraption is conceivable.<br /><br />Downey Jr. is the man of the hour as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the 43-year old actor relishing the extravagant playboy persona of his character and excelling in the dramatic scenes where Stark sees the cause and effect of his profession.  He also made a figurative iron man of himself, sculpting his body with vigorous weight training (five days a week) and martial arts.  He is a literal phoenix of the entertainment industry, risen from the ashes of drug abuse and bad press to come back full swing and win over audiences and jaded film critics once again.<br /><br />Also noteworthy is Bridges as the villanous Obadiah Stane, rendered almost unrecognizable with his bald head and full salt-and-pepper beard.  He takes to his bad guy role quite well and doesn't disappoint in his climactic battle with Stark.<br /><br />Paltrow, a critical darling and a great actress, is an odd choice for the role of Pepper Potts, her stiff performance going right along with her stiff traipsing in all those tight, restrictive skirts and stilettos she wears.  Her scenes with Downey Jr. where they are playfully bantering are engaging but when portraying terror, she falls flat.  Why she was chosen for this role is anyone's guess.  Another waste of talent is Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's close friend and confidante.  Howard can act the hell out of a dramatic role (just watch "Crash" and "Hustle & Flow" and you'll see what I'm talking about) but nary a hint of his capabilities is revealed here, another headscratcher of a casting choice.<br /><br />Director Jon Favreau (an actor turned director) does an admirable job in the driver's seat with this big-budget feature ($140 million), recouping the cost and them some when the film made over $300 million domestically.  He has already signed on for a sequel, as have Downey Jr. and Paltrow.  It will be interesting to see whether he can be on par with or surpass Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" juggernaut.<br /><br />Bottom line: Be you an action movie fan or a lover of superhero fables, "Iron Man" will entertain you in more ways than one with its non-stop action, engaging story and charismatic performance from Robert Downey Jr.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Superhero movies seem to be the rage these days. With movies like Iron Man, I can see why. Not that I'm complaining. If you've read enough of my reviews lately, you'll see I'm quite a big comic book fan myself so it is great news for me. True, I'm an admitted DC fanboy but I, occasionally, get into Marvel Comics as well. Honestly, though, I've never been into Iron Man as much as I have others like Blade, The Punisher, Ghost Rider, Wolverine, Iron Fist and Doctor Strange. You can tell by my favorites there that I'm into the darker, more twisted likes of Marvel's gallery. Yet, after seeing Iron Man, I've decidedly thought about purchasing his comic on a regular basis now. The movie is about Tony Stark. A wealthy industrialist who is kidnapped to build a destructive weapon for the enemy. If things weren't bad enough, shrapnel works its way near his heart and the only thing keeping him alive is a small electromagnetic generator installed in his chest.  Instead of building the weapon for the enemy, he builds a fantastic suit of armor to escape by. After escaping, he decides to turn his life and company around much to the disappointment of Obadiah Stane(his second in command at Stark Industries). Obadiah wants complete control over Stark Industries, even if it means wiping out Tony Stark and that's when things start to get interesting. Without giving too much away, let's just say things get wayyy more interesting from that point.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, Iron Man is Marvel's first movie into more 'serious' material. Not one time in the movie did I find things too unbelievable or fantastical as some of their previous movies led me to feel. Even though I actually loved The Dark Knight and know that some things in that movie could actually happen, this movie made it more believable for me.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau; the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges. Extras include:Trailers(Star Trek, Indiana Jones & The Incredible Hulk), Deleted/Extended Scenes, Iron Man: Armored Adventures(which is a preview of the animated Iron Man series that will air next year on Nicktoons), I am Iron Man(which is a documantary of the making of the movie), The Invincible Iron Man(which is a featurette detailing the creation of Iron Man to his present day interpretation), Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man(which is self-explanatory), Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test, The Actor's Process(a four minute rehearsal with Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Jon Favreau),  The Onion "Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into a Full-Length Film(a two and a half minute parody of a news report) and Galleries(Three picture galleries which allow you to see the movie through photos).<br /><br />All in all, Iron Man is a wildly believable and fun ride.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS MY OPINION DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN OR PURCHASED THE MOVIE--YOUR MILAGE MAY VARY. IF YOU WANT INFO ON PICTURE/SOUND AND EXTRAS SKIP TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH PARAGRAPHS.<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS ON THE TWO DISC SET. THE ONE DISC SET PRIMARILY HAS THE FEATURE FILM<br />THANKS!<br /><br />"Titanium Composite Man" just doesn't have the same ring to it as "Iron Man". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is "The Merchant of Death" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of metal that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by coming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The DVD looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. It's one of the top notch transfers  I've seen in recent years. Audio is extremely active and is well used to put you into metal head's world.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary "I AM Iron Man" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette "Invincible Iron Man" that gives us an idea about the development of the character with interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, "Wired" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film.<br /><br />Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of "The Dark Knight" (that "Iron Man" is really Marvel's idea of "Batman" but a bit of irony thrown in for good measure except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the "Spider-Man" films directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />The nice thing about "Iron Man" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).<br /><br />Marvel's first in-house production "Iron Man" demonstrates that the comic book turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or DVD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third "Iron Man" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of "The Incredible Hulk".<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Iron Man is an awesome film with great special effects! Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly. A billionaire inventor named Tony Stark is held hostage in Afghanistan for months because terrorists want him to build a bomb. Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape. He is rescued and and while he is back home, he tries to reinvent the suit. He makes it and tries to figure out how to work it. His sexy beautiful personal assisstant, Pepper Potts doesn't really him to do it, because she thinks he might die, but he tells her that he must do it to save lives. I love all of Iron Man's gadgets. Soon, some military people think Iron Man is a threat, so Tony asks his friend Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to stop the planes from trying to kill him. His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit. If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Not just another super-hero. The actors lift this and make it fly. As with all the great comicbook movies, it's not the fx, it's the heart. This is a fun one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>With each decade, the dark heart of Comic Book Adaptations beats a little faster. Ever since Tim Burton made his version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman</a>, super-heroes have made our nights in the theater all the more exciting and thought provoking. Now, with Marvel Comics' taking the studio reigns on "Iron Man," they've done something totally new. "Iron Man" is the rare comic book movie that stands apart from its origins, a movie that could have been made without a back-mythology, and a film you can go see without previously knowing anything about the source material.<br /><br />A great deal of this has to do with the casting. Robert Downey Jr, as billionaire Tony Stark, brings enough snarky humor to his conflicted billionaire playboy genius that you totally fall for the act. As his rival Obadiah Stane, Jeff Bridges obviously relishes getting to play baddie. He's all oily charm and malevolence, and watching is descent into the Iron Monger is a marvel (pun intended). Speaking of Iron Monger, the suits, oh the suits. When Tony Stark perfects the second Iron Man outfit (with the help of his AI companions), it really will make you believe he can fly. Even with the CGI, the suits look realistic and hot.<br /><br />The suits do battle and it's better than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a> fights (which were both done by the same company). The other "training exercise" shots, like the one with the fighter planes, are pulse-racing fun. The gadgets are worthy of a Bond Film, and the humor that slides in helps give the movie balance. (Like Stark's commentary to his robots during suit tests, for example.)<br /><br />Balance is also achieved by the rest of the cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as the loyal Pepper Potts and Leslie Bibb as reporter Christine Everhart. Terrence Howard (who is underused) plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhoades. Stan Lee makes the obligatory cameo, and the assorted bad guys are, well, the current middle eastern terrorists du-jour. (It is worth noting that the ultimate evil-doer here is not a foreigner...)<br /><br />All in all, a great Good Vs Evil night at the movies, down to the Black Sabbath finally popping up in the credits. And was it me, or did the end credits pay homage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR">Tron</a>, a movie Jeff Brides just happen to be in?  I also have to - as everyone else here has stated - remind everyone: stay through the credits. "Iron Man" kicks the summer blockbuster season off with a bang.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>This Film is a winner i've seen it twice, it's a must see this summer. now they actually made a good apt from a comic book finally . spidey was good but this one has a better balance of being light and funny plus dramatic for all around fun treat. The  cast is just excellent, props to the person that did the casting for this picture.  Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges the acting muse must have been on their side because the acting is just aces. the most enjoyable film i've in quite sometime.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />P.S. when  i first heard about this film i was think the worst, the  film proved me wrong i love it. oh you must sit through the credits to see a surprise at the end. this won't be the last time i view this film i'll probably end up going again to see it. fun. It's PG-13 For Some Language , Brief Mild Sexually, and Violence/Action Scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Get ready to be entertained folks! I was preparing myself to be somewhat disappointed. After all, many of the comic books transformed to films have a history of sucking hard, but Iron Man comes through with a finely adapted screenplay, top notch action, not to mention a great cast. ILM again comes through with the best CGI money can buy, this time with a winner of film for a change. It also looks as if Robert Downey Jr. (an actor I had always liked) is back in his game. His unfortunate downward spiral in the mid 90's up through the last several years nearly destroyed his acting career. I hope this time around, he's here to stay.<br /><br />So, getting to the "main course" Tony Stark is a billionaire engineer genius/philanthropist and has  been compared to the likes of Leonardo Davinci. His inherited genius comes from his father who started it all designing weapons for the military where he picked up and designed some of the worlds most destructive weapons of war.During one of his excursions and promotional gigs to "sell" his new "bang, bang" toy, he is kidnapped during an ambush where he is forced to make the same weapon for "the enemy" that will be used on theirs. Stark decides to do something else, and in of all places, makes his greatest creation to free himself from captivity...."the suite" which is a crude form of what will be his masterpiece.<br /><br />Upon his escape and back home, he has an epiphany. Instead of making weapons of death and destruction for the military, he wants to design things to help mankind and put an end to war. This does not settle well with his business partner Obadiah, played by the excellent Jeff Bridges who has "alternate" plans. There he designs the suit of all suits through trial an error to put a stop to his weapons being sold and placed in the wrong hands and defend those who need it the most. This immediately put him in the wrong cross hairs of everyone. Soon Obadiah discovers what Stark has created and copies his suit design, only far more destructive and menacing.<br /><br />Well worth watching, Iron Man finishes SOLID. Downey 's character has some great lines and lots of dry, sarcastic and quirky humor. It keeps a good flow through the entire film from start to finish. Of course in this day an age in film making, Iron Man finishes with the hint (and most likely the promise) of continuing stories to come in the future. Well worth seeing for the theater experience, this is not one to miss folks. Saddle up for some hard hitting action and a bitch'in good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Iron Man" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Tony Stark is a billionaire industrialist and genius inventor who is kidnapped and forced to build a devastating weapon. Instead, using his intelligence and ingenuity, Tony builds a high-tech suit of armor and escapes captivity. When he uncovers a nefarious plot with global implications, he dons his powerful armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. The cast led by  Robert Downey Jr. (in a terrific career-defining performance as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Terrence Howard (as Jim Rhodes), Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger), and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts) is excellent! The directing by Jon Favreau (who also directed "Elf" (2003), "Zathura" (2005), & "Made" (2001) is excellent! The screenplay (which is based on characters by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby) by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby (both who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay for "Children Of Men" (2006), Art Marcum, & Matt Holloway (both who also wrote the story and screenplay to the upcoming "Punisher: War Zone" (2008) is excellent! The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also did the music to "Mr. Brooks" (2007) & the tv show "Prison Break") is excellent! The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also did the cinematography to "The Number 23" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Dan Lebental (who also did the film editing to "Elf" & "Zathura") is excellent! The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller (who also did the casting to "Vantage Point" (2008), "Never Back Down" (2008), & the upcoming "You Don't Mess With The Zohan" (2008) is excellent! The production design by J. Michael Riva (who also did the production design to "Zathura" & "Spider-Man 3" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Suzan Wexler (who also did the art direction to "Spider-Man 3" & the upcoming "The Soloist" (2008), which also stars Downey, Jr.) is excellent! The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who also did the set decoration to "Zathura" & the upcoming "Land Of The Lost" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon (who also did the costume design to "Elf", "Zathura", & "Made") is excellent! This is an action-adventure comic-book movie that works on all cylinders. Robert Downey, Jr. was born to play Tony Stark / Iron Man. This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best, by so far, this year. This is also a excellent movie to start the summer movie season off.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Finally, Marvel Comics' ol' Shellhead arrives on the big screen, and he arrives with stunning force. I don't quite know if this is the best superhero film ever made, but IRON MAN's just about got me convinced that it at least ranks right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the first two SUPERMAN movies, with Christopher Reeve (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J">Superman - The Movie</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IJ79V6">Superman II (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>). Everything seems to have fallen into place for IRON MAN, from the knocked-out-of-the-park special effects to the well-written script, brought to life by a high caliber cast. It's just a good story told very well. And, as a bonus, it's surprisingly funny.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has got it all, riches and notoriety and an off-the-charts genius I.Q. A debonair gazillionaire who inherited Starks Industries, Stark has been content breezing thru his days as a freewheeling playboy/inventor. Swanky pad in Malibu. Fancy private jet with gorgeous stewardesses doubling as pole dancers. When asked to justify his company's role as the military's primary weapons provider, his flippant response is "Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."<br /><br />But his worldview is forever altered when he goes to the Middle East for a weapons presentation. Terrorists blow up his vehicle, the resulting explosion causing shrapnel to be imbedded in his chest, very close to his heart. A makeshift electromagnetic device (hooked to a car battery) is implanted in his chest cavity, to prevent the shrapnel from piercing his heart. The terrorists, who hail Tony as the most famous mass murderer in America, insist that he build missiles for them. Accordingly, Tony is kept in a cave and given access to scrap metal and missile parts. But, Tony Stark, with nothing left to lose, decides to build something else...<br /><br />This film is awesome, definitely a fan boy's giddy dream. IRON MAN brings the thunder, delivers the goods. There are so many highlight, pump-you-up moments here, to relish and hoot and holler for. The first appearance of the clunky Iron Man armor. The first time he takes flight. Tony's step-by-step (and often hilarious) development of the new, sleeker model. The first time the new model goes into action. And much, much more. Let me just say, eyeing schematics have never been so much fun. It's pretty contagious, the sheer fun and enjoyment experienced by Tony as he goes about putting together his armor. His underground lab is an eye-popping marvel of hi-tech gadgetry, which includes an artificial intelligence named Jarvis (in the comics, Jarvis is an all-too human butler of Tony's and the Avengers'). And when Iron Man finally truimphantly blazes thru the skies in ridiculous velocities - well, whew! No complaints at all, at all with how the Iron Man armors are imagined on screen. Prepare to get blown away.<br /><br />IRON MAN is peopled by stock characters, no lie. The faithful, beautiful long-suffering, long-in-love assistant. The backstabbing business partner. The terrorists. Even the hero of the film isn't cut from a new cloth (uncaring industrialist undergoing a moral 180). But here's the thing: when these cliches are played by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Robert Downey, Jr., well, then, the cardboard suddenly gains layers of depth.<br /><br />Iron Man had always been so far down my list of favorite superheroes, it's kind of pathetic. Before this film, I've never found him that interesting in the comic books. Too cold, too smug, too superior, too powerful...Plus, if you've been following the recent Civil War crossover event in the Marvel comics, Iron Man, in my eyes, played a very distasteful role. But Iron Man on screen is something else. On celluloid, he's dynamic and dazzling and oh so friggin' cool! But the thing that really puts it all together, that which makes this flick such a hands down winner and a box office monster, is Robert Downey, Jr. Downey brings his fabulous acting, his jaded charisma and his comic wit and timing to the role. And to see him breathe life into Tony Stark is to think "Yes, of course!" - the man fits the part so seamlessly. Still handsome, but there's a well worn look to him now. Downey's done stuff and lived life outrageously, good and bad. And, really, that's Tony Stark to a T. Even more than Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man, Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. For an actor who's had his ups and downs and for a brilliant formerly heartless ex-weaponeer who's literally had a change of heart, redemption comes in rip-roaring heavy metal...</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is almost a perfect super hero film.  It looks beautiful on Blu-ray and sounds incredible.  In only a few moments the movie gets rolling and never lets up.  Mixing action with a pretty good storyline to get any non-comics reader up to snuff on Iron Man history, this movie really does a good job.  Not overly gory and mild language make this movie okay for teenagers.  One quick sex scene without any nudity does make this a parental decision for anyone with younger kids.  After Fantastic Four I was really surprised by the quality of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Well, I guess I'm going to jump on the `Iron Man' bandwagon and admit that I loved the film from beginning to end. Michael Downey Jr. delivers a masterful performance in the role of Tony Stark, former weapons prodigy and multi-millionaire playboy who sees the error of his way and decides to do all he can to undo the damage wrought upon the world by his destructive creations. His call to action takes the former of Iron Man, a metal clad crusader who's all but impervious to conventional weaponry, has the ability to fly at supersonic speeds and comes equipped with the best technology of the day to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. I also enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-time executive assistant and future love interest. The chemistry between the two was palpable and believable.<br /><br />Yes, `Iron Man' receives high marks across the board; strong storyline, wonderful performances, crisp and witty dialogue along with a heart-pounding soundtrack that will leave you anxiously awaiting the sequel. A number of previous reviews have made the statement that the special effects don't live up to expectations. I'm not an effects expert, but it sure looked awfully spectacular to me! My Rating: -5 Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>I'm not a comic book fan at all. So I know about Spiderman, Superman and Batman, but I know nothing of some of the "minor" superheroes that end up starring in big budget motion pictures. I know nothing about Iron Man's origin, the villians, and all of the backstory that go into the universe he lives in. Is the movie, IRON MAN, a movie I could enjoy when I don't know about or really care about Iron Man? The answer is YES. Bases on box office returns and great reviews, the public loved this movie. The critics got this one right. This really is a good movie.<br /><br />The strength of the movie starts with the cast. You have Oscar winners Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Downey is excellent as Tony Stark, the rich industrialist weapons manufacturer. Stark is a womanizing playboy who has every gadget imaginable, but few if any true friends. Pepper Potts (Paltrow) is his harried assistant who perhaps harbors long buried feelings for Stark. Jeff Bridges is okay as Obidiah Stane, Stark's partner who has big things in mind for Stark Industries. Perhaps the best thing about Bridges' performance is his bald head and huge beard. It is pretty funny. The rest of the cast is stellar.<br /><br />The plot seems to be standard superhero stuff. I was worried that the movie might try and make a politcal statement about war. After all, the plot involves a gigantic weapons manufacturer and Islamic terrorists. The movie wades through these waters with ease, giving it realism while never offending any one's political beliefs.<br /><br />The movie has some violence that could be too harsh for younger children. There is some adult situations but no bad language. The sountrack is great and the set designs (like Stark's house) are incredible. This is a fun movie and I know I'll never read an Iron Man comic book, but I can't wait for the next movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>The next anticipated movie from the Marvel line of comic books is "IRON MAN". There has been an overload of comic book films and thankfully, this one doesn`t have "Fantastic Four`s" quality. "Shellhead" goes to the big screen courtesy of director Jon Favreau with a solid screenplay by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. Yes, the movie is great and as with "Spider-Man" is the cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be. Yes, everything but it didn't quite unseat "Spider-man 2" as Marvel's best comic adaptation. (in my opinion)<br /><br />Anthony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire industrialist/inventor and dubbed as a "Merchant of War"; Stark makes most of his fortune making weapons for the military. One day, fate intervenes and Stark finds himself captured and injured by terrorists. With the aid of a man named Yinsen (Shaun Toub), Stark creates a suit of armor from scratch and escapes the clutches of the terrorists.<br />This experience had apparently affected Stark in a life-changing way. Now he intends to use his resources to the betterment of mankind, much to the dismay of Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). To atone for his sins, Stark builds a steel-mesh suit and becomes the ultimate human fighting machine...<br /><br />When I said that the film is a cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be, it is because the screenplay carries references to the Shellhead's comic series from his very origin. Never try to "fix" something that's not broken. The backdrop has been changed from Vietnam to Iraq; and this is a very clever move since it does relate to current events. Characters from the comic make a appearance; Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Yinsen, Obadiah Stane (strong references to "Ultimate Iron Man"), Jarvis the robotic assistant (Jarvis the butler was probably avoided due to similarities to Batman's Alfred) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). S.H.I.E.L.D., "War Machine" and the Avengers Initiative anyone? The film carried a surmountable amount of teases that can have the avid comic fan very excited. Writers Fergus and Ostby definitely did their homework on this one.<br /><br />All these factors and the solid direction by Favreau makes for a very entertaining fun movie. The direction has near-excellent structure. I didn't notice any plot holes at all and the execution is solid, the direction knew exactly what it wanted to do and sticks to it. This can be a double-edged sword and I'll explain in a minute. I truly commend the first act of the film as Stark is portrayed as a man very much in for himself who realizes the consequences of his inventions. Why is it so much easier to invent weapons of destruction than to make things to advance mankind? The film does have a strong moral message and a nice touch of humanity. We're fallible, but what matters is how we make our following choices.<br /><br />The film is also blessed with a great cast. Downey does make a good Tony Stark, and the supporting cast does mesh well. Gwyneth Paltrow's "Pepper Potts" may seem a little "doopie" but I rather thought that it was her character in the comic. Tony is a playboy and boy, I was very amused by his escapades. Hopefully, the cast is signed for its sequel. The action scenes are decently shot and the best one I think is Shellhead's invasion into enemy territory. The battle with "Iron Monger" is a little short and not exactly as bone-crushing as I would've preferred it to be but I suppose it fits the film's pace. Boy, the CGI can trample the EFX in "Tranformers". Shellhead is a "global" super-hero with concerns that surpass bank robberies and criminals.<br /><br />Now, before anything else, let me make it very clear that I really thought that "Iron Man" is a great movie. Great structure, AMAZING special effects that puts most CGI to shame and clever dialogue. But the film seemed too `safe" and while the script was very good, it just didn't feel that it was willing to take risks and somehow, I think it didn't realize its full potential. The villain is a little underwhelming and as to be expected, the hero will encounter his exact opposite, that ends up being predictable. Just who is Obadiah Stane in the comic book? He is the man who trampled Stark to the ground and drove him to alcoholism. The man should be cunning and evil, not reduced to a power hungry, greedy businessman.  As great as the movie is, it just didn't offer any surprises and I felt like I was just watching just another "super-hero" movie and I`m ready for the next one. Maybe if this came before the first "Spider-man" (that launched the super-hero new wave) then this film would be just awe-inspiring. The film just put me in very familiar territory that I really felt as if it was the same old thing. Some scenes proved too silly for my tastes but it was still entertaining. Are these signs of super-hero overdose?<br /><br />Despite the feeling of "super-hero" burnout, the villain becoming too routine and with the film being too "safe" for its own good, I really believe "Iron Man" is still a great effort in the super hero genre. At least, it knew what it wanted to do; entertain the young and old alike. The film is not pretentious and despite the limits it imposed on itself, the film is a very entertaining and a great summer film. Undoubtedly, this film will stand as one of the best super-hero flicks to grace movie theaters.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4 ? stars]<br />This review was drafted in June 2008.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This is one of the best comic to film adaptations produced based upon a literate script, terrific performances, solid direction, and special effects that aren't over-the-top!<br /><br />I don't want to take this kind of entertainment too seriously, so I will not go with the long summary of the plot and simply give a quick recap of it and what I liked best and least about this totally fun-filled film.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is NOT the kind of person anyone would expect to play a superhero and that is precisely why this film works so well in casting him as one as his character is the total opposite of a superhero at first.  Downey, as Tony Stark, is a self-absorbed jerk who lives for fast women, fast cars and fast money while profiteering off of war.  He is the living example of why we don't want unmanned aircraft bombers.  We want the human element.  We don't want war to be reduced to a video game and have lives reduced to a blimp on a screen, but this is how Stark lives when we first meet him.  He creates weapons of mass destruction without ever understanding or caring about his weapons' impact on the world, let alone who ends up with them.  It's the all mighty dollar hidden under the cloak of patriotism.<br /><br />This all changes when Stark is kidnapped in Afghanistan and sees how his weapons are falling into enemy hands and how the lives of innocent people are affected by his "toys."  Once he escapes, he slowly becomes a new man, in more ways than one and it's nice that he's a hero by choice and not some experiment gone.  Stark is assisted by a number of people from his glorified secretary well-played by Gwenyth Paltrow to his military connection nicely acted by Terrence Howard.  Of course, it is no secret at this point, and very highly predictable anyhow, that his family's best friend and second in command at his company is out to circumvent Stark's efforts to stop bloodshed.  Jeff Bridges hams it up some in this role, but he's convincing and fun as the eventual villain.<br /><br />The Misses:<br /><br />1) This material, as entertaining as it is, is beneath Paltrow who is a very serious actress and should be doing things far worthier of her talents.<br /><br />2) The plot element of the family friend running the business for personal gain is far too reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins</a>.<br /><br />The Hits:<br />1) There are only two significant "misses" with this film and, to be honest, they aren't all that significant (just enough for me to note them)<br /><br />2) The casting is perfect and inspired.  While I believe that Paltrow is better than this kind of film, she gives a very spirited performance.  Downey is just down right perfect for the this flawed hero and Bridges is just plain fun in his juicy role.<br /><br />3) The special effects DO NOT take over this film, as they did in the equally fun, but over-the-top <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a>.<br /><br />4) The direction is confident and unobtrusive which I can't say for a film such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T8C">Spider-Man 3</a> which was directed well enough, but Sam Rami just tried a little too hard to put his stamp so-to-speak on it.<br /><br />5) This film is entertaining, but not in the kind of mindless way that other superhero films have been.  This film has some heart and soul.<br /><br />6) I can't say enough about the literate script for this film.  It can be funny one moment and cerebral the next.  That is tough to do in this comic book adaptation genre.  It usually goes too much one way in seriousness as with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5W6">Hulk</a> or too slapstick silly as with too many moments in Spider-Man 3.  This film finds a comfortable balance between serious and humorous.<br /><br />This is an outstanding film and I look forward to the two sequels that are currently planned for this new comic book hero to make it to the silver screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Now this is how to make a summer movie.  "Iron Man" explodes off the screen with a combustible mix of superstar charisma, heavy metal thunder and the one thing other film's of it ilk willfully forget: soul.  Robert Downey, Jr., a gifted actor long haunted by demons manifested as substance abuse, powers this new-fangled classic as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, infusing the splashy playboy with bone-dry wit, magnetic charm and, ultimately, huge amounts of heart.  At first, Stark is a willing and content cog in the military industrial complex, reaping huge profits from the sale of self-designed weapons while staying half a world away from the harsh consequences of their use.  And why should he care in the first place?  He's far too busy showing off his high-powered toys of mass destruction; that and bedding every beautiful woman he sees, much to the consternation of his best friend and military liaison Colonel Rhodes (Terrance Howard, every bit as stellar here as Downey, Jr.) and his loyal secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Paltrow is doing some the best work of her career as Stark's romantic equal.  The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is palpable, sexy and resonant; kudos to director Jon Favreau and his large team of screenwriters, which includes the scribes for Children of Men, for knowing it's the little things like depth of character that really count.<br /><br />But Stark gets jolted to reality when his military convoy is attacked on a rural Afghani road by warlords who seek to use Stark's technical acumen for their own arsenals.  To add insult to injury, the convoy is attacked with Stark's own weapons, which the extremists have procured through black market sales and illegal arms deals.  Struck in a dank, suffocating cave, Stark first realizes the true gravity of making cavalier billions off of weapons of war.  Conscience awakened, he works to design a new prototype under the nose of those who hold him captive.  With it, he will flee and use it to destroy all the loose arms that are linked to him.  Favreau stages the escape with high impact pow, showing that this film might be battle cry of one of the next great directors.<br /><br />Back in America, Stark keeps himself in seclusion, perfecting a new battlesuit that will allow him to undo the wrong he has inadvertently committed, but not before trying to get his company, inherited from his gung-ho father, to discontinue weapons development.  However, his second in command, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, a blazing villain), will have none of it.  To him, there's too much green in selling high caliber goods; peace politics are for those too weak to take power and wealth.  So its Stark and his reformed sense of responsibility versus high-rolling capitalism run amok, and their final battle, with two iron-suits rampaging across Southern California, is a doozy.  But the true joy of Iron Man is not its action or seamless special effects.  It's how it seamlessly integrates those elements into a resonant popcorn yarn that stands with the best of the best.  Folks, this is how it's supposed to be done.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2008's "Iron Man" is a very clever screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero.  Robert Downey Jr. is a surprisingly good Tony Starks, billionaire weapons inventor, who rediscovers his humanity while a prisoner of terrorists.  Gwenyth Paltrow is his beautiful and very capable personal assistant Pepper Potts, while a buff Jeff Bridges has a nicely dark role as his corporate deputy.  Terrance Howard is Starks' strait-laced military liaison.<br /><br />As the story opens, Starks is in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapon.  His convoy is ambushed, and the wounded Starks wakes up in a cave, a survivor of unorthodox heart surgery by another hostage. His captors demand that he build them a superweapon.  Starks instead builds an iron suit that will allow him to escape.  The jury-rigged suit lasts just long enough to get out of his captors' clutches, but the experience leaves him a changed man.<br /><br />Upon his return, Starks tells his deputy, and the press, that he will take Stark Industries out of the weapons business, then locks himself in his lab to build a better iron suit.  In an inpromptu visit to a charity event, Starks discovers that he has lost control of the company and that his weapons are being sold indiscriminately around the world.  Starks takes on his Iron Man personna to set things right, not realizing how ruthless his real enemies are.  In a climactic fight scene, Iron Man faces off with an unexpected foe in a copy of his own super suit.<br /><br />The Afghanistan sequences are tightly paced and suspenseful.  The leisurely intermediate scenes, as Starks perfects his Iron Man suit, feature high tech and high humor.  The suspense is back on for the finale, with an ending that begs for sequels.<br /><br />Downey is entirely convincing as the very human man inside an iron mask.  Paltrow isn't given a lot to do, and her budding romance with Starks gets little screen time.  The Iron Man franchise has been nicely updated.  The movie might have benefited from tighter editing; it does just avoid overwhelming the story with CGI effects.  "Iron Man" is highly recommended to viewers looking for an entertaining action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good adaptation of the famous Marvel comic book character.  Hollywood couldn't resist having the film push a pacifist political message (Tony Stark abandons making weapons, etc.) but overall the plot moves along pretty good.  The special effects are really good.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, Tony Stark's girl Friday; she is absolutely spectacular.  She combines beauty with a charming vulnerability, and is perfect in the role.  Robert Downey Jr. was really not my idea of Tony Stark, but he carries the role off pretty well, and gives us lots of laughs.<br /><br />This is the best adaptation of a comic book superhero to the screen since Spider-Man.  Well worth seeing.  RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>Iron Man is witty, well-paced, superbly crafted, finely acted and packed with satisfying action sequences.<br /><br />I must admit, I was only dimly aware of the existence of Iron Man before this movie was released. Now I think he's the coolest super-hero ever, which is a testament to just how great this movie is.<br /><br />The supporting cast is solid, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr. His Tony Stark is simply perfect -  he's an affable, arrogant womanizer, confident to a fault. As heir to a fortune made from arms sales he has no difficulties performing the mental acrobatics necessary to rationalize his role in facilitating fatalities. Downey is simply fun to watch - he makes the so called 'slow' segments, where he is maturing into his superhero role while building the suit, snappy and exiting.<br /><br />The single disc edition include some extended scenes but you'll have to put down a few dollars more to get the full set of extras on the 2 disc ultimate edition. Either way, you might as well take your socks off before you press 'play'. Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a "kids" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent "Transformers" film I viewed.<br /><br />The scenes with "Iron Man" a.k.a. "Tony Stark" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy "Obadiah Stane" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.<br /><br />Some complain the film is not really all that "smart" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters.  And.....it looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is great entertainment and I really enjoyed watching it. This is real fun and I'd recommend it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>Here's a movie that:  moves briskly, has a bit of humor, and is a beautifully-made and thrilling cinematic ride.  The special effects left me smiling.  There aren't any "stoopid" female roles (e.g., the women don't end up falling [as they run away from an evil man], getting caught, or becoming hostages that force Iron Man to make those humanity-vs-love-interest choices); instead, the main female character is smart, funny, and savvy.  Refreshing.  There's a few plot surprises, too.<br /><br />This is a smartly made/directed, fun, and entertaining action movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>Though I'm sure I would have NEVER picked Robert Downey Jr. for the lead, this movie worked! It's so economically directed, (it's directed by Foggy Nelson himself, Jon Favreau, from the highly underrated "Daredevil",) and so cleverly written, you forgive any sins the movie might committ along the way, (like how did Stark manage to make that rather lethal suit of INITIAL armor, [that in the comic book series he kept for about 40 issues,] from scraps found in the woebegone Afghani desert!?! Or how can he fly around the world on the tiny cannister of fuel he carries on himself while clad as Iron Man?)<br /><br />Anyway, what you enjoy most about this movie is the clever dialogue as delivered by Downey, the wizard action sequences as the sleeker, upgraded Iron Man goes about his business, and the finally, DECENTLY done CGI special effects, (in films about Marvel heroes, the CGI is too often WOEFULLY, obviously not real, ruining the illusion and hence the full enjoyment of some of the films. Both "Hulk" movies and the first two "Spiderman" flicks being cases in point.)<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, who has a knack for being in really good sci-fi action movies that are a cut above the pack, ("Sky Captain",) plays Tony Stark's/Iron Man's assistant and possible love interest Pepper Potts, (can you believe that name?!) Favreau gives himself a small part as Tony's chauffeur and Jeff Bridges, (who, I must say, has aged a bit since "The Big Lebowski"...he actually seems upper-middle-aged here!) plays an old friend of Tony's dad with an impossible biblical sounding name, Obidiah Stain, that surprises us all by the end of the film.<br /><br />I have yet to see a bad review of this movie, and it IS enjoyable, but is it because of Downey, Bridges, Paltrow, ILM or what...? It really doesn't do anything wrong, and really, isn't that what we most want from a movie...?</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>I rented Iron Man on DVD yesterday, and I had a chance to check it out last night. I had high expectations for this film---I expected more, a lot more, a hell of a lot more. Okay, it was a summer movie. Critics raved so much over Iron Man that I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />My first gripe against Iron Man was the time it took to get to the action: about 40 minutes. There was too much exposition before the actual fireworks, and those fireworks were over in a blink. My second gripe against Iron Man was its conflict: weapons save lives, and weapons take lives. I wasn't expecting a brain-f**k, but I was expecting something more sophisticated. My third gripe against Iron Man was Gwyneth Paltrow. She's out of this world, and I would like to have seen more of her.<br /><br />On the plus side, Robert Downey Jr. invests more personality in a superhero than I am used to seeing. He plays the cold arrogant billionaire role with ease. Downey plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who's the antithesis of everything heroic. Tony grew up as a child prodigy. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, he built his first engine. At age seventeen, he graduated from MIT. And as CEO of the largest and wealthiest defense contractor in the world, Tony Stark has zero morals. He gambles, he drinks, he's irresponsible, and he's a womanizer.<br /><br />Tony pitches a new missile system, the Jericho, to the military in Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. There, a band of terrorists hijack Tony's Humvee. The terrorists overwhelm Tony's military entourage. The confrontation is furious and swift. Hours later, Tony awakens in a dark cave. His body is wet with sweat and blood, his clothes are torn, and he has a huge plug--an electromagnet--protruding out of his chest. This magnet keeps him alive by pulling the shrapnel embedded his chest away from his heart. Earlier, during the terrorist siege, an exploding bomb splintered and planted those splinters in Tony's chest.<br /><br />The terrorists torture Tony; they dunk his head underwater. Then they show him why they kidnapped him in the first place. They lead him out of the dark cave and into the light. Tony sees an enormous cache of stockpiled weapons--weapons manufactured by his company. The terrorists stockpile these weapons to use against American soldiers. Now the terrorists want Tony's help: they want Tony to build the Jericho missile system for them to use against American soldiers. The terrorists promise to release Tony if he cooperates. But Tony has other ideas. He builds an armored battle-suit equipped with flame-throwers. He escapes.<br /><br />Back home in the U.S., the press mobs Tony. He's sober.  He saw terrorists use his weapons to kill American soldiers; now, he wants to shut down the weapons development division of his company. He wants to use his company to make the world a better place. Tony's plans embitter his guardian and vice president Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who has his sights set on selling the Jericho missile system to the U.S. government. The action starts from this point of the movie.<br /><br />Like Batman, Iron Man has no natural powers; this implies that some heroes are made. The exterior insulation of Tony Stark's vanity and ego are the perfect counterpoint to Iron Man's cold titanium shell. Overall, Iron Man's a solid movie. It's worth buying, though it's not as good as Verhoeven's Robocop.<br /><br />Author of Gotta Be Down!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>It's been a long time since I've seen a movie in the movie theaters (having a one-year old will do that to you).  I've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (I'm looking at you, Entertainment Weekly).  When we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  And that movie was Iron Man.<br /><br />By now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire Tony Stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  Instead of making weapons, Stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.<br /><br />Iron Man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that Stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like Middle Eastern terrorists.  All this drama is tempered by Robert Downey Jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  His keeper is Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges with suitable cranky menace).  Stark's assistant is the alliterative Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly na?ve and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.<br /><br />At its best, Iron Man features Stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  The theater I was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that Downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  I imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.<br /><br />There are plot holes. Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences. Stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around "repulsor lift" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. But if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?<br /><br />Iron Man keeps the plot tight. Unlike Spider-Man, there are no extraneous supervillains. Unlike X-Men, every character is there for a reason.  But the big payoff for Iron Man is the ending.  Iron Man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  Then it leaves you begging for more.<br /><br />And there IS more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  Unfortunately, I didn't read enough spoilers to realize I should have waited, so we missed it.  So for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>I have to concur with others, Robert Downey Jr as a superhero?  Yet it does work and he gives a terrific performance.  Now that Marvel has it's fate in it's own hands, we should see some positive results and nothing as bad as Daredevil, Elektra, the Punisher and the Fantastic Four!  IRON MAN is the first of their own films and their plans are ambitious to say the least.  No film in 2009 but 2010 will have IRON MAN 2 and THOR. 2011 will have CAPTAIN AMERICA and THE AVENGERS.  It will be interesting to see if the latter beats JLA to the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Just as Iron Man is the king of Marvel's second-tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's "Iron Man" rules over the second-tier Marvel film adaptations.  Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" series and Bryan Singer's "X-Men" films, "Iron Man" rules over all others with an iron fist.  It all rests on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr., who portrays titular hero Tony Stark with all the reckless ego which so many now associate with Americans.  Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially-wealthy family, it is he who pushes his corporation to its limits and who ultimately goes beyond those limits to become one of the shiniest superheroes.  He's further separated from his peers by the fact that he doesn't live his life in painful rememberance, and thus it's not pain that motivates him to do good.  What does motivate him, probably not even he knows.<br /><br />Like its protagonist, "Iron Man" is not one of the deepest superhero films to hit the screen.  Unlike "Batman Begins" (the sequel to which, July's "The Dark Knight," stands as "Iron Man"'s fiercest competition), "Iron Man" does not delve deep into the psychosis of its hero, opting instead to focus on his struggles as an up-and-coming superhero.  Stark's origins are explored in a gritty fashion not unlike "Batman Begins."  The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.  Favreau was an interesting choice to direct, given that his past filmography is highlighted by two family films, "Elf" and "Zathura," but he doesn't disappoint.  Stark's non-iron-clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.<br /><br />But far more sturdy is Robert Downey Jr.  Like Favreau, Downey was an unlikely choice for the film, but Downey elevates the film to a level it could never have reached led by another actor.  In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.  His dedication to the role and love of the character shines through every one of Stark's smarmy remarks, apparent in every arrogant move he makes.  Downey turns a character who could easily lose the audience's sympathy into a guy one can't help but love.  It's hard not to get excited about Downey's cameo in "The Incredible Hulk," Marvel's next movie, released in mid-June.<br /><br />Though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.  Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.  One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.  Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes - and who, as any fan of the comic knows, will wind up as Stark's iron-clad sidekick, War Machine.<br /><br />The most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.  Bridges, perhaps best known as "The Dude" from the Coen brothers' "The Big Lebowski," isn't usually the bad guy.  But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!  As Stark's partner-turned-archenemy Obadiah Stone, Bridges exhudes a ruthlessness and complete lack of morality not seen in any other cinematic supervillain.  His performance is what Kevin Spacey should have aspired to when he portrayed Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns."  It's a welcome change from the over-the-top behavior most supervillains are so fond of.<br /><br />Superhero films tend to be fond of heavy effects; after all, most of the films require them.  But the effect of the effects tends to be lessened by underdeveloped or overused computer-generated imagery (case in point: the last superhero picture, "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer").  Not in "Iron Man."  There's the inevitable amount of C.G.I. effects, but the effects have been precisely designed.  They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's "Transformers."<br /><br />All this would mean little if the movie was not based upon a decent script.  This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).  It never takes itself too seriously, but just seriously enough, choosing well-timed witticism over self-conscious grandeur (as in "Daredevil" or the last "X-Men" movie).  It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.  Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam-era weapons designer to a military designer for the Iraq War.  But while it appeals to fans and non-fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.  Now that the film has grossed a stunning amount of money at the box office, a release date for "Iron Man 2" has been set for April 30, 2010, and a second sequel is ready as soon as that one's finished.  Bring it on.  "Iron Man" may not be an excellent film like "Spider-Man 2," "Batman Begins," or even the original "Superman," but it's a darn good superhero film.  And if not as sturdy as steel, it is certainly as shiny as iron.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>After being captured in Afghanistan and forced, against his will, to build a particularly nasty type of missile for the enemy, billionaire inventor and weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) instead builds himself a super-suit and escapes. Upon returning to the United States, Stark improves on his super-suit and then sets about trying to correct all of the damage he has done through the sales of weapons.<br /><br />I did not expect to like "Iron Man". I have seen a lot of superhero films in my life and I usually find that the acting is second-rate and the endings are irritatingly open-ended. The only reason why I went to see "Iron Man" at all was because my father wanted to see it and I just went along to keep him company. I'm now glad that I did, because it is a surprisingly good film.<br /><br />I have always considered Robert Downey Jr. to be an excellent actor (I still think he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for "Chaplin") and his performance in "Iron Man" is no exception. Downey turns in one of his best performances in years and is ably supported by Jeff Bridges as the film's villain. Furthermore, the film's ending provides enough closure so that this film can stand by itself without sequels (although, I am certain that the film's makers would be more than happy to continue the franchise).<br /><br />The film's script is filled with the sort of light-hearted bantering that is typical of a Robert Downey Jr. film but also has a point to make about the culpability of weapons manufacturers. I particularly liked the fact that this film was set in the real world, rather than in a universe that exists almost parallel to our reality, like "Batman" or "Superman". My main criticism of this film is that it is just so predictable. Some of the plot twists I could see coming for almost an hour before they eventuated.<br /><br />Overall, this film is definitely worth your time and money. "Iron Man" is targeted at a more mature audience than films such as "Spiderman" or "X-Men", but it still should appeal to viewers of all ages. And if you do go and see it, make sure you stay until the end of the credits. Although the credits are very long, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, those who do sit through them are rewarded by an extra scene at the end of them, which is definitely worth the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>If Superman has Lex Luthor and Spider-Man has Dr. Octopus and Batman has the Joker, who exactly is Iron Man's archenemy? He may engage in ferocious battle with an equally ironclad baddie near the end of the film, but I'm going to go in a much more existential direction and say that his greatest enemy is himself. In Jon Favreau's "Iron Man," billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) eventually realizes that the ultra high tech weapons he designed have done much more harm than good, so in a way, the climactic fight scene at the end was his own doing. What a perfect display of irony, especially for a superhero trying to free himself of his infamous reputation as a war-mongering mass murderer. Where exactly is the line drawn? At what point can weapons of mass destruction ever be considered a path to peace?<br /><br />You don't normally associate moral dilemmas of this magnitude with a comic book adaptation. The thing is, the idea of a suited man fighting against an adversary plotting to take over the world is not lost in "Iron Man"--it just takes on a much different form. In this case the adversaries are war and injustice, both of which shake their threatening fists at the world every hour of every day. What is lost in "Iron Man" is the idea that a superhero has to be a perfect, emotionless drone that tirelessly fights for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Even with his money, his brilliance, and his specially designed suit, Stark is about as flawed as the average Joe walking down the street. He's stubborn, cocky, just a smidge arrogant, and after being held captive in Afghanistan for three months, he's far too willing place himself in scenarios he may not be ready for.<br /><br />Before being held captive, Stark was a smooth-talking businessman that designed the most advanced weapons the American military has ever seen. While in Afghanistan introducing a new missile-launcher called the Jericho, he's attacked and kidnapped by a militant group of Afghani extremists. They demand that he manufacture the Jericho for them, and since they somehow have gained access to many of his weapons, this shouldn't be too difficult. But even with a metal device implanted in his chest (supposedly to keep the shrapnel in his body from reaching his heart), he refuses to be under their control; with the help of an Afghani scientist (Shaun Toub), Stark secretly builds a prototype metal suit that can throw flames and shoot bullets and protect him from enemy fire. An elaborate escape scene leads to his rescue, which paves the way for a hilarious moment back in Los Angeles: as he sits in a limo refusing medical treatment, he demands that someone get him an American cheeseburger.<br /><br />Stark's experience triggers a newfound sense of responsibility, one that inspires him to shut down the weapons division of his company and focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. His colleague--Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges)--doesn't go along with this for reasons that are expected in comic book adaptations, such as being power-hungry. This doesn't stop Stark, who begins redesigning his metal suit in the comfort of his luxurious, technologically advanced Malibu estate. After installing a few upgrades, like rocket boosters and missile launchers, he tests his new red and gold suit by flying back to Afghanistan and attacking the same militant group that kidnapped him. How convenient that he happens to arrive just as they're raiding a village and taking civilians captive; superheroes save the day strictly because of convenient plot devices, and that's one of the reasons why we like these movies so much.<br /><br />With the help of his personal assistant, the anxious but highly capable Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his friend, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark spends the rest of the film trying to put an end to his past reputation, first by finding out how the Afghanis received crates of his weapons, second by battling against Stane, who has let his position in the company get the better of him. Yes, it's all enhanced by a wealth of impressive special effects, but that's not the point: Stark is introduced as a man who has everything while at the same time having nothing, and most of this stems from his unwillingness to acknowledge his effect on the world--he essentially got rich making and selling weapons, devices that kill and maim. Now that he's seen the error of his ways, he wants to redeem himself by fighting against the monster of his own creation. He does this all while maintaining a smug yet charming attitude, which is good because a superhero should be allowed to have a little personality.<br /><br />Even better than that is not hiding that personality behind an alter ego, one that behaves as an obvious polar opposite to the hero. This story may be pure comic book fantasy, but Tony Stark brings a realism to it that's refreshing, more so than anything ever seen from Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne combined. It's essentially because of him that "Iron Man" transcends anything I've previously expected from a comic book adaptation. He says at a press conference that he's not the superhero type, and that's really funny because I thought the same thing about Robert Downey, Jr. when I saw the first ads for "Iron Man"; at the time, it seemed unlikely that he would be the type to fly alongside jetfighters or to shoot highly explosive missiles at tanks. But it's obvious now--he was exactly what was needed to realize the reworked idea of hero versus enemy. A lot of cool digital effects weren't a bad touch, either.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Standards have been rising in the comic adaptation genre, and the new Iron Man comes in at the top of the range. This is one of the best comic adaptations ever, and a very good action flick in itself. It gets the summer movie season off to a flying start - if the rest of the season's movies rise to this level, it's going to be a great year.<br /><br />Effects are everythig you could ask, with lots of explosions, fire, and other good enterainment - but that's the norm these days. Plenty sets this apart from the pack. Acting is way up there, as the star-laden cast would have you expect. Scripting offers a blend of humor, action, sneering bad guys, and simmering romance that's hard to beat. It gives Robert Downey Jr. lots to work with, including an outstanding aide in the form (the lovely form) of Paltrow's "Pepper Potts." The main bad guys are the current evil-du-jour, mideastern madmen - so recognizable that they don't even need motives. Heck, even the industrial robots have more personality than the entire casts of some comic flicks.<br /><br />One of the most implausible of plot turns really brought this to life for me: Stark's sudden rethinking of the multi-generation arms business. As an engineer and as one who's tried (not always successfully) to keep my work out of weapons, that exerted more of a pull than there was any rational reason to expect. But that's way too serious for this movie. Even if it jumps the season by a few weeks, it's great summer fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Being Marvel Studios' first self-financed film, Iron Man is a pure treat from start to finish.  I won't bother going into the storyline, since most already know it by now considering how smashing a success the film proved to be at the box-office, but it does go without saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel film to see the light of day, outshined only by X2: X-Men United.  Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as billionaire industrialist and weapons developer Tony Stark, and Jon Favreau is definitely the right man for the job in helming the film.  It's perfectly paced and pays wonderous homages to the classic comics that it's adapted from, all the while featuring an ending that have you simply salivating for what's to come not only in the realm of Iron Man, but of Marvel as a whole.  As a superhero film, Iron Man is definitely close to the top (but nowhere near The Dark Knight, which takes the notion of the superhero movie and turns it on it's head), with the only drawback for me personally being that I just couldn't get into Terrence Howard as James Rhodes.  I don't know what it is, I jsut don't find him all that well-casted as Rhodes as I do everyone else in the film.  Still though, Iron Man is a pure blast for nearly it's entire running time, and here's hoping that Favreau, Downey, and co. can keep the magic coming.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>Marvel Comics, like it's counterpart nemesis DC, has had it's share of hits and misses when it comes to translating it's superhero catalog to the big screen. While successes like Spider-Man and XMen tore it's way to the top with ease, there's also the ones that got clobbered like The Punisher and the first attempt at Hulk in 2003. But with CGI technology reaching closer heights than ever before, now Hollywood has the ability to truly turn those ink and color panels to life, and no opportunity has been better received than with Iron Man.<br /><br />Tony Stark is basically a war profiteer that he and his company Stark Industries creates and manufacturers weapons so the good ole USA can win in a variety of battles, and in these reflective times, the battle currently is in the Middle East. When he himself is captured during a weapons demonstration that leaves numerous deadly pieces of shrapnel permanently close to his heart, he and a fellow scientific prisoner implant a device in his chest to keep them from reaching that area & in return becomes a major power source. When the captors want Stark to create an ultimate bomb, Stark turns the tables and creates a bodysuit of armor to escape and in return he realizes that he cannot go on in building weapons that usually just falls in the wrong hands, and unknowingly to Stark, by his business partner whose only concern is the almighty dollar and Tony's demise. So with his new and improved version of the suit that helped his escape, he's gonna beat them at their own game and find his superhero within.<br /><br />Let's state one thing:this is a GREAT cast. Robert Downey Jr not only looks the part of Tony Stark, but with his natural ego-driven comicial flair, he was born to play this role. Even the supporting cast of Jeff Bridges (who with his shaven head & beard might be hard to recognize), Terrence Howard, and a surprisingly Gwyneth Paltrow, who you'd figure would do a role like this in the early stages of her career not the opposite, bring the story along with a great pace. There's really not a weak link in the bunch. As for the CGI effects, of which most times I personally dread, they come off very natural and believable here. Where as in 2008's The Incredible Hulk when the lead character was of organic origin, Iron Man is pure solid-looking steel and because of that fact can be replicated much better without any doubt if the object is really on the screen or not. Visually all parties pulled off an amazing feat with Iron Man and honestly without flesh and blood to get in the way, the CGI does what at this point it can truly do best.<br /><br />Even though this review is for the single-disc edition, Paramount still gives you quite a value here than just a typical bare-bones disc. With a film presentation that has one of the best looking and sounding standard definition combos I've ever seen, they also include on it over twenty-four minutes of extended & deleted scenes which at least half of are worthy of a director's cut. There's even an Easter Egg hidden here maybe giving you a preview of what extras the 2 discer might have in store for you. So for fans on a limited income, or those that just want the movie, you won't go wrong by buying the smaller content version. While a commentary by Downey would have been nice (neither version has one), there still is plenty to enjoy with this presentation.<br /><br />Overall this was a great origin superhero film that didn't drag one bit within it's 2 hours and 2 minutes. Great cast, great story, and a bonus ending scene (featuring a surprising cameo) that will make you demand more in the near future. And unlike The Dark Knight, that took itself way too seriously, Iron Man still mentions problematic issues concerning war today and thrilling us all along the way.<br /><br />P.S.: The two-disc version has extensive behind the scenes and interviews with the film's cast and crew that in my opinion could have brought my rating a good half point or more if that was the version I chose to see as of this writing.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>"Iron Man" is good.  Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.<br /><br />Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...<br /><br />I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in "The Incredible Hulk.")<br /><br />Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, "Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?"  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.<br /><br />So go see "Iron Man."  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, "Iron Man" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.  You have to go see it for that, if nothing else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>Iron Man is simply one of the best. Forget the sorry excuses for movies that were Spider Man 3, or The Fantastic Four, forget all that nonsense. Iron Man stands with the best, a true revival for the super hero genera on par with the great super hero movies such as Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins. What a way to kick off the summer season that will also see long awaited films such as the new Indiana Jones movie, the second Batman film The Dark Night, and the redo of The Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />The film starts off with billionaire/genius weapons developer Tony Stark riding in the back of a Humvee in the Afghan desert, havening successfully impressed the military by blowing up a whole mountain with his new Jericho Missile. From the start of this film Tony is one of the MOST likable guys to ever grace the big screen. He's charming, smart, witty, funny, hardcore, and a bit of a ladies man. One memorable scene was when a girl Toney was with woke up in his house alone and found his personal assistance, Pepper Pots, with her dry-cleaning.<br />"Ten years and he still has you doing his dry cleaning?"<br />"I do anything he requires of me," Potts replies, "even, occasionally, taking out the trash."<br />As he eloquently puts it; "They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire, well I respectfully disagree. I prefer the one you only have to fire once. That's how America does it, that's how my dad did it, and it's worked out pretty well so far." Now tell me you wouldn't like to hang out with THAT guy.<br /><br />Unfortunately for our hero the Humvee he's riding comes under fire from Afghan rebels and he is taken hostage and forced to build one of his new weapons for his captures (after refusing of course and getting water boarded). But he has a few tricks up his sleeves and manages to escape by building, you guest it, an Iron Man.<br /><br />Far and away the best thing this movie accomplishes is creating likable characters who may not be as relatable as, say, Peter Parker, but who are definitely just as cool or sympathetic. As stated before, Tony Stark is the very definition of cool, but he isn't the only character who steals the show. His lady friend, oddly named Pepper Potts (okay, who was the genius who decided to name her Pepper Potts?) is perfect in her role as personal assistant/love interest with all her witty dialog and charm. The Afghan man Tony meets while in captivity is also a great contrast to Starks cocky and care free attitude; plus their conversations with one another are some of the best you'll see in a super hero movie, period.<br /><br />The only problem I had, and it's a small one, is that the action in this film was a little lacking. The escape from Afghanistan in the first Iran Man was great, and the battle between Iron Man and the Afghan militia later on was also incredible, but when it came to Iron Man VS really big Iron Man, the outcome was somewhat of a disappointment; the reason being that we never got to see both fighting at their best. One was always at a disadvantage during the whole fight. To see both go at it at their best would have been nothing short of amazing, unfortunately though we never got to see that.<br /><br />If you're a super hero movie fan then you HAVE to see this flick. Iron Man stands proud with the best in its genera and simply blows out of the water most badly made adoptions. Oh, and one more thing, if your willing to wait ten minutes for the credits to finish there is a thirty second scene at the end that may be worth seeing as it sets the stage for a sequel pretty well.<br /><br />Re-watch Value; VERY high.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>Robert Downey, Jr. does about as good a job with the lead character as anyone could, and the acting is pretty good overall, but the special effects are just OK, the plot is somewhat juvenille, and the portrayal of the Afghan bad guys is laughably stereotypical.  I watched this movie with the family (not my choice of movie), and it wasn't a total waste of time, but I do wish the time had been better spent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This is the movie that kick started the Marvel Universe Phase One. This is a awesome movie and Robert Downey Jr is the one and only Iron Man. This will be the role he is remembered for. He does a excellent job playing Tony Stark. I had this movie on DVD, but it was on sell at Walmart for 10 dollars on blu ray, so I picked out up along with The Avengers 3D blu ray, and if you haven't seen The Avengers yet be sure to do that, it is a can't miss movie. Back to Iron Man, the blu ray version looks very nice and was well worth the upgrade. I enjoy the story line of IM1 a little more than IM2. I am not saying IM2 is a bad movie, cause it is not, I just enjoyed seeing how Tony Stark progressed into Iron Man. The action in this movie is fantastic and the CGI is incredible! I think the CGI along with Downey's performance is what really makes this movie believable. If you haven't seen this yet, make sure you do, you don't want to miss out on this blockbuster, and if you are wondering if you should upgrade, if you can find it for a reasonable price go ahead, you won't be disappointed!</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>Now I'm not a huge Marvel comics fan, but i have to say.

Jon Favreau directs with a verve that doesn't forget people as he keeps the super hero format intact.  Robert Downey plays Iron Man with a great sense of humor and as Tony Stark the weapons magnate who is his alter ego.  The movie begins in Afghanistan and Tony Stark is held hostage and escapes by making a protective suit to ward off deadly weapons.  He perfects this suit into the Iron Man we know and love in the movie.  Pepper Pots is a great servant and a very pretty woman whom he ignores as often as he can.  Terrence Howard gets to play the sidekick in a fun way.  Jeff Bridges finally gets a bad guy role.  What fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>Easily the best movie based on a Marvel character. Not only does it take the idea of a superhero into new territory, but it also manages to throw in everything lovable about the new found genre. Most of this movie's heart and charm is owed to Robert Downey Jr., who completely ownes the character in every way possible. The reason Iron Man has become a household name so suddenly is because it was acted so well and made as realistic as possible. It also takes the best parts of the source material and makes it into something familiar, but also new (much like Batman Begins). John Favreau managed to get down the comedy without making the movie become one. When this wants to be, it is a fantastic action movie with lots of great explosions and special effects. However, this also knows how to invest time in its characters and plot so we care about what will happen. The attention to detail is incredible.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>Robert Downey is quickly impressing me that he may be the most versatile actor of the past few years. When you compare this role with Sherlock Holmes and his performance in Tropic Thunder, you'll understand what I mean if you didn't immediately. All three roles are very different, yet he delivered them expertly, and with a combination of real drama and real humor in each of the three.<br /><br />In "Iron Man", he elevates what could have been just another comic book hero movie with his completely engaging performance. Let's face it, even tho I was a comic book fan, and like these movies, their numbers in recent years has approached overkill. The first Spiderman movie was revolutionary, but the next two were nothing more than continuations of the first. The first Hulk movie was wretched, and even tho the second was an improvement, Edward Norton didn't bring the personality to the character that Bill Bixby did in the TV series. The Fantastic Four was interesting but quickly forgotten The X-Men series was a cut above, and so was Iron Man.<br /><br />However, without Downey's performance Iron Man might have tanked as badly as the first Hulk. The story is nothing very surprising, and the "surprise" and ending are nothing but predictable. However, Downey's Tony Stark is alive. When he feels we feel. When he seduces a reporter, its all very natural and predatory. When he has troubles with the suit, his alarm infuses us as does the slapstick of his early mistakes. He is charming, infuriating, and at times completely blind to what is going on around him. All very human.<br /><br />I hold back one star because the story REALLY could have used a lot more imagination. Downey's performance almost hides that flaw ... almost.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>Loved it ...<br /><br />Comics, superhero, corporate greed, karma<br />What's not to like?</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>Iron Man is a rockin', sockin' fan-freakin-tastic superhero film that by far outshines darn near every other superhero fantasy film release thus far. Almost. While Iron Man may be an amazing film, it's worlds apart tonally from DC's The Dark Knight, an equally amazing film. Iron Man is flashy, witty and adventurous, whereas The Dark Knight is darker, grittier, and far more mature. Superhero fantasy film fans are really going to be split down the middle on this; I've come across quite a few people that claim Iron Man is the best comic book flick ever made while others insist The Dark Knight was an instant cinematic masterpiece with more substance. That's going to be up to all of you.<br /><br />Concerning acting, brilliant stuff, every single actor came strong and delivered their dialogue superbly! I think the only performance I wasn't thrilled with was Terrence Howard's; he just didn't pop for me, I'm almost glad to see him leave the sequel. He's a capable actor but I'm confident Don Cheadle will give Rhodes a new dimension and, hopefully, his alter-ego War Machine as well. Speaking of War Machine, the suit cameo looked awesome; you just know it's going to be pimped to the hilt in the next installment.<br /><br />This movie's CG was mesmerizing and production design was breathtaking, this is everything a good comic book fantasy film should be. It ups the ante on every single front, especially the phenomenal dialogue. Favreau is without a doubt a capable director and this film in his hands was masterful.

Not just that: today's crummy offerings (mostly involving silly brainless teens falling into comic books or video-/Hasbro-based schlock) suck beyond all recognition. That is why IRON MAN takes the prize in my book.<br /><br />As most of my generation and the following two, I grew up reading comics. Of all, Marvel Comics were my favorites. It is a thrill each time a Marvel character is done justice. In IRON MAN, nothing disappoints. In spite of today's grand cine-tech, this is a seamless, superbly executed work of art.<br /><br />Featuring the dramedy-slapstick talents of Robert Downey, a growling villain in the form of Jeff Bridges, we have as a perfect spice the support of Gwyneth Paltrow and Terence Howard. This film will show you what "supporting role" is supposed to mean.<br /><br />Though there are multinational (presumably Muslim) terrorists, who give Tony Stark his Iron Man initiative, this film is lighthearted, fun, never overbearing and funny as hell. Thanks to this, Downey got offered Sherlock Holmes, and IRON MAN really is his 'comeback'. He reins in Tony Stark's pathos and gives us a strong, determined man who is not afraid to grow. Jeff Bridges' villain shows the opposite side of that coin brilliantly.<br /><br />I loved hearing Paul Bettany's sexy voice as Stark's computer Jervis, and the inventions, gadgetry, even weapons were a fantastic treat. When I think of the hatchet job done by Christian Bale to BATMAN....<br /><br />Here, IRON MAN is overtly political but not in any patronizing, annoying way. Stan Lee has always been 'political' marching to his own drummer's beat, and this movie reflects that better than any other I've seen so far. Political can only take you so far: the rest had better be entertaining and just plain good. And IRON MAN IS GOOD!!<br /><br />Now that its sequel is floating around, get and enjoy this unique film. There are explosions, but everything looks and feels so new here. That is a level of skill I just don't see anymore. Samuel L. Jackson gives the perfect "this-is-about-to-get-big" cameo at the end, and I nearly jumped out of my seat at that promise--which I can only hope has been delivered as well as this delivered.<br /><br />IRON MAN will be a classic, mark my words.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Iron Man" stars the irresistible Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a rich weapons designer who eventually ends up captured by terrorists in Afghanistan.

It's a very character-driven movie, which sets it apart from your average run-of-the-mill action flicks. Downey is charming and absolutely perfectly cast in this role, and he has amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays Stark's assistance/platonic love interest, Pepper. "Iron Man" is a hilarious, exciting movie that will definitely make me buy a ticket to see the sequel when it arrives in theatres two weeks from today.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>In the normal course of my work in this space I don't generally review current commercial films, except when they provide some kind of political or social comment that is in line with those aims. Or when I am feeling a little whimsical or wicked after watching a "light" film that is just pure entertainment. That turns out to be the case here.<br /><br />Let's face it, how can one seriously knock a film that is based on a comic book character?  Reading about or viewing such characters was virtually a rite of passage for any child, right? Here whiz kid (or elder kid) and mega-rich defense contractor Tony Stark, played very nicely by Robert Downey, Jr., just happens to have had a "conversion" experience in of all places, modern day Afghanistan (if one can accept that as a correct term in that benighted country) as a result of a very close call with the results of his own weaponry at the hands of a Taliban-like organization.<br /><br />As a result, Brother Stark will not, however,  `go gentle into that good night' and begin to preach some form of pacifism but will turn the nature of modern nasty and brutish  combat on its head and return, via high technology, to the good old medieval days of individual knightly combat. One on one, up close and personal.  Needless to say, that knight will be none other than the whiz kid Stark. Throw in a little off-hand old-fashioned chaste romance with his fair damsel, oops, Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and you have the makings of a very good...comic book story. Kudos for that part.<br /><br />No kudos, however, for the little premise that was always behind these super-hero adventure stories. Wait on an individual `savior" to come by and save us from ourselves. If we wait for the "white knight" to come and save us from this wicked old world we are in serious trouble. Although this film was fun to watch and a nice spoof I'll stick with the mass plebeian struggle to turn those swords into ploughshares. And by the way, individual knight or massed troops isn't it about time to get out, way out, of Afghanistan now. The comic books, and their very appealing characters, are of no use for use on that proposition though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>Undoubtedly Blu Ray reference material - great audio and video.  The story is a big mixed though.  The SX are great, but the story seems forced and artificial.  I'm not a comic book fan at all, and do not know the comic iron man story, so i'm likely at a disadvantage.  however, the antagonist seems to just be there and be a formidable foe, no real development to that plot evolution.  at the same time, this is an action movie first and foremost, so perhaps i'm asking too much.  it just wasn't climactic - the final battle happens, and its not satisfying. otherwise, downey is awesome, the dialog is fun, etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>When Marvel and Paramount first started promoting "Iron Man," I expected it to be nothing more than CGI sequence after CGI sequence showing you just how far FX have come.

Wow, what a nice surprise to walk out of the theater feeling as if I'd just witnessed a solid drama interspersed with excellent FX and action sequences.  Robert Downey, Jr. makes the lead role of Tony Stark/Iron Man his own.  Much like Michael Keaton when he suited up as Batman, I admit that I had my doubts when it was revealed that Downey, Jr. would head up this film.  Instead, Tony Stark comes across as one of the most believable characters to grace a comic book film adaptation.  He's a jerk, highly intelligent and self-centered.  When a life-changing (and almost life-taking) incident occurs, he returns to his home as a new man hoping to right the wrongs that his company has done for so many years.  Being a comic book film, naturally, a villain steps up to put a stop to Stark for both financial and egotistical gains.  The result is an all-out slugfest sure to please even the harshest critic.<br /><br />The cast is solid, from Terrence Howard as Rhodes to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.  Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's primary business associate in the weapons business.<br /><br />The actual suit(s) that make up Iron Man and his enemy look great on the screen.  The action sequences are brilliant, especially one involving civilian traffic.  Another highlight is Stark's home, which gives the Batcave a run for its money as far as gadgets go.<br /><br />Even though the FX are notched up quite a bit, they take a step back to the plot.  This is one of the most character-driven comic adaptations to hit the screen in a long time.  Perhaps it's the quality of the cast or the direction of Jon Favreau or a combination of both, but this story just doesn't feel like an ordinary comic book film.  The story is interesting, funny at just the right times, and never falls back on action or FX to bail out a scene.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is a very, very good film.  It's a comic book adaptation that doesn't feel or act like a comic book adaptation.  Despite the bright red and gold armor, you'll find yourself more concerned with the man inside of the suit.  That makes a good film in my book.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is necessary.  There's a tad bit of language and one swift roll in the hay between two characters.  The action is explosive, literally, and some younger kids may be put off by a few of the deaths in the film.  If you do have younger children who want to see this film (and I'm sure there are plenty), I think that a nine or ten year-old could view this with a little guidance from mom and dad.<br /><br />Highly recommended and hopefully a sign of things to come this summer film season.  Also, like everybody else seems to be warning, make sure to sit through the entire credits for a brief hint at "Iron Man 2" or perhaps an entirely new film that'll make fanboys jump with glee.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>Cool. That is one word that describes this movie. Exciting and fun are another two. Robert Downey Jr. was nothing but excellent at playing Iron Man. He exhibited wit, intelligence, that playboy charm and charisma: the works for a superhero. Although the plot was not strong, and there were a few holes or weak areas, the movie was excellent. But, the plot did not matter that much. This is an origin story and it was all about the characters, they are the ones that move the story forward.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was one cold blooded arms dealer, and he was great at it. I just wish we would have seen more of him. Terrence Howard was ok, not the best part of the movie. Paltrow was cute in her very capable performance. But the story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man, and it was good. The action sequences and the special effects were excellent but did not dominate the film, which I was grateful form.<br /><br />This movie managed what many movies have not been able to do: balance. The action and special effects are enough to keep the movie going and highly entertaining, but the character development is what drives it forward, what gives it form and meaning. This movie is a must see, it is fun, funny as well, and has excellent performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Director Jon Favreau (Zathura & Elf) brings Marvel Comics' armored superhero to the big screen in the first-rate comic book adventure "Iron Man". While demonstrating his company's newest weapon system, billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by Middle Eastern terrorists and forced to build a powerful weapon. Instead, Stark secretly develops a suit of armor to escape his captives. Upon returning to the United States, a renewed Tony Stark is determined to amend his company's mistakes and improves his armor to become the high-tech superhero Iron Man. "Iron Man" is a superb crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date. The latest comic book adaptation delivers a well-paced storyline, excellent visual effects, good action sequences, a solid cast and great humor. Downey's entertaining performance as Tony Stark is one of the movie's biggest strengths. "Iron Man" also stars Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Academy Award-winner Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />"Iron Man" arrives on Blu-Ray with a fully loaded 2-disc Ultimate Edition that's a must-have for any Marvel Comics fan. The 2008 blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is very impressive but not quite perfect. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is excellent. "Iron Man" Ultimate Edition features two great documentaries: "I Am Iron Man" that offers an in-depth behind-the-scenes look in the development of the film, and "The Invincible Iron Man" that explores the origins of the Marvel Comics' character. Other bonus materials include four picture galleries, 11 deleted and extended scenes, theatrical trailers, "The Onion: Iron Man Trailer" gag short, actor Robert Downey Jr's screen test and "Hall of Armor" interactive feature. Overall, "Iron Man" Ultimate Edition scores an "A".</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>What makes Iron Man a great movie is that it is virtually void of those moments where you go, "That could never happen." And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an "iron" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but also gives Tony Stark the ability to fly.<br /><br />I've seen comparisons between the detail and...well...just plain awesomeness that was abundant in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC6A3E">Batman Begins</a> and Iron Man. And that comparison would not be incorrect. While I'd agree that both had great action and made viewers believe that these superheros actually existed, Batman Begins was more dark while Iron Man kept you giggling at Tony Stark's wise-guy personality...which is true to the comic book versions of the characters.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of a wise-guy than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark! And the rest of the cast and acting in the movie were terrific.<br /><br />Iron Man takes you from Stark's creation of the gold-titanium-alloy suit to his confrontation with those that would see Stark Industries commit treason. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing will probably put Jon Favreau in the sought-after category.<br /><br />The good news is that Iron Man will be back, but in what capacity is the question. It's well known that Stark (Downey, Jr) has a cameo in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. And it's rumored that the actors in Iron Man have all signed on for two sequels (at the time of this writing Director Favreau has not). But will Iron Man's return be solo, or perhaps with some of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828">Avenging</a> buddies? Either way...I can't wait.<br /><br />I will definitely pick up Iron Man for my collection. I don't know about the theaters in your area, but the theaters in mine don't even come close to the picture and sound quality that I get from my home theater. I'm not bragging; I'm just saying that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168ML1G">Iron Man</a> will be a movie that goes into my Blu Ray player the day it's released.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>I believe one of the best things to happen to the big screen was when they started filming Marvel Comics. Honestly, I'll go see an action-adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre. And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.<br /><br />The story in brief:  when Star Industries CEO and wunderkind engineer Tony Stark (Downey, Jr) is kidnapped by terrorists, he builds an Iron Man suit to escape rather than creating the missile they demanded.<br /><br />Back at home, he decides to convert Stark into a more politically correct company and 'make peace instead of war.'  He hadn't reckoned with the terrorists re-arming and deceit from his own camp.<br /><br />The acting's great. I think Terrence Howard (Colonel Rhodes) is going to be the next Denzel Washington.  He's a good actor and easy on the eyes. Jeff Bridges broke out of type and served as a pretty amazing Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />The imagery is fabulous. Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.  His fellow captive, Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub) was an interesting and sad character, such a waste of a brilliant man.<br /><br />The soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images. Okay, I wish they'd used Black Sabbath's version of "Iron Man" for the soundtrack, but that's already been used by both "Detroit Rock City" and "Lords of Dogtown."<br /><br />Best of all, for a vertigo sufferer like me, there was minimal monkey cam.  I could follow almost all the action without a problem.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed "Iron Man" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Multi-billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) is the owner of a successful weapons industry. During one day in Afghanistan, he demonstrates for a group of U.S. soldiers a different kind of weapon that works successfully and gets kidnapped by terrorists as he's held captive and forced to make the weapons for them. Instead he uses his brilliant brains and creates a special armour-suit that helps him escape from hell and is sent back to the U.S., of course his friend Obadia (Jeff Bridges) wants to take over the corporation for himself and makes a deadly conspiracy. Thus Stark creates a more advanced, industructable and more powerful suit that makes him into "Iron Man" in which he serves to protect the innocent and fight evil.<br /><br />Intelligent, exciting and thrilling sci-fi actioner is based on a Marvel Comic Book and is the first great comic book movie of the year next to "Dark Knight". Gwyneth Palthrow co-stars as Stark's sexy secretary Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Colnel Rhodes, it's the greatest Marvel Movie since "X2" or "Spider-Man 2". Downy Jr. definitely nailed the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man well just like Christopher Reeve was to Superman, Tobey Mcguire to Spider-Man and Christian Bale was to Batman. Jeff Bridges made a belivable and excellent villain here in this motion picture, the special effects by ILM and Stan Winston are just outstanding including the acting. It stays true to the origins of the comic books even though a little of the origin is changed to a modern time, it's a truly satisfying and smart superhero movie that knows how to please the audience and critics alike thanks to the magic of it's smart script, great acting and fantastic action sequences with a nifty suprise at the end of the credits of this movie.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray is mindblowingly fantastic with it's nicely detailed picture and sound that will blow you away. The extras include a 7 part making of Documentary, featurette, Blu-Ray exclusives like Iron Man IQ Test and hall of armor, the actors Process, deleted and extended scenes, a sneek preview of the upcoming Iron Man animated series, Still gallery, and screen-test.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>The big screen was blessed this year with two superlative comic book adaptations, "Iron Man" and "The Dark Knight".  What's not to like about "Iron Man"?  Good acting, characters that are full bodied and make sense, good visual effects and edge-of-your-seat action.  What's my reservation about the flick?  It feels like an incomplete film.  It seems like it's mostly exposition.  By the time the flick really heats up it's over.  It's like the makers of the "Iron Man" were so confident in it's success that they're setting you up for the sequel which, now with the film's success, is inevitable.  I might elevate this film to five stars if the sequel's any good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Robert Downey Jr. has done some good movies these past few years; including some pretty esoteric stuff (Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang - Wonder Boys - Tropic Thunder) but he sometimes borders on the outrageous here as Tony Stark - In a good way.  His experimentation in the lab with his robots by his side, was particularly funny. He delivers a somewhat cool, calm yet lackadaisical approach to things when the pressure is on. He did everything right in this movie and I think that's why he's endeared millions more fans because of it.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was extremely annoying and obnoxious as Obadiah "Stane" (was that a subtle hint?) and the "Iron Monger" who battles Iron Man in the final sequence. Which by the way, reminded me of RoboCop 2 (RoboCop vs Cain) and Edward Norton's "Hulk" vs. Tim Roth's "Abomination" battles.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Iron Man" is a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Casting Robert Downey Jr as the very personality flawed billionaire military weapons manufacturer Tony Stark was just perfect.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the movie follows the transformation of Tony Stark from selfish (not sure he actually changes much there) playboy to a full fledged Marvel Superhero (but as Pepper says, "You are NOT a superhero").<br /><br />Obviously this type of movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but the humor, action, and special effects keep the little issues way in the back of your mind.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie, Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>When I was a teenager, I read both Marvel and DC Comics.  My favorite heroes were respectively Iron Man and Batman.  I have yet to see Dark Knight yet, but from what I hear, Iron Man is the more positive, feel good side.<br /><br />The best summer movies are ones that wow you with special effects but also have performances that captivate you, and this one has that.  Sometimes a movie is overloaded with star power to draw you in; with this movie, the stars were selected because of their talent.  When I saw this movie in the theater, the only actor I expected to see was Robert Downey, who was as good as the film critics said he was.  Believe it or not, I didn't recognize Gwyneth Paltrow, though she caught my attention with her excellent performance of Pepper Potts.<br /><br />In the novel "Moonraker" by Ian Fleming, the villain told James Bond that if a man is bald and grows a mustache, even his mother wouldn't recognize him.  What does that have to do with "Iron Man"?  Jeff Bridges proves the point in this movie.  I did not recognize one of my favorite actors.  Again, his talent gave life to the role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />I have, as I grew up, stopped keeping up with the comics though I am usually interested in the Marvel movies.  When I was a teenager, Tony Stark was captured and became Iron Man in Vietnam.  I learned that the story changed twice since then, and the movie follows the current version of Iron Man's origin.<br /><br />This movie can be considered a little slow in its development.  The real action is at the beginning and towards the end.  This is where the casting helped pull the movie off, because I was kept interested by the portrayals of the actors.<br /><br />Of course, Stan Lee makes a cameo.  There were a couple of hints of what might come in a sequel (Terrence Howard's character eyeing an armor suit and the mention of SHIELD) that would leave a non-Marvel fan scratching his head and wondering what that was about, which I felt was a chink in the armor of this movie.  Also, I felt the movie sputtered in its final minutes.  (The editorial review loved the ending -- I didn't.)  These negative elements won't stop you from enjoying the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>Iron Man is a very awesome movie to watch. he built 2 other variations of suits before he built the red and gold one. my impression is that it was a 2000's imitation of Robocop. Hugo Weaving, who was the voice of Megatron, supplied the voice for the bad robot. I heard plenty of rock in this movie, but I didn't hear any cussing. if I had kids, I would be comfortable in letting them watch this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Robert Downey Jr. brings the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man to life in this thrilling movie.<br /><br />Downey stars as Tony Stark, billionaire head of Stark Enterprises.  Taking control of the company after his father's death, Tony, along with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) continue to manufacture different types of military weapons systems.  Their newest system is the Jericho missile, and Tony is on a mission to Afghanistan to show off the system to the military brass.<br /><br />After the demonstration, Tony hops in a Humvee.  He's talking with the others in the Humvee when suddenly, the convoy comes under fire.  Tony is eventually captured by rebels and hidden away.  He is told that, in order to be released, he must build a Jericho system for the reigning warlord.  However, Tony has something else in mind.  He instead begins construction of an iron suit.  Once completed, Tony blasts his way out of captivity.  He's finally rescued, but he's forced to leave his damaged suit behind.<br /><br />Upon returning to the U.S., Tony decides to stop all production of military weapons, much to the amazement of his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Obadiah.  Instead, Tony works on perfecting his Iron Man suit.  He even returns to the Middle East to clean up some unfinished business.  Meanwhile, Tony's company has suffered huge monetary losses due to his decision to stop military production.  As it turns out, Obadiah has had secret dealings with the Middle Easterners and is still trying to funnel arms to them.<br /><br />In the end, Tony discovers that Obadiah has betrayed him and has managed to build his own suit.  There is a huge confrontation between Tony and Obadiah, and only one will survive.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges all give first-rate performances.  The special effects are great, and there's even a little comedy thrown in, too.  I've seen each of the "Spiderman" and "Batman" movies, and I'd rate "Iron Man" as the best of the superhero films.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age).  A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion.  He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a "merchant of death," but he balks at being called "the Da Vinci of our time").  Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity.  Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and pulverizing the bad guys.<br /><br />"Iron Man" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards.  But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time.  He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made "Iron Man" what it is without him.  Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory.  These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen.  James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.<br /><br />Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in "Iron Man" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie.  It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film.  And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be.  It's nice to see that somebody finally got it right.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Iron Man has been a favorite of mine since childhood and they got this one right.

The 2 disc addition is the one to own.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>There is a lot to `give away' in describing "Iron Man', but suffice it to say that the film makers have created the real Tony Stark.  He is the rowdy billionaire responsible for building weapons of mass destruction and selling them to the enemy who then turns into a reluctant and then powerful `Iron Man'.  The cinematography is stunning in Blu-ray and the scenes starting from Afghanistan to Los Angeles's skies are over-whelming.  The action is intense, funny, witty and true to the character of the comic book character.  Plus, it is all believable.  Robert Downing, Jr. playing around with his Iron Man invention is nothing short of hilarious and thrilling.  Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused as his assistant, but she supplies some killer one-liners.  Jeff Bridges plays a role that truly threatens Iron Man, but that's all I'll say.  The effects are fantastic, the storyline is fast and clever and it is no small wonder it broke box office records.  On Blu-ray disc, it is just as good as being in a movie theater - the details, color and sound are that amazing!  Tony Stark IS `Iron Man'.<br /><br />All Blu-ray discs are set up differently according to their theme, but for Iron Man, I'll describe the screen imagery.  The initial PLAY/SCENES board is a colorful statue of Iron Man with colorful, comic book scientific looking diagrams.  Audio is available in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  There are some great extras like the `Hall of Armor' showing all four Iron Man designs, `The Invincible Iron man' and deleted scenes.  These deletions are great, including, 'I Am Iron Man', `Visuals Effects of Iron Man', a fantastic `Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test'. 'The Actors Process' (Downing and Bridges get down with some real improvisations), a semi-spoof trailer from `The Onion' on Iron man,' Theatrical Trailers, Galleries, Credits and Subtitles.  Not to leave anything out, more extras include six mini features such as `Friends and Foes' and "Demon in a Bottle".  If you're really into Blu-ray, try connecting to the Internet for BD-Live capability. This is one of the Blu-ray features that put it so far and above regular DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Looking at this year what will most people say was the best comic book movie of 08? Dark Knight, exactly but next in line is without a doubt Iron Man and that's for many different reasons. Out of the 4 comic book movies I can name off the top of my head that were released this year, Iron Man was definitely the coolest, with Dark Knight being the most authentic, Hellboy 2 being the biggest fantasy and Incredible Hulk just being the most insane. Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt made this film what it is, he delivers his very special brand of charisma and acting talent to a very cool and charismatic character. A lot of people have said that you couldn't have gotten a more perfect person to play Tony Stark and they weren't kidding.<br /><br />To those not familiar with the comic or have not yet seen the film, Tony Stark/Iron Man is the owner of the worlds premier weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. In the movie he is kidnapped by terrorists who hold him until he agrees to build them a specialist weapon, he agrees but instead builds an indestructible suit which he will use to break himself out of his prison. He manages to break out, but comes to realise what he's been doing has been the main force in a lot of innocent killings, so he designs a better version of the suit which he will use to help those in need.<br /><br />Downey Jr. has always been known as one of those special actors that will constantly put on amazing performances in little known movies, and very rarely gets a chance at a big time role. Iron Man is one of his biggest roles to date and he gets to star along such greats as Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. Speaking of Paltrow, I don't think you could have gotten a more perfect role for Tony Starks P.A. Pepper Potts than the Oscar winner. The villain of the film is one hell of a scary guy, Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger is actually one of the more intimidating comic villains I've seen to date. Played by Jeff Bridges, I honestly think the guy deserves a round of applause for his role.<br /><br />All in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message. Watch it, I promise you wont be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Iron Man is a Marvel Comic movie that doesn't disapoint. It's better than Spiderman 3 "which even Fantastic Four 2 was even more fun than" with more wit and a lot less whining, crying and.... disco dancing. Hell it's the best Marvel movie since Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2. It slowly picks up which is why it gets compared to the Hulk by some people. However it's always entertaining and more fun than the Hulk.<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr's Stark slowly becomes Iron Man but the movie is never boring since Downey carries the film well with his quick wit. It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark. He also has chemestry with Gwyneth Paltrow who has a quick wit of her own here as a trustworthy employee of his. Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend. I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner. When there is action it's super cool and well done. But the movie wouldn't have been as good if Robert Downey Jr. wasn't casted.

I probably would never have watched it if my wife hadn't wanted to rent it.  I'm glad she did, or else I would have missed a fun and entertaining movie.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. really made this movie shine.  It's a measure of the writing and direction that film could have succeeded with a different actor as Tony Stark.  But Downey really took the reins and put an indelible mark on the character all his own.  He completely owned every scene he was in.<br /><br />"Iron Man" successfully walked the fine line of taking itself seriously enough that you actually care about what happens without becoming so serious that the whole movie collapses under its own weight.  Favreau and Downey deserve equal credit for that.  And Favreau does a great job of keeping "Iron Man" moving.  Who would have thought back in the day of "Swingers" that Favreau would become a big-time A-list director?  Hollywood often fails to notice talent, so it's great to see him succeed.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent, and the special features are enjoyable.  Perhaps the most special feature is after the end credits, a la Ferris Bueller; be sure to watch until the very end!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to fans of action movies, superhero films, SF movies, or anyone who just plain enjoys a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Ironman is right up there with the other heroes.

Afterall Spidey and Batman have some serious issues brewing (criterion/prerequisite for being a superhero). Perhaps we could see that in Ironman 2? Sometimes you have to run before you can walk...what a riot.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Iron Man was a lesser-known hero in the Marvel universe.  He wasn't as well known as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Captain America, or the Fantastic Four.  Therefore, it was a bit surprising that in their freshman film as an independent film company that Marvel would choose Iron Man as the hero that their future would either be built or destroyed upon.  All doubts, however, have been put aside as 2008 has come to be the year that comic book movies became serious works of cinematic art, beginning with the release of IRON MAN.<br /><br />IRON MAN revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a billionaire whose fortune was built upon arms manufacturing to defend the free world from totalitarianism, tyranny, and terrorism.  Stark is also a brilliant scientist and engineer who designs many of his own weapons and devices.  While unveiling a new missile to American troops in Afghanistan, Stark is knocked unconscious, receives a heart injury, and is captured by terrorists.  The group calls themselves the Ten Rings.  They want Stark to build them a replica of the missile he just created for the U.S. Army.  Stark gets to work, but instead of building the weapon the terrorists requested, he builds a suit of power armor that he uses to escape from the terrorist camp.  After returning to the United States, Stark decides that his company, Stark Industries, is no longer going to be in the arms manufacturing business.  Seeing what his weapons can do when placed in the wrong hands is too much and he decides that the company will take a new direction.  He's convinced by his partner and good friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) to take some time off.  Stark uses that time to prefect the suit he created in the Middle East.  Meanwhile, Stane has plans of his own and the direction Tony wants to take the company in doesn't fit in Obadiah's plans.<br /><br />IRON MAN is an excellent comic book movie.  The acting is solid, the script well-written, and the direction superb.  The movie completely revived the career of Robert Downey, Jr. and turned Jon Favreau from being just a comic and family-film director into being a major directorial player.  Though hinting at a darker future (as well as plot developments for future sequels), the film is full of hope, optimism, and good old American patriotism.  When one thinks about it, IRON MAN is the type of movie that SUPERMAN RETURNS should have been a couple years ago.  I guess iron really is stronger than steel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>This was a fabulous movie.  If you like the Comic book genre, this is one of the best out there.  Tony Stark was an awesome character.  Robert Downey Junior delivered the character incredibly.  I would definitely see it repeatedly, loved it.<br />But, it really is a shame if you missed the opportunity to see it on the big screen.  It is a great movie theater film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YVDY3TISDRE1.html">A1YVDY3TISDRE1</a><br/><p>next to the Batman film (Dark Knight), Iron Man was by far the most enjoyable action film of summer '08.  Great cast, great script, interesting CGI, well-acted and directed.  I actually had FUN watching this in the theater.  The action scenes with Iron Man in flight were awesome.<br /><br />Downey Jr. adds just the right touch of humor/anger in the role, and Paltrow has never looked more beautiful.<br /><br />I've heard the sequel comes out May 2010....I'll be the first one in line.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>Since X-MEN hit the big screen in 2000 the comic book film had taken a huge leap forward. With the major advances in special effects and CGI it was time to finally bring the true comic book character off the page and to the big screen accuratly. Since then we have seen the amazing,(Spider-Man) the dreadful(Hulk), the Unknown (Sin City), and the renewed. (Batman Begins)<br /><br />Now a brand new experiment is about to take flight with a whole chain of movies linked together to culminate in what could be one of the highest grossing and most amazing films ever to hit the big screen. It all begins with the legendary Marvel character Iron Man. This is the story of rich and powerful Tony Stark suddenly finding out he is extremly vulnerable due to a complication with his heart. With this occurance Stark has an ephany and realizes there is more to life than power and he decides to use his power and inginuity to become a super hero. Now he has created a powerful exo-skeletal suit to keep him alive, but at the same time save the world and protect all that is good. All that with just a little time to show off is not too shabby.<br /><br />This movie is probably one of the best in the comic book film genre. It has all the elements that make a film enjoyable. An excellent origin story by director John Farravau. A steller performance from Robert Downey Jr. and his supporting cast. It's fast, dramatic, humerous and flat out fun. Still, this is only the begining of a much bigger picture in the Marvel film universe. But, you won't know that until the very end.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Wow, this film rocks, it's up their with Spider Man II as the best of the Marvel films.  Downey is great as Stark, he's all charisma and steel will.  Downey has fantastic chemistry with Paltrow, frankly im not her biggest fan, but I really liked he in this, mainly because she perfectly played off of Downey.  Bridges is chilling as Starks nemisis, it's weird to see him bald, but it added to his chilling look.  The CGI Ironman is incredible and his battle with Bridges at the end was spectacular.  I appreciated how the screenwriter wove issues we have today into the formula of the movie, it made it resonate all the more.  I could not recommend this movie any higher, it is a must see if your into this sort of action fick.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>While visiting Afghanistan, billionaire arms supplier Tony Stark (Downey) finds his caravan overrun by terrorists and himself captured.  Injured in the kidnapping, he finds a n irremovable piece of shrapnel in his chest.  He must wear an electromagnet to keep it from piercing his heart.  The terrorists want him to replicate his latest and greatest missile for them to use.  Stark has other plans, and is able to fashion a suit of armor that allows him to escape captivity.  Back home, he decides to stop his company from making military weapons, and focus on perfecting his metal suit.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is a great film, and as a superhero film it rates up there with "Batman Begins" and "Spider-Man 2".  It has action, drama, fumor, and great special effects.  The story of the self-made superhero is different and interesting.  Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired casting.  He IS Tony Stark, and he is at least as responsible for the greatness of this film as director Jon Favreau.  Favreau would not be the obvious choice for a film of this nature, but he pulls it off spectacularly.  "Iron Man" is a great movie for all ages.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>This has to be included with the biggest SuperHero movies now. You would think that these would at least become slightly predictable but no, this movie is a totally original Genre movie. I was amazed to find the opening scenes in the dispelling deserts of Afghanistan! From the get-go Robert draws your attention to his millionair personality, and he gets away with it because he's a quirky kind of guy. I'm glad Roberts Bad days are behind him and that he has his Giant Success now. Best movie of the year, and I'm sure it's one of the best reviewed also. What could they be complaining about? It's a fantastic story, with rich characters and the best CGI this year. I look forward to the sequel slated to come out sometime in. Now that I think about it a little more, why can't we say that for now, this is an Oscar Worthy performance by big-time actor Robert Downey Jr.? I don't want to imagine this movie with anyone else. And STRONG performances by Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as the Iron Monger and the beautiful and flirty Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. The CGI was Fantastic! Jeff Bridges sits inside the menacing Iron Monger as if it were right in front of you. Witty, Funny, Alarmingly FUN! Best SuperHero movie since...Since my personal favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>One of the great pleasures of summer is the release of the big budget, popcorn films that feed the eye with amazing special effects and take the movie goer on an action-packed thrill ride!  Not all summer films achieve the goal of pleasing the masses but this new movie, based on the Marvel comic book hero, Iron Man, does just that!<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr., the talent and charismatic actor who received an Oscar nod for his turn in "Chaplin", takes on the role of Tony Stark, an extremely wealthy man whose fortune has been amassed by providing weapons to the world's warriors, good and bad.  After being abducted and held by terrorists in the Middle East, Stark realizes the damage his weapons are doing and decides to change the path of his business.  After escaping from his captors using an armor he creates during his abduction, Stark returns to the U. S. and begins working on an improved version that will allow him to fight the forces he has empowered with his own, technologically advanced weaponry.  Thus, the birth of Iron Man, a super hero with a flashy red and gold suit of armor that packs a treasure trove of crime fighting gadgets that would make even Batman jealous!<br /><br />  Aiding Stark is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his dedicated executive assistant and apparent future love interest and his best friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard).  Jeff Bridges plays Stark's mentor and father figure, Obadiah Stone, a man who took young Tony under his wing after the death of the elder Stark and groomed him to take over the Stark empire.  All three actors do a great job with their parts, especially Paltrow and Bridges.  Hopefully Howard's character will grow in the inevitable sequel.  And, of course, there is the usual Stan Lee cameo, which is quite funny in this film.<br /><br />  Jon Favereau did a great job with this movie and apparently pleased fans and non-fans alike, considering its impressive take thus far, both domestically and internationally.  Although I was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I have to give kudos to Marvel for really making sure that their latest hero films are up to par---Spiderman (other than Spidey 3, which was a disaster), the X-Men films and now Iron Man have all been well made and appeal to everyone.<br /><br />  Grab a friend, buy some popcorn and sit back and relax with the first blockbuster of the summer!  Highly recommend!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>After an eye-opening stint as a hostage in Afghanistan, multi-zillionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) gives up being a merchant of death to don a high-tech suit of his own invention and fight for justice and atonement as Iron Man.  This is a top-notch debut effort from Marvel Studios and hopefully portends more great movies to come.<br /><br />That said, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two Spider-Man films.  A superhero really benefits from having a great villain to battle; Spider-Man has the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, Batman has the Joker, but Iron Man really never had such an arch-nemesis, even in the comics.  Maybe the Mandarin came closest (and there's a subtle nod to the character in the name of the terrorist organization The Ten Rings), but he's too mystical to be a good fit in a movie like this.  So for a finale we get Stark Industries CEO Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) in an even bigger suit.  By the end of this somewhat underwhelming climax, I was getting flashbacks to Robocop.  Nevertheless, the cast is great, the script is smart, and director Jon Favreau shows a sure hand with this material.  I'm looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />The final line of the film is perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Saw it in the theater.  The movie begins in the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan, as a group of Army Hummers are transporting businessman Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) through the war zone. All of a sudden, explosions begin and shots are fired at the Hummers. US Soldiers are shot and killed.  Stark jumps out of the Hummer and starts running. As an idiot could guess, he doesn't get far before he gets shot and captured.<br /><br />Rewind 36 hours to an award ceremony at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where Tony Stark is about to get an award for his achievements in the weapons' producing industry. His father began Stark Industries some time ago and Tony took over when Daddy died. Tony was a 6-year old product developer so, at probably 40-something, he is quite proficient now. He remains single and enjoys a romp with the ladies, now and then.  While the award is being handed out, Tony is gambling in Vegas and smoozing the women.  His military liaison (Terrence Howard) comes looking for him in the casino to remind him that he promised to be there for the award, so, you can see the carefree attitude of a stuck-on-himself, filty-rich genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow is his administrative assistant who takes care of everything for him. Stark has an awesome car, his own plane, and a computer system that would probably make Bill Gates drool, complete with holographic imaging. (You will likely recognize Terrance Howard when you see him.)<br /><br />Fast forward back to Afghanistan.  Stark was there to conduct a weapons missle presentation for the US army. Stark was seriously injured. He is hauled off to a terrorist camp.  As he looks around, he notices the camp is loaded with Stark weapons. He begins to realize that his lifetime labors of love have also been going to the "bad" guys to help them kill Americans.  The terrorists order Stark to build his new missile for them and they will set him free. He knows its a lie but it buys him time to appear to work on the missle. Instead he builds a very special iron man suit.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, with a shaved head, plays an interesting role. I believe he is chairman of the board at Stark Industries, or something similar.  This is a super good action film. Great job by all the actors. Good guys vs. bad guys theme. The computer graphic imaging was great, too. Approximately 2 hrs. Not for young children. (Some people get shot in Afghanistan, and although these scenes were not belabored, I doubt that you want your young impressionable children to carry these images around in their heads.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Like most fans of Marvel Super Heroes, I couldn't wait to see this movie! So.......10 am on Friday morning, I was sitting in the theater with my wife hoping not to be disappointed.......we were not! The film's opening scene gets your attention and then back pedals a few hours to fill in the blanks. This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!  Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man or "ol' Shellhead"....if you will. I think his career is about to take a very big turn for the better after this film! I think he will forever be associated with this character like Toby McGuire is to Spider-Man. I can't see anyone else in either role now. Like the Spider-Man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well. This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider-Man films. I actually may go see this again, something I never do, well I did see the first Spider-Man movie twice. I don't know if anyone noticed this, but Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this! 'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider-Man' films and the believable techincal aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!<br /><br />A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN! Like all superhero movies should be....go see this movie!..and stay through the credits for a great cameo setting up the next installment......oh yes, there will be another!</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Morton Downy Jr. plays the lead in a film that transcends the comic genre. He portrays Tony Stark; the creator of Iron Man.  Tony inherited the legacy of his father's company; a weapons manufacturer.  All the core elements of the comic are there. Jarvis is a computer in this one.  Happy Hogan, the chauffeur.  Gweneth Paltrow was extraordinary as Pepper Potts; IM's executive assistant.  Gweneth added dimension to what could have been a throwaway part.  Being his close confidant, she was privy to the issues that needed his attention.  The details of the original were all there.<br /><br />Over forty years of continuity of didn't bog down this story.  Unlike Hulk, Spidey and X-Men, Iron man wasn't one of the more popular characters.  Being true to form, following the comics "Demon in a Bottle" tale, Tony has a drinking problem.  However, the movie deals with that aspect without turning the character into a joke.<br />Fans of S. H. I. E. L. D.  take note.  There's a surprise in store for you if you watch the end of the credits.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>What was enjoyable about Iron Man was that it was a smart addition to the Marvel Comics film adaptations. There are some action scenes, but they don't attempt to mask or steal the show or moral of the movie (that weapons in the wrong hands can have devastating results). After realizing that his father's company was inadvertently leading to the destruction of lives, and after having a terrifying experience being held hostage in the Middle East, multimillionaire Tony Stark (Downey) changes his tune of his invention-making ways, saying that he will not create anything aimed at destruction again. However, some information of making the perfect destructive machine has leaked, and now it is in the wrong hands. Sometimes the ones closest to you are the ones who turn against you, and now Tony battles both sides of evil.<br /><br />Although the film was two hours, it was a quick two hours because of the pacing of the film. There aren't crash scenes that drag on for long periods of time, and the plot and script were well-written enough to keep all main characters involved in the climactic and critical scenes. The major characters all did great jobs in their roles: Gweneth Paltrow does a commendable job as Stark's assistant, and Jeff Bridges does an excellent job Stark's company business partner.<br /><br />I would rank this film just a shade lower than Spiderman 2, but I think they are two of the best comic book movies out there in recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie was very good and the special effect was great.

It's my favorite movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>So first we had X-men, then Spiderman and afterwards other countless Marvel Comic adaptations that were either majorly or moderately successful. But what do we have to expect for Iron Man, does it live up to the expectations of the fans, does it match up Spidey or X-men? Honestly it does; this adaptation proves that the comic book genre can still bring a character from the pages of a comic and yet maintain it fresh and new to a vast broad audience.<br /><br />In this first and clever adaptation of "Iron Man" we have Tony Stark, A genius and ambitious weapons business man who finds himself after being captured by Terrorist. These terrorist have weapons built and designed by Stark; they need Stark's help to build a super intelligent missile known as "the Jericho". In his attempt to create this weapon Stark creates a better and more efficient weapon...obviously Iron Man.<br /><br />The movie is a popcorn flick above all, it does however mange to create a very well crafted origin storyline; maybe not on the level of Batman Begins or Superman: The Movie, but it still brings in a good transition of how Stark finds his true destiny and purpose. The effects for the film are stupendous all the way. The only problem I found with the movie was 2 things. One the later half of the movie changed from what seemed to be a serious comic book movie, into an adrenaline fueled action extravaganza. Sure action is cool, but the way the ending was placed with him fighting the other Iron Man...it felt sort of silly; As if the ending was just a filler to have Iron Man facing someone for the hell of using more effects and having the audience feel the use of the 135 million dollar budget for the film. Above all this the movie is still a triumphant adaptation; the majority of the characters are superb in their acting. Downey Jr excels marvously as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and it's a great movie to watch with the family...I think. Anyways a must own by fans of the genre or new comers.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>If you know the Iron Man comic, you know the story. Billionaire inventor and weapons producer Tony Stark is captured by renegade forces who want him to create a super-weapon for them. After requesting the supplies he'll need, Stark instead creates a metal suit for himself, using it to bust out of captivity. Now fully realizing the great havoc his weapons inflict, Stark vows to act as a protector of the human race and undo some of the damage his creations have caused.<br /><br />I thought that this movie was good, but I was actually expecting it be a tad more spectacular. Maybe because I'd heard it being discussed in glowing terms for the better part of a year. It's hard to live up to such hype.<br /><br />I thought Robert Downey Jr. did a fabulous job. Gwyneth Paltrow did a fair job for the role she had, but Pepper Potts didn't seem to be a very pivotal character in this film. I loved Terence Howard, and I'm disappointed about the rumors that he may be replaced in the next film in the series. Jeff Bridges chewed the scenery gloriously. (He looks very ominous without his hair!)<br /><br />The effects were great, and I'm glad to see how the SpiderMan series and King Kong have cemented a new rule of thumb in hero/effects films (one started by Titanic, I think): even if the movie is all about effects, it will be better if you cast people who can actually ACT in the lead roles. (Not just models. Not just bodybuilders. ACTORS.) Everything will benefit from strong performances at the core of the film, even if you think audiences are really only coming to see you blow stuff up.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>IRON MAN is a total blast.  My husband and I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time.  Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.<br /><br />In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.  As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world.  When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect.  In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.  Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions.  Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world.  Of course, nothing is ever easy...<br /><br />All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.  The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.  The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.  The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.<br /><br />There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come.  I sure hope so.  I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for "truth, justice, and the American way."</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>Actually...........he didn't turn to steel in a great magnetic field.<br />Nor did he travel time for the future of mankind.<br />Kind of like Spiderman I never really knew much about Iron Man.<br />So.............I tried to watch this with an open mind.<br />Ok, let's be brutally honest here. By the time I popped Iron Man into the DVD player I had just gotten home after being out with the co workers.<br />Iron Man got popped into the DVD player and I plopped down on the couch, not just tipsy, not just a little woozy.

He makes the hero a very human character.<br /><br />Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.<br /><br />And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>We have seen this movie three times already. First, we enjoyed it by ourselves; then, with friends and finally with the family.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays the lead role of this superhero story. Tony Stark is a brilliant individual who graduates from MIT at an early age and goes on to design many of the weapons sold by the company his father founded.<br /><br />The movie immediately hooked us for we see Stark visiting the Middle East, delivering weapons and demonstrating the power behind his designs. The pace is amazing as we confront terrorists who to Stark's horror and dismay; use the very weapons he designed for our protection as the tools of mass destruction. How is this possible if he only sells to friends?<br /><br />Stark is captured and transforms into Iron Man by a suit he designs that makes him indestructible, with weapons to fight innumerable enemies and able to fly to safety.<br /><br />He escapes and comes back home where his assistant, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is waiting for him at the airport. It is fun to watch Stark tell her "the vacation is over" and that the first thing he MUST do is eat a cheeseburger. Burger King must have paid a fortune for this ad.<br /><br />The technology used in this movie is razor edge, his ability to design in a three dimensional environment is simply awesome. As usual, the bad guys interfere at every turn and he discovers that the force behind his many encounters with challenges is in the identity of which he thought was a close "friend."<br /><br />This movie provided adventure, romance, intrigue and comedy. We have seen it three times and something tells me we shall soon want to see it again, therefore, we highly recommend purchasing as opposed to going to the movies or renting it. Don't miss it... it is AWESOME!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Very strong movie that stands up there with the original Batman with Michael Keaton and the original Spider-Man with Toby Maquire, and let's not forget about Superman!  Who knows if they'll ever make a decent Hulk, X-men or Avengers (coming soon).  Good modern adaptation of the story.  Ending was a bit heavy, and I wasn't particularly enamored with Bridges role, but Downey and Paltrow worked great.

There is some graininess to the picture, but it is still sharp, clear, colorful, and vivid.<br />*Includes a vast number of great special features; 23 minutes of deleted/extended scenes, interviews, documentaries, stuff that explores Iron Man's suit, trailers, and a mock newscast by the Onion website.<br />*Smashing special effects and action scenes.<br />*Good, straightforward filming style. A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.<br />*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.<br />*Pretty good, straightforward story. Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.<br />*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to "Lord of War", but not as serious).<br />*Pretty good characters; pretty good acting. In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be. Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero.<br />*Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again!<br />*Great sound effects.<br />*Awesome music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*One or two slow parts. The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it. But it's still not too dull at all.<br />*Some violence may be too much for young children (rated PG-13).<br /><br />Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie. Much of the action and effects are quite memorable. The characters are not too shabby. The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening. Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing). It is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than "The Fantastic Four."</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>You I had heard many times this is an awesome movie, and I agree. When I was a kid Iron Man was my favorite comic book so I was happy about this transition to the screen. The story, acting, directing, effects, and music were excellent. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges give stand out performances. I can't wait for the sequels. The DVD quality is excellent and the single disc played fine on DVD player and PC. The only extras are the deleted scenes on the single disc but then it was only $14.99 if you pre-ordered. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy action movies. Great quality DVD with exceptional replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Batman Begins" and "Hellboy". Some super heroe sequels aren't as good on many of the super hero original movies and a couple were less than stellar on the first release, let's hope Iron Man sequels will be the exception.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>It actually reminds me of the recently released "Transformers" remake.<br />Iron Man isn't a new comic book hero.<br />It is all updated to the current events.<br />Gwyneth Paltrow and the villain Jeff Bridges put in very good performances<br />that help make it less comic book like.<br />Still the military and a lot of the action has dialog problems:<br />sort of a cardboard/ comic book unreality,<br />that you don't expect in a major studio release like this.<br />I still like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The one thing Iron Man has going for it is Robert Downey Jr who is just perfect for this role. He is a natural and really embodies the character just right. There is wit and charm and appeal. However, I found the movie a tad on the slow side and fairly predictable. There was no doubt in my mind who the 'bad guy' was, and I know nothing about this comic book.<br /><br />This film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did. There were boring lulls and nothing particularly interesting to fill the action-less void. Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best. It will appeal to many, mostly, again, because of the main character's likeability and the very nice special effects the film has to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`Iron Man' is awesomely cool,<br />U.S. forces and Afghanistan duel<br />From highlands and desolate caves<br />Stark Enterprises allegedly saves<br /><br />Tony's the successor, a living prodigy<br />Of what weapons' development ought to be<br />Until selling his Jericho multiple warhead,<br />Ensuring the enemy will all but be dead.<br /><br />Finding the enemy is well armed<br />By weaponry he never meant to have harmed<br />Our own side by enemy forces<br />Trickling in by unknown sources.<br /><br />On his deathbed from an explosion,<br />Tony must produce from a dungeon,<br />A new Jericho weapon to beat all<br />Against U.S. troops and bring to a pall.<br /><br />Now he makes himself the Iron Man<br />Defending the innocent whenever he can<br />From imminent danger of a major threat<br />Defending his company during the upset.<br /><br />With a humanitarian touch, not based on money<br />And Pepper Pots, his helper, proves to be a real honey,<br />They face a greedy nemesis found in Stane,<br />Board-of-directors' man keeping investors sane.<br /><br />See 'Iron Man' if you haven't yet.<br />Your entertainment value is a safe bet.<br /><br />(The snappy dialogue and the awesome flying shots go well with the funny, slapstick test flight scenes from Tony Stark's Malibu laboratory.

To buy his freedom from his captors he must construct the new weapon he was showcasing. He decides, instead, to build a suit made of iron to help him escape, a suit powered by an electromagnet that was installed in his chest to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart. Further design modifications and refinements lead Stark to a truly amazing concept which makes him a bonafide superhero.<br /><br />The movie follows its hero (pun intended) on a series of personality changes. He goes from chick magnet to humble captive and from cocky fly boy to man on a mission. I am sure you can figure out which traits were more entertaining.<br /><br />I was impressed at first with how much hype was created for this movie. Those involved took a pretty well-known but certainly less-popular comic book character and made it one of the most highly anticipated films in at least recent history. My hat is off to them all for going beyond that and delivering such a fun and energizing movie. They also followed the story well and included at least two teasers as to what we might see sometime into the future (*cough* War Machine and The Avengers *cough*).<br /><br />The story gets in the way a few times, and it is cheesy comic book story, but I hope you can get past that. With the volume of comic books being adapted to film, most people should be pretty used to that by now. What that story does is form the environment in which the special effects can really shine.<br /><br />Tony Stark is a stronger personality (and thus a better lead) than either Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, and Iron Man and the pace of his movie are also significantly more explosive. Since you're now questioning me, I will say that Iron Man was better than any of the Spider-Man movies. And I liked Iron Man for different reasons than Batman, so that is a hard comparison to make, but I think Batman Begins is still the better movie. And we'll see how Mr. Stark does against The Dark Knight later this summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>Superhero movies are a mixed bag. Sometimes you get a good one that captures the heart of what made the comic book popular (Spider-Man, Batman Begins), and sometimes they just go all weird for no reason (Superman Returns, The Hulk). "Iron Man" has captured that perfect feel for a comic book movie.<br /><br />First, we go to a movie called "Iron Man" to SEE Iron Man, and director Favreau doesn't disappoint. We see him four times in the three different incarnations (original, plain iron, and the gold-and-red). The sequences are action-packed and perfect.<br /><br />Second, Robert Downey Jr. is dead-on as Tony Stark. He has this smirky personality yet he manages to stay down to earth at the same time. You actually feel for this character and laugh in the moments he's creating the armor (the jet boot sequences are hilarious).<br /><br />Finally, the storyline itself. It's a perfect origin story that remains true to the comics while still giving us something new. You can tell Jon has had a lot of time with the comics by giving little nods to the real comic book fans out there (wondering about War Machine? There's a hint in the movie).<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest and greatest fanboy moment of all comes after the credits have finished rolling. You've got to sit through a LOT of them, but trust me: DON'T MOVE! The final one minute sequence sets the stage perfectly for where Jon wants to take the movies in the future.<br /><br />I loved this film. I can't recommend it highly enough. I just hope they allow Jon to direct the next two AND the Avengers movie (if it ever comes out). Just like Sam Raimi captured the essence of Spider-Man in the first movie, Jon has Iron Man down pat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>Iron Man so powerfull. i don't give you a big review for this. but i loved Iron Man specially Iron Man Mini Bust.

The purest of comic book movies, who has a message, but does not overburden the audience with to much emotional baggage.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is "Iron Man," he may be the brightest acting star of his generation, as he can play almost any part, & he plays the wealthy industrialist, swashbuckling, chick magnet, Tony Stark to perfection, with a wink of his eye! Jeff Bridges, who is also one of the greatest actors of his generation, plays the double dealing, money hungry, evil surrogate father figure, Obadiah Stane, of Tony Stark, with malicious glee, as he plans to take Tony's inventions & sell them to both sides of the fence. Tony's personal aid/secretary, Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow) is perfect in her role as the faithful secretary, that is thinly disguises that she is in love with her boss. She is vulnerable, yet ready to take control of any situation that is bestowed on her with total competence. These three actors make "Iron Man," sturdily solid, great popcorn entertainment for those who want to escape for a couple of hours in their lives!<br /><br />Recommended to everyone who loves a thrill ride of a film, with a great confrontational finale!</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>I'm very glad that Robert Downey, Jr got his act together.<br />It is largely because he did that we have this film. He holds it on his shoulders ably.<br />Like other comic book based movies, I don't care about the source material at all.<br />The only question : Is the movie entertaining - yes it is, in fact is for that reason that I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />This movie is a master class in acting from Robert - whether that be comic or dramatic.<br />What other lead actor could play Tony Stark? Granted, that is an easy question, as there are not that many real 'actors' out there at the moment.<br />The reason I say this is that Robert has to play an unsympathetic yet occasionally charming and intelligent man.<br />This in itself is a challenge - which he rises to admirably.<br />People have to work with him, but they don't have to like him - in fact, that does lead to problems for the character.<br />Of course the supporting cast are right there with him - at or near his ability level.<br /><br />The last line of the film is delivered perfectly by Robert and leads in to the next movie.<br />The last line is perfect because everything previous to it leads there logically - it is the only possible culmination in the film's world. You are left hanging on with a sense of anticipation, yet you laugh as well.<br /><br />Perhaps one day we will see a Director's Cut of this, though I won't be surprised if we don't, as it is perfect.<br /><br />If I could add one thing to this Blu-Ray set, it would be a commentary by the director and stars.<br />Very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>There are two classes of superhero films:  top tier ones that are psychologically real (Spiderman, X-Men) or simple two-dimensional stereotypes.  Iron Man, alas, is the latter, at least for me:  they tend to over-emphasize special effects to make up for weaknesses in the script, have far more action than character development, and follow some pretty simple formulas.  I was hoping for better.<br /><br />That being said, the actors are very good, starting with Downey.  Perhaps it is that he is such a playboy genius type that turned me off, as opposed to a nerd like Peter Parker, who unexpectedly gains power.  I didn't identify with him much.  But he undergoes a pretty interesting transformation and he has nice chemistry with Paltrow, who is as luminous as ever.  Bridges isn't a bad bad guy, but he is lackluster.<br /><br />I did like the special effects and technology evocations.  When he flies through the air, it is fun and very beautiful.  His end fight is also very fun indeed, particularly as he is handicapped.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>The always entertaining Mr. Downey is on hand to present his tongue-in-cheek interpretation of the "super-hero". I've always been a fan of his, and with the help of director Jon Favreau (a fine actor in his own right) the two create a silly, never boring film of complete entertainment. It would be silly to try to say anything that hasn't already been said, but I rented the single-disc version; I'd been buying too many films, sight-unseen. This is one I'd buy, and that's about the best recommendation I could give!  Haven't heard much about Ms. Paltrow lately, but she's quite fine and confident in an important role. Jeff Bridges, too, always Mr. Nice guy in every film he's made, but here he shows surprising variation. As I said, everything's been blabbed away by previous reviewers, but I was amused and entertained a whole lot. There WILL be subsequent episodes, and I look forward to them. I just hope it doesn't dissolve in Hollywood garbage like other super-hero franchises...</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Really enjoyed this film for the first 90 minutes, until it became a predictable super robot movie. Robert Downey, Jr. is technical whiz Tony Stark, the ne'er-do well scion of a weapons manufacturer. He has a social awakening after being captured by Afghan warriors during a product demo, and decides that his company must change course. One of his first designs is a power suit, propelled by a new source of his own devising.<br /><br />Downey is perfect for the job. His dry acting style and bad-boy persona are perfect for depicting the driven and hard-driving protagonist. He is completely believable with booze or blond in hand. Gwyneth Paltrow trots out her American accent to play Stark's all-knowing assistant. Jeff Bridges is completely believable as Stark's corporate partner, uniting uncleish bonhomie with more sinister motivations. The special effects are terrific, but made believable (and often funny) with scenes of Stark test-piloting his new equipment. A scene (shown in the trailer) of Stark outrunning a couple of stealth fighters is harrowing and plenty exciting.<br /><br />Iron Man does a lot (mostly thanks to Downey) with borrowed materials. There's a know-all female assistant (a la 007's Moneypenny), a technical wunderkind (a la Batman) and foreign bad guys (a la Vin Diesel). Still, the film is rocket-solid until about the 3/4 mark, when it tumbles securely into the old cliche mismatched superhero battle. There's never a question of who will win, and it would have been refreshing if the plot had allowed for fewer explosions, close calls and destroyed cityscapes.  A quickie, surprise ending would have been better than the 20-minute, predictable mini-Armageddon that threatened to drop this review to 3 stars.<br /><br />A fun ride, with a setup (after 10 minutes of credits) for what promises to be a lame sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is certainly better than the latest Hulk movie, but for me it never quite reached the heights that I had hoped. The opening part of the movie is well done and the scenes when Stark is devloping the final version of the 'Iron' suit are some of the finest use of CGI I've seen. In particular where he was initially testing out its flying ability adjacent to his collection of classic cars. Great scene...<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the leading role (reminded me of Al Pacino in fact) and it was great to see Jeff Bridges again. Gywneth Paltrow also gave a good performance.<br /><br />Where the film went downhill was the final 1/4. Much like the ending of the latest Hulk film the final battle was entirely predictable. Once again though there is a lovely cameo role for Stan Lee and the final few moments give us hope that Marvel may be preparing a film based on The Avengers.<br /><br />My review is perhaps a reflection of my age. If this film had been produced when I first read the comics (the 1970's) I would have been blown away by it. Sadly age and a somewhat more cynical view of life means that superheroes are never quite what they were. I still love the comics though!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>It is also updated for our time with events fictionalized from Afganistan, the villans being terrorist, foreign & domestic. Broad enough to spawn endless sequels. Sort of like the James Bond franchise. One problem, however good James Bond is or was, Sean Connery was the best Bond. Vodka martini references aside there are some simularities between  Bond & Robert Downey's Tony Stark (Ironman). He is the best thing about this movie. Let's not forget Gwynth Paltrow as Pepper, his friend assistant & girl everything. She is absolutely fabulous. I can't see either of these gifted actors wasting their careers on too many  Ironmans. It is after all a cartoon.<br />  Tony Stark is a boy genius, smarter than everyone else & heir to a fabulous weapons producing empire. His ego is as big as his fortune but everybody loves him. He manages to get captured while on a visit to Afganistan by terrorist. While in captivity he builds Ironman & long story short, escapes. He returns home a changed man & has a revelation to change the world. He creates another better Ironman to destroy all the weapons of destruction his company has sold to the world. This is not taken well by partners & others that profit from this military industrial complex. At this point the movie just breaks down into foolishness & mayhem. I reccommend this movie. It's good fun</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Iron Man (Jon Favreau, 2008)<br /><br />Wait, Jon Favreau directed this? The guy who did Elf? And Zathura? Someone must have messed up the credits, because I find it well-nigh impossible to believe that someone who could have unleashed those monstrosities on the world could make not only a credible, but an exceptionally enjoyable, action thriller. And yet here it is, in all its glory, Iron Man.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is one of those guys who pops up in movies when he's out of rehab and either wipes the floor with the entire rest of the cast (Chaplin, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) or kind of fades into the woodwork (Gothika, a movie I'm sure everyone involved would love to forget). This is a mopping-the-floor performance, which is even more impressive given the caliber of the rest of the cast; Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Leslie Bibb, and Favreau himself all turn in good performances, but nothing on this screen at any time can touch Downey, who plays a much friendlier and more na?ve Tony Stark than I've been used to seeing in comics recently. (Interesting that The Dark Knight and the upcoming Watchmen are all about making the superheroes more human and gritty, while Iron Man wants to get back to almost golden-era-comics-like exaggeration and strong lines between the good guys and the bad guys.) As a result, the bad guys come off as even more evil, and in the opening scenes this could easily have been played in a ham-handed-racist sort of way. I don't doubt there are those who will take that interpretation away from the first half-hour of this movie, in fact, but to me it came off more like Three Kings; the terrorist-as-bad-guy approach is topical, rather than racially-based, and you could have stuck in any nationality. In other words, it's not about the Arabs.<br /><br />This is a fun movie, very well-done all around. It has the unfortunate distinction of being released in the same year as The Dark Knight, which is likely to eclipse every other superhero movie released in 2008, but it's such an entirely different film in tone that the two make very good foils for one another. Quite enjoyable, and well worth your time. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>Robert Downey Jr. may not seem to fit the superhero archetype, but he is the quintessential TONY STARK! Downey is egotistical, edgy; both smug and smooth, comic book fans will quickly associate him with the flawed, sometimes less than heroic head of STARK Industries and IRONMAN himself. This isn't the only good bit of casting Gwyneth Paltrow is sooo perfect as the Moneypennyish Ms. (Pepper) Potts, Stark's personal assistant and unrequited love interest. Terrence Howard as Tony's right-hand-man Col. Rhodes (and War Machine in the future-sequel) is great as is Jeff Bridges as Stark Industries co-CEO and more (as the ominous poster would indicate).<br /><br />The 1963 Marvel comic, holds up well in the 21st century, the billionaire weapon-making industrialist, has a change of heart (sort of literally) after discovering his weapons aren't always used on just the bad guys. He reinvents himself (also, sort of literally) and returns home to more altruistic designs, but discovers he may have been betrayed.<br /><br />State-of-the-art FX contains some of the ultimate transforming sequences in which Tony Stark suiting-up never gets old (infinitely better than the NFL graphics). Equally cool are the aerial combat sequences with old Iron-head zipping `round pilots. The chrome-dome-computer-generated finale maybe one of the most clich&eacute;d moments, but even this is forgivable, next to so many other stand-out moments in which the film shines (including the perfect proclamation of Tony Stark in the films final moments! Starks ego is appropriately served!)<br /><br />Actor/ director Jon Favreau, who cameos amusingly enough, as Stark's driver, may have been a risky pick for such a huge property, especially without a notable hit-list. But, Favreau must be a fan or at least understands what comic fans want, as well as grasping the needs action/popcorn fare. Props to you Mr. Favreau, this AIN'T NO HULK! I can't wait for the sequel, with more drinking for Tony (no rehab research needed for Downey there) and more flying for Rhodes.  Why not the Avengers, too?<br /><br />Yes co-creator Stan Lee shows up, this time with an entourage!<br />Stay `till after the credits roll or you'll be furious....FURIOUS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Casting Robert Downey Jr. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0784011680">Chaplin</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCZGV8">Zodiac</a>) in the title role turns out to be a masterstroke as the beleaguered actor slips easily into all the complexities of a brilliant scientist who also happens to be a billionaire industrialist and a hedonistic playboy whose every pleasure-seeking habit has turned into a death-defying addiction. The textured part of Tony Stark so mirrors Downey's former tabloid-headline-grabbing life that the actor can't help but inform the role with layers of resonance and irony that elevate what could have been a more cookie-cutter superhero epic. At the same time, director Jon Favreau (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE">Elf</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M">Zathura</a>) has more on his mind than creating another heavily stylized comic book myth, as he spends the first part of the film on establishing the realistic context for his hero's circumstances in rugged, war-torn terrain of Afghanistan. No less than four writers were recruited for the screenplay - Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway - on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics. Usually having too many hands is a warning sign of a bad, neutralized movie but not this time - this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.<br /><br />The story has Stark, the head of his own multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of state-of-the-art, mass destruction weaponry, in Afghanistan demonstrating a new guided missile that can launch a multitude of smaller missiles aimed at individual targets. His military convoy is ambushed by insurgents who kill the soldiers escorting him. Stark survives due to the quick-thinking ingenuity of a local Afghan physician who implants a device in Stark's chest to ensure the remaining shrapnel left in his body doesn't travel to his heart. Stark's captors demand that he build a missile like the one he just demonstrated, but instead, he makes an elaborate armored suit and blasts his way out of the cave where he was held hostage. Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story. Transformed by his traumatic, three-month experience overseas, Stark has a change of heart which has detrimental ramifications on his company but also allows him to follow his monomaniacal pursuit of building a sleeker, more powerful version of the suit he built in captivity. Three people, in particular, are impacted by Stark's unpredictable actions - his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim ("Rhodey") Rhodes; Stark's cagey second-in-command at Stark Industries, Obadiah Stone; and Stark's devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts.<br /><br />With impressive agility, the often underappreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper. Favreau's other casting decisions also pay dividends though some more than others. Shorn of his thick hair and sporting a salt-and-pepper beard, Jeff Bridges, another actor who never seems to get his due, is still recognizable from his trademark grin and plays the avuncular, villainous Stone with great relish. Credit Bridges for not overdoing what could have been an excessive Willem Dafoe-like turn in the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKCH">Spider-Man</a>. One suspects that Terrence Howard will have more to do in the sequel as Rhodey since he is not called on to do much in this first installment except provide support and official alibis. Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</a>, Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines. All the production values are top-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J. Michael Riva's elaborate production design (Stark's Malibu estate is quite an eye-catcher), Matthew Libatique's crisp cinematography, and the dozens involved with the seamless CGI effects. Make sure to stay after the credits in order to see a surprise final scene which gives a hint of what the sequel may be about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a genius with technology.  He inherited Stark Enterprises from his father, and has turned it into the leader in international weapons.  He is wealthy beyond imagination, and lives the playboy life to a hilt, spending as much time as possible drinking, gambling, and pursuing anything in a skirt.<br /><br />On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, things go wrong and he is kidnapped by a gang of terrorists.  What he sees there changes his outlook on his business.  After three months in captivity, Stark manages to escape.  He returns home determined to change the direction of his company.  This does sit well with the board or Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), his father's partner.  Will the new suit he is building help him with his goals?<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is it is an origin story.  As a result, much of the movie is slow, even for someone like me who is unfamiliar with the character.  What we do get in the way of action scenes are wonderful and had me on the edge of my seat.  The climax didn't quite make sense, but that's worth noting only in passing.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the special effects were great, especially the shots from Iron Man's point of view.  And the robot assistants were very funny, proving a nice balance to some of the darker moments.<br /><br />The biggest problem the movie has is the characters.  Even with all the time spent creating Iron Man, we aren't given time to get to know the characters.  This is especially problematic for Tony who comes across as an egotistical jerk at first.  While his character softens, I never fully warmed up to him.  The other characters are only given one or two notes, and that isn't enough to make us truly care for any of them.<br /><br />Now this isn't a reflection on the top notch actors.  In addition to the two already mentioned, we've got Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow.  They all did the best job they could making the thin characters come to life.  I will admit that I couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr. and his past problems when looking at Tony.  It's more of a personal problem, but it was another stumbling block in any attempts to warm up to Tony.<br /><br />To me, the flaws were equal to the strengths, making this a fun but shallow superhero movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Iron Man was a huge surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways. It is highly entertaining all the way through. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.<br /><br />Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly "summer popcorn action flick", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though. I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.<br /><br />My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great. I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it.<br /><br />I'll keep this very short because I cannot pretend to be a pro. As far as I can tell, the Picture Quality is reference material through and through. Grain is persistent thoughout, but that only means that they didn't scrub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain). The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws. The same can be said for the audio too. I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack. I couldn't hear any apparent flaws. Fine work. As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them. Plain and simple. I just wish there was a damn audio commentary. Commentaries are essential to me, and I cannot help but dock the extras a whole point for there not being one. The one that Favreau did for Iron Man 2 was exactly what we want in a commentary, so it was a missed opportunity. Otherwise, the extras were brilliant.<br /><br />8.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This film, based on a comic book character, is very well acted and is filled with no stop action and suspense. A very rich, eccentric, smart, and generous owner of a weapons company, Tony Stark, is captured by Moslem terrorists. They say that they want him to develop a weapon for them. But is this the real reason that he was captured? Who is behind the capture?<br /><br /> Tony builds an iron suit of armor with built-in flame-throwers and rocket launchers and an ability to fly. Using the suit, he destroys the terrorists and returns to the US determined to give up weapon production and use his genius to help people. He builds an improved suit of armor despite suffering many humorous failures. He uses the suit to fly to the Moslem country where he saves people from the terrorists.<br /><br /> Meanwhile the terrorists found and reconstructed the discarded first iron suit. Tony's number two man in the weapons company meets with the terrorists, finds out about the iron suit, and builds an improved version of his own. There is a final battle scene between two iron men and Tony needs to decide if he wants to reveal to the public that he is the iron man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>What would you do if you were a weapons developer; find out that the weapons you manufacture are used to kill innocents and then learn that you have shrapnel near your heart that could kill you at any moment?<br /><br />If you are anything like Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) you'd build a mechanical suit and fight to end your own weapons. And, to prevent your death, you'd create this little gizmo based on a new energy source to prevent the shrapnel from entering your heart. It's this energy that powers your suit.<br /><br />But of course, the bad guys don't want you to succeed, so they'll build a gigantic robot to stop you.<br /><br />This movie is packed with fabulous actors: Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Howard, and Paul Bettany as the voice for Stark's butler, Jarvis.<br /><br />I think this film is better than the Spider-man movies and just up there with Batman Begins. Everything about it is top-notch: acting, writing, chemistry, etc... Some of the best comedic moments are between Tony Stark and his robot assistance as he builds his updated Iron Man suit.<br /><br />The bottom line for my experience of this movie was creativity. The creativity found in this movie was astounding. Everything is crisp and great looking.<br /><br />This is going to join my DVD collection. Can't wait for the sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Iron Man is just a flat out fantastic comic book to film adaptation. I had high hopes going in given the amazing critic reviews and I was not let down in any way. Robert Downey Jr. lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film. He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual. The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well. The main reason I loved this movie so much was the fact that the cheese factor was very low (more like Batman than the cheese heavy Spiderman), not to mention all the cool tech gadgets. The CGI is only used when needed and looks realistic.<br /><br />My entire sold out theater went crazy throughout the movie and I must admit I even did at times. While The Dark Knight looks to be the film to beat this summer, Iron Man is truly a worthy foe. Now bring on the Iron Man 2!</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>Mine loaded in less than 2 minutes and played fine on my Panasonic BD Player.

Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />This is one of those rare ones, like The Lightning Thief, it is new Popcorn Entertainment. It ain't real entertainment, it is popcorn entertainment. For most of the movie, I enjoyed the mind-numbing action and the special effects, cheesy lines and everything else that goes good on movie snacks. Don't expect this to be the companion of The Dark Knight and Incredible Hulk, this is more along the companions of Superman The Movie except modern.<br /><br />One thing I found intreging is that people disrespect Robert Downey Jr., he is a great actor, I definatly like his personality. Sherlock Holmes, stuff like that. I don't think this movie DOES or DOES NOT deserve it's amount of fame, it's just fun and nothing else. It's better than what Avatar got, when it deserved nothing. Avatar was a bad movie! But, I don't wanna spend every single one of my reviews talking about how much I hate avatar.<br /><br />Another thing I'm liking is the choice of AC/DC for the music score. Any movie would go great with some AC/DC my friend! (A little Metallica wouldn't hurt either.) The characters are all blockbuster hollywood of 2008, heck, that's how everything feels like, and what's to say that that's a bad thing? This ain't one of the best comic book movies ever, but it is definatly fun.<br /><br />Well, that's it, don't expect the experience of your life just expect fun. There is not much more to say since the whole movie is pretty predictable in that aspect.

This means that you must set aside your rational understanding of physics and science and just relax and enjoy what is a marvelous adventure. Everyone knows that Robert Downey Jr. has some serious character flaws but if there was ever any doubt regarding his acting ability this film should put that to rest. There is no doubt but that Downey is one of the best actors around today -- maybe even the best.  This screenplay in the hands of less capable actors could have been campy or dull but Bridges, Downey, and Paltrow turn it into a really excellent film.  In fact the acting is so good thoroughout that Paltrow's performance is easily overlooked but she is marvelous at showing her love for Downey while he is totally oblivious to her or to his unrecognized love for her.<br /><br />To some this may appear to be an anti-war film or a film with some sort of moral message and maybe they are right -- I really don't know all I know is that this was a really enjoyable film and Downey's performance made it all worth while.<br /><br />I did stay through the seemingly endless credits to see the 30 sec tag scene that foreshadows the sequel.  All I can say in the way of a hint is "what happened to the reconstructed prototype suit?"<br /><br />I gave this film 5 stars and I thought it deserved everyone of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>Good action superhero movie, very slick and very hollywood.

I loved it.<br /><br />Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., owns a weapons manufacturer. On a trip to demonstrate a new missile, the Jericho, which knocks out a wall of defenses with many small bombs deployed from a single shot, he is captured. His captors are essentially killers Al-Qaeda. They want him to build this device.<br /><br />In a cave, he realizes he cannot escape on his own. He'll build the bomb, and then, they'll kill him. Bad deal. He secretly builds the Iron Man suit and gets back home. Fellow captive and engineering genius Dr. Yinsen cautions him, "Don't waste your life." Yinsen gives his life to save Tony's.<br /><br />While in captivity, he sees that his weapons are used by the enemy. Why? How?<br /><br />He had been a sleazy, rich, indulgent womanizer. Now, he sees the light. Not only is he a new man with his morals, but, with his view about weapons. His Iron Man suit will be used for good, by him. Specifically, he will use it to take down the enemy's stock of Stark Industry weapons.<br /><br />One problem. His partner, Obadiah Stane, is in cahoots with the enemy. He sanctioned Stark's capture, and is the one selling Stark products. He double crosses the enemy, and acquires the Iron Man prototype suit and plans.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), previously seen as a plain assistant, starts looking good to Tony Starks. Both realize they are nowhere without the other.<br /><br />What now?<br /><br />Go see it. Surprise ending.<br /><br />When you do, look for Stan Lee. He's the Hugh Hefner lookalike.<br /><br />The acting is solid, with Downey spot-on for the role. Paltrow is replaceable. Jeff Bridges, as Obadiah, is excellently cast. Shaun Toub as Dr. Yinsen carries the role impressively, though we only see him in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Terrence Howard as Lt. Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes is the weakest link, as he comes across too feminine and insipid to be the kind of leader he should be as the liaison between Stark Industries and the military.<br /><br />The movie's messages: heroes are men who do the right thing even if it means sacrifice, and, bigger guns do not necessarily lead to peace. The message is conflicted, however, as it is bigger guns which save the day (with some good ol' experience thrown in).<br /><br />The idea of not wasting one's life -- having purpose and vision -- comes through well. This brings the movie from sheer pulp to something with depth. Tony Stark is not perfect; some of his faults are indefensible. He is, though, a man on a mission. That's a pretty good idea for all of us.<br /><br />Violent at times, horrific at others -- the terrorists here are put in their proper light, but as they murder, it is very realistic and frightening.<br /><br />Sensuality -- Tony Starks is a womanizer, and we see evidence of this, especially as he seduces an equally arrogant Brown University graduate and magazine writer Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb). When Pepper Potts is escorting her out, she refers to her as trash.<br /><br />Would I bring kids? Probably not. PG-13 it is rightly rated.<br /><br />Look for a sequel. I fully recommend "Iron Man."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />http://anthonytrendl.blogspot.com</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>Review Number 447.<br /><br />What has red plates, an arc converter, firepower, the ability to fly, and Robert Downey, Jr inside? Yes, I know you know--Iron Man! What with the magic of movie making tricks, a great cast, a creative director, and the edgy, cagey star power of Downey, why wouldn't this movie be a hit? A BIG HIT!<br /><br />The really wild aspect of this movie is that it does not have the feel or look of a comic book. It's more akin to true sci-fi--take a man who has barbs of a modern bomb in his chest, barbs that will migrate to his heart without a battery attached to keep them stationary. Then take this same man who is a munitions genius holed up in a cave with crazed, power hungry Middle Easterners as his captors, demanding the Jericho bomb for their very own. They have many of his weapon types with the puzzling question--how did these weapons end up in their possession?<br /><br />Tony Stark, son of a powerful, very wealthy weapons designer and maker, and godson of Jeff Bridges' character who assumed the mantle of the company at the founder's death, finally has an awakening to the true meaning of destruction while a captive. He must escape with the mysterious, multi-lingual man who assists him in the creation of an escape device--an iron suit, indestructible (for a short while).<br /><br />I've given a background for Iron Man--how he came to be, his inner turmoil leading to a change in professional and personal direction. Robert Downey Jr. makes this all work with his slim, but not powerful physique. He's just Joe Average physically--well, better than that because he has no fat, but he is not bulked up. It is his face, those eyes that make his every close-up so conducive to the building of the story. In his early middle age, Downey has IT and makes IT work in his character and role.<br /><br />Other actors contribute as much: Jeff Bridges (always a favorite actor) becomes an excellent villain. My gosh, in his first scene the viewer knows  he will be a villain. He looks the part! Terrence Howard continues to build his impressive resume here, although he doesn't have as much to do, but his last line sets his role in a sequel.<br /><br />Although Gwenth Paltrow plays the handy girl assistant-- again, the viewer knows that her role will also expand in the future.  As for the S.H.E.I.L.D. agent, I expected him to say "the Other Christine" at any moment.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is an exciting movie. I expect to see it again! What's the record for reviews of a movie on Amazon? I expect this one will break that record! Once a person views this film she just has to praise it--it's that good (if you like violence and excitement and creative genius and heroes and desire to do the right thing and....see what I mean?)</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Well done but not quite as A quality as the first one.

It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.<br /><br />There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.<br /><br />The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again?<br /><br />There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks good in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound and plenty of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Based on the Marvel comic book character, Tony Stark builds a high tech suit of armor to escape enemies.

I was so bored and confused by this train wreck, I lost interest after 45 minutes of nothing. Robert Downey Jr. is horrible, he brings nothing exciting as Iron Man, highly over-rated actor. I give this film two stars thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard, wish they were in it more, they are the real deal. This is one action film I won't be seeing twice, yuck!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>I've heard how great this movie is for months.  So I finally get to see it...and it seemed like 2 hours before he finally got the damn suit on.  Pretty slow build-up there.  Also the "villain" was...nobody.<br /><br />Good news is Robert Downey Jr. was FANTASTIC as a playboy, pompous businessman, monkeying around with the suit, sitting eating a burger during the "change of heart" press conference etc.  The tension between him as Bond and Paltrow's MoneyPenny (or whatever the hell her name is) was believable too.<br /><br />But once it gets building up to the climax...I really stopped caring.  Particularly when the final battle ends of being a blatant, BLATANT rip-off of the final battle in RoboCop 2.  If you didn't see that one, what happens is little RoboCop ends up fighting a much larger Robot with a gatling gun on his right arm...and later ends up on his back, piggy-back style, destroying it.<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />Christ people...would it kill you to write something original?<br /><br />So I recommend RoboCop 2 (and the orignal of course).  That one's not afraid to splatter blood all over too, instead of G-rating the action for the kiddies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Forgive me for not being familiar with the comic book "Ironman" - I've only put a toe in the graphic novel pool and I've flat-out missed this one.<br /><br />So perhaps my rave review of this comic book adaptation is somewhat uninformed.  But given the fact that the filmmakers went for a PG-13 blockbuster approach, it's hard to imagine how director Jon Favreau (no, not President Obama's speechwriter, but the guy from "Swingers" and "Elf") could have given us a more polished, pitch-perfect movie.<br /><br />Start with a clever and detailed "birth of Ironman" story, a pretty funny script, and a wonderful ensemble of top-notch actors, and you've got a great cocktail.  As has been widely commented, the movie starts and stops with Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance as genius weapon-designer Tony Stark.  Poking gentle fun at Downey's sordid past, "Ironman" provides a fresh perspective on the superhero - Stark is one cool dude.<br /><br />Surrounding him are Gwyneth Paltrow as secretary/love interest Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as sidekick and straight man Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges as the bombastic Obadiah Stane (the name should give you some clues).  These gifted actors breathe life into characters that not only shine in the big scenes but also in the quiet, more mundane moments in the movie.<br /><br />I won't bother recapping the plot - it's pretty by-the-numbers fare - but strongly recommend enjoying this movie for its attention to detail.  Virtually every scene has something to recommend it, which isn't always the case with comic book adaptations because there's often so much darn exposition and backstory.  The first half of the movie shows the birth of Ironman in perhaps the most entertaining form of all - a birth of necessity.  You're so captivated by the character of Stark that you find yourself ignoring the top-notch special effects and how the movie - for all its violence - stays safely on the PG side without descending into "Phantom Menace" cartoonishness.<br /><br />An excellent film that has given birth to a new franchising juggernaut ("Ironman 2" and "Ironman 3" are already in pre-production), "Ironman" is a guilt pleasure without the guilt.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Iron Man and Ray Stark are new to me. I am not a comic book or fantasy fan. However, I enjoyed this film tremendously. The plot though thin, rang true and the superhero is expected to do some real acting. Though his feats are amazing, it is the scenery, his soul and the people supporting him that make this film so good.<br /><br /> Robert Downey, Jr plays Ray Stark, he owns a company that makes and sells high tech weaponry. At the moment he is in Afghanistan showing off his weaponry, when his group is attacked. He spends the next three months  building a suit to protect his new heart and himself. In the process he escapes and comes back to to life in California. Iron Man has a great cast of characters- Terrence Howard, as the military man, Gwyneth Paltrow as his girl Friday and Jeff Bridges as his accomplice in the company- Bridges really wears black. Needless  to say the plot thickens and Iron Man goes on to build a new suit to defend his newly found ethical behavior and save the day.<br /><br />Save the day, he does- Robert Downy Jr is a first rate actor with emotional liability and he is the Iron Man. The other actors are also first rate and this is the film of the past year, IMO.<br /><br />There is a shocking revelation and the hardware is impressive. This is a fun film for all.  The computer aided visuals are impressive and Iron Man, well he has Soul!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-02-09<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DE29SS">Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intruiging: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.<br /><br />There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).<br /><br />When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).<br /><br />Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle & Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.<br /><br />In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man" who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>I vowed some time ago to, once and for all, stopping handing over my time, money and brain cells to sequels, threequels, remakes and franchise.  So since this was the first time IRON MAN was being brought to the big screen, I figured I was safe and would be treated to a good, original superhero movie to follow in the steps of the original Superman, Batman, X-Men and Spiderman.<br /><br />In my (surprised) opinion, no so.  While Robert Downy Jr's acting and spontaneous ability for dialogue and wit never fail to please, the story, for me, fell very short.  If this film is, indeed, based on the original comic book story of Iron Man, then the story failed to impress me.  In this film, it seems you spend more time watching the endless, ongoing process of how his superhero suit is created step-by-step rather than the action and the danger that you crave.  To make matters worse, I felt there were way too many stupid jokes and sight gags inserted into a film that I thought would be much darker, judging by the trailer I'd seen.<br /><br />I'm afraid that IRON MAN gets thrown on the scrap heaps of bad superhero movies like FANTASTIC FOUR.  And Hollywood can rest assured that I will be going nowhere near IRON MAN II, III, IV, etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon!<br /><br />It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have always got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, one of the Merchant's of Death literally has a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)!<br /><br />Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday!<br /><br />I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!<br /><br />For those who think selling weapons is funny see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047026196X">Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BYA5GO">Lord of War (2-Disc Special Edition)</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009AOBP">The Ugly American</a> and most importantly: Committing to Afghanistan: the case for increasing U.S. reconstruction and stabilization aid.: An article from: Military Review<br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction see:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAE">Zardoz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAC">Enemy Mine</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZN7KQ">Fantastic Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630587493X">Bicentennial Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S86J0I">Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Now that all of our summer blockbusters have become nothing but comic book super heroes, some of them still deliver a great time.<br /><br />IRON MAN is one of them.<br /><br />I used to get Iron Man comics as a kid but he wasn't as popular and iconic as Superman or Batman.  In fact, I can't remember any of the villains from his comics, but he had a cool suit and the artwork was as topnotch as the best of Marvel during the 70s.<br /><br />The film version definitely has as much to offer as the best of the super hero movie.  The script is tight, the characters are fleshed out, the humor is funny and genuine, the special effects and production values are topnotch.  Robert Downey Jr. brings a lot to the role of Tony Stark and you almost believe the role was written just for him.<br /><br />IRON MAN leaves you wanting more.  And since it made a gigantic pile of money, I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him.<br /><br />Be sure to stick around for a short scene following the end credits (this past summer's THE INCREDIBLE HULK also featured a post-credits scene of Tony Stark popping up as well!).<br /><br />And, was it just me, or did everyone think that was Kris Kristofferson every time Jeff Bridges showed up?</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Iron Man seems made for Blu-Ray, although it succeeds in any format.  This witty, human, explosive action film sets a high standard, along with The Dark Knight, for the genre.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark, a playboy, irreverent billionaire who believes, like his father, that whoever had the biggest stick keeps the peace.  His company provides the US government with high tech weapons meant to destroy enemies in enormous numbers, and he sees nothing wrong with it.  However, Tony finds himself at the wrong end of Stark Enterprises and has an epiphany.  Iron Man emerges from this psychological low:  a uniquely powered metal suit with jet packs, flame throwers, and brute strength that houses Stark.  A weapon, yes, but one designed to protect.  Unfortunately, his displaced second, once the CEO of Stark Enterprises, Stane (Jeff Bridges) does not agree with the direction Stark intends to take his company.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. is simply perfect for the role of Tony Stark -- he plays smarmy as well as he does brilliant, intense as well as he does comic, heartless as well as he does lovable. His facial expressions while "inside" the Iron Man suit remind us that a human we can empathize with is contained within the seemingly invincible armor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet, if a little ditzy, as romantic interest Pepper Potts, but her performance stands up against Downey Jr's charismatic screen presence, not an easy feat.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning, particularly on Blu-Ray, and the soundtrack is powerful.  The Blu-Ray comes with two discs containing some special features of note:  the creation of the special effects; interviews/commentary, mostly with Stan Lee, of the evolution of the comic book series; and a fun glimpse into Downey Jr's and Bridge's rehearsal of one scene.  Blu-Ray also includes BD Live, if you're into that kind of online chat.  (I don't have the regular DVD, but I assume that the two-disk version has the same extras, minus BD Live.)<br /><br />This was a fun, action-packed, and at times humorous superhero film. Unlike some blockbusters, this film uses special effects to supplement the acting and the action, not the other way around.  I enjoyed every minute of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Get this in the blu ray version.  It looks alot better than the other version and this is great movie.  Everyone in it does a fantastic job<br />that makes this a awesome movie that is everything a blockbuster should be: Entertaining, fine acting, a solid story,  brilliant effects ,<br />and it has characters that are well rounded.  And jeff bridges who makes a fine villian in this story.  He was always underestimated as a actor and this movie lets him create a believable slimy villian who might be working in any organization.  The movies have finally caught up to my old 1960's comic books in their ability to depict great fantasy heroes.</p></br></body></html>

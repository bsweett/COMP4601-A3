I am not a fan of John Singleton, nor do I go out of my way to watch gangst related movies or listen to music, but this was an interesting movie in so many ways.<br /><br />The Four Brothers, Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, have reunited over the death of their adoptive mother.  Gunned down seemingly at random in a local grocery store, the four return to their hometown of Detroit for her funeral.  They discover that their mother's murder wasn't exactly a random act of violence but part of a larger plot whose motivations seem unknown.  They go out on the prowl, attempting to find how it is that their mother, a seemingly insignifigant person, is connceted to a sticky web of crime from the police department through the crime kingpins of Detroit.<br /><br />This was a good movie in the fact that you know from the beginning that there is far more to their mother's murder than meets the eye.  They will eventually overturn rocks and stones to find out more.  The obvious comic relief of Angel's Latino girlfriend's hot blooded explosions make for some funny moments.  Their past as troubled kids will aid their search (breaking into houses, firearms, etc.), making them forces to be reconed with.  Their obvious distain for the police and knowledge of police tactics to make them confess to something they didn't do also makes them smarter and crafier than the "bad guys" and "good guys".  Plus the violence of Detroit as a backdrop always make for good times.  Why not five stars?  The plot eventually thins out towards the end.  Even after seeing it once, I had to watch it a second time to understand exactly what their mother's murder had to do with this crime wave in Detroit.  Yet, it's a good movie about love and family even under the dreariest of circumstances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) was a saintly woman, a white-haired grandmother who tried to make things better in her neighborhood in Detroit. When we meet her she is in a convenience store convincing a young boy that shoplifting is not a good path to take in life. However, after winning that small but important victory she is brutally murdered along with the store clerk by a couple of masked men. Everybody who knew Evelyn comes to her funeral, including her four adopted sons. Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) are white, Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah( Andre Benjamin) are black, but such distinctions did not matter to Evelyn and they do not matter to these "Four Brothers."<br /><br />The four are Evelyn's only adopted sons because she managed to place all of the dozens of other foster children she took into her home. But these four were apparently incorrigible, which not only explains why they were never adopted but also why they are going to take matters into their own hands after their mother's funeral. They still try to be good to honor their mother, but unleashing their bad sides might be needed under the circumstances. Suffice it to say that her murder was not happenstance and most of John Singleton's film is devoted to finding out is responsible for her death and doing something about it. This does not sit well with Lt. Green (Terrence Howard) and Detective Fowler (Josh Charles), who are working the case and know all about the unsavory reputations of the Mercer boys, but clearly this part of the Motor City is run by the criminals, in this case the crime boss Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor). So we know who is ultimately guilty, but the question is why Evelyn had to die and that takes a while to unravel from the brothers' end of the story.<br /><br />I was going to say that the four brothers are willing to go where the police will not go and do what the cops are afraid to do, but since these cops are perfectly willing to beat up suspects during an interrogation it is clearly more the former than the latter than matters here (and there is a nice running gag of sorts involving a hair in a plastic bag). Singleton is not pretending to make a message film like "Boyz in the Hood," but rather telling an urban tale that is really more like an old fashioned Western than any of the more obvious genres it brings to mind (the fact Singleton said as much was a big clue). "Four Brothers" is not a great action thriller, but it is certainly a solid one and has the virtue of not having the negative aspects that are often attendant with such films. Plus, what the brothers do to the bad guy in the end, well, that is just plain cold.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>John Singleton's latest is a decent enough time passer & a remake to the John Wayne film, "The Sons Of Katie Elder".<br /><br />The Mercer boys, four adopted brothers return home to pay their respects after their mother has been gunned down in a grocery holdup gone bad.

Unlike most other action movies, it's not laden down with total explosions in every scene. Some comic lines were thrown in, as well as one very angry off Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg did an excellent job portraying Bobby Mercer, but the major surprise was Andre 3000. With no huge action or acting experience, he took on the role and nailed it. With the help of Garrett Hedlund and Tyrese Gibson, "Four Brothers" showed how one diverse family can come together to avange their mother.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Evelyn Mercer (Flanagan) was a foster mom all her life, taking in many kids.  In all her life there were only four kids that she could not find homes for: Bobby (Wahlberg), Angel (Gibson), Jeremiah (Benjamin), and Jack (Hedlund).  They were still bad seeds, but not nearly as bad as they would have been without Evelyn.  They considered her to be their mother, and each other to be brothers.<br /><br />Evelyn's murder at a convenience store in her neighborhood brings the four brothers back home.  They attend the funeral and soon decide that since Evelyn did so much for them, perhaps they should do some informal investigating into her murder.  It doesn't take long for them to sense there was more to it than Evelyn being caught in a simple robbery, and the brothers begin to rattle some cages that may be better left unrattled.<br /><br />One of the strongest points of "Four Brothers" is the relationship between the brothers.  The comraderie is very beliveable, and is what holds the film together.  "Four Brothers" is very much a revenge film set in the mean streets of Detroit, and as such is successful.  This movie engaged me more than I anticipated, and I was pleasantly surprised with it.  For those seeking a good urban revenge movie, look no further than "Four Brothers".</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>Four Brothers is dubbed an "Urban Western" in one of the special features on the DVD. The filmmakers hit the 'Western' imagery right on the head. With vigilante justice and unlikely bonds, the stuff of old-time Westerns, the film comes alive as brothers seek revenge after the slaying of their mother. Plot twists and action will hold your attention. Some portions of the film are a bit unreal, but that's so in every Western I've ever seen. In the beginning, it's hard, as a viewer, to apply the 'Western' style to a hard urban community. For me, the relationships seemed a little awkward in this style. But the angle is a brave and successful move for the writers, director and producer. The acting is also superb. All four 'brothers' bring something special to the cinematic table.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>This is not the type of movie that you can watch while distracted or doing something else.  I went to the show to see this movie and did not get it at all, so I rented it to see what I was missing. At the show, it just seemed like a lot of shooting, a guy trying to deal with his dramatic girlfriend, a trigger happy brother, a family man who's fighting the bad guy lifestyle, and a very confused brother who doesn't know whether he wants to be a rockstar or a gangster.  The four meet to find out who killed their brother and although the other three realize this may be heavier than they thought, there's always that one testosterone heavy guy who think he's Superman.  Mr. Testosterone is the ringleader in many fights, shoot-outs, and all four unite for justice.  This movie is proof of how brother bond, regardless of race, when loyalty comes into play.  I'm definitely glad I gave it a second chance.<br /><br />Side Note: The soundtrack music is on point.  Classic music by artists like the Temptations and Marvin Gaye play in the background, which makes this modern day western even cooler.  I wish the scene with Angel's character and the bathtub could've been shown in the deleted scenes so I could see whether it looked believable, but I cracked up at the "Bobby teases Jack" scene. I wish that would've been left in the movie to make Bobby's character more human (and hilarious).<br /><br />My only problem with this movie was Mark Wahlberg saying the n-word. I don't care how much or how long his character is supposed to be from the streets: there are still certain barriers not to be crossed.  Other than that, great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7NFDO3I1TA.html">A4X7NFDO3I1TA</a><br/><p>This is a very good movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

If you like wall to wall violence and action, then you will probably love the film.  The acting is decent especially considering that some rookie actors have some big parts.  What bothered me is the realism.  I watched a gun pulled out in the middle of a basketball court in front of hundreds, then a gun battle in a nearby apartment, and not a single police siren to be heard.  Later on a high speed chase and gun battle through the streets and no police.  Finally a machine gun fight in the middle of a residencial neighborhood for 10 minutes and no police.  They do portray Detroit as a lawless town, but this was crazy.  The only other thing I didn't like was the images/ghost of the boy's mother popping up.  I would rather have had a brief story in the beginning of the movie to set up her character and the influence she had on the boys.  I think if you want a straight action film and don't think about it too much, this one is for you, it certainly is exciting.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>quite watchable. wahlberg did a great job as the leading role and proved to be a very talented actor. read the reviews about this movie from filmcritic.com and rottentomatoes.com first, and decided to take a look. turned out to be pretty cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Four Brothers" is a kind of urban Western with a straightforward revenge theme. Four grown brothers who were adopted by Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanigan) when they were delinquent youths reunite in Detroit for their mother's funeral. The eldest is Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), a lone wolf with street smarts and a real violent streak. Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) is a family man with plans for a business who stayed in Detroit. Angel (Tyrese Gibson) is an ex-Marine. And the youngest is Jackie (Garrett Hedlund), an aspiring musician who lacks the toughness of the others.  Evelyn was shot to death in a convenience store robbery. But when the brothers find out that her murder may have been premeditated, they set out to find out what happened and to avenge their mother's death. As the brothers rampage through their way to the culprits, police Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard) is conducting his own investigation.<br /><br />"Four Brothers" seemed to me a relentless violent rampage in which no one's behavior was redeemable or made any sense until I realized the film's structure and themes are similar to that of a classic Western. The brothers represent vigilante justice in a story about revenge, corruption, and a violent battle of wills and wits between 2 opposing forces. It's a masculine tale in which men fight over a wrong done to a woman, Evelyn, who remains foremost in their memories. Assuming you don't mind that the protagonists unquestioningly embrace brutality as their method of operation, whether the situation calls for it or not, the trouble is that the brothers lack depth and are completely devoid of ethics or any code of conduct. They think of no one but themselves and their own loss, which sets this apart from Westerns.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg shows off his star quality as the leader of the pack. Tyrese Gibson is undeniably charismatic. Outkast member Andre Benjamin is certainly a convincing actor. Director John Singleton draws on 1970s cinema for the visual style. But these characters are only sporadically thoughtful, and their actions, no matter how hair-raising, are not interesting. There is a glaring error in the brothers' ages. The youngest, Jackie, was adopted at age 16. Bobby is at least 10 years older. The boys could not all have been in Evelyn's household at the same time. That may be a casting problem, not a script problem, but it's sloppy.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2005): Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 9 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 ? min), and an audio commentary by director John Singleton. "The Look of The Brothers" (10 min) talks about creating the look of winter in Detroit in Hamilton, Canada and Evelyn's house on a soundstage with director of photography Peter Menzies, Jr., production designer Keith Brian Burns, and costume designer Ruth Carter, among others. "Crafting Four Brothers" (10 min) interviews writers Paul Lovett and David Elliot about the characters and the action sequences, and John Singleton talks about the brothers' relationships. In "Behind the Brotherhood" (9 min) producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura and the cast talk about Singleton's direction and each other. In "Mercer House Shootout" (4 min) special effects supervisor Neil Trifunovich explains how he created the shoot-out sequence. In the audio commentary, John Singleton provides a scene-by-scene comments on the choices he made, including technical details, performances, story, and editing. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The four adopted sons (Mark Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, and Garret Hedlund) of a selfless woman (Fionnula Flanagan) who dedicated her life to the poor go on the warpath in a search for the truth and vengeance.  The result is a pretty standard revenge flick with some good performances and a nice bit of poetic irony in the main villain's fate.  Despite the concept of a mixed-race group that considers itself related, this is a merely decent rehash of material that has been done a thousand times before.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>I had expected only to like this movie. I had seen the trailer and commercials and from them the movie looked decent. I had not expected to run out and buy a copy after seeing it so I could watch it time and time again; I did not expect to love it, only to be entertained. And I was entertained, at parts...but only a few of them.<br /><br />The self-help street justice that the brothers turn to in their effort to avenge their adopted mother's killer was over-the-top unbelievable. The "saintly" woman who took these lost-cause boys into her home apparently did not do nearly as good of a job raising them as everyone gave her credit for. She took these boys when no one else wanted them. She gave them a home when no one else would. In her and each other, they had family. But then they grew up, went their separate ways and never got off the streets. Only one of the four appears to have his head on straight.<br /><br />Marky Mark was good in his role, but the role just wasn't impressive. None of the roles were. The writing and the action were hijacked out of some 80s movie that is only aired on the basic channels Saturday afternoons when the networks have nothing else to show. I would have thought the film industry had evolved beyond movies like this.<br /><br />I am usually a supporter of violence in movies. In most action movies it can paint a picture. In Four Brothers it was senseless and unnecessary as it just leads you back to the idea that what the brothers got away with was completely ridiculous.<br /><br />The ending. Oh my, the ending. "There is a plot twist coming, I can feel it... Wait, was that it? Was that the big finish? Huh. I guess it was." I just narrated your thought process as you watch the end of Four Brothers.<br /><br />I think the plot was too big for the movie and there was no way the makers could have achieved what they wanted. I cannot imagine a scenario when this would be a movie worth watching.

The sons vow to find and kill the ones who did this.  They later find out that it was not a simple robbery but that that their mother was followed and executed.<br /><br />The movie is full of senseless violence and makes Detroit look like a state of anarchy.  Sofia Vergara has a stereotypical role as a dumb Latin lover of one of the four brother which looks like a role that will be a career killer for her.<br /><br />The ending is fairly predictable and the movie's plot and stupid dialogue often is an insult to anyone's intelligence.

She has just been murdered and they are out for revenge. It sounds like a good theme and there's some star power here too as Mark Wahlberg plays the lead and Terrance Howard has a small part as a cop.  But the screenplay was so outlandish that there were parts that I laughed out loud when I should have been serious.  Everyone has guns, lots of guns, and there are wild shootouts with bodies strewn all over the place.  To their credit, the actors do a good job.  Their performances were good although it was hard to pay attention to their acting with all that gunfire going on.  The plot was disjointed and murky and made no sense whatsoever.  It was easy, however, to tell the good guys from the bad guys because the bad guys always had smirks on their faces.  This is a silly silly film which is targeted towards pre-adolescent boys who are more interested in the gunplay than the reality of the plot.<br /><br />Keep away from this one.

This time to Detroit to seek revenge for a fallen mother.  To his credit, he tries to cross racial lines by coming up with four foster brothers, two black, two white, and the ex-hippie white mama who raised them.  He tries to blend action with social commentary but it is like oil and water, with the result being a disjointed film that barely manages to keep its head above water.  Wahlberg puts in the most compelling performance as the older brother who feels he can muscle himself through any situation.  Andre Benjamin has a more complex role as he tries to balance his family with the return of his three prodigal brothers, but in the end the four take on the lawless neighborhood like the James gang, cleaning up the Detroit suburb terrorized by a ruthless gangster, while invoking images of their dead mom. Great for teenagers who want something a little more than the usual action flick, but Singleton has yet to recapture the form he exhibited in "Boyz in the Hood."</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I guess in the age of NO talent movie stars, writters that love violence and Hollywood being a distructive force for morality this movie doesn't surprise me.  Nor will it surprise you.  It's Hollywood telling the same old story over and over again but each time with a little more violence.  As most educated people know this kind of thing just shows the rest of the world what kind of people we really are.  They see everything from the eyes of the media and Hollywood.  I wait for the fall of Hollywood.  The talent just doesn't exist anymore.  The time of good Hollywood stars, music scores, writers, directors, costume designers and now a thing of the past.  Save yourself money and not go which would be the political correct thing to do as far as i'm concerned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) drives into his childhood Detroit neighborhood, returning home to bury his adopted mother, Evelyn (Fionnula Flanagan, "The Others"). At the funeral, he meets up with two of his three other brothers; Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin of Outkast fame), now a family and business man, and Jack (Garret Hedlund). Evelyn was the foster mother for hundreds of kids and adopted Bobby and his brothers when no one would have them. After the funeral, they return to her house and find their fourth sibling, Angel (Tyrese Gibson), sitting on the porch. Soon, they learn that Evelyn's death, during a convenience store robbery, may have been more than a simple case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. An old childhood friend, Green (Terrence Howard, "Hustle and Flow", "Crash"), now a detective, warns them against taking matters into their own hands. But take matters they do, and they begin to investigate, leading them closer and closer to a local gangster, Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Dirty Pretty Things", "Melinda and Melinda").<br /><br />When you read the synopsis of "Four Brothers", or hear about it, each of the elements seems to say "Huh? That won't work. That can't work." But combined, and married to good acting, good writing and good directing by John Singleton, the film is a surprisingly effective dramatic tale.<br /><br />The key to the film's success is that it is R-rated. I don't necessarily need to see an R-rated film every time I go to the movies, but if the film is about four men trying to find the person who killed their mother, on the mean streets of Detroit, an R-rating will allow the filmmaker to be more realistic. In this age of PG-13 horror and action films, something gets lost. In a horror film, I expect to see some blood. In a PG-13 horror film, you aren't going to see a lot. In an R-rated action film, I expect to see some violence. "Brothers" is all the more realistic because Bobby and his siblings throw some punches, people get hit by bullets and they use some R-rated words. They grew up in the slums of Detroit. I wouldn't expect them to say "Gee, I'm sorry for that" or something equally as innocuous. And because the story centers on their quest to find a killer, some violence is to be expected. And delivered. Much like the recent R-rated "Wedding Crashers", filled with rating appropriate humor, I applaud this recent trend to deliver films with content appropriate ratings rather than trying to tailor the content for a kid-friendly (or a teenager friendly) rating. Filmmakers should stand by their vision and not allow it to be changed to meet an artificial rating.<br /><br />Because of the R-rating, Singleton is able to allow the characters to be true to themselves. Because Bobby lives in a violent world, he doesn't have to think twice about using violence to get to his goal. Bobby is a really complex character and Wahlberg does a great job of conveying the conflicting emotions at work. Green introduces each of the Mercer boys to his partner, Fowler (Josh Charles), as they sit in their car watching each arrive for the funeral. After Green describes their various criminal records, Fowler is incredulous that Evelyn is regarded so highly in the community. "But, they are all the Dalai Lama compared to what they would've been without her influence." Bobby is clearly affected by his mother's memory and influence, especially staying in her home, but he desperately wants to find out the truth. As the oldest of the four boys, he also has to provide protection and leadership to his brothers.<br /><br />Andre Benjamin is also surprisingly good. Often musicians don't make the transition to film well (Hello, Mariah Carey? Lance Bass? Justin Timberlake?), but Benjamin shows some real acting ability. He also shows his seriousness for the medium and doesn't sing during the film, or on the soundtrack. He is a family man with a wife and two daughters to think about, so he doesn't participate as quickly in his brothers' scheme. But when he becomes linked to the action, he realizes he has no choice and reluctantly participates. Angel and Jack are really Bobby's henchmen throughout, following him without objection to any corner of the neighborhood.<br /><br />Terrence Howard does some good work as Green, but it is a supporting role and, compared to his other work in "Crash" and "Hustle and Flow", unremarkable.<br /><br />As Evelyn, Fionnula Flanagan has the least amount of screen time, but she manages to instantly convey why this woman was so revered in the community. Before she is shot, she has a brief exchange with a local boy in the convenience store, quickly establishing her character. Later in the film, each of the boys imagines her talking to them. All of these appearances establish her as a tough, but kind woman who is only afraid when someone is pointing a gun at her face.<br /><br />Chiwetel Ejiofor plays one of the most chilling villains in a long time. Victor Sweet is a vicious man and will take anything and kill anyone he wants. The final scenes involving him are particularly memorable, because the outcome is unexpected, yet believable.<br /><br />Singleton is clearly trying to evoke the feel of gangster films from the 70s; Wahlberg even drives around in an old car from this period throughout most of the film. The cinematography is gritty and the soundtrack is filled with songs from this era. All of this adds to the feel of the film, making everything stand out.<br /><br />But the film is most successful because it doesn't pull any punches. "Four Brothers" is a gritty, violent, believable look at the revenge four brothers take for their beloved mother's death.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Never underestimate the bonds of family.  That could easily have been the tagline for this terrific revenge/murder mystery.  With "Four Brothers", director John Singleton (2000's "Shaft" remake) takes this mantra to the extreme, showing that no matter what, when the chips are down you can always count on your family to watch your back.<br /><br />After their saintly foster mother (Fionnula Flanagan) is murdered in a convenience store, her adopted sons, two white and two black, come home to pay their respects.  Three out of the four brothers, Jack (Garrett Hedlund), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), are content to believe that what happened was just a case of wrong place/wrong time.  However, oldest brother Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) believes that they should at least try to find who did this, and deliver some punishment.  In their search for answers, the brothers discover that their mom was not just a random killing, but a planned execution that is tied into a vast conspiracy ranging from the Detroit police, to city council, to a local drug kingpin.  Now, the brothers are in a fight to not only bring down those responsible, but also walk away  with their lives intact.<br /><br />The gritty, hard edged violence of "Four Brothers" gives the movie a modern urban western tone, that is nicely balanced by the brothers' bond to one and other.  John Singleton was careful to show that though the oldest brother, Bobby, was hot-headed and wanted vengeance on the killers, words of wisdom from his other brothers prevailed.  Causing him to stay his hand, until all responsible were discovered, and the conspiracy revealed.  A well-written story that takes time to allow the audience connect with the brothers, and feel their deep pain, before engaging in the revenge arc of the story.  This was key, so that the audience wouldn't view the brothers deeds as no better than those responsible for their mother's death.  All of the actors in "Four Brothers" were outstanding, one character I wish they would have developed a little more was that of Detective Green (Terrence Howard), an uncorruptable Detroit police officer, who knows that the brothers are planning vengeance, but is torn between his duty as a cop and his duty as a friend of the family.  The action scenes are fast, intense, and in some cases brutal, but never gratuitous, with only minimal amounts of blood and gore shown.<br /><br />With its focus on strong family bonds, and a think before you shoot mentality, "Four Brothers" rises above your average revenge movie, and is a thoroughly entertaining and engaging film that most people will enjoy.<br /><br />"Four Brothers" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>John Singleton has a gift for depicting the gritty side of life and making it credible: there are reasons for heads-up defensive action in neighborhoods where perpetrators and victims live side by side in a world teetering on imbalance.<br /><br />FOUR BROTHERS is a finely tuned, taut little film that demonstrates the influence of a caring adult on kids with little future can impact lives.  Evelyn Mercer (a terrific Fionnula Flanagan) is a single woman who adopted four orphans as children and raised them tightly bonded brothers: two are white (ex-con Bobby - Mark Wahlberg - and gay musician Jack - Garrett Hedlund: two are African American - (gentle Angel - Tyrese Gibson - and stay-at-home businessman Jeremiah - Andr&eacute; Benjamin).  The four brothers reunite when their mother is killed during a store holdup.  Knowing that the Detroit police are a corrupt organization they take matters into their own hands, seeking out their mother's killers.  Along the way they discover aspects of each other that draw them eventually even closer as brothers.<br /><br />The cast is excellent with fine cameo performances from Terrence Howard and Josh Charles as polar opposite policemen, from Flanagan (who though murdered in the first frames of the film reappears to 'spiritually' influence the brothers), Chiwetel Ejiofor as the bad guy, Taraji P. Henson as Jeremiah's wife and Sof&iacute;a Vergara as Angel's girlfriend.  The story is solid if a bit predictable, but the messages are many about racism, brotherhood, family importance, and awareness of police corruption.  Singleton directs with breakneck speed yet allows us time to get to know everyone in the story.  This is a dandy action film with a heart.

I'm not going to say this is the gritty urban version of the mid-'60's shoot-'em-up John Wayne western. I'm not going to say it. THE HELL I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT! Even the four brothers swagger and demeanor, their sibling regard for one another, and their distinct characters, while poking around dangerous city streets looking for the killer of their adopted mother, suggest the actors studied that classic western intently. Give them cowboy hats, a few cows roaming around, some six-guns at their side, and you have, "The Sons of Katie Elder", in leather and jeans. And that's fine because "Four Brothers" is as entertaining, as wholesome and nobly violent, as the pistol-packing template that inspired it. You come to believe in this brooding male family unit, and the Motown classics soundtrack, and other soul and rock music sprinkled throughout, (apparently Mom was a big Temptations fan), gives the film a cool '70's feel, like The Sons of Katie Elder meets Shaft.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>this movie was better than i expected! the plot of the movie was well written(what son out here that wouldn't go all out for their mother)and touching! the cast of this movie were also well placed! if you are a guy and you love your mother, this movie will have you clapping with enjoyment! and it will also make you want to call your big or little brother on the phone just to say hi!</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I went into this movie with no knowledge of it except the info on the back of the DVD.

What I also found interesting is that thier mother was a foster home worker that couldn't find homes for the four children, so she adopted them into a loving home. They were children of different races and orientation which isn't presented in movie format very often. I was very impressed with the way this was presented with humor and common conflicts within a family.

Well, although I have enjoyed a few Singleton flicks, I did not expect to enjoy this one as much as I did.<br /><br />The Mercer brothers return to their hometown of Detroit to bury a woman who loved them like they were her own. All four men, now brothers, were adopted by a woman, who did not care that they were different races with torrid pasts, but who loved them regardless of what they did.  She instilled different traits in each of them in an effort to make them successful in life. Although, according to Terrance Howard's character, they were the only four kids that she could not "save" or find homes for. Anyway, these brothers are thrust together by their mother's death, and an investigation into who killed her and why. As they embark on a quest to find the truth they learn alot about themselves and grow closer. Through a series of conversations, we learn a lot about each character, and we see each of them fight their own demons, and navigate through self awareness as they solve the crime. We find that the love that they have for each is more than if they were blood brothers.<br /><br />This story will make you laugh (there are some funny moments) and cry (one brother dies), but the entire story will make you smile. The real journey is the one that begins when your heart allows you to love unconditionally, and that is the true point of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>Evelyn Mercer has been the shining light in a number of down and out kids' lives since she moved to Detroit. Her life was about helping every kid she could get a home and a chance at a better life. There were four kids she just couldn't find a home for; she gave them hers so they would grow up with some amount of love and positive direction in their lives even if the world outside thought they were nothing but trash. In return they loved her for it.<br /><br />Four Brothers opens with Evelyn providing some of her loving direction to a young boy who was stealing candy from a corner store. After he leaves she goes about her shopping. A few minutes later she hears two men come in and rob the place. It is a very intense scene where she ducks behind a shelving unit and listens to the interaction between a Black masked man and the young Indian clerk. The man in the mask makes a poignant statement about how a brother can't make no living from the country his in and shoots the clerk. Evelyn's squeal of shock alert to her presence and they find and kill her. Big mistake.<br /><br />Evelyn's four boys return home for her funeral, tie up affairs associated with a death and pick up where they left off as brothers. The four men; two black, two white and no blood relation are obviously brothers. In their neighbourhood they are known as the Mercer brothers: Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah, and Jack. As they begin to look into their mother's death they realize there's a little more to the story than a simple corner store robbery. The more they look the angrier they get and the angrier they get the more heads rolls. The police and the local crime boss are not going to keep them from their task of finding out the truth behind their mother's death.<br /><br />The movie had a slow start but once the action starts it doesn't stop. Four Brothers has great cinematography, action, acting and story. It was not predictable at all. Just when I thought I knew who was behind everything there's an exciting twist. I loved all four actors playing the brothers and am looking forward to seeing it again. Some of the features include deleted scenes, a featurette on the brothers and one on a major snow storm stunt drive.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>And thats what you get with this film, something gritty and real and much better than to be expected.  The movie revolves around four brothers, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) the oldest, Angel (Tyrese Gibson) the gangster, Jerimiah (Andre Benjamin) the family man and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) the youngest, as they search for the man (men) that killed their mother (the woman that adopted them).  Due to the boys criminal past (All but Jerimiah) the police seem to not want to get off their backs.  Detective Green (Howard) seems sympathetic enough but his partner Fowler doesn't want to let up.  Bobby, Angel and Jack set off in search for theirs mothers killer while Jerimiah tends to his own set of demons.  Following gang member after gang member, beating on a few doors and killing a few thugs the three boys (err...men) uncover some secrets they wished they hadn't that may or may not incriminate their 'goody-two-shoes' brother Jerimiah.  Four Brothers is filled with the action and humor that makes it an entertaining film, and while not an oscar film the acting is quite good for everyone involved, but more notibly Marky-Mark who does an excilent job as the older brother who not only has to battle the fact that his mother has been killed but he also has to battle himself, trying to protect his brothers while avenging his mother.  He does well showing the vast ranges in emotion.  I'm not a fan of Howard, I don't see what the big attraction is and I was actually happy he only had a few scenes in the film...but other than that my only real complaint is the final showdown between Victor (our villan) and Jerimiah which resembles all too well the ending to Training Day and while Victor was yelling at his former associates all I could see was Denzel screaming "King Kong aint got $#!+ on me!" but all in all the movie was an entertaining ride and well worth the price of admition.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Finally a story that is about family, and the importance of such.

Angel and Jeremiah are black, and Bobby and Jack are white. However the four brothers still love each other and consider themselves family, no matter how many people look at them strangely as they call themselves brothers.<br /><br />The plot of the movie takes a dark turn as the four brothers start to learn that the random murder of Evelyn may not have been random at all. What results from that startling revelation is that Bobby, Angel, and Jack disobey police orders to not get involved in the case and go on a driven quest to find out who killed their beloved mother and why.<br /><br />The movie is filled with violence, and strong language. Some scenes involve drive by shootings, a wild car chase between the brothers and the two men who killed their mom, and a fist fight at the end between one of the brothers [I won't spoil who it is] and the sole man responsible for the death.<br /><br />Crooked cops, corrupt politicains, gang members, and organized crime all take shots at the four men and some scenes seem to have a million bullets flying everywhere. But there are moments of intense excitement and none of the action scenes seem to be overdone on violent killings.

The story line however is a bit different, not following any pre-set revenge flick formula.  The Mercer brothers - foster brothers in fact- return home to bury their sainted foster mother Evelyn Mercer (played by Fionnula Flanagan).  And Evelyn's boys, who have been for the most channeled into productive lives through her efforts, certainly are familiar with the code of the street.  Once Evelyn's buried, it's time for an eye for an eye - and then some.  I know, this sounds formula like, but it isn't.  What distinguishes this movie is how director Singleton give all the characters dimension and depth, but in such a way that never strips the move of it's shoot-em-up nature.  Make no mistake, this is an extremely violent movie, but at its heart it teaches, without preaching, mutual love and respect for family.  Given the vehicle, a revenge flick, this is a really hard to thing to pull off, with most directors just increasing the body count and bullets to compensate.  But Singleton succeeds brilliantly.  In particular, I was impressed by what must be one of Wahlberg's best performances.  Too often lately he's been packaged as some sort of super cool Steve McQueen type, a really icy dude. In contrast, "Four Brothers" taps into Wahlberg's inner thug, seeing at last the fire and passion that you sensed was always there, but had been kept largely under wraps.  Well, as it says on the tattoo on his back: "No Mercy" (This is for you Mom).  This is a B flick, but one with a heart of gold that nevertheless refuses to compromise its street sense.  Good stuff!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is a highly entertaining film that is well written and directed. I have to admit that I never got ahead of the plot's final ironies which are surprising twists of fate. It is the story of a family of four boys reared by an adopted mother willing to take in rough homeless kids from rough families. Mark Wahlberg is excellent as Bobby Mercer along with his three other adopted brothers played by Andre Benjamin, Garret Hedlund, and Tyrese Gibson. The fact that two of these fellows were white and two were black worked very well in this film where affiliation lines were drawn over many differences and similarities. The family arguments and struggles are very realistic and show how brothers struggle with each other, no matter what race they may be. The brothers are each distinct and unique giving the film further depth. The highest praise I can give is that the bonds between the brothers felt authentic. The city of Detroit is highly visible in the film. After the death of their adopted mother Evelyn, these fellows begin to discover that there may have been more than random crime at work in her death. Terrence Howard is superb as a childhood friend who has become a police officer and is willing to give the brothers some inside information. The puzzle of their mother's death begins to point to a hateful local mobster played perfectly by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The scene where this mobster makes one of his hit men and the hit man's wife eats French fries off the floor like dogs is priceless. It may sound predictable but the action is fast and dramatic, the plot has many twists, and the ending was one of the most emotionally satisfying that I have seen in a long time. It is a violent film, highly suspenseful, based on revenge and murder, but non-the-less it is highly entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>After their adoptive mother is murdered during a grocery store hold-up, the Mercer brothers--hotheaded Bobby, hard-edged Angel, family man and businessman Jeremiah, and hard rocking Jack--reunite to take the matter of her death into their own hands.

She was shot in what seemed a random robbery-gone-wrong in a convenient store. There were four brothers even though they did not resemble each other a bit. All four were adopted by a murdered woman many years ago when she was a social worker and tried to find new homes for the children from dysfunctional families. Nobody wanted those four. She did. She took them in, brought them up, gave them love and support and they called her mom and themselves - brothers. Now she is dead, and the brothers start their own investigation on the dirty and often deadly streets of their childhood city to find those who were behind the murder. Very soon they discover that the robbery was a cover up for a hit murder. Someone wanted their mother dead and paid for her murder. Four brothers Mercer, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), the leader, the oldest, toughest, short- tempered, and stubborn; Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), the only family man of four who had taken care of the mother the last years; Angel (Tyres Gibson), the sexy one, and Jack (Garrett Hedlund), the youngest, whom three older brothers try to protect, are determined to avenge their mother's death no matter what it would cost. The film was directed by John Singleton as an urban thriller -revenge movie which is also a family drama, and I like it very much. It is violent, gritty, it moves well, it's got many plot turns on its way, it is packed with very effective dynamic action scenes, and acting is very good by all principal players. I was especially impressed by Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Victor Sweet, the pure evil despite his name. Ejifor said once, "I like to disappear into a role. I equate the success of it with a feeling of being chemically changed". The actor whom I first noticed in a compelling role of an illegal immigrant in London in the film Dirty Pretty Things (2002), was frightening in Four Brothers. I am also becoming a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He's got charisma and screen presence. The film does not fail to provide some humor, to show how much the four brothers mean to one another, and what the woman whom they lost meant to them. I missed the movie when it was released and actually did not know anything about it until this evening when its opening scene grabbed my attention; I began watching and did not leave until the credits started rolling.<br /><br />A bit of trivia: John Singleton is the youngest Oscar nominated director. He received the honors at the age of 24 after completing and releasing his directorial debut, the phenomenal Boyz n the Hood (1991) which was based on his own childhood in a LA ghetto. Where do you move if you start your career on such high note? Four Brothers may not be as great as Boyz n the Hood but it is a darn good and entertaining film.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Four adoptive brothers find each other again when they learn that their foster mother has been killed in seemingly random grocery store robery in Detroit.

Wonderful cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p>Personally, I don't think I would resort to murder, but for the four brothers in this movie there was no doubt how far they would go. Set off by the police force's lack of effort (in their eyes) in finding their adoptive mother's killer, the four brothers take vigilante justice to a whole new level. Nearly lost in the plot of killing, corruption and revenge though is a story about family, loyalty and love, even respect (for the woman who raised them mostly). I was touched by their Thanksgiving meal where they each saw her, except Bobby, who finally saw her at the end. Josh Charles plays another smarmy, dirty cop (like he did in SWAT) and Garrett Hedlund does an amazing job as the troubled, youngest brother who tries so hard to make the older ones proud. A well done piece by Singleton for sure, it could have been set in any large city but he picked Detroit. Interesting. This movie is very gritty and violent, but I was drawn right in and everytime I thought I had it figured out there was another twist.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Four Brothers begins with a terrible shooting. Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), a dedicated social worker, is shot in a convenience store holdup. The crime seems senseless and inexplicable, but her death brings together the four young boys she adopted when she couldn't place them in any other foster home.<br /><br />Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) Jack (Garrett Hedlund) Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) couldn't be more different, but their mother's death devastates them, bringing these ne'er do wells back to snow-covered Detroit. Regardless of their different paths in life they have always considered themselves to be Four Brothers.<br /><br />But perhaps Evelyn's death was not so accidental after all, a closer analysis of the store's videotape makes the crime looks as though it was planned.  Suspicion forces the brothers into a confrontation with a ruthless local crime czar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who specializes in bullying dominance, forcing his subordinates to eat off the floor.<br /><br />The brothers are helped in the search for the killer by a kindly police officer played with panache by Terrance Howard.  But as the clues unravel, the brothers discover shady dealings, criminal manipulation, and police corruption as the four are determined to get to the bottom of the seemingly senseless killing.<br /><br />Four Brothers' strength is its richly varied cast and a story that starts out strong and builds into a tale of vengeance and retaliation. But the film also has a coarse and edgy quality and it manages to convey with a degree of resonance, a world of grit, crooked cops, gang lords, and contract killers who inevitably control the landscape. The tough quartet is often forced into vigilante action in order to see justice done. Bullets and foul language rule as these bad boys seek out and kill other bad boys who just happen to stand in their way.<br /><br />But the ultimate problem with Four Brothers is its overly convoluted plot. I'm still not quite sure who killed Evelyn, why she was killed, and how she was supposedly involved in all the shady dealings. It's as though the director John Singleton loses focus with the story, while attempting to make a violent film appeal to as many people as possible. Despite his best intentions to portray multi-ethnic brotherhood united in affection, he merely ends shooting up Detroit.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Four Brothers is reasonably compelling, and Mark Wahlberg gives one of his edgiest performances in years. The film is also shot during the dead of winter, so it exudes plenty of chills, with Singleton capitalizing on Detroit's reputation as the dangerous gang-ridden heart of urban America. There's a scene involving a car chase in a snowstorm that is particularly gripping.<br /><br />But despite haphazard bursts of ambition, action and drama, Four Brothers ultimately feels like a gangster genre movie, only without the satisfying payoff. The desire for revenge obviously provides these characters with a strong motivation - and you really get the sense that these characters really loved their mother and really love and are totally committed to each other - yet the long-winded plot lets the movie down with a the story doesn't always work things out in a convincing and clear way.

You've got tatted up, gay wannabe rock star Jack ( Garrett Hedlund), former union worker /hellraiser-turned-straight arrow family man Jeremiah (Andre "3000" Benjamin), and pretty boy Marine Angel ( Tyrese Gibson), who comes part and parcel with his aggressively dysfunctional relationship with stereotypically hot-blooded Latina girlfriend Sofi (Sofia Vergara). And then there's Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), the oldest, most volatile, charismatically violent leader of the interracial Mercer brethren. Spurred on by the memory of "the best mother four degenerate bastards could ever have," Bobby leads the clan through a messy, hackles-raising, vengeance spree through inner city Detroit, miles ahead of an ineffectual police in trying to solve who murdered their mother.<br /><br />From its snowy, Motown-fueled opening to its frozen lake climax with a nice, unexpectedly pro-union twist, "Four Brothers" is a bare-knuckled, take-no-prisoners action romp rooted in gravitas. "Brothers" is such a punch-first-ask-questions-almost-never type vehicle, you can credit Singleton for single-handedly resurrecting the urban Western with admirable verve and tenacity. Grounded by a capable script from David Elliot and newcomer Paul Lovett, Singleton's "Brothers" is as much about brotherhood (the boys bond through hockey, fighting, Motown music, and general horseplay - all very believable) as it is about bashing some heads in. The hard-edged, potty-mouthed, rough hewn script, matched with Singleton's great visual energy and flair, features surprisingly unexpected violence that keeps the suspense up and lives off balance.<br /><br />Having quite a summer (exec producer and financier of breakout indie hit "Hustle & Flow"), John Singleton demonstrates just how much he's grown commercially, if not artistically (yes, you CAN do both) in "Brothers." Employing the car trick photography acquired through his admittedly sellout vehicle-sequel "2 Fast 2 Furious," Singleton spotlights one harrowing, wintry car chase shootout with particularly frenetic magnetism. In a shootout that would make Charlton Heston proud, Singleton stops the film completely by jumpstarting it into the aforementioned urban (Mid-)Western genre, with probably the most exciting and tragic action sequence of the summer. Wracked with high stakes and true emotion yet still viciously edited with hacking, meat cleaver-like intensity, more than bullets and bricks fly in this showdown.<br /><br />Infusing the pic with said intensity is a fine stable of competent and on-the-come-up actors. While singer-cum-actor Tyrese didn't exactly move me in "2 Fast" or "Brothers," his Angel at least keeps up with the crew, brooding appropriately for most of the movie yet totally whipped by his bra-popping, hell-on-heels girlfriend. The least developed of the brothers, Hedlund's Jack hints at the corners of an abusive foster home past and an easy acceptance of his role as lowest on the brotherly totem pole, gamely taking ribbing about his dubious sexuality and being stuck with the worst weapons (he gets a crowbar while everyone else gets guns). Despite his native, out-of-place Georgia twang, Andre "3000" Benjamin, one-half of worldwide Hip-hop superstar group OutKast, exudes a quiet complexity within his attractive, genial smile as family-and-honor-bound Jeremiah, a smile that hides pain, responsibility, and principle to spare.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg dives oily-head first into his personally delinquent Beantown past to emerge as Bobby "the Michigan Mauler" Mercer, a former high school hockey goon with an appealing, casually violent nature and an affinity for gasoline and firearms. Not just enough to be the leader of this ragamuffin crew of not quite reformed malcontents, Wahlberg's Bobby leads by beautifully misguided, hotheaded example, more than happy to create a scene with mack truck finesse where surgeon scalpel precision would do. In other words, he's so unpredictable, you can't take your eyes off him, for fear you miss his next ferocious, out-of-his-hindquarters move.<br /><br />Whereas the chemistry among all four brothers is believably tight, the support suffers in comparison, despite amiable casting. As an ear-to-the-streets detective, Terrence Howard does Terrence Howard, emitting his trademark, green-eyed laser beam concentration in his handful of scenes. Also from "Hustle & Flow" as well as Singleton's confused, patchwork quilt of black male psychology "Baby Boy," Taraji P. Henson is criminally underused as Jeremiah's worrisome wife Camille (but I'm sure the seldom-working Henson appreciated the check). Having heralded him the British heir apparent to Denzel upon introduction to his work in "Dirty Pretty Things," Chiwetel Ejiofor shocked the hell out of me by washing up with a sturdy, American hood accent as gang lord Victor Sweet. A sort of Nino Brown-lite, Ejiofor's Sweet is cartoonishly malevolent, who prefers as much to punish with brute force as with unforgettable humiliation. The only one out of place at this party is Josh Charles (S.W.A.T.), a bland and curious choice for a Detroit detective, standing out like Tom Cruise at a Nation of Islam meeting (or the BET Awards - same difference).<br /><br />Hampered but never slowed by moments of unintentional comedy that usually sprout from random violence and insults, this movie may get a little silly with all the action but at least it's never boring. Deploying an intriguing second act complication that blurs the lines between good guys and bad, "Four Brothers" is a multi-culti cowboy flick for the 21st century. Somewhere in his grave, Charles Bronson is giving Singleton a pistol-packing salute.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Four Brothers is the latest film by director John Singleton who back in the early 90's made Boyz N The Hood to a mass of critical and audience acclaim.<br /><br />Singleton's newest feature stars singers turned actors: the already veterenated actor Mark Wahlberg, Outkast's Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, and the up and coming actor Garrett Hedlund as four adopted brothers who return to their old neighborhood and home in Detroit after their foster mother is shot to death at a local convenient store to seek revenge.<br /><br />The movie attempts to mix light humor in its dialogue while turning the knob up on the anger, melancholy and frustration the boys endure as they are out to get the guys who killed their beloved gaurdian. There are the usual twists and turns along the way but the revenge remains very straightforward, Singleton style.<br /><br />There are no over the top performances by any of our main characters including the supporting cast that features Terrence Howard, who just recently shined in the Singleton produced Hustle And Flow, and Josh Charles, but the movie makes its point by succeeding in grabbing your attention even through the usual revenge/action-movie cliches that it's filled with.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B-</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Though set in modern-day Detroit, `Four Brothers' goes like old-fashioned Western film. First you witness one violent death, which causes the four tough guys get together again, in the town where they were raised as bad boys, and in the name of justice they begin their own fight against crimes. The vendetta story is told with John Singleton's rather inconsistent storytelling, mixing sentimental moments, violent actions, and not-so-sophisticated humors. Don't expect too much from the rambling storyline and some of the formulaic set-pieces (from the writer team David Elliot and Paul Lovett). But the film remains engaging throughout thanks to the portraits of 'Four Brothers.'<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund are the `Four Brothers' who search the truths behind the killings by the two masked guys at the grocery store because the victims included their `Mother' Evelyn (Fionnula Flanagan). But who is really responsible for the death of their foster parent? The script gives some hints early on (in fact, there's a fairly big hint in the opening credits) so the film's point is not a whodunit. It's about the brotherhood of the four guys, which is severely tested by the bullets and blood.<br /><br />I don't say the acting of the four actors is exceptional, but still they are good and believable. I am not still sure of Wahlberg's acting capacity, and his acting here didn't change my mind about that, but he is OK. Andre Benjamin shows surprisingly good acting after his comic turn in `Be Cool,' but it is Terrence Howard who adds precious tone of subtlety as Lt. Green and though briefly, the appearance of Flanagan gives humane touch to the otherwise generic story. Compared with the males, young females are given less attention from director, and Singleton shows almost no interest in developing the character of Sofi, speaking Spanish, hot-tempered, etc. played by Sofia Vergara.<br /><br />But after all we don't see Westerns for females, and maybe Singleton should not be blamed. It is certain that `Four Brothers' gives what it promises in its title - four guys avenging the beloved one's death. The Good vs. the Bad, or Justice with Violence. In this film, they are done not in the wild West, but in the frosty streets of cold Detroit (with Motown music). You either like or hate the film for the same reasons. I didn't hate it, but must say that I am not a big fan of Singleton's uneven narrative style. Still, four stars for four brothers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Evelyn Mercer served as a foster parent for years.  During that time, she only found four children she couldn't place with adoptive parents.  Bobby, Angel, Jerimiah, and Jackie Mercer all lived with Evelyn in her house till they were grown, and she saved them from much harder lives than they would have had.  Bobby is still a hardhead and a fighter.  Angel pulled a stint in the military, but remains a man of violence.  Jerimiah became an upstanding businessman and overextended his grasp.  Jackie was pure rock and roll.  One November night, Evelyn was gunned down in a convenience store.  Her sons come back to Detroit for her funeral and stay for revenge, having to stay one step ahead of the police to get the job done.  While fighting the bad guys, they also have to fight each other and find a way to pull together.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg (INVINCIBLE, THE ITALIAN JOB) plays Bobby Mercer, putting together one of his street-tough roles that he does well.  Tyrese Gibson (2 FAST 2 FURIOUS, ANNAPOLIS) plays Angel.  Andre Benjamin (Outkast) stars as Jerimiah.  Garrett Hedlund (TROY, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) plays Jack.  Terrence Howard (IDLEWILD, GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN') plays police detective Green.  John Singleton (2 FAST 2 FURIOUS, BABY BOY, SHAFT, BOYZ IN THE HOOD) directed.<br /><br />Definitely leading with an edgy revenge western feel, FOUR BROTHERS stands up, takes names, and kicks butt from the beginning.  The relationship between the four brothers feels real, not forced, and they seem to have a history together.  The pacing keeps the story moving along and introduces enough twists and turns and oddball characters that the viewer doesn't really know how everything is going to turn out.  The revenge motif will get answered, but perhaps not in the way that's expected.  The Detroit surroundings look real, and the chase through the snow was a great bit even though it was ultimately pretty simple.  Enough of the story was hidden to keep the viewer guessing the whole way through.  Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Victor Sweet and is one of the hardest and most menacing villains on the screen lately.<br /><br />FOUR BROTHERS definitely isn't family fare.  It's more of a good buddy flick and a guy film.  The violence, swearing, and no-holds-barred intensity might jar some viewers who don't expect it, but viewers looking for an action movie with a little something extra will enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.<br /><br />The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.<br /><br />With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>This is an entertaining film.  There aren't any shocking plot twists, no clever surprise endings - it's just good, solid entertainment.<br /><br />There are stereotypical characters that act in predictable ways, but somehow it comes off as original and you don't mind it.  The level of acting has something to do with it, for certain.  Mark Wahlberg is great at playing a crazy M'Fer, Tyrese has come a hell of a long way with his acting abilities and Andre 3000 also turns in a solid performance.<br /><br />The movie will definitely hold your attention.

Now, the quartet has to discover who put out the "contract," and for what reason.

The actors are also very good, starting with Wahlberg, who carries an entire environment in the roles he chooses.  Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, I felt that it became almost comicbook-like in the way that it cut corners:  there is rampaging violence with little consequence, like even taking suspects into the police station for questioning (except when it advances the plot); the characters slowly lose credibility as they take smarter and smarter actions; and the ending has not one but two deus ex machina devices that ruin the remaining realism.<br /><br />What the film becomes is a kind of shoot'em up cowboy movie, with an icing of realism implied.  At that, it isn't too bad, but it is entertainment when it could have been a much much finer film.  Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Far better than others in the genre.  This is a well-told tale (rare in the realm of modern movies).

They then search for the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice.  Director John Singleton brings together some high class talent to make this film work.  Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Tyrese Gibson and Andre Benjamin playing the brothers gives the movie substance.  They work together nicely as a unit.  Oscar nominee Terrance Howard gives a strong preformance in a supporting role as the police detective searching for clues.  The action sequences are stellar.  However, it does fall flat at times with the dialogue and plot.  Overall, its a good action film that I would recommend.</p></br></body></html>

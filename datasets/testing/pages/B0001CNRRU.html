It draws you into an intense vortex of emotions, tragedies and the occasional tinge of serendipity - such is life itself.<p>Tons of great performances make it a must see and easily eclipse any complaints of uni-dimensionality.

It was so real (like Traffic) but so personal. Watts really was strong here, but so was the rest of the cast (Penn etc). I can't really describe this film in words because it was so choppy, but I can say that it is a definite must see for dramatic lovers.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I'm glad I didn't read any of the Amazon reviews prior to renting it. All of my reviewing predessors blabbed away the very element that makes this film so compelling. I won't do that. Sure, I was a bit baffled at the goings-on, but director Inarratu weaves a tapesty that results in a mind-blowing catharsis. This is one of those &quot;full-circle&quot; films with flash-backs, flash-forwards, and relies on the viewers ability of retention. The three leads are brilliant, and I take issue with a previous reviewer about Watts' character; grief affects people in different ways, and I thought her decisions were appropriate to the developments. Her performance was dead-on, as well as those of Penn and del Toro. I was very impressed. The film is grim and unpleasant with its subject matter. However, its ugliness is countered with daring honesty, something that many don't really ever think they'll have to deal with. Life, death, love, hope, desperation and redemption have rarely been examined so thoroughly on film. To say I loved this film would be like saying I loved a root canal; still, I felt that it was important, and extremely well presented. Once the power of the novocaine wears off, you find yourself thinking a lot about your own mortality. Unfortunately, the DVD offers no extras of any kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>21 Grams is watchable, but tries to be too clever.  Going backwards and forwards in time has been done so much better in other films.  It really wasn't necessary for this film, and in a waty detracted from the performances.<p>21 Grams has been acclaimed as Naomi and Sean's shining moments.  Let me say that Sean Penn is excellent, but Naomi didn't deliver the extraordinary performance that I was expecting (based on her Oscar nomination).  On top of that her character lost credibility.  One minute she says that &quot;nothing will bring them back&quot;, then in a future scene she wishes to kill the man who did it.<p>21 Grams is a watchable piece of film, but could have been so much more  ... a better script, for starters would have helped.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>21 Grams is the most non-linear movie I've seen to date.  You know how Pulp Fiction jumps around in time?  Well this movie outdoes it a hundred-fold.  Pulp Fiction was divided up into chapters so that the audience never REALLY got lost.  I'm curious to see what the shooting script for this film was like - if it was written this way or if the effect was completely created in the editing room.  EVERY SCENE takes place at a different point in the story and almost NO TWO SCENES follow consecutively.  It's fascinating to watch the movie unfold.  True, it is a gimmick, but it is a gimmick that works.  As we see bits of the end and bits of the beginning, we strain to put all the pieces together and understand what is happening.  This process may be vexatious for the occasional movie-goer - he will become lost and bored with a plot that doesn't unfold in a straightforward manner.  However, for film buffs, it is sure to fascinate.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>The more I think about 21 GRAMS the more I start to dislike it...so I better write quickly before the stars start decreasing!<br /><br />Three separate lives all coming together as as a result of a car accident that kills a husband and two children. OKAY....told in a non-linear way....OKAY....some riveting performances.....OKAY....ending with a thud of an explanation....NOT OKAY.<br /><br />After being flipped back and forth from story to story, time frame to time frame, trying to piece all of it together to result in a meaningful theme...all we get is 21 Grams is the weight of the soul...etc.etc.?? If the point of the film was that a soul is way more than just the biological 21 gram weight...well.....never mind!<br /><br />When one boils down the entire plot and it's moral, why did director Alejandro Inaritu need to jerk us back and forth making us as nauseated as Sean Penn was in this film? I stayed with it (heck I had no choice!) for about 90 minutes, but after that this film and it's "clever" style just became downright annoying. I was tired of it and wanted it to end!!! The King in AMADEUS loosely quoted said "Once in a while it's just a little too...too....long.Just cut a few notes and I'm sure it will be just perfect!" Listen to the King Alejandro!<br /><br /> CRASH, TRAFFIC and MEMENTO do all of this better!<br /><br />This film has all the markings of a truly great film. The sound, though, is probably it's worst feature.You have to keep lowering it during music sequences and yelling and raising it for lots of low-talking! That is a real pain in a film that jumps around like a worm on a hot rock! I best stop now, because a feel another star falling!</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is an utterly rivetting film about three lives that intersect by chance.  First, there is the professor (Penn), whose health is deteriorating and whose marriage is all but a meaningless shell.  Second, there is the wife (Watts) of his heart donor, whose pain at the loss of her family has driven her to return to drug abuse.  Third, there is the ex-con who is remaking his life as a born-again christian and is lucky to be loved - he takes responsibility for a car accident that claims the lives of the wife's family.<br /><br />What makes this film so outstanding is the actors:  they are absolutely first rate and you feel what they are going thru as they question life and try to cope.  It is so utterly believable that it is very painful to watch:  you feel their conflict and the meaninglessness that threatens to engulf each of them, but also how they reach the point where the survivors can go on.  With all of their flaws and the ambiguous outcome, this is not a simplistic hollywood feel-good film where all's well that ends well.  It is brilliant art that reflects on life.  The time shifts are also quite interesting and are not hard to follow as a narrative that is not quite linear.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>Some people would say this movie was bizzare due to the chopped up footage.  I thought that made the movie more interesting and appealing because it's something different and fresh.  The acting was great and the story line raw.  Go see this and I know you'll enjoy it.  If you are a Sean Penn fan, then this is definately for you because lately he's so good in everything he's done and this was no exception.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>You may not like the film itself, but you must admit the actors' talent -- Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro are all fantastic.  The story, meldrmatatic as it is, is not a problem.  The real problem is, you may not be absorbed in the way it is told.<p>See the characters first.  Christina (Naomi Watts) is a mother of two daughters, married to a loving husband.  Tragic accident happens to them (that you will see soon), and Chris can be what she was any longer.<p>The accident was caused by one man Jack (Del Toro), a devoted believer of one sect of religion, and he was also doing time in prison before becoming a fervent member.  Jack is also a father of two kids, and one of them knows what the father did.<p>Christina's tragedy brings another man onto the stage -- Paul (Penn).  We know he was going to die -- because of his heart -- but Christina's husband gives another life to him.  However, Paul is still unhappy, as if he lost something (perhaps when he should be happy before his wife)  And he meets Chris, the one he should never meet.  After that, everything starts to rush lie a Greek tragedy.<p>All these ingredients can be told in the traditional storytelling scheme.  The dirctor (of &quot;Amores Perros&quot;) strongly refuses that linear narrative, and he gives a very experimental approach to the material --so unique that you should be very attentive to what is going on the screen.  <p>THE FILM'S STORY IS BROKEN into pieces, and they, regardless of chronological order, are all again pieced together, as if hesitating to reveal the whole truth.  Thanks to the taut editing and fast pace, you will not lose interest in what happened to these characters to the end, at which the film shows what really happened to them. <p>And what happened?  They turn out so convoluted that you might accuse the director of being too intent on giving one or two too many surprise to us.  In fact, though the film's first half is gripping, the second half gets a little dull, for by then we come to realize what is the reality behind these fragmentary scenes.  The director tries to outwit us, but the last action of the film is, frankly speaking, preposterous.  <p>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu certainly believes in the power of film as media, and he is good at presenting his story, too.  I know he wants to say something -- something about the still undying power of cinema -- sacrificing the accessible narrative method.  But you see a dying person, and then see the same person alive and kicking, we find it somewhat disturbing and even pretentious.  Why does he go experimental when you get a better way of telling that, in this case, chronological order?  We want a better answer to that, in Inarritu's next film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Strange tale about interwoven lives surrounding a heart transplant recipient works very well despite a super tragic incident which serves as the movie's centerpiece and garners the audience's attention and sympathy. A woman's family is killed while crossing a street by a drunk driver and she slowly and methodically seeks revenge with the help of her dead husband's heart transplant recipient. Sounds preposterous but it unfolds believably and becomes a genuine think piece that never resorts to heart bludgeoning measures, given the very emotional circumstances involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 4/04, 10/11<br />Rate: 7<br /><br />10/11: So...how many cartons of cigarettes does Sean Penn waste per film that he stars in? Lowering my rating of 21 Grams from `6' to `5', I felt that the film was far too long, manipulative in creating misguided social messages, and heavy handed in the drama department. Watching all the main three of the cast to perform was like an exercise of how to make the situation as pathetic as possible. And they succeeded by letting 21 Grams to have very little entertainment value. Sean Penn was his own boring self and Benicio Del Toro gave a better performance in Traffic, but it's Naomi Watts who turned in a very strong performance as the depressed widow who also lost two daughters in a freak car accident. Although the editing of the film was very adroitly done (however, been there and done it before in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction), I still suffered much from the shaky camera work. All in all, the story wasn't very interesting in 21 Grams, and 30 minutes should have been cut out of the length. As a matter of fact in regards to the title of the film, it's not true that the body loses 21 grams immediately after death.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>This is a very good movie, but was made unnecessarily complicated and confusing by the way the plot alternates between characters and different moments in time. I am not new to facing this technique, which has been used extensively by one of my favorite directors, Quentin Tarantino, and some of the writers I enjoy most, Stephen King and Mario Vargas Llosa. However, in the Tarantino movies and the King books I found enough information to make it relatively easy to follow the events and time periods to which they refer to. I found extremely hard to do this in &quot;21 Grams&quot;, as happened when I read the great novel &quot;Conversation in the Cathedral&quot; by Vargas Llosa. After the first thirty minutes in the movie, it all starts to make sense and I was able to enjoy the movie. However, this production could have received five stars instead of four if the beginning was not so tangled.<p>Paul (Sean Penn) is dying and needs a heart transplant urgently, while his wife Mary is trying to get pregnant before it is too late. Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-alcoholic and ex-convict, who has recently been fired from his job in a Country Club because of his appearance. When Jack accidentally runs over a man and his two kids, Paul gets his transplant, and the destiny of the two men and the widow become inexorably intertwined. From this point on, we witness the emotions and actions of the survivor, the victim and the man who cannot help feeling guilty.<p>It is interesting that Del Toro received an academy nomination for this movie and Sean Penn did not. In my opinion, the latter shines brighter and his talent lead to justly winning an Oscar for &quot;Mystic River&quot;. &quot;21 Grams&quot; is a movie that deserves to be seen, and I hope that if you find yourself frustrated at the beginning because it is hard to follow, you will hang in there until everything makes sense. I know you will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>This movie can easily confuse the heck out of anyone... It takes a while to pick up the storyline, and even once you do figure out how the lives of Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn and Naomi Watt get connected (much in the same style as in the director's outstanding movie, "Amores Perros"), there are still ends that are not easy to tie until later... much later. By the end of the movie it becomes somewhat evident that the core of the story is about how the protagonists deal with their own guilts and internal demons.<br /><br />As much as I loved the cinematography, the performances of the three leads and the overall feel of the movie (much assisted too by Gustavo Santaolalla's magical musical touch), and as much as I am into non-linear filmmaking, after a while you get a bit tired of the jumping back and forth. Specially since it doesn't build up in a way that is compelling enough and ends up taking away from the core message. You feel before the movie is half way through that there's no good reason for resorting to telling the story in this way, or that the editing work was not effective enough.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie, but far from "Amores Perros", I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's cinematic accomplishment to date. I give it three stars mostly for the performances and the movie's overall feel. But other than that, I feel the use of non-linear storytelling complicated things unnecessarily and threw it off in a loop.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Not many films can take a gritty subject, tell it in a series of harsh flashbacks, film it with a bleak landscape and make it work.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu accomplishes this great task with the help of immensely talented actors like Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro.  Del Toro is frightening as the hard edged born-again Christian who accidentally commits the worst of crimes.  Watts is heartbreaking as the victim who buries her sorrows in drugs and alcohol. Penn excels in subtly as the man who receives Watts deceased husbands heart and falls in love with her.  It's almost too much emotion to take in at once.  All three actors are at their peak and Inarritu plays them off eachother without pretense or falsehood.  Each character is decisively different yet all have one horrible thing in common.  Inarritu tells this tale in an original, highly edited manner with flashbacks and foreshadowing that never confuses.  The film is actually amazingly interesting in its ability to keep scenes tight and emotions as raw as possible.  It is a rare achievement and this film would have received more accolades if the material were simply more upbeat.  That's a tragedy in itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>21 Grams is a heavy movie - despite a light title.  The story is about the collisions, literal and figurative, between three imperfect people:  A religeous fanatic with a dark past, a cheating husband with a critical heart problem, and a drug addicted widow.  The movie operates as a series of flashbacks and fast-forwards, much along the lines of Amores Perros and City of God.  It's a bit faster, which makes it optimal to see the movie in one sitting to keep up.  (I saw it in several, which detracted from the viewing)<br /><br />In the end it's easy to see the movie as a work of art.  It's best at it's darkest.  People really don't lose 21 Grams when they die, and the spiritual side is weaker.  Even with that, if you like the genre, you'll like the movie, even if it's not as solid as others.  All movies don't need to fit the Hollywood stereotype.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The mathematical professor Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is dying as his heart is slowly deteriorating and the only thing that can save him would be a heart transplant.  Meanwhile, Paul's wife is urging him to impregnate her as she wishes for a child with her husband, which brings up some moral dilemmas for the couple.  The rich housewife Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a recovering cocaine addict with a wonderful family that she loves above all as she fills her days with rehab meetings and swimming.  The family man, ex-convict, and former alcoholic Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) has discovered God and works hard to mend his past failures in the name of the Lord by helping others.  Paul, Christina, and Jack meet at a crossroad that brings them all pain, suffering, and agony as guilt, love, and anger are heavy burdens in their hearts.<br /><br />Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, the man behind the film Amores Perros (2000), brings another riveting tale of three characters whose lives are interconnected and ultimately changed through an dreadful accident.  The film offers the audience reflection upon the grief caused by several emotional states such as love, anger, and guilt, which follows the accident.  Despite the similarities in 21 Grams and Amores Perros, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu rejuvenates the idea and displays outstanding directorial skills as he offers the audience an innovative cinematic experience.<br /><br />21 Grams is told in a fragmented storyline which encourages the audience to ponder the theme and messages of the film.  This fragmented storyline displays first-class editing as it, at an initial glance, seems erratic and difficult to follow, but as the storyline jumps back and forth it offers small glimpses of recollection that encourages thoughtful interaction with the film.  The cinematography, mise-en-scene, and editing are outstanding as they elevate the emotional turmoil that the characters are experiencing.  All the cinematic aspects of making a film are brought together by I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and he offers the world a brilliant cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>The color, backdrops, pace and acting (yes, the acting was very good) lent to a very "downer" of a movie. Sure, I've watched a lot of movies that have had ongoing depressing scenes that ended in a sad story. Well, this is one of them.<br /><br />Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts give their best to a movie that shows the down-trodden lives of people who've hit bottom in some very tragic circumstances. You get a taste of betrayal, deception, lies and confusion, all rolled into one.<br /><br />I really don't know how to truly classify this movie other than that I would never want to watch it again. Yes, it is a "thought-provoking" movie with some very emotional and touching moments, but there is no reward in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>I hated this movie. It was so slow and annoying, filled with over-the-top acting and a story that jumps all over the place. I understand that the directing was different because the movie goes back and forth through time to explain the story, but this wasn't interesting to me. It just served to confuse and make the movie move along at a snail's pace. The more Sean Penn films I see, the more I am starting to think that he ain't so great. Naomi Watts was so annoying in this movie and I'm sorry, but I felt no sympathy for her at all. Benicio Del Toro was great, but he is great in everything so it was no surprise that he did a great job in his role. Ultimately, this is a slow movie that is way overrated. I didn't enjoy this film and was very happy when it was over. I give it 2 stars because it tried to do something different.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>How much is a life worth? Modern folklore suggests that at the moment of death, when the soul leaves the body, the body loses 21 grams. Be sure to read a few reviews of this film: the complicated plot is told in a complex, non-linear fashion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>First off, it's becoming rather tiring these days to see that any director aspiring to make an "artsy" film resorts to the non-linear direction. To clear up any misunderstandings in advance, there's nothing wrong per se with using this technique. But there should be a point to it: there should either be a clever twist hiding behind all the back and forths or the choice of going non-linear should make the film more entertaining in an obvious way. But in "21 grams" neither of these objectives is achieved. There is no twist and had this story been told linearly the result (positive or negative) would've been exactly the same.<p>  But  there's actually more working against "21 grams" than for it: throughout the whole film i was left wondering about what the premise is. Is it a film about death? One about god? One about fate, synchronicity and the "chancy" lives we lead? One about the complexity of human emotions? Or is it actually a film about life as lived by humans and the bizzare or "funny" choices they make?<p>  The problem is that it's a bit of everything with other touches thrown in for good measure. This problem becomes more annoying when you consider that all these themes (non exluded) are important and vast enough to make a film on its own for each. If you have 2 hours at your disposal to directorily "comment" on all of them you wind up with a film that says -ultimately- not much but which SEEMS to be saying a lot. But when you try to accurately answer the question "what is the message or the premise" they're conveying at us here you cant come up with a pinpointing answer. <p>  This is basically the equivalent of a film as if it had been made by a trickster. Loads of tricks to impress those only with eyes, but very little for those that employ cerebrum function with eye movement: the non-linear depiction, the fact that a variety of highly unlikely tragedies are thrown together, tied hastingly in a plot that doesn't go in any particular direction and finished off with tons of overacting to compensate for the inadequacy of the plot.<p>  It's not all a bleak sum though. The acting (overacting as it was) is indeed good, because in a perverse way this was the only thing that could've saved this film. Every actor here does his best to elevate this "not much" into "something" and in the end it's the performances that stay with you, not the movie itself.<p>  Speaking of a weak plot i could ask many questions, but I'll ask only one because precisely this question made it a "miss" for me in a definite way: in the film the character of N.Watts finds out that the man she's started an affair with is actually the recipient of her husbands heart. Yet she "marrily" goes on with the affair after only a small tantrum that lasts a mere few hours. Exactly what are the odds of that is what i'd really like to know.. Not only that, but only shortly before, during the funeral of her loved ones she declares that she doesnt want to even press charges against the guy responsible and yet, as a complete and unexplained transformation takes place, she winds up wanting to murder him. Go figure.<p>  To sum it all up, this will easily be a film that'll be widely praised, because people tend to be stunned when they are visually impressed even if there's no premise hidden under the spectacle. It's an old trick in the art of movie-making, it has worked 1000 times before and will work another 1000 times in the future. It's in fact a trick that works in many other levels of life just as effectively. <p>  Knowing that I'm totally going against the tide here with what I've said, i'll say also this: this film tries to be uncharacteristic of Hollywood and yet it manages to be flawed in the way many Hollywood films are: loads of eye-candy but precious little else. Lastly, this trivia about the 21 grams in the end had to do with what exactly anywhere in the film? Oh well, i could go on and on but the point is made. At least i hope so...</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>The three lead actors in this film give great performances, but I had a hard time getting emotionally involved because of the editing.  I'd been distracted by my curiosity of how the story was going to fall together.<br /><br />In a film like THE ENGLISH PATIENT (another non-linear storyline), the filmmakers gave you enough time to get involved with the plight of the characters.  In 21 GRAMS, the cuts are so abrupt and frequent that you never get a chance to really bond with the characters.<br /><br />Instead of feeling their pain, you're left saying, "Oh, that's how that fits together."<br /><br />But the three actors here are among the best acting in film today, so it's definitely worth seeing for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>21 Grams is a tense, gripping, and disturbing film full of twists and surprises. The story is better left in summary:  A freak accident brings together a critically ill mathematician (Sean Penn), a grieving mother (Naomi Watts) and a born-again ex-con (Benincio Del Toro). In itself, it provides an upfront guarantee of satisfaction and weaves a spellbinding and suspenseful mystery. However, after throwing in its credited cast and their flawless performances, you get one of the most powerful films of the year. The wonderful Sean Penn leads the all-star cast, who all deliver possibly the finest performances of their careers. Guillermo Arriaga writes this intelligent story with the intent to captivate his audience, which he does, and at the same time touch them, which he also does. The film is greatly benefited from the award-nominated acting and the superb direction. Though the film blasts back and forth from past to present, by the movie's end every scene has been tied to the next leaving no questions -- nothing but a speechless audience. 21 Grams is a profound piece of cinematic art and is highly recommended. This is a superb drama and one not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...especially compared to the director's previous film, the instant classic "Amores Perros" ("Love is a bitch").  <p>It feels like an inferior recycling of the first film in both themes and narrative technique, just without the sparkling freshness, originality, and effortless flow.<p>Al Pacino, Naomi Watts, and Benecio Del Toro are all world-class actors but they don't have much to work with here.  <p>Oh well, I guess this is what they call the "sophomore slump."</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>This is film has received a lot of heated discussion, so I think I'll keep it relatively short, for once. The big debate surrounds the nonlinear narrative, with many suggesting that it isn't really necessary, and actually hurts the film.  I'll admit, I kinda agree with these people- it ain't really needed.  However, I don't think it really hurts it, even if it is a sorta needless affectation.<br /><br />The unconventional narrative is especially strange considering that this is largely a three person character-study and acting showcase.  Right now I'm gonna reveal a little more of the plot than is typical for the reviews for this.  I don't think it'll hurt you to read it, but consider yourself warned:  '21 Grams' centers around the aftermath of a car accident, focusing on the effects it has on Jack, the man who caused the accident, Cristina, the wife and mother of those who were killed in it, and the terminally ill man, Paul, who receives a heart transplant from one of the victims.  Needless to say, their lives become intertwined afterward.  Honestly, it hasn't got much of a plot at all, really, but the three leads all provide stunning, moving performances.  Benicio Del Toro is the best of them as the bulky and tattooed born-again ex-con who causes the tragic auto accident that sets off the core events of the film.  He's a more complex character than you might expect, as he falls apart, his life which he barely got under some sort of control suddenly collapsing through a combination of bad luck and negligence.  There are a number of scenes of his regret which are just just so sad and powerful.  Frankly, they easily coulda been clich&eacute; and cheap, but Benicio completely pulls them off.  Naomi Watts plays a devastated widow and former druggie who's sliding back to her old life.  Fortunately, the script allows her a wider range than one might anticipate, even if she only expresses anger and grief.  Also, when she starts screaming her head off it's actually believable, both in the performance and the context, a rarity in the films I've seen.  Penn is the weakest of the leads, as Paul, but he's still excellent.  I'm not that big of a Penn fan.  His roles are always convincing, for sure, but his characters have never really struck me as all that interesting. (Seems like everything I've seen him in he's a taciturn cynic who is usually fairly well reserved but has the potential to explode.)  He still plays this basic role much of the time in the film, but he is slowly revealed as the film goes on, and proves to be a truly sympathetic individual at the end.<br /><br />I suppose that's what this all comes down to.  I became very interested in and attached to these characters, moreso than in the vast majority of the other films I've seen.  And frankly, that's not usually the sorta thing I'm big on.  We got plenty of real people in the world, so show me something new, or different or whatever, when you're making a film.  Still, I'll have to admit that most of my very favorite films manage to have a strong human element in them.  The real problem is that most films simply can't pull it off, can't make characters that are real and sympathetic enough to be worth watching.  '21 Grams' does it, or it did for me, anyway.  It is perhaps a little too drawn out, at times, or redundant, or seemed to be at the time anyway, but watching these people is what this movie is about.  Take it or leave it.<br /><br />The film has a grainy, grimy look and appears to have been shot with handheld cameras almost exclusively.  Some have complained about this, but I like the gritty look, particularly the colors.  It is pretty damn grainy at times, I'll admit, but again, I'm pretty sure that's how it's meant to be.  It's got a sad, stirring soundtrack as well, mostly used relatively sparingly.  The dialogue is fluid and natural, but still with a few of those powerful, memorable 'movie moments' that probably wouldn't ever happen in real life, but you buy them anyway.<br /><br />I dunno if there is that much more to say.  With a film like this it's tough to really say why it works so well.  You'll just have to see for yourself.  It's certainly not for everyone, as the unconventional structure will irritate some, the slow pace others, and the exceedingly dark subject matter still others.  And, honestly, it is perhaps the slightest bit pretentious.  But, it reaches high enough that the fact that it thinks it's a maybe a little bit more than it is doesn't hurt it too much, when you look at what it has got.<br /><br />Edit: After watching this movie a second time I am somewhat less impressed.  The fact that none of it really adds up too anything in particular proves more irritating the second time thru, and the performances lose a bit of their impact.  Still, it's very good, but I'd probably now bring it down to 4 stars, if I were allowed to do so.<br /><br />Hmm, turns out that wasn't so short after all.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Intense performances by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, not to mention some fine work by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo, make this almost too much to bear.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu throws out a line of tension and keeps it incredibly taunt from beginning to end while exploring the most fundamental human emotions: fear, love, lust, and tragic loss.  He uses a technique being seen more and more in film, a technique in which the story is not told in chronological order, but temporally scattered.  This technique is similar to that used by, for example, Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) in which the story is told in reverse chronological order.  Here there is a mixed pattern as the story unfolds, sometimes in sequence, sometimes out of sequence.  At first it is disconcerting, then intriguing, and finally everything is abundantly clear.  I don't think this technique is necessary, but it does have the virtue of forcing the viewer to become engaged in trying to figure out what is going on.  And perhaps this heightens the cinematic experience.<br /><br />There are three stories strung together on a single strand of fate.  First there is the story of Jack Jordan (Del Toro) a petty macho criminal who has found Jesus.  Second there is that of Paul Rivers (Penn), a college professor of mathematics who is dying because of a defective heart.  And third there is that of Cristina Peck (Watts) who has found what she wants in life with a husband she loves and two young daughters.  And then there is the tragic accident that seals their differing fates, and brings horror into their lives.  The story is told in starkly realistic scenes spliced in jarring juxtapositions, skipping from one character's story to the other.  The effect is to give us relief from the terrible events of one part of the story only to lead into another, and then to pull away from that story and into a third until the stories appear as one.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about the performance of the three leads.  Sean Penn is brilliant in an understated way as he projects (by turns) charm and tenderness, desperation and hope, and a kind of hopelessness headed for a flat line.  Naomi Watts is electrifying in the intensity she brings to the most emotionally-wrought scenes.  She is one of the most amazing actresses working today, and if you haven't seen her, see her here.  You won't forget her.  She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress (losing out to Charlize Theron in Monster).  And much the same can be said of Benicio Del Toro who was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (losing out to Tim Robbins in Mystic River).  Del Toro's portrayal of a fated man who both found and lost his faith because of tragic events and his own failure of character was totally convincing and very sad.<br /><br />If I had to nitpick I would say that Cristina's initial feeling that she couldn't be bothered to help prosecute Jack Jordan for killing her family did not square well with her later feeling that she wanted to kill him.  Yet, I suppose, one's feelings can change.  I also didn't think Jordan was the kind of character who would hit and run.  He takes responsibility for his actions.  He turns himself in and says that he has a responsibility to God.<br /><br />As far as the ending goes, note that Cristina is dressed in bright, almost happy colors because of what was discovered when she donated her type O-positive blood to save Paul's life.  Obviously I can't reveal what was discovered in a review, but I'm willing to bet some people found it redeeming and hopeful while others found it ironic while still others may have found it cheap and easy.  Personally I thought it worked because everything in this movie revolves around very physical human events.<br /><br />Bottom line: may be too intense for some viewers, and put the kiddies to bed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>_21 Grams_ is another recent testament to the skill of Sean Penn.  What has happened to Penn in the last few years?  Something went off inside of his head and he decided to start really giving it to us, showing us once again that an actor can find himself well into his prime.  Benicio Del Toro is electrifying, as always, in his portrayal of a born-again Christian.  Director Alejandro Inarritu is on his game in this film.  While many have complained about the story's progression, as it flips back and forth out-of-sequence and does not follow a linear plotline, I believe that the story would have suffered without this chaotic format.  From the first few minutes of the film, the audience knows where this train wreck is headed: the gripping part, however, is sitting there in your seat watching as these two storylines are rushing towards one another.  Not only does this type of sequencing keep the audience mentally engaged, it adds to the sense of chaos and unpredictability of the plotline, immersing the viewer inside of this world.  In fact, like many films shot in this manner, if you had seen the film according to the linear timeline, the story would have been somewhat ordinary and boring.<br /><br />That all being said, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed with _21 Grams_.  Let's put it this way: I love non-linear sequencing, but there are other films out there that do a much better job.  The storyline of this film is a bit too mixed up, with gaps that leave one wondering about motivation on the actor's part.  After the film was over, I just sat there and said, "All right...it's over now."  While still an outstanding film, I feel that it fails to hit the mark dead center.  In the end, the acting is still tremendously strong in this film and I highly recommend it, if only to see Sean Penn in another brilliant performance of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>This is a hard film to see and understand, nevertheless is outstanding and deserves to be seen.<br /><br />Film director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has developed a complex, tasty and compromised "film d'art". We may trace different stylistic influences on this movie: Quentin Tarantino's (Pulp Friction) non linear time sequence and some touches of Kieslowski's (The Double Life of Veronique) casual but most meaningful encounters between different characters.<br /><br />Inarritu transforms an ordinary everyday issue in a strange, tangled and puzzling drama.<br /><br />The story is as follows: there is a sick mathematician waiting for a heart transplant as last resort to survive; there is an ex-con trying to make a new clean life for him and his family; there is a family father taking care of his daughters. Tragedy and fate reunite all these elements into a griping tale.<br /><br />Main actress and actors in the film perform greatly.<br /><br />Sean Penn, as the feeble hearted mathematician, is able to express and transmit the anguish of nearly dying man. Afterwards he shows the compulsive need to find who his donor was.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro, as the ex-con, presents a very convincing mask of a tormented man trying to overcome his addictions and drawbacks in order to have a new opportunity.<br /><br />Last but not least, Naomi Watts, as the widow of the donor, gives a performance full of subtleties.<br /><br />Viewing this movie in DVD gives the unique opportunity to go back to previous scene when you get lost.<br /><br />A tasty dish for movie fans.

They shine, outshine even almost ever other performer of 2003.  Now I don't know if I was the only one with the missconception that this was a film about drugs, well, it's not.  I mean, Niomi does coke breifly, but other than that drugs has very little, if NOTHING to do with the story line.  The film is shot in panic mode almost, switching from past to present to future to give you the begining and end all at the same time and then filling in the middle slowly so that it all makes sense.  You have Benecio Del Toro, an ex-con turned Jesus freak sort-of is dealing with a grave mistake.  Niomi Watts is dealing with a grave loss and Sean Penn is learning to live again, now that he;s finally given a second chance, a new lot on life.  These three are connected through their new lives, their mistakes and misfortunes until the end which will blow you away and make you cry, at least a little, on the inside maybe...GREAT movie and highly highly recomended.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>21 grams is an underated gem with a splendid cast. It is one of the best movies that I've ever seen and is also one of the most original. It has a brilliant cast including Sean Penn, Benicio Del Torro and Naomi Watts. The acting alone is worth the watch but the movie..wow..<br />21 grams is a deep movie and will require the watcher's full attention. It won't all make sense until the end because of the way that it is formatted. The movie is so original because it throws random scenes at the screen. One might be from the past..one from the future..etc.. For example, one scene you see Benicio Del Torro in prison, the next in a church, the next as a construcion worker. One scene you see Sean Penn bleeding to death, the next smoking, the next driving his car. Now that's what is so original and genius about the movie...it makes you open your mind and the scipt is brilliantly conceived.<br />You will be scratching your head at times and be like "what is going on?" because the movie's goal is to connect all of these scenes in the end. It makes you watching till the wonderful conclusion.<br /><br />There is no need in talking about the plot because that was something that I enjoyed discovering on my own during the movie. It includes vengeance, tragedies, life and death, and change. Some characters go from being happy to depressed and drug users; others change from violent to religious; others go from dying to being saved.<br />The movie has cruel ironies a plenty and the movie is so powerful that you will be thinking about it for a while. Everything in this movie has a message and a point so pay attention.<br />21 grams is one of the best movies out there..as well as one of the most tragic. It is a must see and can be comapred to the movie Crash. But 21 grams is a better movie for many reasons. The acting is better in 21 grams as is the originalty and the script. Where Crash has difficulties with unrealism and being corny and cheesy, 21 grams does not as it always stays realistic, original and splendid.<br />The scene where the boy is using the leaf blower is wonderfully done. To see the car pass by, him drop the leaf blower without showing anything graphic like most movies would..wow. This way is much better and much more powerful. So please watch this gem, one of the best movies out there, a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>&quot;21 Grams&quot; is a movie of overwhelming power and drama, told in a compelling fashion by director Inarritu.<br />Much has been said about the kaleidoscopic, jigsaw puzzle-like storytelling technique used in this film, but it works flawlessly.<br />Briefly and reduced to absurdity, Sean Penn plays a man with a diseased heart, Naomi Watts plays a happy mother of two with a seriously dark past, and Benicio Del Toro plays a religious fanatic ex-con. I dare not tell you more, because one of the joys of this film is figuring it out the true sequence of events on your own.<br />These three strangers end up together (you know that from the beginning, given the way the story is told), but being only given snippets of information, in an artful, non-chronological and piece-meal manner, lends extraordinary suspense to the film; you feel guilty even pressing pause. We're talking Hitchcock levels of suspense here...you NEED to know how it's going to end.<p>&quot;Incendiary&quot; is an adjective often used to describe an acting performance; you will gasp at Naomi Watts here. I sat slack-jawed and fully amazed. I never knew she could do something like this, and she will surpass your every expectation.<p>Sean Penn gave the two best performances of the year, here and &quot;Mystic River&quot;. They're both career performances, in a career full of them. He's making a strong case for being our greatest living actor. Those who think I'm overstating the obvious, consider starting with Spicoli from &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, and then imagining roles in &quot;Falcon and The Snowman&quot;, &quot;Carlito's Way&quot;, &quot;Casualties of War&quot;, &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, &quot;At Close Range&quot;...and ending up in 2003 with those two films mentioned above. Few actors could match that range with that quality, for over two decades straight.<p>I was not prepared for this film. I was far better than I thought it was going to be. It's the type of movie you want every person who enjoys film and filmmaking to see. You will tell others about it. You will want to talk about it.<br />Set aside a night to watch this, I implore you. If youv'e read this far, this is the type of movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>21 Grams is a dark, daring story of three sad lives.  The actors give fine performances, but the movie is hard to watch - way too much drama and with the emotions running rough and  relentless. This movie did far too many flashbacks and then before you can take one scene in, another segment of time flashes quickly before you grasp the meaning.<br /><br />The three main characters played by Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts are constantly striving to overcome addictions and life hardships.  Over a period of several months, an accident throws their fates together.  The overwrought drama of faith, redemption, love and mortality is draining to watch.  The sadness of drug addiction, infertility, organ transplants, low socioeconomic lives, and con men is definitely drama overkill.<br /><br />21 Grams takes dogged determination to watch.  Just putting the thrashing scenes and pieces of their lives together makes one dizzy.  There is nothing other than boredom throughout as the dark, graphic, morbid, mess of three lives was irritating to the senses.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie highlights three people--a man who needs a heart transplant in order to live, a woman whose husband and 2 daughters have been run over, and the ex-con turned born-again Christian who accidentally ran over them.  It is full of angst, flashbacks, and good acting, but it is all very dark and the constant switching from character to character and past to future to present is all a bit overwhelming.  According to many of the other reviews, the movie left many viewers in awe of the artistic merits and message of the film, but it simply left me confused and depressed!</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>This film has a rather unique plot arrangement with strong acting but all converge upon a non-existant theme. After a rather depressive two hours of drama, the audience is left wondering as to what the point of the story was.<br /><br />  Benicio Del Torro delivers a moving performance as a penitent ex-con who seeks redemption as a born again Christian. His conscience tormented between his duty to God, family, and society. Sean Penn seeks the wife of his heart donor to give his thanks but soon finds himself evoking painful memories and mixed emotions from the grieving widow. In turn, Sean Penn feels compelled to avenge the death of the widow's family by killing Benicio Del Torro.<br /><br />  At best, the film's theme shows that there is no simple truth to spiritual salvation in the bleak drama of human lives. The film shows that God punishes the innocent, the penitent, as well as true sinners and that none of us will ever really know why. Given the dramatic ending of Sean Penn's character, the film seeks to show that life is short and that we should be thankful for being healthy and alive, even if for a brief time. If that is indeed the film's message, it conveys it rather obscurely and unsuccessfully.<br /><br />  If you have to see this film, see it on video. There's nothing about this film that makes it worth seeing at the movie theater for $9; you also won't have to find yourself in an embarrassing situation if you fall asleep. Another advantage of seeing it on video is that you can pause it and try to study its elusive, if even present, convoluted theme.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>21 GRAMS is a film of such importance that attempting to review it is intimidating. Once in a while a film appears that is a Benchmark, a film that is destined to alter the concept of moviemaking as an art form. That this is only the second film from the obviously prodigiously gifted co-writer and Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ( the strikingly creative and disturbing 'Amores Perros' being his first) serves the craft well in continuing the promise of film as art.<br />Inarritu enlists the intelligence of his audience and what a partnership that creates! His "style" is called non-linear which merely means that the story of the film is not spoon fed to us in a "this happens, then this resulted, then this altered, then this happened" etc fashion. Inarritu takes advantage of the fact that visual images can hold so much power that the story behind them seems secondary at the moment of viewing only to alert us to THINK as we see bits and pieces of history and result dangling from a mobile, ever in motion. We are led to believe one thing depending on how we relate to the image on the screen, and then we are shown that we misjudged that event as we are given more detail from the past and from the future.<br /><br />While this technique may sound difficult to follow, Inarritu uses it with such facility that learning the true story being told is similar to the way we are running through life: we see fragments, remember tiny moments, watch the media alter variations of reporting reality, hear gossip, view events with prejudiced eyes, form opinions based on our individual experiences with like events in our own lives, or in other words always be faced with the question of what are the drivers of accidents/fate/destiny/need/passion.<br /><br />The story is basically one of how three disparate characters' lives complexly intertwine - people who come to a fatal auto crash with very different life patterns. A mathematics professor with severe heart disease, a reformed drug addict mother who happens to be the wife and mother of the victims, and a Bible thumping ex-con who drives the truck that causes the accident. The events that ensue after the crash (the victim a heart transplant donor for the mathematician, the devastation the event has on the perpetrator and on the surviving wife) are the storylines we follow. The ending is an intelligent, shocking surprise and one that alters the way you will view events and people after you leave the story behind.<br />Inarritu has employed the gifted artists Sean Penn, Benecio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts and each of them gives the most potent performances of their careers to date. It is impossible to single out the strongest one as each actor owns the full spectrum of each character and each performance seems to exude from their innermost core of their talent. Each is powerful, subtle, sensitive, wholly credible and deeply moving. The other cast members are very strong - especially Clea DuVall and Charlotte Gainsbourg who take their seemingly supportive roles to heights of such importance that it seems the story could not progress without them.<br />The photography is appropriately and conceptually dark and the quality of the picture has a decadent graininess to it that enhances the mood and the perplexing mystery of the story. But in the final analysis it is the magisterial directing talent of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu that is simply mind-boggling. This is a VERY important film, so very much worth the work required from us the audience, and as with most things in life, the more we invest the more we gain. Well worth 10 Stars! Grady Harp, December 09</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>This was an extremely moving film that pulls no punches yet beautifully avoids passing judgment.  Del Toro is Jack Jordan, a seemingly normal guy who commits a most horrific crime - in a hit and run, he kills a man and his two daughters, condemning Cristina (Naomi Watts), a mother and wife to a life of endless grief and hatred.  Separated, Jack and Cristina endure a living death.  Guilt-ridden Jack will consign himself to prison and find religion an apt avenue for suicide.  Cristina, it turns out, had an especially unstable life before being settled down by marriage, and with her family gone, turns back to chemical bereavement counseling.  Jack wants nothing more than punishment, and Cristina is all too ready to satisfy Jack's need.<br /><br />And then there's Paul, the man who finally brings the two of them together.  A mathematician with a terminal heart, condition and a marriage to match, Paul receives Cristina's husband's heart, and then court her.  Paul thinks himself a hero, doubtless, taking Cristina out for lunch, driving her home from clubs when she's had one-too-many.  But Cristina has an influence on Paul as well - a negative one.<br /><br />This flick charts the emotional rollercoaster of Jack, Paul and Cristina's lives.  The film plays out of chronological sequence, but hardly out of order.  Like a ride, it has its fast moments and its slow ones, milking the maximum emotional velocity by playing its scenes to a climax before returning to an earlier point in the story.  The effect is at times incomprehensible but also unforgettable.  Suffice it to say, this is the perfect movie for people who like to see the same movie more than once.  In a voice-over, the title supposedly refers to a theory that the human soul weighs 21 grams.  This is the story of those who got their grams back.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie really did captivate you from the beginning till the end.  Its format was glimpses of past, present, future and in random order.  For audience, we were compelled to think of the "what" and "why" that motivated them to do so and so.  Suffice to say that this movie touched upon the issues of life, death, guilt, redemption and guilt.  What made this movie so intriguing was three people from three very different backgrounds, due to some inexplicable circumstances put them together.  Their universe basically collided and with that came fireworks of unimaginable kind.  The "behind the scene" was useful to allow us to understand in-depth of the Director's various decisions.  All actors interviewed talked about the movie and the roles that they played candidly.  On the screen, those magnificent actors and actress in the form of Benicio, Sean and Naomi were superb.  We really couldn't take our eyes off them.  Their performances were compelling and that's probably what made 21 Gram so watchable.  A slow movie that best suited art movie lover or even audience that sought intelligent story-line.  Definitely not for the faint-hearted and the cover DVD said it well that this movie does stay with you after watching it.

To portray these characters, the powers that be recruited three of the finest film actors working today, as well as a talented director smart enough to get out of their way. The result is (not surprisingly) a powerful, gripping film.<br /><br />This film is not easy to watch. These characters are going through hell. Naomi Watts portrays a grief-stricken woman whose husband and two daughters are all killed in a hit-and-run. Sean Penn plays the heart-transplant patient who receives her husband's heart, and finds hiimself living with a strange combination of gratitude, guilt and terror. Benecio Del Toro is the born-again Christian and former convict who accidently killed the family, and is tormented by guilt and rage. Watching Watts, Penn, and Toro tackle these characters is truly magnificent, but also heartwrenching. Rage, guilt, heartbreak, suffering, need, empathy, fear, hatred, love, lust, hope ... these characters showcase humanity at its most raw. There seems to be some debate about the affectiveness of the non-linear way their stories are told, but I thought it worked beautifully. All in all, a terrific film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>"21 Grams" is the sort of movie which sucks the life out of you--I don't think there is one agony in the human conditioned left unturned, one painful rock left uncovered, one intimation of the fragility of human existence left without inspection in this movie.  Then, like the natural cycles of life, the sun shines meekly when the night gets darkest.<br /><br />Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu provides with a scathing glimpse into the lives of three people for whom life has indeed become little else, particularly for Sean Penn's character Paul, a cynical mathematics professor for whom life has become little more than a long convalescence: the victim of a fatal heart condition, he is slowly dying but shows rather negative signs of vitality.  He refuses to stop smoking and recognizes that his wife, played unlikably well by Charlotte Gainsbourg, has never been the one for him.  She badgers him for a sample of his sperm with the process of artificial insemination and it does not seem to the viewer that it is out of any concern for him or a desire to "continue" his existence in some way: it is for her own satisfaction and hope for a new life.  Rather than taking the safe route, he elects to die outside the hospital than taking the advice of his doctor and dying in the hospital.<br /><br />Christina (Naomi Watts) is a woman with a husband and three children and a recovering cocaine addict. Her life has become more stable as her attention is directed towards the welfare of her family. A car crash involving Jack, an ex-con turned Christian, turns all of their lives around forever. This film is completely non linear, but unlike "Memento" or "Mulholland Drive" it does not take multiple viewings to show what is happening.  If you really concentrate you'll understand.<br /><br />Neither of the aforementioned actors--Penn, Del Toro, or Watts--have transcended the work they did in this film.  The acting is fantastic, and I have to disagree with some viewers' about it being "hopeless": the subtext about Penn and his warning shot at the end, which brings everything together, is what brings salvation.  It is gritty and true to real life, almost uncomfortably so--you'd think you were watching a documentary with amazingly sincere people at times--but it is no way hopeless.<br /><br />This ranks among one of the best films I've seen to emerge in this decade.

That's the way this incredible movie is told. A math teacher (Sean Penn), a born again social worker (a haggard-looking Benicio del Toro) and a recently-widowed mom (Naomi Watts) live lives that intersect around a traffic accident and a heart transplant. The story unfolds over the course of the movie, juxtaposing past and present in a display of superb plotting. Aside from the three principals, Melissa Leo (as del Toto's long-suffering wife) and others turn in stunning performances.<br /><br />The 21 grams of the title refers to an old discredited study that purports that at death, we lose exactly 21 grams of weight, attributable to the soul leaving the body.

This sort of fim really does owe a lot to film making techniqes popularized by Quentin Tarantino in "Pulp Fiction".  Armed with this knowledge it becomes fairly evident where the story is leading and it's probable end.<br /><br />Good performances throughout by the entire cast...although Sean Penn seems to play the same "tortured" persona he always plays.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I was tempted to entitle this review, "Too clever by half" but I would have been guilty of the same....Another title that came to mind was "Needs Heart Transplant" but I rejected that for the same reason.<br /><br />On the positive side, most of the acting is superb.  Sean Penn is never less than great and he does not disappoint here.  Benicio de Toro's performance was beyond brilliant.  Naomi Watts was the weakest in my opinion. (I loved her in The Painted Veil.) She relied on looking pale and blank and tensing her jaw too many times to show any number of emotions and somehow I found her just blah.  She looks good, though, so men might overlook her pallor.  I think any number of other actresses would have done a better job. Kate Winslett and Julianne Moore both come to mind.  Melissa Leo, as del Toro's wife was perfect in her role.<br /><br />The story is smart.  It's full of thought provoking elements.  Perhaps too many to be digested in the space of one film.  This might be a good opener for a discussion group on any number of subjects:  addiction, religion, abortion, marriage, suicide, heart transplants, etc.<br /><br />That brings me back to "ambitious." There's nothing wrong with that, but I was so overwhelmed with the intensity of the content, that I numbed out, and by the end, I really didn't care about any of them.  Except Jack Jordan (del Toro's character) and his family.<br /><br />I found the technique of cutting back and forth in time more confusing than intriguing. As others have mentioned, it seems largely for the sake of being arty.  A little mercy for the viewer would have been welcome.  It did all come together, but too late in the film, for my taste, and by that time, I had stopped caring. If it had been filmed in a more sequential way, I think I would have been able to sustain my ability to  keep my heart open to these characters.  Also, the ratio of misery to joy was severely imbalanced, in my opinion and this had the effect of  numbing me.<br /><br />I agree with another reader who complained that the characters played by Penn and Watts were not fully written.  Penn's, especially.  He's portrayed as a real cold character, but when he gets the heart (transplant) of the good, famiy loving man, he warms up....but only to the widow of the dead man, not to his own wife, who wants desperately to stay in the marriage and have his child. Penn, by his natural humanity, makes us care about him, but that's a gift I think he gave to the script.<br /><br />The Watts character didn't hold together much for me.  She's portrayed as the loving wife, mother, sister and daughter, but then there is another, darker part of her that I think we should have seen earlier in order to make sense of her later meltdown.  True, she was given an enormous blow, but others have suffered similar things without resorting to drugs and murder.<br /><br />I have to give special mention to Jack Jordan, (del Toro).  The character is written with great depth and compassion and acted accordingly.  I was only going to give this film three stars but for that I add a fourth.  He is the one, troubled as he was, who comes through with the real heart.<br /><br />Another reader wrote that "the intricate screenplay isn't half as smart as it thinks it is" and I think he has a point.  It seems that the goal of the film is to impress.  If you want to be impressed, and don't mind being de-pressed in the bargain, then this might be the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'm a fan of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.  Sure, he dwells within the realms of his `one-trick' and some define him as gimmicky (interwoven character arcs thriving within a convoluted structure) but he knows how to make that `gimmick' sing for all it's worth.  He did it with `Amores Perros' and he does it here too.  He also did it with `Babel', but to a less than magnificent result.<br /><br />`21 Grams' may be his best film to date.<br /><br />The film tells the complicated and heartrending story of a young woman named Christina who is drawn into the lives of two men after a tragic accident leaves her widowed.  One of those men is Paul, a professor in dire need of a heart transplant.  The other man is Jack, an ex-convict who has turned his life over to god in order to atone for his sins, one of which being the cause of Christina's predicament.<br /><br />Yes, Jack killed her husband.<br /><br />Shifting back and forth within time, `21 Grams' weaves a delicate web of harsh realities that brings the audience to a dark place thriving with life.  The complexities are all held tightly within these three amazingly real characters, all of which come to life in vivid and mesmerizing ways.  My first viewing of this film left me rather spellbound.  I knew it wasn't perfect (not many films are), but it also had such a strong hold on my emotions that I was compelled to watch it again and again and again.  Every time I see this film I am rushed with more emotions, for it remains real and compelling every time.  The reality that life is fragile and that life is every changing seeps through every pore of this film.  You can't help but watch these shattered souls and wonder how they make it through.  Their struggles are so deeply felt, so richly realized.  Some have balked at the films unending sense of torment, but for me it never really becomes something unbelievably harsh.  `21 Grams' uses the darker realities of life as a stepping stone to establish human tendencies and the need within us all to survive.  It also shows the will we have to right the wrongs and redeem ourselves through the survival of others.<br /><br />As depressing as this film is, it is strangely uplifting upon reflection.<br /><br />The performances here are all stellar, especially from Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts.  Watts, one of the greatest actresses of her generation (a few pegs shy of Kate Winslet), delivers a gut punch performance here.  Some call this performance too dramatic, but I think that that particular perception may be poisoned by the films narrative flow.  It only seems dramatic because the pieces are not in order.  When you consider how she builds her character and look at it from that view then you see a completely realized character.  She understands how to live within the character.  You can see her taking in every moment, and it helps create someone truly unforgettable.  Del Toro is one of the better actors working today.  This performance is most certainly his finest to date.  The way he drenches himself in his character determination, allowing his every fault to become his driving force; it's unmistakably solid.  Instead of falling into the clich&eacute; of playing a `Jesus Freak' with obviousness, he underscores a generic character with flourishes of purpose and understanding.  Sean Penn, an actor I find highly overrated, is very good here.  This performance is FAR better than his hammy Oscar winning one from the same year (how he one of `Mystic River' is beyond me).  He understands the subtlety that is needed to highlight to unnerving reality befalling this man.  You can see him slowly withering away within his own solitude.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also magnificent here, especially the significant others played by Danny Huston, Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg.<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is an eternal downer at first glance, so be prepared to take your mood down a few notches, but the rich script allows for the emotions to display themselves in interesting and provoking ways, and this is definitely a film that will continue to provoke you to think, and glean.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>This is a hard film to see and understand, nevertheless is outstanding and deserves to be seen.<br />Film director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has developed a complex, tasty and compromised "film d'art".

In a nutshell, it tells of 3 people interlinked to a tragedy involving a car crash (in narrative, very similiar to the director's first, "Amores Perros") and how they eventually finally confront each other in an dynamic finale.  Sean Penn must have had a great year, acting-wise, since this film and "Mystic River" netted him an Academy Award, a Golden Globes, and Best Actor by the National Board of Review (a poll by all the leading film critics in the country). Watts and del Toro are also superb in their pivotal roles and the title itself refers to the weight applied to one's life when it begins!!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Filmmaker Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's penchant for non-linear chronology in his cinematic storytelling is perhaps at its most heightened in this powerful 2003 drama. Having seen the other two superb films in his trilogy meditating on death, 1999's "Amores Perros" set in his native Mexico and last year's ambitiously international "Babel", I fully expected I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriago to deliver something as audacious. Indeed they have with a gritty, heartfelt look at three disparate lives brought together by a single twist of fate and how each copes uniquely with the aftermath. Executed with even greater abandon than the other two films, the sequencing of plot developments in "21 Grams" is initially confusing, but the out-of-kilter pacing actually fits the jagged contours of the desultory story which deals with the unpredictability of life.<br /><br />The relentlessly downbeat tone can get wearing at least until the plot threads start to come together with greater force in the last third. The plot follows three people facing deeply personal challenges - Paul Rivers, an academic awaiting a donor for a life-saving heart transplant, as his impatient, English-born wife wants his sperm to have a baby by artificial insemination; Jack Jordan, an ex-con and born-again Christian struggling to keep a job to support his wife and two kids; and Cristina Peck, a happily devoted wife and mother who has a history of drug problems. Their lives intersect through a hit-and-run which results in fatalities and burgeoning flows of anger, guilt and resentment. Brief, time-juggled snippets of their individual lives are interspersed with obviously later scenes when the three come together under dire circumstances. Divulging any more of the story - which was apparently filmed chronologically despite the final editing - would dampen the propulsive dynamics generated by the constant second-guessing by the viewer.<br /><br />Fortunately, the three principals act with such fervent commitment to their characters that it is hard not to be compelled by the film in its entirety. In the most subdued performance of the trio, Sean Penn effectively plays Rivers as a dying man hoping to find some level of redemption for second chance he gets, often reacting with quiet force to the actions occurring around him. As Jack, Benicio del Toro is unafraid to exhibit the character's ugly side while sharply conveying his inability to cope with what he sees as his accountability in the tragic event. With a series of bravura moments, Naomi Watts lends palpable ferocity and a liberating lack of vanity to Cristina's inner torment.  There are a couple of sideline performances worth noting as well - Charlotte Gainsborough as Paul's insular wife Mary and especially Melissa Leo as Jack's tough-minded, self-protecting wife Marianne.<br /><br />The film has an intentionally bleached-out look thanks to Rodrigo Prieto's atmospheric cinematography, but the most impressive achievement is the filmmakers' insightful presentation of complex, multi-layered characters in ways that make these even their more unsavory actions understandable. Unfortunately, the original 2004 DVD offers no extras, but the 2006 Collector's Edition DVD does include the theatrical trailer and an interesting behind-the-scenes featurette, "21 Grams in Fragments", which spends a lot of time on the director's fascination with death and his motivation in making the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>21 Grams was the best film I saw in 2004. Naomi Watts is so talented, so good in every role she is in, she is remarkable to watch, she should have won the Oscar for her performance. Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are fabulous as well. The film goes out of order, non-linear so pay close attention to each scene, some scenes are cut short, some are longer to explain the story and plot better. Don't worry you will not get lost or confused, all three stories weave perfectly together halfway through the film. It is amazing how three stangers lives could all change and be affected because of one horrifying event. Intense, sad, and important film, 21 Grams will have you shaking in your boots.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's &quot;21 Grams&quot; employs an unconventional narrative to explore how one incident can bind together the destinies of three individuals.  To watch lives change in an instant is a sobering experience.  Almost as sobering as the claim that life itself may only weigh 21 grams. <p>Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a college professor with a heart problem.  Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is a former convict who has turned his life around with the help of his strong religious beliefs.  Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a married woman who finds comfort and stability in her husband and two daughters.  A tragedy strikes that devastates Cristina and sets into motion a series of events that draws Paul into her life and forces Jack to reassess his most deeply-held beliefs.  <p>Inarritu's decision to intercut the stories of the three characters in a non-chronological manner is jarring at the outset.  However, if you stick with the film, you will be rewarded when all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place and the tale can be finally seen in its entirety.  Penn and Watts are solid in their roles but Del Toro's performance is absolutely mesmerizing.  You can literally feel the pain of Jack as he abandons everything he has come to believe and cherish in life.  Eddie Marsan, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo perfectly compliment the leads with their supporting performances and prove invaluable in increasing the emotional impact of the unfolding events.  If you're willing to accept the unique storytelling style of "21 Grams" then you will find yourself watching a devastating and absorbing creative work.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>When people say that, it's usually meant to be somewhat encouraging.  The point of the saying being that tomorrow is a new day.  I'm not sure that people consider EXACTLY how painful that life &quot;going on&quot; can be.  This film explores that.<p>It's a film about how 3 different people, all connected in some way to a tragic car accident, deal with the guilt and pain of their lives continuing to move forward ... even when they can't bring themselves to move along with it.<p>The acting is absolutely SUPERB.  Sean Penn, realistically, could have won an Oscar for BOTH Mystic River and 21 Grams.  He's just OUTSTANDING.  Naomi Watts was also BRILLIANT as a wife and mother whose life is just DESTROYED when her family is killed.  Benico Del Toro, I'm convinced, is one of the most under-appreciated actors of the modern film world.  Even the second tier cast was outstanding.  Melissa Leo, for example, was incredible in the way she played a Lady MacBeth-ish wife to Del Toro's character.<p>The directing is wonderful.  The emotion that Alejandro I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is able to get from his cast is staggering.  Its emotional impact on his audience is mind-blowing.  You'll find yourself tearing up watching Naomi Watts desperately trying to piece her shattered life back together.  I was a little confused in the beginning by the out-of-sequence method that was used in the films editing, but it breaks helps to give the audience a small emotional break (as another reviewer stated, this is a REALLY dark, sad film) and also makes for a better payoff as you fit the pieces of the film together to reveal the whole picture.<p>I can't possibly recommend this enough.  It is horribly depressing, but it's also an absolutely brilliant work of art.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Though not depressing, because nothing this good is, the film is haunting -- a walk on the razor's edge between life and death." Liam Lacey<br /><br />For the first half hour I was confused trying to figure out the characters and how one minute Naomi Watts looked like a lovely woman and housewife, and the next a coke addict. Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu has directed this film which goes between past and present.  As a matter of fact as a critic stated; "the movie is like a mirror broken into hundreds of pieces and put back together one piece at a time."<br /><br />Naomi Watts is one of the most credible actresses of our time. She can become anyone she wants. Sean Penn as well, is IMO, the best actor today. Benicio Del Toro, plays the role of a man who is tormented. A tormented man who has found Jesus but still can't get away from his former life of crime.<br /><br /> Stephen Hunter has said that "21 Grams", which refers to the weight that a body eerily loses at the instant of death," could be construed as the weight of the soul -- is a pure theological argument, playing two theories of grace off each other."  This is a film that sends many messages. What does this all mean? Why do we care and why should we?<br /><br />"21 Grams" begins with an image of birds in an urban landscape, suddenly breaking into helter-skelter flight. That's Gonzalez I&ntilde;arritu's metaphor for chaos, for the possibility that life is random atoms splattered this way and that by other random atoms. That, too, is the narrative strategy: a confusing jumble of seemingly random scenes, beyond the capacity of human organization." Stephen Hunter<br /><br />This is a movie that begs for discussion and pondering. How can we begin to understand the meaning and the message from the lives of three humans as 'screwed up' as these three are by their circumstances? What can we begin to learn?  Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is a director of brilliance and it will behoove us to view all the films he has and will make.<br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 3-30-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MCH5P4">Babel</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N8A9">Amores Perros</a></p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>This film is edgy and incredibly imperfect, it bounces around in time and begins where it ends but there is a method to the madness.<br /><br />In every life a stranger's actions may reflect our future at any given moment and this film brings together three lives and three families as no other. It begins with the ending, an unexplained moment that makes no sense and seems entirely insignificant until the end. We find a cynical almost self-loathing man in need of an organ transplant, he sits alone in a room waiting to die or be given life through another's death. Another core character is a busy mom who bakes a cake with her girls but hides her deepest secrets from her family. The driving force in the film is an ex-con who covers his anger by representing a born again Christian to the outside world. The film takes these main characters and twists and turns back and forth through time revealing the past and presenting glimpses of the future as it rolls slowly along. It is difficult to get through but worth the effort once all of the scenes are eventually tied together.<br /><br />The actors in this film deserved more attention for their roles. Sean Penn is the ailing professor and puts his all into the struggle of this man's life. Penn is perfect as the seriously conflicted man managing to always be flawless in such challenging roles. Naomi Watts is the seemingly happy young mother but soon changes face as tragedy disrupts her protected world and Watts decays into a different character. Watts is brilliant next to Penn and is not even close to suffocating in his turmoil; she brings her own agony right back and does it extremely well. Finally Benecio Del Toro is superb as the flawed ex-con trying to control his future by a false faith. Del Toro is anguish! He always brings something extra to his roles. Adding to the fantastic acting of these individuals is the way that the director filmed this movie. The actors are filmed in a gritty light that sticks in each and every facial imperfection and traces the tragedy of their lives. The actor's skin is sallow and almost gray, with dark circles under their eyes and grimy fingernails clasping cigarettes in most of the scenes. If you are looking for pretty this isn't it! But the filmmakers deepen the tragedy of the characters with this unique technique somehow.<br /><br />The message that extends from this gritty film is that our lives intersect with many others through a series of events and that one bad decision can off shoot into a million others. With all of the people we pass by unconsciously everyday it may make you wary or it may make you aware of the impact your life has in the world. The message is clear and the writer/director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, has managed to convey his worth to the world in an amazingly unique and profound way. The weight of this film is more than a few grams and Inarrito has carved himself a brilliant future.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>21 Grams came to UK shores with a bundle of critical acclaim and and an Oscar nomination for Sean Penn.  And it pretty much lives up to the good things people have been saying about it.  Directed by the man behind Amores Perros, you can immediately tell from the way this is filmed that it's not a typical Hollywood melodrama.  The colours are bleached out and the time out of synch.  However, this doesn't mean 21 Grams doesn't have something in common with such films.  The centrepiece of the story is a terrible accident that affects the movie's other characters.  Watching the movie at first is slightly confusing, as it shows us glimpses of things that are yet to happen in the longer sections.  This technique has been used by various directors, notably Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan.  Yet it is the latter director with which 21 Grams shares so much, particularly his little seen first independent affair, Following, which also had very short clips from the future to break up the drama of the main story.  The scenes used for this come across as short exclamations of passion and horror; a dying man covered in blood, a post-coital cigarette and a woman taking drugs in a bathroom.  Whilst it's true that if it weren't for these scenes the movie might be shown as the pretty simplistic drama that it is, this doesn't make it any less compelling or any less good.  For anyone's who's seen the Australian movie Lantana, this will certainly ring a few bells.<p>What makes the movie though, besides the almost poetic direction, are the performances.  Sean Penn got a lot of credit for his role and deservedly so, though the rest of the cast also give nuanced and complex performances.  Benicio del Toro is superb as the heavy-religious ex-con, depicting a whole range of anger and self-loathing behind his furrowed brows.  In addition, Naomi Watts really comes into her own as the lonely woman falling apart.  It would have been easy to give a shouty, tear-stained performance, but she really lends a desperation to this that is tangible.<p>Any other year, 21 Grams would have probably sweeped the Oscars, were it not for the phenomenal success and achievement Peter Jackson demonstrated with The Return Of The King.  Whilst it's true to say that in hindsight it's not really as good as it would perhaps like to be, nor as original, it's still a brilliant movie in its own right and one that any fan of intelligent, adult cinema should try to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>If you are a young actor, or just love a well acted movie, you must check this film out. I cannot recall a movie were there were so many standout performances. As always, Sean Penn displays his usual nearly supernatural talent. Penn can do more with his eyes and expression than any actor I can think of, and his capacity for effective understatement is unparalleled. He can simply move the viewer wherever he wishes them to go effortlessly, and he is always a marvel to watch. Benicio Del Toro is tremendous as well, doing what he does best - bringing to life a certain tortured repression that always seems to brood a little too quietly behind his burning eyes. <p>For me, however, the delight came from watching the women, Naomi Watts as the grieving widow who serves as a catalyst in the films' intertwined lives; and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the wife of an ex-con, desperately trying to hold her life together. Naomi Watts is asked to carry a great deal of weight in this picture, and her raw pain and emotion really had me twisting in my seat in sympathy. She actually accomplished that rare feat that happens so seldom in movies: Her pain and grief didn't seem like acting at all - it seemed rather that cameras just happened to rolling while some terrible event was happening. She was absolutely amazing.  My favorite piece of work, however, came from Charlotte Gainsbourg. With all the bigger names doing such great work around her, it is an easy role to overlook. Do yourself a favor and watch this woman take command of her role. Her portrayal of the ex-cons' wife, struggling to keep what little she has managed to salvage out of the world together, is simply heartbreaking. I wish Hollywood used more actresses like her. Ms. Gainsbourg is not a fashion model, nor is she beautiful in a high-cheekbone, pouty-lipped way. She is, instead, beautiful to watch because of her talent. <p>To tell you the truth, this type of character-based, dialogue-driven drama is not my usual meat. I like a good crime or action picture, big-Hollywood style. But when acting talent as displayed in this film comes to the table, one cannot help but pay attention. -Mykal Banta</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has made a bold film in an innovative style.  The movie is not told in a straightforward fashion.  There are approximately 40-50 scenes, and they are assembled in a non-linear fashion.  It's sort of the cinematic equivalent of tossing 50 pieces of a puzzle onto a table and having to mentally assemble them.<br /><br />For me, it works.  I have read other reviews that weren't that crazy about it.  Roger Ebert wrote that the technique got in the way of the story.  Other reviewers here have complained either that it made the story "slow" or boring or that they just didn't get it.<br /><br />I'd have to see the whole film reassembled into chronological order to be able to give an opinion about whether or not the film is better in its presented form or whether it would be improved by being more conventional, but I didn't have any trouble sorting out the various plot-lines in my head as the story unfolded.<br /><br />Sean Penn gives another memorable performance as a math professor with a congenitally bad heart.  We learn that he is less than a month from death unless he gets a transplant.  Naomi Watts gives the best performance I've seen yet from this talented actress as a woman who is happily married to an architect with whom she shares two daughters, but we also see that in her past she did more than dabble in drugs.  Benicio Del Toro is heartbreakingly good as a man who has lived a hard life and done some hard time before being saved, in the Christian sense. Melissa Leo is his wife, and she shared his hard life before, and plainly hasn't come to terms yet with his conversion as a born-again Christian.  All of the main characters intersect in ways that I cannot reveal without spoiling, so I won't.<br /><br />There are many other supporting performances given by actors who I was not familiar with, and my lack of recognition contributed to my ability to fall into the story.  The film brings up many difficult questions, and I think it is one of it's strengths that it does not find easy answers to them.<br /><br />It's a worthwhile way to spend 2 hours if you want to see strong acting, bravura film-making, and don't mind having to think about what's on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>From director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, the story of 21 Grams links three people who are united by very tragic circumstances.  Paul (Sean Penn) is terminally ill, but finds a new lease on life after receiving a heart transplant from the recently deceased husband of Cristina (Naomi Watts).  Her husband was killed in a freak accident by Jack (Benicio Del Toro), an ex-con looking for redemption.  As the film shifts back and forth through time, we see the events that lead these people to being united, and it doesn't end well for anyone involved.  The intricate screenplay isn't half as smart as it thinks it is, but the performances from Penn, Watts, and Del Toro are nothing short of brilliant.  Penn's subtle turn is one of his most masterful (he was the only one of the three who weren't nominated for an Oscar for this film, but he took home a Best Actor award for Mystic River the same year), while Watts gives a wonderful and emotional tour de force, and Del Toro is simply brilliant.  Still, 21 Grams attempts to weave an intricate web that isn't as multi-faceted as it thinks it is, but the film still manages to be something special based on the performances of the three leads alone, and they alone are worth seeing the film for.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Dizzingly chaotic, compellingly acted, and masterfully directed, 21 GRAMS is not a movie that will make you feel happy.

A supporting actress nod should have been noticed at the Oscars.<br /><br />Sean Penn, who was marvelous in MYSTIC RIVER, is even more so in this film, for which he should have received the Oscar.  Maybe he got it because he was so good in both movies.  He plays the infidel college professor who receives Watts' husband's heart and saves his life.  Penn's obsession with finding out his donor's name leads to an involvement with Watts that is both poignant and tragic.<br /><br />Charlotte Gainsbourg as Penn's wife suffers from a stiff and one tone performance, but fortunately she's not in the movie too much.  A more versatile actress would have added much more.<br /><br />Watts probably would have won the Best Actress Oscar in a different year; Charlie Theron's MONSTER was such a critically acclaimed crowd pleaser Watts got lost in the shuffle.  But it is a tremendous performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This film has several good things going for it.  First, it has a good story.  Second, it has really fine actors.  Third, it has a director who has made a name for himself with cutting edge techniques.  Put them all together and ...  well ... maybe it works for some people.  It only occasionally worked for me.  It was the "cutting edge techniques" part that played around with the time frame of events that I found difficult to enjoy. <p> <p>Even though Benico Del Toro had third billing, he stole the show.  All the roles were difficult and complex, but his was probably the most challenging.  He plays a ex-con who, when we first meet him, is now a church-going religious fanatic.  He's changed his life and preaches the word of Jesus to everyone he meets.  Sometimes he goes a little too far - like when his children are fighting and he makes his daughter allow his son to punch her again because he literally believes in the "turn the other cheek" philosophy - but we can all see he is trying to go straight and lead a good life.  His wife, played by Melissa Leo is also great.  She plays the part of a woman who has stuck by her man through all the bad times and now is trying desperately to support his religious streak and keep him out of jail.  <p> <p>Seam Penn plays the role of a dying man whose wife wants to have a baby. And Naomi Watts plays the role of a young widow who is going through severe depression when her family is killed in an accident.  <p> <p>A series of seemingly unrelated events brings all of these people's lives together.  The result is high drama.<p> <p>The director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, seems to have shot the film, cut it all to pieces, and let the audience see it a little at a time, and not at all in sequence.  Little by little details were revealed that was supposed to flesh out the story.  Well, sometimes they did and sometimes they didn't.  All I knew is that I kept wishing the director would "get on with it".  And since I had the luxury of watching the film on DVD and not in a theater, I was able to walk away from the screen and do stuff on my computer without having to concentrate too hard on the film as it just was taking too long to say something that had been already told before.  Basically, by the time I had watched half the film, there were no more surprises, and I just didn't care.<p> <p>Film buffs should see 21 Grams and, for that reason I'm glad I saw it.  As I've said before, the performances are great and it's interesting to see new film techniques.  The story is a depressing one however, so if you're looking for a "feel good" feeling, this is not the film for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu<p>This is a difficult film to review because it is not a conventional film by any means.  There are fantastic acting performances, and layers of detail, but the structure of the film is what presents the challenge.  "Memento" was a movie that had a story that was told out of sequence, but the way "Memento" was edited worked perfectly because there was a definite method and clear purpose that fit the story being told (the story was told in reverse order).  Unlike "Memento", I was not able to figure why the scenes in "21 Grams" were out of chronological order.  This is a powerful film, but it might also be needlessly complex (complexity for complexity's sake). <p>Here's what we know about the movie (though exactly when we get everything fitted together is a little unclear).  Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is dying.  He needs a heart transplant rather badly.  Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con trying to turn his life around.  He has become a Christian, but still struggles with his anger.  Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) has lost both her husband and her two children in an auto accident.  These three separate lives will start to intertwine as the movie progresses, but to give more than a simple description of who each of these characters are will be to spoil how they interact and why, and what happens to them.  The disjointed chronology of the film makes describing it even more difficult because scenes from the beginning of the film only make sense when connected to a scene more than an hour later.  <p>In one sense, watching this film is an exercise in understanding.  We see the film play out and we are (or at least I was) working to figure out how everything fits together both as a part of the story as well as to the greater theme of the movie.  The movie is titled "21 Grams".  It is said that the weight of a human soul is 21 grams because that is, supposedly, how much weight a body loses when a person dies.  The film, in my view, is trying to measure a human life, to see what it means to be human, especially in the face of death.  On one hand, the film succeeds.  On the other, human life and experience is so varied that what may be meaningful for one viewer may be less so for another.  I thought this was a powerful, well acted film, but the out of order format of the film was a little distracting.  I'm not sure about the purpose of setting up the movie with the mixed up chronology.  This is a good one, even a very good movie.  The acting is great, but I'm not sure if the movie is.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>&quot;21 Grams&quot; is one of the best films of 2003 and has some of the best acting.The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards for<br />Best Actress:Naomi Watts &amp; Best Supporting Actor:Benicio Del Toro.Sean Penn probably would have gotten a nomination here if he hadn't won Best Actor for &quot;Mystic River&quot;.The movie is about three people.Paul Rivers (Penn),Cristina Peck (Watts),and<br />Jack Jordan (Del Toro).Paul is a terminally ill college professor in need of a heart transplant.Cristina is a housewife greiving the death of her husband and two daughters.While Jack is a born again convict who just made a big mistake.Through the story all of their lives are intertwined marvelously and sometimes confusingly.The movie is told in sequence but frequently goes out of sequence to show you stuff that will happen later in the movie.Everyone in the film gives some performances of their careers including Naomi Watts whose performance is unforgettable.One of the best films of 2003,go see<br />&quot;21 Grams&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Director Alejandro Inarritu strikes gold with his amazing triumvirate of life experiences that merge to create the plot of &quot;21 Grams&quot;.  Housewife Naomi Watts loses her husband and two young daughters in a hit and run accident perpetrated by career criminal and born again ex-con Benicio Del Toro.  Watts' husband's demise provides the heart for transplant for Sean Penn who is dying of heart failure.  After the operation Penn grows tired of his lukewarm and childless marriage and begins to pursue Watts. She goes ballistic when learns that Penn is the transplant recipient.  They eventually bond and plot to evoke vengeance against the devastated and remorseful Del Toro.<p>The acting performances by the three major players were absolutely superb.  Penn and Del Toro with Oscars already on their resumes are already well established.  Watts however was the star of the show.  Her portrayal was unexpectedly magnificent and possibly more impressive than Charlize Theron's Oscar winning performance in Monster.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>21 Grams is a movie which has three parallel thread stories which seem to be unconnected but the movie progresses it becomes apparent that all three stories and characters are connected.<br /><br />The thread stories are<br /><br />1) Sean Penn plays a critically ill academic mathematician,<br />2) Noami Watts plays a grief stricken mother,<br />3) Benicio Del Toro plays an ex-convict who has newly discovered Christianity<br /><br />All three characters center around a tragic automobile accident.<br /><br />The movie although shot in  chronological order, is edited in a non-linear arrangement where the lives of the characters are depicted before and after the accident. The random order in which the 'before' and 'after' bits of the 3 stories are mixed around, could confuse some viewers who are not attentive or who don't want to take the effort. This movie requires a bit of serious viewing. But it's different and novel. When the end, start and middle of the movie are mish mashed around, it breaks down our formal thinking process of a first, middle and last act of the movie. It also adds suspense and curiosity to see what transpired in between when we see the start,end and certain middle parts one after the other and then spend the rest of the time curious to know what happened in between and to fit the pieces of the puzzle. Not a conventional film, not for everyone but a good film neverthless.<br /><br />And the title "21 grams" actually refers to suppossed loss of weight when a person dies. So when a body dies it looses the soul and in the movie we are told 21 grams is what the 'soul' weighs and we thus weigh lesser by 21 grams after death.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>To descibe a film as being truly original is thrown around so often but in the case of "21 Grams" it totally applies.  Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a new talent to be reckoned with.  The structure and editing of this film is so unique that it takes your breath away.  It's like fragments of a whole that seem to be random but come together at the end for a satisfying conclusion.  Inarritu takes three disparate individuals whose lives couldn't be so different who, through circumstance and tragedy,intersect.  The acting in this film by the three principles is top-notch.  I thought Sean Penn as the heart transplant recipient gave a better performance here than he did in "Mystic River" in which he won the Oscar.  Naomi Watts continues the stellar work that started with "Mullholland Drive" as the grieving widow.  I save my highest praise for Benicio Del Toro who continues to amaze with his portrayal of the ex-con who finds Jesus.  I recommend this film highly, in particularly for the more ambitious film-lovers.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This movie talks about contrasts, warmth against lack of expressiveness : the latinoamerican boundaries vs. the anglosaxon behavior : the whole conception about the basic requirements against the incomplet knowledge about his vital rank.<br />There's a latinoamerican novel whose reading is very close related to 21 grams . I mean Rayuela from Julio Cortazar . You can read in a random order and the storytellnig is always perfect . Another important point to remark is the poem that Penn tells Naomi is from a living venezuelan poet Montejo .<br />This is a detor film . A crossroad picture which links three different lives , three different worlds , theree different fates in a dramatical fact.<br />The love appears as a happy son from the deepest regions from the tragedy and almost wins. The religion , the uncertainity about the life , the redemption , the memory , all that complicated puzzle is told with maestry , with poetic flowness , and accurate direction . The movie never falls in a melodramatic mood , it never let you down . There are always challenging and twists of fate who amazes the viewer through all  the story.<br />Penn plays the most difficult role of his career. Naomi makes the grade as a character actress and Benicio del Toro gives a very difficult around a man who suffers a true metamorphosis.<br />The suggested omages , the clue shot about an empty swimming pool reveal the loneliness , the hopeless and the tragedy of that little town , with dark passages and a brilliant use of the color as an addittional actor.<br />This film is a step ahead in 2003 and one of the best and intelligent films made in Hollywood.<br />We really expect that this couple of director and guionist keep working together , 'because they have shown a new road and new possibilities of cinema expression.<br />A winner film!</p></br></body></html>

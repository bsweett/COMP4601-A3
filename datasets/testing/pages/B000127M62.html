Film companies that own the rights to various characters have often held them in check, not wanting to share the wealth made by them. But now, since interest in both seems to have dwindled, they look to join the duo to make more money. And that was done this weekend as the movie took over the box office. The question is, was it worth the wait?<br /><br />The answer is a resounding yes. Fright film fans can rejoice in one of the best of both series. And with the success of this movie, it can't be long until Michael Myers joins in the fray (yes, talks are already under way).<br /><br />The movie begins with Freddy (the returning Robert Englund) bemoaning the fact that he is no longer remembered and thus has no way to return to the world to wreak havoc. Looking of a way back, he finds Jason (Ken Kirzinger) in the bowels of Hell, resurrects him and sends him back to Elm Street to remind the folks there what terror is all about.<br /><br />Jason follows instructions (given to him by his mother, actually Freddy appearing as same). He begins slaughtering teens in the house Freddy once stalked and when the police show, one young officer is chastised for mentioning Freddy's name within earshot of the teens. If not mentioned or remembered, how can he return?<br /><br />That one mention snowballs and eventually the whole town remembers and discusses Freddy. Jason primarily focuses on Lori (Monica Keena) whose ex boyfriend Will (Jason Ritter) has been locked away in a mental institute from his weigh in with Freddy long ago. There with his best friend, the pair along with most of those who had contact with Freddy have been kept dreamless with the help of a test drug. Will and friend escape and set out to find and help Lori and friends from the evil they know exist.<br /><br />Given strength by Jason, Freddy returns to the dream world of the teens in town and begins his assault on another of Lori's friends. But as he is about to claim her soul, she disappears when Jason kills her in the real world. The terror Freddy set free is ruining his chances to scare the world. I mean, how can he send out scares if no one is alive to dream of him? The showdown is set in motion and now it just takes time.<br /><br />The teens come upon an idea to lure Freddy into the real world and let the two titans of terror face off against one another. Their plan is to do so at Camp Crystal Lake so that once, they hope, Jason finishes Freddy, they can send Jason back to the watery depths and a final rest. Yes, although he murders viciously (and with much gore), Jason sort of becomes a hero here.<br /><br />Would I tell you the final outcome? No way! Just know that the movie keeps your interest throughout, setting up the final confrontation between these two. Did I say final? As anyone with any amount of horror film knowledge knows, nothing is final in a horror icon flick.<br /><br />The acting is well done, with all characters appearing seamless in their roles making them quite believable. Englund has done this role over and over again and yet each time he shows why no one else could have done the part. Much to do was made of the fact that Kane Hodder (who has played Jason since number 6) was not hired to play him here. Know what? It's a guy in a mask! Kirzinger does a solid job in that function.<br /><br />The movie may not be overflowing with new scares, but that's not what's expected here. What we are looking for is a decent story, a few laughs, a steady pace and a few buckets of gore. This movie delivers on all counts.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Freddy Vs. Jason pits two of the biggest names in slasher history together.  This movie works well for fans of both.  It has a Nightmare on Elm Street feel but a Friday the 13th atmosphere.  The plot works perfectly if you're a fan of both and it's a LOT better than the last few releases of both series.<br /><br />I won't give away any of the movie but I will talk about what the DVD includes.  An audio commentary from director Ronny Yu and Freddy and Jason.  It also includes plenty of deleted scenes, and alternate opening AND ending, featurettes, a music video and plenty more.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees, this is a must have.  If you're a casual fan, it's highly recommended.  Otherwise, it's worth a checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>I've always been a huge Friday the 13th fan. I own all ten of them and love Jason Voorhees. I also own several of the Nightmare On Elm Street movies but I'm no big Freddy fan. However, when I ran across this DVD in a local video store for sale previously viewed, I figured what the heck. Overall, I think it's a pretty good movie. Freddy has been in hell and now he wants revenge but is not sure how to get it until he thinks about bringing Jason into the picture. Once the two meet up, the battle and competition begins. There are great special effects in this movie and some gore. We are taken from Freddy's world into Jason's world as they do battle. Myself, I think Jason ROCKS in this movie and I find myself rooting for Jason. When Freddy sees that Jason won't be outdone, a battle to the death begins. I like the fact that we are taken into both worlds. I think the best scene is when Jason comes out of the corn field being set on fire. As he walks around, he just slashes everyone in his path! This is a good movie for both Freddy and Jason fans. Although with the ending, you wonder if they have more in store for us!</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>The fact that 'Freddy vs. Jason' is as good as it is is practically miraculous.  Of all the outrageous, silly fanboy concepts that have been thrown around over the years, the Freddy-Jason crossover is one of the wackiest.  Furthermore, even if it were to get made, odds are that the studios wouldn't put any effort or money into it, and just cheaply slap it together, knowing that people will see it anyway.  Certainly, 'Freddy vs. Jason' is not a great piece of art, nor a great film, but it's a load of fun, and manages to find the right tone:  It's got humor without being a smug campfest, and has a script that was written seriously enough that the whole film doesn't seem as ridiculous as it probably ought to.  It's also got a sharp, surprisingly classy visual style, care of director Ronny Yu, and a lot a cool gore, at least by mainstream film standards.  That's about all I'd want from this film.<br /><br />The basic premise is this: The adults of Springwood have thoroughly erased the memory of Freddy Krueger, which has made him lose his power, and his ability to kill.  In order to get back, Freddy invades Jason's death-dreams, posing as his mother, saying 1- Stop being dead, stupid, you're immortal 2- Go to Springwood, start killing.  Naturally, once Jason's rampage begins, the adults begin to suspect that it's Freddy's doing, and he starts to regain his power.  Freddy soon returns to full power, but Jason won't stop killing, which naturally aggravates Freddy, so he decides to take care of Jason.  Throughout all this, there are a number of teens who must find out what's going own, and fight for their lives etc. but the specifics regarding them don't really matter.<br /><br />Of course, the new world and mythology is not 100% consistent with what came before, but, it's pretty good, and it's not as if the original films were remotely consistent anyway, so this one couldn't possibly make it all add up.  Certainly, the plot is nothing to write home about, but the film actually has one, and it is a  whole lot less idiotic than I'd anticipated.  The characterization doesn't fare as well, as they tend not to be particularly interesting, and are often cliched (the sassy black chick, the stoner, young cop who trusts the teens, Nerdlinger etc.) but, eh, who cares?  The only characters who matter are Freddy and Jason, here played by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger.  Englund does a good job with Freddy, naturally, making him a bit more menacing and less humorous than he tended to be in the latter films.  I, like many others, was a bit upset when I heard that Hodder wouldn't be playing Jason, but Kirzinger does a great job. (not that there's all that much to the role)  He plays it in about the same way that Hodder did in Jason X, as the huge, lumbering yet somewhat contemplative killing machine, but w/o much of the sardonic detachment that Hodder through into the role in X.  (Which is appropriate, as although 'Freddy vs. Jason' is hardly completely serious, it isn't as jokey and campy as that film)  Although I still think it's pretty damn lame that Hodder got booted from the job, I think the practical effect on the film is pretty much nil.<br /><br />Though the film certainly isn't scary, it's occasionally a bit eerie, and the dream sequences are generally very nicely done.  (The first dream the Monica Keena character has is particularly good)  Of course, I've always been a Jason man, and the scenes of him hacking up innumerable teens are always a delight.  Notions of suspense are almost completely lacking, but it's got a high body count and plenty of great kills.  (Jason's first real kill is one of the most brutal, yet funny he's ever had, and there's an excellent, uhh, cut-in-half, death, too)  Also, there's an utterly priceless scene where he storms a rave, after being dosed in everclear and lit aflame, cutting swath throught the teens like a flaming angel of death.<br /><br />The funny thing is, although the notion of Freddy and Jason being in a film together is pretty amusing, the idea of them fighting isn't all that exciting to me.  These scenes actually turned out very well, though I think the scenes of them dealing with the kids are generally better.  Freddy uses lots of Freddy-fu on Jason, which is pretty damn funny, and their final confrontation earns lots of points for sheer gruesomeness. (I seriously doubt the MPAA would allow this level of violence to be wrought on truly human characters w/o earning the film an NC-17 rating)<br /><br />Yeah, I guess I'm done.  Reviews are pointless, as anyone interested in this film already saw it, but, whatever.  Also, the DVD looks very, very nice.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>I didn't really take this movie all that seriously, but I was entertained at least. Frankly, I thought it was hilarious because it definitely wasn't scary at all. It was interesting watching two indestructable forces battle it out though. I've always wanted to see what it would be like for those two horror titans clash, and I must say I wasn't too disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>&quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; is the penultimate blood and guts fest that pits Freddy Kruger against the Crystal Lake psycho - Jason with inevitably predictable results. Conceding that this is a horror movie there is surprising little that's genuinely horrific about the killings. They're rehashed uninspired vignettes from a dozen other knock off, schlock and load junkies. The shock level hasn't been raised even if the budget for this film has.<br />TRANSFER: Good things to talk about here. A really pristine transfer that captures fine detail in the darkest of scenes - and believe me, they're dark! Colors are well balanced. Some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but really - it's only a hint. The audio is well balanced and just when you think things are getting too quiet it's sure to surprise and kick all five channels into action with all the visceral charm of bringing up one's lunch.<br />EXTRAS: Too many for a film who's plot is this thin. Only if you're a die hard fan of pure junk will you be encouraged to sit through the barrage of thought-numbing nincompoopery. I think it's about time both these murders hung up their torture devices and called it a night - a long one!<br />BOTTOM LINE: I love a good scary movie. This is nothing like one!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>A typical horror film with gore and breasts. The acting is not great, and some of the fight scenes are funny. It's a fun film.

The count is countless as Jason slashes through Elm Street and folds a bed with a man on top of it! It was the ultimate best when Freddy possessed that young man in the mental hospital and Jason came to cut that stuff in half! Then the showdown of the millennium takes an astonishing twenty minutes at Camp Crystal Lake! "Freddy Vs.

It has all the right elements: a high body count, good movie monsters, a good premise and lots of blood. Who wins? Well, if you have ever seen any of the Freddy or Jason movies, then you will know how it ends. This movie is a nice diversion, it is not cheap looking nor is it as brain-dead as most of the Friday 13th films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Freddy Vs. Jason" is one of the excellent horror movies I have ever seen. Robert Englund returns in his signature role of Freddy Kreuger in this well made horror film that is a part of both the "A Nightmare On Elm Street" and "Friday The 13th" movies. Ken Kirzinger takes on the role of Jason Voorhees. Kirzinger is superb in his role as Jason Voorhees. Englund is just as superb as Kirzinger is. The directing by Ronny Yu is excellent and the screenplay & story is great. The production and costume design, the make-up and special effects, the cinematography, and the music are brilliant. Go see this movie now, I mean, right now!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>This has been years in the making. Was the final match up between the two most famous serial killers in film history worth it?. You better believe it. If you are a fan who grew up on these movies in the 80's, then the release of this film is like Christmas. Freddy Krueger(once again played by Robert Englund), is losing power. The children of Elm Street are no longer dreaming, thanks to the drugs they are being fed, and no long suffer from nightmares. What is a psycho killer to do?. Get help via another psycho killer. Freddy enlists the help of Camp Crystal Lake Killer Jason Voorhees(this time played by veteran stuntman Ken Kirzinger), to come to Springwood and cause mayhem and terror so that the kids will once again be afraid and start to dream again. But Jason begins to like his new turf and no longer wishes to be Freddy's puppet. The main heroine is Lori Campbell(Monica Keena), who just happens to live in Freddy's old house on 1428 Elm St. Although, it is so obviously NOT the original house used in all the previous Freddy films. She, along with her boyfriend Will(Jason Ritter), and many friends, are the unlucky ones caught in the crossfire. Most of the teen's own seperate stories are not interesting enough to carry the film. They are okay to watch, but could of been more fleshed out. It doesn't help any that most of the acting from them was pretty stilted. Ordinary at best. Monica Keena, while a beautiful thing to look at, desperatley needed more honed acting chops to do this role justice. Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland, was one of the better ones of the bunch. Who knew?!. The whole section with Lori and Will and that storyline would of been so much better if there was a little more time spent on it. There is a lot of talk about what happened, but it all seems to be played out as just a lightweight thing to pass the time to get to the battle. It's not bad, but it distracts from the main narrative when it came close to being something rather good. Robert Englund is, once again, brilliant. This is classic Freddy. The look of the make-up and the sweater and the attitude was more reminiscent of the first 3 'Nightmare' film, than any of the latter ones. The wait to see Freddy again was worth it because Englund delivers brilliantly. No offense to Kane Hodder, but Ken Kirzinger really ruled as Jason. He was strong and a big presence. His Jason had a more subtle touch to it than the zombie like ogre presented in the last few 'Friday' films. A touch more humanity as well. This is one of the better representations of the character, if not the best, in any incarnation. Sorry Kane. The film definitley seemed to praise all of the traits that made up 80's slasher films. Nudity, [love], drugs, and rock and roll. It is all there in all it's unabashed glory. Although, the nudity really is brought to the film by the 'Friday' relation. The movie has barely started before these traits are thrown on the silver screen and we couldn't be happier about it. This is a movie that knows what it is and what fans of each franchises' like and want to see. The methods of murder are quite cool, and the body count is on par with any typical Jason film, although quite high for a film that Freddy is in. The movie will also please gorehounds because it is incredibly bloody. I have not seen such a bloody movie in a long time. It's a slasher movie all the way. The movie goes along with a real nice pace. There are signs that the movie may of been edited unfairly and that some scenes were cut off too early, but it has a good flow. It is certainly longer than most of the slasher flicks in the last several years, and you can tell. I enjoyed that a lot. The end battle scene is one for the record books. It is one of the most highly enjoyable moments on screen this year, if not the most. If you are a fan, you will be mesmerized and clapping with glee. One wishes it went on even longer and came up with even more inventive ways to torture and fight each other. As for the ending, well, it wasn't what I was expecting. I didn't really know what to expect, actually, but I was looking for something else. The balance of both films' traits are mostly well done, but at times it doesn't seem to fit. The 'Nightmare' films were several rungs above "Friday' on the horror ladder. They were a bit more classy and intelligent, so it seems kind of odd to see such female nudity and buckets of blood drenched about. But it was cool. Some people miss the point when they say it should of been Jason Vs. Michael. As much as I love Michael as well, it would just be two pieces of indestructible granite pounding each other. With Freddy, you get more than just hitting. You get special effects and so many different things to do that can take the film, and story, to heights that could never happen with just two people like Jason and Michael. People don't get that.  Director Ronny Yu is a brilliant visionary. The movie is very sharp looking and crystal clear. He makes the most of every shot. Whenever there is a moment for something really cool or grisly, he doesn't come up short. The man is incredible. I was blown away with this film. I had a great time. The best thing to come out of the genre in ages. I give you my word. I was laughing(intentionally), cheering, and having a great time. The pairing of the two came across in a film that is undoubtedly entertaining, grisly, and over the top fun. You will have to see it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>And what a battle it is.  Freddy is stuck in Hell, forgotten by the Elm Street families he terrorized, so he sends Jason off to stir up some dust and some memories.  The Camp Crystal Lake killer does his job, but doesn't stop while ahead.  This turn of events angers Krueger to no end, and gives his potential victims an edge.  Place your bets.<p>Freddy Vs. Jason has been in development for nearly ten years (perhaps longer), ever since New Line bought up the rights for the Friday the 13th series from Paramount.  For fans of either series, it should prove well worth the wait.  Not surprisingly, the movie resembles an entry in the Elm Street series more so a Friday the 13th sequel.  This is probably due to the fact that the Elm Street series had a more inventive visual style than the pedestrian Friday the 13th.  But the characters play off each other quite well, and the remaking of Jason into a more 'sympathetic' killer works well within the concept of this sequel.  Director Ronny Yo has done his homework, fans of either series will be more than happy with this 80s era monster smackdown.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>Freddy Vs. Jason kind of seemed like an urban legend in the horror movie genere for a long while before it finally decided to become a reality. The movie industry finally realized the potential marketing value of putting the slasher movie genre's most popular and loved villains face to face. It was always a good idea from the start. Yeah, I would say that it was a little outlandish. But outlandish is what made the sequels to Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St. If you didn't expect outlandish by now then you need to watch more Jason and Freddy sequels. Yeah, sometimes it was corny and stupid. I'm use to that when it comes to these two guys. But in the end, the movie was really fun and entertaining. I did think the whole set up to the two fighting was a little slow. And I do think that there could have been 15 to 20 minutes more of Freddy and Jason actually fighting, but this film is loaded with carnage candy and some really cool fight scenes. The film didn't feel like another addition to the lengthy line of sequels that we have had for a while. It felt like a whole 'nother thing happening. This film really is how these two classic killers will be carried on in the 21st century.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Freddy Krueger. Jason Voorhees. Two characters in the American horror film canon that simply refuse to go away. Literally, since both are impervious to lasting physical injury. You can set these guys on fire, stab them, dissect them, blow them up, do just about anything you want to them and they keep coming back for more. How many films have both of them made at this point? Twenty? It feels like a hundred. The combined box office and home rental take of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th" franchises must be close to a billion dollars by now, so when New Line Cinema acquired the rights to make future Jason films they knew they were on to something big. Finally, they thought, they could put together a film containing both Freddy and Jason. New Line spent years developing just the right script for the showdown every horror fan wanted to see. Hence "Freddy vs. Jason" cleaned up big time at the box office last year, making so much money that plans for a sequel should be a foregone conclusion. Until New Line figures out how to make lightening strike twice, content yourself with the DVD version of the film.<br /><br />"Freddy vs. Jason" reintroduces us to good old Springwood, the home of the late but definitely unlamented Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). Things have changed in the old neighborhood since Freddy went on his dreamscape rampages back in the 1980s and early 1990s. The adults in the area figured out an excellent way to get rid of the man with the frayed sweater and razorblade gloves forever, or so they hope. They simply removed every reference they could find in newspapers and magazines about Freddy Krueger. Go to the library to do some research on the man, as one of the characters does in the film, and you won't find a darn thing. Why go to all the trouble of a news blackout? Easy. The kids can't dream about Freddy if they don't know he exists. And if they can't dream about him, they can't perish horribly. There are a few kids that know the ghastly secret, like Will Rollins (Jason Ritter), but the authorities have him and the others tucked away in a high security mental hospital under the influence of the powerful anti-dream drug Hypnocil. Before Rollins unceremoniously went to the hospital, he spent a lot of time with his gorgeous girlfriend Lori Campbell (Monica Keena) and her friend Kia Waterson (Kelly Rowland). Lori doesn't learn what happened to him until Freddy decides to come out of retirement.<br /><br />Krueger, you see, despises the fact that the Elm Street kiddies don't know about him. In order to once again torment the descendants of his oppressors, he resurrects the dreaded Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) to stir things up in his old neighborhood. Jason does an excellent job of instilling the appropriate amount of doom and gloom in the kids, partly through his beastly appearance and partly through his penchant for imaginative killings. In one case, he folds a kid up in a bed. Hardly disturbing, right? Well, it is when the poor chap's heels are touching the back of his head! Voorhees's antics soon know no bounds. He shows up at a rave in a cornfield just in time to massacre scores of kids in particularly heinous ways. Jason kills so many people, and keeps on killing more, that it puts a serious crimp in Freddy's plans when he shows arrives on the scene. He wants all the children to himself, which means Jason has to go back to hell posthaste. Problem is, the masked maniac isn't going to do it without a little help. The result is the fight, a slam bang, take no prisoners tete a tete that is breathtaking to behold. Neo and Agent Smith can't compare to these two. Freddy and Jason squaring off translates into a lot of blood and a lot of broken bones. Any humans who happen to get in the way are hamburger.<br /><br />"Freddy vs. Jason" is a massively entertaining film. It's not a traditional slasher film although there are slasher elements in it. It's not a character driven film, either, except for the two killing machines. The entire film exists solely as background for the final showdown. Sure, some of the effects up to this point, including the shadow Freddy and Kelly Rowland's nose flying off, garner a chuckle or two. But the fight scene stands center stage. The best part has to be when Freddy dumps dozens of long pieces of rebar down on an unsuspecting Jason, several pieces of which turn the hockey masked maniac into a giant shish kebob. Or maybe the best scenes include the battle at the lake where Freddy and Jason exchange blows resulting in huge gouts of black gore. Whichever part you like the most, the conclusion to the film won't disappoint. Given the emphasis on the fight, it's sort of disappointing we don't get to spend more time with the always beautiful Monica Keena. She's the sort of young lady I never tire of seeing in a film. I would tune in to watch her sit around in sweat pants and a grungy T-shirt eating breakfast. In "Freddy vs. Jason," though, she's one step above cannon fodder. Pity.<br /><br />The amount of supplements included with the film stagger the imagination. A commentary track with director Ronny Yu, Robert Englund, and Ken Kirzinger heads the list. You've also got a "jump to a death" option, trailers, an intriguing documentary on the special effects, interviews about the difficulty in bringing the film to fruition, and a lengthy text article from Fangoria magazine about the myriad scripts penned by many writers over the years. I highly recommend this film for those viewers looking for a great way to whittle away a few hours. I'll be watching it again soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I've been a bigger Friday the 13th fan than a Nightmare on Elm Street fan.  The woods simply seem more inherently frightening and dangerous than a suburban street for horny teens.  In any event, I feel that both of these series, especially Friday the 13th, have lost their lure in recent years.  Trying to find ways to bring back our favorite slashers and attempting to do it in contemporary fashion have fallen short, in my opinion.  I've remained a fan through it all, yet when they took Jason out of Camp Crystal Lake and brought him to New York City, he somehow became less imposing and some of the mystery was lost.<br /><br />Freddy vs. Jason was an idea borne years before this film began pre-production.  The premise of the film (Freddy calling on Jason to strike fear back into the children of Elm Street) is decent, but it seemed to me that something was missing...<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, especially the dream sequences, but I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with the film.  It just didn't feel like Friday the 13th to me.  It felt more like a Nightmare on Elm Street film, but even those movies were scarier.  This movie bordered on absurd at times and much of what we had come to know about Freddy and Jason was betrayed in this film by way of contradiction (i.e. Jason suddenly having a phobia of water after he had, on many occassions in the past, pursued people into the water to kill them).<br /><br />I am glad that this movie was made and I will always remain a fan, but I feel that with all of the time and writing that went into this idea, it could have been a hell of a lot better.  The story was not bad, but the movie was simply not scary or suspenseful at all.  It's a must see for any fan of either series, if for no other reason than to see what your favorite classic slasher is up to - but don't expect to get that good old feeling you used to get when watching a Friday the 13th or a Nightmare on Elm Street film back in the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />The bonus material is extensive and quite exhaustive.  They cover every aspect of the film, including pre-production, direction, stunts, visual effects, make-up, audio commentary, deleted scenes, storyboards and galleries, etc....  The bonus disc amounts to a few hours of extra viewing, which is actually pretty informative and insightful.  With cool, animated menus, this is a great DVD edition for something of a letdown film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>The youngest generation of Freddy and Jason fans have no idea how long we, the original fans of the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street franchises, waited for this movie to become a reality.  We dared to dream of this monster match-up back in the mid-1980s, years before development actually began; that development, as we all know, went through all manner of scripts and writers and producers and directors and basically but the kitchen sink over the course of eleven years.  When New Line took over the Friday the 13th franchise, the first sparks of belief were born from the fiery ashes of hope, and the ending of Jason Goes to Hell sent us into tremors of excitement.  We waited, and waited some more.  New Line also waited - waited for a script that would join these two distinctive storylines in a way acceptable to both the studios and, most importantly, the fans.  Freddy vs. Jason, in my opinion, was more than worth the wait, and I thank New Line for caring enough about the characters and their fans to wait until they had a script we could all buy into and respect.  <p>I love this movie.  It has everything I would have asked for: gratuitous nudity (well, I might have added a little more of it); an acceptable number of kills and the blood and gore to go with them; insights into the "births" of both Jason and Freddy; a return to basics for Freddy himself, veering him away from his stand-up comedy career of later Elm Street films yet retaining his wickedly sarcastic wit; an interesting cast of characters I enjoyed seeing die one by one; and of course both a home and away match for our two star attractions.  It also has plenty of an oftentimes wet Monica Keena, and the fact that she remained clothed throughout the film only made her that much sexier.  You've got plenty of action at Crystal Lake as well as Freddy's boiler room turf, and the premise of the film works very well.  How to bring Jason and Freddy together?  That was always the crux of the matter, and the assorted scriptwriters who worked on the story over the years came up with some ridiculous ideas that would never have worked.  Damion Shannon and Mark Swift deserve kudos for discarding all the old ideas that continued to cling to the project and giving us a darn good script.  We all know that Freddy draws his power from the fear of his victims, but he has suddenly been forgotten.  The adults of Springwood have erased Freddy and his activities from the collective history of the town, and those kids who know Freddy and fear him have all been shipped to an asylum and deprived of the ability to dream via drug therapy.  Freddy has been made too weak to come back, and so he selects Jason Voorhees to go to Elm Street and spread fear anew.  His plan works, as the authorities let Freddy's name slip out, and with each of Jason's kills, Freddy grows stronger.  This leads us to the second critical aspect of the plot: why would Jason and Freddy fight one another?  Once Freddy's back, he doesn't take kindly to Jason claiming all of his own would-be victims - obviously, the guy in the hockey mask needs to learn who the boss really is.  And so the rumble begins, a fight brought over into the real world thanks to the kids of Elm Street who work things out and intentionally place Jason in Freddy's path.  <p>I thought all of the young actors did a great job, even though a couple of characters were not fleshed out as much as they might have been.  Freddy is his old self again, witty but downright vicious, and Jason is his single-minded murdering self.  I had a hard time deciding who to pull for, though.  I love Freddy because he takes the time to enjoy tormenting his victims before killing them, but you have to admire the one-man killing machine that is Jason Voorhees.  I think there was plenty of fighting between the two at the end, and I approved of the ending.  You can argue about the victor of the fight, but clearly (whether or not a rematch ever occurs) the fight ain't exactly over just yet.  <p>The DVD is fantastic, filled with all sorts of goodies.  I actually started wondering when the featurettes on the making of the film would ever end - there is an amazing amount of material here.  Another wonderful addition was the two-part Fangoria article detailing the wild history of this long-awaited film; I could not believe some of the ridiculous ideas espoused by earlier script writers; had New Line made this film earlier than they did, they would very likely have doomed both the Jason and Freddy franchises.  The Ill Nino video for "How Can I Live" is fun to watch, although I was disappointed it did not feature any movie clips (and thus no Monica Keena).  Best of all, though, you get a number of deleted/alternate scenes as well as an audio commentary of the film by director Ronny Yu, Robert Englund (Freddy), and Ken Kirzinger (Jason) - England sort of dominates the conversation, but his excitement about the film is palpable.  Yu was an interesting choice as director, but I think he did a fine job; I was especially fascinated to learn how much of an impact early screenings of the film with test audiences affected the final cut - Yu knew that the fans were more knowledgeable than he was on the subject at hand and rightly deferred to their opinions when they made plain the fact that certain elements of the first cut just would not fly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Forget Tyson and Lewis; this is the big show.  The big event that every horror fan has dreamt of is finally here.  Two legends duke it out to claim their glory in high body-counts.  The world isn't big enough for these two monsters, so they will have to fight until only of them walks away victorious.  While this is no Shakespearian masterpiece (nor is it trying to be one) and the movie tends to go over-the-top at times, &quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; is a complete blast for those who are looking for one hell of an entertaining time.<p>The people of Elm Street have finally found a way to get rid of Freddy Krueger for good.  They've erased him from their memories.  Any evidence or witnesses to his bloodshed have been done away with or locked up; thus, making Krueger powerless.  As a sign of desperation, Freddy calls upon another legend killer; Jason Voorhees.  With Jason back from the grave and going back to his murderous ways, Freddy knows that the people of Elm Street will suspect that it is his doing and will be afraid once again; for it is their fear he craves and lives on.  The only problem is once Freddy set Jason loose, there's no stopping him.  Jason is killing all of Freddy's children and sparing none for him.  Well, Freddy is not going to take that lying down.  Freddy decides it is time to put the bad boy down for good, leading to the ultimate showdown between the two legendary monsters.<p>It's impossible for this movie to please everybody, but I for one must confess that I absolutely LOVED this movie.  This is because I accept it for what it is.  Being a huge Freddy fan, I knew exactly what it was going to be.  In fact, the movie went as far as to even surprise me with a clever and workable plot.  While it takes the film some time to get into the background story (which is really cool to see the beginnings of these two maniac killers; especially Freddy's start) and character development, once these two colossal giants go one-on-one, it is a sight to see.  There is some incredible fighting between the two that was very unexpected.  The acting in the movie isn't fantastic, but it works for what it is trying to accomplish.  You don't need excellent acting in this kind of a movie; you just need acting that is at least bearable.  I found it more than that and was pretty pleased with the end results.  Freddy and Jason are the two show-stoppers that really makes everything work.  Kudos to Robert Englund for being able to rise to the occasion of playing a marvelous &quot;Freddy&quot; for all of these years.  He hasn't lost his touch.<p>One of the big complaints about this film from people is talks of there being no winner.  Without giving away the ending, I will go on the record and say there absolutely is a winner.  It's undeniable that the ending leaves room for a second round, no doubt; however, there is most certainly a winner by the end of the film (think of it more like a round in boxing).  I think the ending is more than suitable--this referring to the exact final shot.  I'm sure some people are upset with how it ended, but I thought it ended on a fine note.<p>This two-disc DVD set has some pretty cool extras within it.  First off, the picture quality is breath-taking and crystal clear while the sound is excellent.  The DVD offers both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie.  Extras included are deleted scenes, commentary, trailers, a music video, some cool DVD-ROM features, and much more.  A pretty impressive package for a movie like this, I must admit.<p>&quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; isn't looking to win Oscars, nor is it here for enlightenment.  It is here for us horror fans, and for us Freddy/Jason fans.  If you think the previous movies are stupid, then you will most likely think this one is as well.  If you're a fan of the past movies, then chances of you enjoying this flick are very great.  Just keep two things in mind:  Don't let hype consume you, and allow yourself to make up your own mind in the end.  This was a very entertaining chapter in the Freddy/Jason saga that I will be sure to watch over and over again.  What could've been a terrible disaster ends up being a grand and gory entertaining time.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>The long awaited &quot;Freddy vs.Jason&quot; was well worth the wait considering the makeup and the good script.The movie isn't the best in either series however it IS better than the last two installments &quot;Wes Cravens New Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Jason X&quot;.The film had some pretty good writers and a great script making the movie a must see for Freddy/Jason fans.The film starts out with an intro depicting how Freddy died and was sent to hell after the kids on Elm street forgot about him making him lose his power.<br />But when Freddy finds a way to get his power back by sending the immortal hockey faced slasher Jason Voorhees to remind people about him.Stuck in the web of terror are a couple of teenagers who are trying to bring the deadly duo together for the &quot;Ultimate Showdown of Terror&quot;.The film does have a semi predictable ending and I think does need a sequel although the film fell off the top 10 charts after four weeks.The makeup effects are great and the special features are top notch including an aternate ending,and 18 deleted scenes,this is a must have DVD for horror fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>When I heard Freddy Vs Jason was coming out in theaters I didn't want to watch it. I thought it was going to be stupid. I thought it was going to be like the Mtv show. I don't remember what it is called. And I can only remember bits and pieces of it. But the makers of the show would make stars into I guess you can say 3D. I'm sure it's not 3D, but looks like it. Then they would make them fight each other in a ring.<br /><br />Well I thought that was stupid. And that is what I thought this movie was going to be about. I bought this movie anyways because I'm collecting all of Jason and Freddy movies. I just finished watching it last night. I really enjoyed it. I was half way done watching this movie when my husband walked in from work.

This movie was for the Nightmare on Elm Street fan. Freddy had most of the film and yes, I know Jason cant talk. It was good to see Freddy in a film again though. Robert Englund is a treat to watch, i'd highly recommend him in 1001 Maniacs. It had a good plot but the cast was really annoying. Also, Kane Hodder, the Jason in the last four Friday films, was left out for a unknown actor. Hodder was the best Jason and his presence in this movie is missed. A good movie with a few good fight scenes between Jason and Freddy. The killings in this movie weren't really speical. Id recommend it to people who love horror or just have every Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>We've been waiting for this one since like 1989. They changed this from when it first came out on video, to a much more straight forward Friday the 13th film. Jason and Freddy hack up a group of overage teens before squaring off against one another with, as I could've predicted years ago, Jason wins. They tied the two series together, it was Freddy who drowned Jason. I really liked it, but someone who isn't a diehard fan of either series might rate it poorly. It's amazing to see Friday the 13th films still being made after Jason X bombed. Robert Englund does a good job of reprising his role of Freddy Kruger, in what should be his final film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>Okay, I'll be honest, I never wanted to see this movie. I love all the Elm Street movies, and some of the Friday ones, but the whole idea of Freddy and Jason fighting just seemed stupid to me. I caught the end of the movie on TV the other night, and it was pretty good. Turns out my husband has the DVD, so I sat down to watch the whole thing, and it was pretty good. It's not the best of either series, but it's not even close to being the worst.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This movie has been in limbo for years. This was to be released before 'Jason X', after 'Jason Goes To Hell'. It has it's moments and each franchise has released worse entries under better conditions. I am a fan of both series, but have always thought Jason was more menacing than Freddy!<br /><br />When I first heard they were making this I immediately thought of other classic monster team ups  Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, King Kong VS Godzilla and Alien VS Predator. I guess compared with the other team up films it stands up pretty well. The DVD edition is way better than the film deserves. A decent installment in both series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>This is an old-school horror...<br /><br />Lots of gore, the goriest horror film I've seen in a long time. Almost comparable to the Evil Dead.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like either the Nighmare on Elm Street series (I do not) or the Friday 13th series (I do) this is one one those slashers that has a small plot, but if you like the style of the others, then this movie is for you.<br /><br />Also, if you like new horror films on high budgets, this is also for you.<br /><br />Just dont get it expecting a classic!<br /><br />Overall, a good final battle.

At one time these movies where serious, now they are more for laughs. This one did however manage to do a better job than I anticipated. They successfully made a plot that incorporated both characters in it and made it seem somewhat legitimate. The movie seemed to move a little slower though than some of the pervious movies in either series. It also seemed to have a lot less blood than the earlier Nightmare On Elmstreet's and Friday the 13th' movies. It was more like an over rated pro-wrestling event that builds up to 2 characters battling it out for a fake heavy weight belt.  I still however enjoyed it, and I did not have high hopes for it to begin with.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>After taking a hiatus from the dreams of all those little boys and girls, Freddy seems to have developed a tiny little problem. People have forgotten him. They no longer remember "The SpringWood Slasher" and what the dozens of kids he killed, nor do they recall that their parents brutally enacted revenge upon him by burning him alive. They've also forgotten what he did about that and how he came for them all, tasting the fears buried in their dreams as he knifed his way through them one fingerblade at a time, and they've stopped recalling the bodycount that meant. For all the terror he managed to make while rocking Springwood's youth, he has now become something that nobody can recall. Knowing what that means and how that denies him the pleasure of being the beast he's always wanted to be, he comes up with a plan that will let him make the children fear again and make them believe in Freddy. By disguising himself as the mother of another legend lost in time, he calls out and awakens something that has the potential to make people believe. Still, the menace known as Jason isn't the easiest monster to control...<p>When the rumors first began surfacing in the 1980s abut this movie coming to pass, all my friends and I used to sit around and talk about how great it would be and who we thought would win. I, always partial to Jason after he became something more than a man, argued day in and day again about it, thinking that the superstalker had more in his bag-of-tricks than he got credit for. Regardless of which sid eof the fence you feel on, however, we all knew that this was a match-up we'd wanted ages to see, and one that we thought would never be made because years upon years passed. When I finally found out that this time was "go time" and that I could actually see the end result of decades of pondering, I went and did something I rarely do - going as far as to brave the bipedal disease to see the legends that haunted so many of my childhood dreams. And it was truly worth it. <p>Seeing Robert Englund dawn the glove one more time and do a little backstory with it was nice, and nicer still when you looked at the amount of money that had to have been pumped into the set-up. There were the little things that had been touched up from the last time we saw Freddy hit the big screen, with his face made to look more menacing with subtle refinements, and there were many of the same things we remembered about him from the "good old days." The twisted pieces of humor floating around in the movie, the one liners we have all grow to love; they were all there and they were all thriving. It was like picking up with Freddy, jokes and darkness and all, and having that ball to run with again. Couple that with Jason, the walking campground massacre machine that he was, and add in the fact that they get together and have a lot of fun before having it out, and you have yourself something interesting.<p>Combined with this was something I had seen in that many horror movies in a while - and especially not in a Jason movie for quite some time - and that was a body count with some horribly violent deaths.  Instead of an MPAA piece of bent on the destruction of a franchise, it was an out-an-out horror movie that didn't kid around with what we were about to see. From the beginning, with Jason heaping helping of his machete onto the unwanting and the unwilling, to the end and the fight between Freddy and Jason, there was blood and blood aplenty. Jason did what he is probably best know for, creating an atmosphere and then walking in like a plague that nothing can stop, and Freddy did what he does - playing with the fish he wants to fry. Yeah, it's all good stuff.<p>Couple into that equation the fact that there are a drove of deleted scenes that complete many parts (the beginning, for one making it better) , that an extra ending is also on the DVD that allows you to have the beast you might want to win, and that there's a lot of other extras and you have yourself a showdown that is worth picking up on DVD.  You can listen to R.E. as he talks about the movie, skip to deaths, watch a video, and play around with quite a few other trinkets on your way to the torso hatchery. Its really nice to see another chapter of the nightmare unfold after as long.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>I hated Friday the 13th part IX: Jason Goes to Hell and the idea of making a film about Freddy and Jason squaring off was horrible but inevitable after we see Freddy bring Jason's hockey mask to hell with him. Well, I can admit I was somewhat wrong.  You see I was under the impression that the inept creators who made these later films would create this one too, but Freddy vs. Jason was in decent or at least very disturbed hands. The film hand picks the truly memorable elements about both stories and touches on all of them.  The parts that make them scary and somewhat convincing and the parts that reinforce the characters as legends and horror icons.  Freddy vs. Jason celebrates the mythology in an undeniably clever and tongue-in-cheek fashion.<br /><br />Freddy's legend is brought to an iconic status as we see girls jumping rope singing those Freddy rhymes and him getting burned by the vengeful parents of the Elm street children, they even gave us glimpses of Freddy's greatest moments. He consistently breaks out his puns and bad one-liners in vintage Freddy bravado and in many ways he is the lead character of the film.  The movie is actually from his perspective from the start. Jason's legend on the other hand is touched on only half way until later on when the two meet for the first time. We see images of his mother, her head, Jason drowning as a boy and children picking on him mercilessly.  We even get a short reference to Jason's potato sack wearing days in Friday the 13th part 2.<br /><br />Freddy's strength is the fear of the children on Elm Street and to fear him they must know who he is. I don't remember Nancy and Johnny Depp having to know who Freddy is to fear him but where would one of these films be without a plot-hole? So Freddy needs to get something going in reality (cause Freddy exists in dreams). He summons another dark force to bring chaos and fear to the real world Elm Street so the legend of Freddy is hyped-up all over again and he is allowed to flourish in all of the children's fear. Enter Jason Voorhees. But when Jason shows up he spoils all of Freddy's fun by killing everyone he can...and I mean everyone. Freddy can't stand it because everyone on Elm Street now fears Jason just as much as him but Freddy has gained enough power to make a comeback.  The stage is set for the modern day King Kong vs. Godzilla. Both opponents are worthy of the other and they do not disappoint in the least.<br /><br />What really makes the film entertaining is the violence and if you're a fan of these characters. Otherwise you're going to see some brutal deaths that will scare you because most fans are twisted enough to laugh at it and you won't understand why. Freddy vs. Jason contains perhaps more blood than any mainstream film I have ever seen (obviously it can't top Peter Jackson's Dead Alive). Still, the film has blood shooting to and fro in just about every direction in just about every death, and we see a lot of the death. It gets even bloodier when they finally meet in the real world at Camp Crystal Lake for the classic showdown. Freddy's Kung Fu and his wits seem to be the perfect match for Jason's brawn and complete invulnerability to any type of pain or dismemberment.<br /><br />Anyway, the film has plenty of laughs besides the usually amusing murder sequence. Consider this line after Jason marches through a cornfield toward a small rave party as he is engulfed in flames and kills a handful of people, "Dude that goalie was pissed about something".  Rumors still circulate that Michael Myers or Ash (from Evil Dead 2) might get into the mix but nothing has come out of it.  Slasher movie fans are a patient lot with lower standards than most but perhaps enough is enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>In the hundred years or so of American Cinema, there have been epic moments; Gone with the Wind, Cleopatra, True Grit, Star Wars, Dr. Zivago, etc... Well now we can add a new film to the list of 'Greatest of the Great'......Freddy Vs. Jason!<p>The professionalism of acting, the firm hand of the director, the special effects wizards, and of course Ken and Robert can all be proud. They really came through. <p>I could go on forever how this was the greatest movie ever made (it is). But I will stick with just one subject before this review becomes 500 pages of praise. I will give praise to Ken who played the part of Jason Voorhees.<p>Never before has Jason played a part like this. He's almost the good guy, almost. To express such emotion while wearing a mask and never uttering a line is the ultimate challange to an actor. But with the turn of the head, the puppy dog eye, and the heroic stand against Freddy, Jason did well. Well beyond what we all thought he could.<p>Jason is more than a killing machine wearing a hockey mask. He is each and every one of us. Yes, Jason lives in us all, and we all wish we were him. Remember the abusive boyfriend in the beginning of the movie? Words can hurt. Jason knows this, he takes care of the boyfriend as best he can. He stabs him with a machette about 15 times then folds him in half backwards. Brilliant. <p>Or take the party out in the cornfield. Underage drinking, wanton lust, use of illegal drugs. What parent wouldn't want Jason to be a chaparone? He broke up that party quicker than you can say "That was one p*ssed off goalie". Jason is truly the champion of wholesome upbringing and virginity. Sin is the weed and Jason is the gardener.<p>And the final fight with Freddy? Sure Freddy can beat anyone in their dreams, but we can do anything in our dreams. Win our girl, have wealth and fame, be handsome or beautiful. But when we wake up, reality takes over and we drudge on with our lives. <p>Three times in the theater I saw this movie, and everytime it happened. When Freddy realizes he is in the real world, he turns around with fright on his face. Jason slowly rises and is ready to kick butt. The audience screamed, howled, and cheered. Cheering for Jason? My word, I never thought I'd see the day. <p>Yes friends, believe the hype. Never a Jason or Freddy fan you say? Watch this movie, you'll be on eBay in no time buying up every Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street movie you can find.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>When I first heard they were thinking about making a Freddy vs Jason movie years back in like 1994 I thought "that's going to be awful". Years later when it was finally done I admit that I actually like it.  It was done right. It's not overly corny  or silly "like some Freddy and Jason movies" . It's only problem is that it has the usual teenagers that can't act that you always get in slasher movies. <p>  The plot needs them in-order to work unfortunetely though. Although they are annoying it's clever that Freddy needs  Jason to bring terror back into Elm Street in-order to be able to kill again. You see, the people in Elm Street don't fear Freddy anymore because he's not around. So Freddy needs Jason to kill there so people think it is Freddy and fear his name again. So the more people Jason kills the more power Freddy gets and he can kill in dreams once again. I liked all that. <p>  When Freddy finally does get to kill in dreams again it's just the usual stuff with him chasing girls around a scary factory. The Jason killings are the same as you would get in Friday  the 13th movie as well. It's when we finally get Freddy vs Jason that the movie is at it's best. Freddy in Jason's dreams are very cool, makes you think "now that is really going to piss Jason off". Especially since Freddy makes himself look like Jason's mother and talks like her. That was very cool as well. Anyway their fight is well done even if it isn't that long. I hear they might make Freddy vs Jason vs Ash "Bruce Campbell's character of the Evil Dead movies". I'd rather see Freddy vs Jason vs Chucky so they could take turns hacking him to pieces lol. In that case though he'd only be in the first 10 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>...I recall being truly agitated at the early movies of these two horror mass murderers. Freddy as you recall was so bad in that first nightmare film that he sliced himself and the green ooze coming from his slashed ribcage looked like road kill warmed over. And Jason? He would suffer the most terrible destruction only to revive, a hulking murder savant, hockey masked so his victims would never get a hint of how machetes fatal strike will come. This movie seemed to deconstruct and mock alla that precursor mythology about the two and go to the basic horror fan's geek argument, "If Jason and Freddy got into a fight who will win?" It's reminescent of those "Who will win a fight between the Hulk and Thing?" from the Marvel Comics microcosm....so, the movies writer's and producer culled up the premise...Jason becomes Freddy murdering slave, cause he's (Freddy) infected him (Jason) in his dreams (as if he has them)...throw in some late teens and early twenties kids who's more interested in TRL than urban lore and you get the set up. The body count adds up, but and all along the way you get some mind bending slash contests between the two majors. And teen aged deaths as art. What can I say but I thoroughly enjoy it. It ain't spozed to be Chekov, but a way to kill time on a Sat afternoon. It keeps you watching...Loved the way no one wanted to give Jason the mouth to mouth. Loved the way the myths and mystique are designed to go one forever.

I was expecting a lot more and got much less.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this movie was excellent except for 2 very minor flaws.one is for a few minutes at the beginning jason is portrayed as somewhat of a mamas boy and the 2nd one is for about 10 seconds or so freddy intimidates a young girl who looks to be about 7.now i know hes a child murderer but he was never shown going after small children.i dont see anything the least bit entertaining about children in danger.this is definately not for the littleones.it is the last of 8 freddy movies.i think it is a toss up between it and #3 for the best frddy film.freddy exists because people were scared of him.he needed thier fear.the town took all the kids to the loony bin and erased freddy from the records.so he went to hell and pulled out jason to go kill for him.the people would assume it was him and hed be back in buisness.it worked long enough to get freddy back.he got jealous of all the attention jason got and the many many fight were on.in previous freddy and jason films,the deaths were quick,but in this one freddy and jason have epic confrontations.it is an excellent movie but if youre a big fan,youll figure out when and where each combatant is dominant.i think the end was a bit of a bummer too.as for the future?whose to say?jason is supposedto be good for 13 films,but the space one sucked.the freddy's new nightmare kind of blew too.maybe hollywood should qiut screwing around and think about a film people want to watch.the older parts were way better in both sets.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>Horror movies experienced a bit of a rebirth last year, with both "Freddy Vs. Jason" and the remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" raking in loads at the box office, and both are now treated to a deluxe special edition DVD, this is something none of the previous "Friday the 13th" or "Nightmare on Elm Street" (outside of the box set) got. The FVJ DVD is loaded with supplements that compliment the movie, which was surprisingly good. <p>You probably already know the story, so I won't waste keystrokes on describing it ad tedium for you. But what I will say is that this is very much the movie that fans have been ravenous for. Director Ronny Yu wanted to make a back-to-basics slasher movie that respected the mythologies of both series, but added some new twists that would bring them together. Considering how movies ventures of this kind turn out, this movie rises above all the dredge that filled the slasher genre since the craze died in the 80s. This is definitely not a movie for the critics, but fans of either series should be satisfied, if for nothing else than the copious amounts of blood spilled on screen. <p>Obviously owing to the box office success of FVJ, the New Line DVD gives a nice package of supplements to go with the movie. Here is a breakdown of what you can look forward to:<p>-Disc one has a nice commentary track featuring Director Ronny Yu, and the two titans themselves, Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger. Englund is the most vocal, and humorous of the bunch. Kirzinger offers a few tidbits, but is mostly quiet. Yu, in his heavily accented but perfectly understandable English, is the most technically inclined. The commentary track is light on the technical details, but is loads of fun. <p>-There are loads of deleted scenes, but most of them are extended versions of existing scenes in the movie, and are nothing to get excited about. The alternate opening is, again, an extension of the first scene, though it is very classic "Friday the 13th". The alternate ending included is actually pretty good, but I can see why they opted for the other one. <p>-There is a 1 hour documentary sectioned into 10-15 minute featurettes that cover all aspects of the movie. This is where you can find all the technical details that were not in the commentary. They cover the long and grueling road from inception to completion, including bits on the screenwriting, set design, and the stunts. It has interviews with all the principle players, including Sean Cunningham and some of the New Line executives.<p>-The best supplement for me was the reprint of the 2 part Fangoria article on the many scripts and the long road to finding the right story to put to screen. It goes into detail about the many script ideas, and how off-the-wall some of them were. Fascinating stuff.<p>-You also get the assorted trailers, TV spots, and an excruciating music video by Ill Nino. Heard of them? You probably won't be. <p>"Freddy vs. Jason" is a nice homage to both the series and the fans. Since my expectations were not particularly high going into this movie, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The DVD package from New Line is an easy recommendation for fans, and hopefully this will finally spark some progress into that "Friday the 13th" box set that fans have been eyeballing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>by good i mean in slasher flicks terms.lets go through the checklist.1)crazed lunatics....CHECK.2)high body count....CHECK.3)sexy,dumb as dirt girls just waiting to get beheaded....CHECK.4)gore factor....uuuummmmmm,check i guess.the shown violence was decent but at times cartoonish.5)cheesy acting....CHECK.6)believabilty....YEAH RIGHT.im still at a loss of how semi drowning gives jason invincibilty.and when hes down,not 1 person thought of lopping off his head?nah,that would not only kill jason but the cash cow.and finally,7)plot....uuummmmmmm,check kinda.pitting bad guys against eachother is a novel idea.but connecting them is the trick.if i had my way it would have been jason vs michael.but then again,2 silent stalkers isnt much fun.so in the end this is the best pairing.here,the kids are the typical dunce cap models,and adults even lamer.again,common sense kills the slasher/cash cow.to summerize(how official!)this is worth buying at a sale price of say,12.99(give it a month or so).</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Call me silly - I know this movie got mostly bad reviews from the major critics, but I enjoyed it.

I went to this movie opening night and have returned for a second viewing because the first time was so much fun. That is what this movie is all about...FUN! It combines the feel of both Nightmare on Elm Street and the Friday the 13th series nicely. We get to cheer for our preferred villain and get some nice scares and action along the way. Is this a scary horror movie? Maybe not...but there are some pretty tense scenes, and some really great action sequences. But please if you have not seen the film, do not read any further reviews because some folks believe in spoiling a good time by giving away the outcome, just go out and see it. I really hope there is some kind of follow-up to this movie. These characters are too much fun to be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>I saw Jason X.......why?<p>I never saw a Nightmare on Elm Street movie. I never saw ANOTHER Jason movie. But I saw Freddy vs Jason, only because I was interested in finding out who won, and how. When I went, I was expecting to see a scary, interesting movie. After being freaked out by a Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I was ready for the worst. The first time I was truly scared was during a scene in the boiler room where Freddy has one of the main characters cornered, in her dream. The last time I was truly scared was during a scene in the boiler room where Freddy has one of the main characters cornered, in her dream. I was disturbed by a few of the ways that the characters were murdered, but wasn't enough to get me jumping in my seat. <p>I did like the idea. The plot. I only wish the screenwriters and the director tried to take advantage of the good ideas in the movie and made it better. Freddy, looking to kill a man, gets an idea hatched in his evil head. The town where Elm Street is(Freddy's victiums) has locked away survivors that have come in contact with Freddy in the past. They also give them dream retarding drugs, as to destroy any memory that they may have of Freddy, so that he cannot come back to preform movre evil deeds. Freddy's idea is to bring back killer Jason. Jason could kill people on Elm Street, thus making the people around there believe that Freddy has returned to killing. They would bring back the memories that they have tried to forget, allowing him to actually return. In bloodbath sequences, Jason kills a small group of people, and everything after that happens exactly to Freddy's plans. People are dead and he is now strong enough to return. <p>Meanwhile, Lori, Kia, and Gibb are stuck with the memories of Jason killing thier friends. That is untill Lori has a nightmare, where she sees a man named Freddy, the name of the person that the police said as a potentioal killer. Things become more strange when he old boyfriend Will and his friend Mark, return from the psychiatric ward(she doesn't know where he's been) to find out what was going on. <p>When Freddy corners one of them in a dream, up in the real world Jason comes and kills Freddy's future victium. Instead of Freddy killing the person, Jason does. Freddy misses killing and gets angry at Jason. He demands for Jason to return back to the dark shadow world, but Jason says no, leading the two well-known killers, into a battle that goes from the dream world, straight to where Jason was first made...Camp Crystal Lake.<p>But throughout the film I was constantly asking myself, what is with all of this useless stuff, like profanity, the drugs, the sexually situations. Why could we not have a plain horror movies without all the add-ons. A scary movie, like The Ring, with the slasher film quality like scenes in the summer blockbuster 28 Days Later...(another film I had a problem with)<p>Did I hate Freddy vs Jason? The answer to that is no. I enjoyed it very much. After struggling through the first thirty minutes or so, my money was finally paid off with the last hour. When Freddy finally takes command. If the movie had a little more detailed plotline, and some more non bloody action taking place instead of all of the teen partying scenes, etc, this would have robally gained  fourth star. It wouldn't have gained a fifth star because it wasn't excellant. It wouldn't even be great with all the things I mentioned above. My next stop though is to watch the orignal Freddy and Jason films. They have to be better...<p>To watch this movie was not torture. I have no idea what the critics were talking about, saying that it was a terrible dry film. It was good....I liked it. In the word of the 60's generation...mellow out, man. <p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence/gore, gruesome images, sexuality, drug use and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Freddy Vs Jason almost lived up to my lofty expectations. I have been a lifelong fan of both series and have been waiting literally 18 years for this film. The plot is simple yet intriguing: the residents of Elm Street (and town) have been forced to forget Freddy Kruger by being drugged and having their memories erased, thus leaving Freddy powerless to enter their dreams. So Freddy, scours the bowels of hell searching for a soul he can manipulate into bringing fear into the Elm Street teens. Well, no one is more fiercesome than Jason Voorhees. Freddy poses as Jason's dead mother and implores him to kill all the naughty children of Elm Street. The problem is that Jason is sort of like a bag of Lays potato chips, he can't KILL just one. He goes berserk and starts killing everyone, even the victims Freddy intends to kill, thus causing a showdown. The problem with Freddy Vs Jason lies in the absence of screen time for both protagonists, instead we are forced to listen to and follow the stupid teens. However, the film does pick up in it's final 45 minutes enough to rescue the movie as a whole. The fight scenes between Kruger and Voorhees are magical and sent chills up my spine. I would not have had any problem watching these two slice and dice each other for the whole film. The final battle is truly awesome but the best fight scene lies in the showdown in Jason's dream. A sequel is all but assured by the last scene which is great, but as another reviewer wrote why not add another psycho to the mix like Michael Myers, Pinhead or Leatherface, it would only make us fans of the genre that much more pumped for the sequel. Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>I'm sure when everyone heard the title &quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; the few people whose ears didn't perk up with interest probably just let out a giggle. But one thing that is for sure is that the fans of these movies have been waiting for this movie to come out for what seems like ages. The history of this movie goes back to 1988 when &quot;Friday the 13th: The New Blood&quot; was released. Initially this was the movie that Freddy Krueger (of the &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot; series) and Jason Vorhees (of the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series) were to face off. But alas, it was never meant to be. Each franchise was owned by a different company (Paramount owned Jason; New Line owns Freddy) and they just couldn't get into bed together. So the project was squashed, if only temporarily, until New Line acquired the rights to Jason and produced their first &quot;Friday&quot; movie: &quot;Jason Goes To Hell&quot; in 1993. Since the two bad guys now worked for the same company, it made sense for &quot;JGTH&quot; to end with Freddy pulling Jason's mask into Hell, forshadowing this movie, which took New Line 10 extra years to develop. And it went through it's own Hell. At least a dozen different story ideas and scripts were being tossed around (some of them very odd and goofy, as documented on the second disc of this DVD). But alas, producers Bob Shaye and Sean S. Cunningham (who birthed and kept each series alive) finally agreed on Damian Shannon &amp; Mark Swift's script, and under Ronny Yu's (&quot;Bride Of Chucky&quot;) direction, a historical horror event was finally born.<p>For me, &quot;Freddy Vs. Jason&quot; exceeded all expectations. No doubt, there will be people who are unhappy with the movie, but that always happens. Instead of being just a wrestling match with Freddy and Jason at each other's throat, this movie has a great story, good characters and an interesting and plausible way to tie the two characters together. Freddy is in Hell. The people of Elm Street have forgotten about him, thus, he has lost his powers. He devises a scheme to resurrect the hockey masked killer Jason Vorhees to put fear back in the hearts of the Elm Street children, all in the name of Freddy. However, things go sour. When Freddy is finally ready to bring down his reign of terror, Jason has slipped out of his control and is getting all of Freddy's blood, so the battle is on. The movie contains some nice heavy dosages of nostalgia. Sure, it's more of a &quot;Nightmare&quot; flick than a &quot;Friday&quot; flick, but both series are treated with respect and none of the history is altered. As a &quot;Nightmare&quot; movie, this one is the tops. Freddy is just as menacing and mysterious as he was in the first two films, the characters are as interesting and likeable as in part three, and the movie itself has the style and energy of part 4. He may crack a few one-liners in this movie, but Freddy is way more sinister than &quot;Freddy's Dead&quot; portrayed him as. Freddy's finest moment is during Mark's death -- a pivotal moment in the movie that brought back a lot of &quot;Elm Street&quot; memories -- his first kill in the movie. Robert Englund was born for this character and he plays it for all it's worth. As far as Jason goes, he does what he does best: hack teenagers up with his trusty machete. The rave scene is Jason's moment; there is something to be said about Jason on fire, stalking teens throughout a cornfield. Despite Kane Hodder (Jason from parts 7-10) being fired, the new guy Ken Kirzinger manages to be just as tough and unstoppable as those before him (maybe even more). The movie also returns to some basic &quot;Friday&quot; elements that &quot;Jason Goes To Hell&quot; and &quot;Jason X&quot; were missing. The last half hour to the ending is just mind bending and the way it ends is perfect if you think about it. I hope there are more sequels on the way (but not a whole new batch of ____ vs. ____ movies). I honestly couldn't have asked more of this movie. It picked me up and had me hooked for the breezy 90 minutes it filled. <p>The DVD is jam packed with stuff, making it an even better experience than when I saw it in theaters. Nevermind the fact that we can now watch this movie over and over again ad nauseam like all the others, but we get a commentary for the director, Ronny Yu, and actors Robert Englund &amp; Ken Kirzinger. We also get in-depth featurettes on virtually every step involved in this movie (a nice bit focuses on Freddy's make-up). Then of course there are a truckload of trailers and a music video for Ill Nino's 'How Can I Live' lifted from the soundtrack (which I highly recommend). If you grew up on these movies and have watched them so many times as I have, you need to look into this movie. It's already a classic in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>I really have no idea what the point of this movie was, exactly, but I certainly did not enjoy the premise of the ordeal.  It's kind of fun to watch Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees duke it out, but overall it won't leave you feeling very entertained; or that your time had been well spent.<br /><br />The plot opens with the best scene in the entire film, which is the prologue of Robert Englund as the pre-supernatural Freddy and his origin.  From here, the film quickly declines.  Freddy , trapped in Hell because of the fact that the people of Springwood have erased every trace of his existence (thus children don't know him, and as such can't fear him, so thus Freddy can't enter their dreams....I don't recall Nancy knowing who Freddy was until her mother explained in the first Nightmare film, but OK).  He cons Jason to rise from the dead and kill the (as usual, overly horny teens) kids of Elm Street, thus causing his name to spread once more.<br /><br />This results in Freddy losing it when he realizes Jason's gone on a murderous rage (duh) and is preventing Freddy from savoring the time and elaboration he likes to take when killing teens.  Annnnd, this is where the "plot" of Freddy and Jason actually fighting comes in.  The fight in Freddy's boiler room dreamscape is very nice, and the Crystal Lake fight at the end is also entertaining up until the construction site portion onwards.  Problem is that between these fights, there really is zero substance.<br /><br />A usual problem with slashers is horribly present here: horrible, ditzy, female actresses.  They're good on the eyes, but make the brain cringe.  The blonde girl who's the lead is "a virgin" (PAH! I bet...) and there is a scene in dreamland where Freddy creeps his claws up her leg in what would have been horrifying...if her character was at all believable, or something the audience could relate to.  As far as the audience is concerned, Freddy may as well be threatening to defile a trash can.<br /><br />The problem is mainly that Jason kills the most people yet he is presented as some sort of anti-hero while Freddy is the pure villain.  What is with these crossover monster features and making one of the antagonists winding up as some sort of hero figure?  Plus, Freddy Krueger is a far more interesting character than Jason Vorhees who is a boring zombie who stumbles through everything like Frankenstein on steroids while Freddy has menace in the fact that...he just really likes killing!  Robert Englund (As usual) portrays Freddy Krueger as someone who savors each and every life he takes while Jason is mindlessly hacking his way through each scene.<br /><br />I'm no blood fiend, but the fact that Freddy only kills ONE TEEN in this entire film through dreamland (and it isn't even good by Freddy standards) while Jason not only kills the most "good guys" but is also portrayed as the hero of this clash.  Anyone else see some messed up logic here?  Oh well, Robert Englund, as expected, delivers entertaining quotes and sequences as Freddy, but aside from this the movie has no merit.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Freddy Vs.

To me part 1-5,(with 1 of course being the very best),2 being good,and 5 downright silly.represents the height of the freddy franchise. Wes Craven's New Nightmare was also good, If your like me who grew up on this franchise watching On WBFS-33, or wdzl-39(the most) then NO REMAKE w/o Englund will due.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) is been dead for years in the Real World and the Dream World. Since Freddy is literally in hell and forgotten in the real world. Freddy has a plan to bring back Crystal Lake serial killer Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) to life in the real world. Freddy thinks that by bringing Jason back to life to bring fear on Elm Street and making teenagers believe in Freddy again, he can break loose from hell and restart his killing spree.However, now that Jason is a instant killing machine, he isn't willing to step aside, and with a terrified town in the middle, Freddy has to find a way to kill Jason by going in his dreams before Jason takes over Elm Street. A scared teenager (Monica Keena) finds a way to bring Freddy to reality from her dreams, thus pitching Freddy and Jason into a horrific and bloody showdown.<br /><br />This film is directed by Ronny Yu (Bride with White Hair, Bride of Chucky, Formula 51) who made an entertaining Spin-Off to the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th" Series. Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger for the 8th time, reprises his role as Freddy, and it seems that he had a blast making this film. Kirzinger replaced Kane Hodder (Hodder originally played Jason in the last four films) and adapts to his new role beautifully. Kirzinger is excellent as the new Jason. Sean S. Cunnigham, who produced and directed the original "Friday the 13th" is back producing this silly but larger than life epic. The film also stars Jason Ritter (Jason's father, the late John Ritter, worked with Yu in Bride of Chucky), Kelly Rowland (R & B singer from the group-Destiny's Child), Lochlyn Murno (Scary Movie), Chris Marquette (The Girl Next Door) and Katherine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps Trilogy).<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Expanded Surround Sound. DVD has an ingraining Commentary Track by the director and actors:Englund and Kirzinger. Disc Two has Deleted Scenes with/without Commentary, Many Behind the Scenes Featurettes, Music Video (Ill Nino- How Can I Live, which in my opinion is worth the price of the DVD), Hidden Features, DVD-ROM Content and more. The film has an strong music score by Greame Revell (The Crow, Dark City, Pitch Black) that pays tribute to the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th". This film ended being a Box Office Smash for the studio New Line Cinema. Extremely entertaining for the Fans of both Freddy and Jason. Watch for New Line topper Robert Shaye (one of the executive producers of the film) as the Principal in a cameo appearance. Great gory fun all the way. (*****/*****).</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>The whole idea of Freddy vs Jason has been like a guilty little daydream waiting in the dark places in the back of your mind for most horror fans. When it finally seemed certain it was coming, I know I wasn't the only horror fan who felt the strangest flush of excitement and trepidation, hope and fear, and above all else curiosity. I think many of us also felt that this could be the ONE, the movie that could either lift two of our favorite institutions into respectability or turn them into a laughing stock forever. The longest half hour of my life was waiting through the opening ads for the film to roll, but when it did...WOW! This is all I, a dedicated and obsessive horror fan, could have hoped for. There is murder and mayhem, excellent special effects, and non stop action. The story is surprisingly plausible and fleshed out. New scenes from Jason's past are revealed and more of his motivation explained than ever before. The teens are your typical whiny snots and their deaths are deeply satisfying and stylish. If you are a fan of either icon, see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Freddy vs. Jason (Ronny Yu, 2003)<p>After ten years of talking, more talking, delays, and more delays, America's favorite serial killers, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund [V, Dead and Buried] from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, and Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger, professional stuntman; guess Kane Hodder got sick of the job) from the Friday the 13th series, mix it up. The movie manages to hearken back to the days when every movie monster was pitted against every other, while retaining not a shred of the too-seriousness with which those movies took themselves.<p>The first thing to remember about Freddy vs. Jason is that this is in no way a horror film. Veteran action director Ronny Yu (probably best-known in America for The Bride with White Hair) tried that once, with disastrous results (Bride of Chucky). So he went back to doing what he does best: action flicks. This should be obvious in any of the big fight scenes; take away the makeup and put them in a big field of bamboo and you have Crouching Tiger, Over Hyped. Yes, folks, this is wire-fu, and probably some of the most amusing wire-fu you've ever seen.<p>Even though the big fight scenes between the two are the main focus, it's a Friday the 13th/Nightmare on Elm St. movie, so you have to have a complement of moronic teens as Jason/Freddy fodder. This time, instead of trying to break new talent (and really, how many of the Nightmare/Friday kids have gone on to stardom? Let me count them for you: two, Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette), the crew racked up the body count with somewhat established stars. The Parade of Pretty Underaged Bodies is led by Lori Campbell (Dawson's Creek temptress Monica Keena) and her boyfriend Will (Joan of Arcadia's wheelchair-bound Jason Ritter, looking considerably less disabled here). The story goes something like this: Lori is part of a new generation of Elm St. kids, who are no longer afraid of Freddy Krueger. Since their fear drives him, he needs some way to get them scared of him again. So he raises Jason from his Crystal Lake grave and sends him to Elm St. in order to make the kids think Freddy's back (cue Alice Cooper music. Whoops, that was the OTHER series). Now (please ignore the giant plot hole) the last round of Freddy-inspired terror had happened four years previously, during which time Will thought he saw Lori's father murder her mother inside their house. The resulting trauma caused Will, and a number of the other near-victims (including Will's best friend Mark [Brendan Fletcher, who wisely disassociated himself with the Air Bud movies after the first one]), to be committed to a mental hospital outside town. (Lori knows nothing of this and thinks Will just moved away.) But after Jason commits his first murder inside Lori's house and Will catches a piece of a news story, he and Mark decide to escape and go make sure everyone's okay. Which, of course, they're not.<p>Perhaps the most inventive part of the storyline is the fact that you think you're being dropped into a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel, but (as far as I can tell from reading IMDB cast lists) this is a new storyline, created for this movie. Very subtle, and quite well done. But that said, everyone who's going to want to see this movie is going to see it for one reason: Freddy and Jason mixing it up.<p>Like I said, the fight scenes are wire-fu, so be prepared for Freddy and Jason bounding around in three dimensions like giant pinballs. (As Freddy says at one point during the first big dust-up, "oooooh... tilt. &lt;SLAM!&gt;) But then, expecting realism in a fight between two undead serial killers is kind of like expecting realism from a Monkees movie, so it doesn't really detract. Instead, you get the unstoppable object meeting the immovable post, and it's a lot of fun. And certainly a lot better than I thought it would be. ***</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Ever since the 1993 film "Jason Goes To Hell" (Friday the 13th 9) when Jason was sucked into hell and his masked remained on the ground, and unexpectedly Freddys glove pops out of the ground to grab the hockey mask and pull it down before it cuts to black with frddys evil laugh people were exciting to know that Freddy And Jason where about to be seen together and not know what to expect?<p>Well, Personally, After all these years of waiting, the feeling of wanting to see that had been almost forgotten and this film all of a sudden popped up and I was thinking it was somthing they should have done shortly after JGTH but never arrived, and IMO this movie is overdue and didnt deliver all as well as hoped for! but forgivness is found on the bonus discs as they explain that it took ten years and 17 scripts later to finally find one that would work!!<p>The disapointment for me was the effects I was hoping to see. When I heard the team who where doing the SFX was the same team who did the great death scenes in "Final Destination 2" I was really excited about what they could do with this film! But sadly the effects and killings where no where near as good and disapointed in alot of ways! but they still managed to create some awsome death scenes!<p>The plot you shouldve read or know about already is about Freddy Krueger who has been forgotten about, authorities have covered up any trace of his exsistance and the teenagers of Springwood have no idea who Freddy is! The ones who did know where all sent to a mental home and almost prison like kept there! Freddy has no power if no one is scared of him, he still has his ability to controll the dream world and enter nightmares but without any fear giving him power, he's weak and cannot do any harm. So he searches the bowels of hell ,so he says and finds Jason Voorhees who he reserects and sends out to spread the fear amongst the children and make them remember him so he can return to what he does as the dream demon!<p>At first things are going to plan, but one thing Freddy didnt count on or expect...Jason is more into killing then he is and Freddy cannot stop Jason from killing all of his suppossed victoms! And when Freddy is ticked and decides to throw Jason aside like trying to throw away a useless wrapper off a candy bar, he finds out that it is more harder then he could imagine, and the battle is on to see who is the better of the two? Is it Freddys quickness and smart witts? Or Jasons strength and stamina? youll have to see for yourself the outcome of the battle to see which winner kills all!<p>This movie of two of the screens biggest slashers locking horns is a decent movie! If your into slasher films then this one is ok! I personaly didnt find it scary, but thats me, and wasnt really satasfyd with waiting 10 years for it. but it wasnt all that bad! But i recomend you rent first, then decide if you want to buy it?<p>The bonus features, features some cool stuff, but not really memorable IMO. One thing i was particuly disapointed about was somthing i saw just before the movie was released with a behind the scenes look on the film, and England and Jason where in an interveiw and Freddy was muckign around acting silly saying he could have gone up against a 1 foot doll (chucky) or that Michael Myers guy ..what is he a mime? Englad said... it was funny. But all in all, its pretty packed with worth while material!<p>For those of you who have the DVD and havent found these yet, then i'll tell you where some hidden eggs are!(all on disc 2)<p>1. go to THE PRODUCTION, go to the second page of it, highlight "development hell" and press the RIGHT arrorw (->) you should see some slash marks highlited now? press enter! you will get a few minutes of the making of a scene at the end of the film!<p>2. go to the deleted scenes submenu, highlt the arrorw at the bottem that points right, and then press up(^) and you should get another one of those slasher markings, press enter! you will get an interveiw about a proposed ending to the film that didnt get used!<p>3. go to the production, then go to VISUAL EFFECTS, on the next screen press right(->) and select those slash marks again and you will see a computer made story board of a scene!</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>It has taken more than 10 years to get this promised pairing of horror icons Freddy Krueger (of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET fame) and Jason Voorhees (bemasked killer from the FRIDAY THE 13th sequels) to the silver screen, but the waiting sure has paid off.  Director Ronny Yu and screenwriters Damian Shannon and Mark Swift stay faithful to the established origins of both characters, yet they still manage to merge the two cinematic mythoi in a way that seems logical and uncontrived.  They have also peopled modern-day Springwood (Freddy's original stomping grounds) with fresh meat for the two serial killers to pursue, but most of these new characters are not the cardboard cutouts that are usually found in lesser slasher-flick fare.  Instead, the audience is offered three-dimensional characters that, with all their human foibles, are familiar, likable, and easy to relate to.  When the audience can identify with a character, it makes it all the more terrifying when the killer comes for 'em.  And gettin' terrified is what these two horror franchises are all about.<p>The basic plot: Nightmare fiend Freddy has surreptitiously and deceitfully enlisted the aid of Jason to help him spur the memories of the kiddos he once terrified in the quaint little suburb of Springwood.  If he can awaken images of himself in their memories, Freddy reasons, he will again be able to inhabit their nightmares and thereby continue his acts of terror and murder in the realm of Morpheus.  But Jason is no yes-man, and he has a deadly agenda of his own.  Eventually, this difference of philosophy leads to a showdown between our two prolific homicidal maniacs and....<p>As is the norm in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series, a lot of gallows humor is thrown into the mix, which should definitely please fans that back Freddy in this monstrous match-up.  And those who root for Jason will be pleased to see that the ol' boy is still his reticent, esoteric self--and just as adept as ever at wielding that machete.  Add in the outstanding special FX and make-up work, the good acting, and the occasional bare female breast, and Yu and company have cooked up one "killer" of a movie!<p>The outstanding two-disc DVD set is a slasher-flick lover's wet dream.  Disc one offers a beautiful anamorphic widescreen transfer of the print, a feature commentary from the director and the two principal actors, and an amusing Jump-to-a-Death chapter-select option.  Disc two is chock-full of other wonderful extras, including deleted and extended scenes (with optional commentary), behind-the-scenes featurettes, FX featurette, trailers, and more.  Definitely a must-own for fans of the two horrific franchises, as well as for aficionados of the horror genre in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Freddy Krueger is in hell and he's come to the realization that everyone has forgotten about him and the legacy he had left behind when he died. So he formulates a plan to get people to remember and fear Freddy once again, but he isn't strong enough to do it alone. He resurrects Jason Voorhees by pretending to be Pamela Voorhees and tells Jason to go to Elm Street. Once there, Jason does the dirty work and Freddy Krueger's name starts to spread. The more fear that spreads, the stronger Freddy gets. Things seem to be progressing in Freddy's favor until Jason unintentionally steals a kill from Freddy and winds up setting the stage for a battle between two horror icons that fans have been anticipating for at least a decade.<br /><br />After so much buildup and fans waiting so long for this epic confrontation to take place, there really was no way it could live up to the hype. With that being said, it isn't a terrible film. Just disappointing. It really feels like more of a Nightmare On Elm Street film than a Friday the 13th film. So, right off the bat, that gets to me since I wasn't a big fan of the ANOES franchise and I'm completely biased towards Friday the 13th as a whole. Jason is also suddenly afraid of water and emotional, which hurts the character overall. While this may be the biggest Jason to date, he certainly comes off as the weakest. Freddy seems to be two steps ahead of Jason throughout most of the film, as well. While it makes sense overall, the F13 fan in me would've liked to have seen Jason have a bit more control offensively in the film. Overall, I think the most disappointing factor of this film is that a sequel never materialized even though the film did fairly strong numbers at the box office and on DVD. A few of the endings that were scrapped would have been amazing compared to the inconclusive one we wound up with. It's just a shame because a follow up is nothing more than a dream sequence at this point.<br /><br />Rating - 5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>Sort of a gore fans' version of what King Kong vs Godzilla is to monster movie fans.<br />For what this movie is, a violent slasher movie of epic proportions - the meeting and greeting and beating of two slasher icons. Freddy vs Jason to me was really entertaining. That is all this is meant to do, it is for fans of the gore and slasher genre & watching these two bloody each other up. These movies don't need a heavy plot or deep characters or love interests, they are just for violence fans. Characters are just there to be fed to the real stars, Freddy and Jason. I enjoyed the blood bath fight scenes between the two and the action to me was satisfactory. As far as acting & plot - well these movies really aren't specializing in that aspect. These are for gore,violence & this case 2 horror icons going at it with a stab here and a slash there. Better than average in my opinion. I enjoyed this than most of the other Jason/Friday the 13th films and I am not really into the Elm Street series, but put the two together and I really liked it. The DVD is really a treat for this movie..well worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The long awaited bloody smackdown between razor clawed killer Freddy Kruger and hockey masked slasher Jason Voorhees manages to be both better and less than it could have been.  After spending over a decade in development hell and set to be handled by a handful of different writers and directors; New Line finally managed to set a release for the film.  The story surprisingly manages to combine both Freddy and Jason's stories, and director Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky) covers the film with a surprising heaping amount of blood and gore.  Freddy (Robert Englund, more lively in the role than ever before), trapped in Hell, manages to use mindless killer Jason to hack up and instill fear in the kids on Elm Street so he can pick up his old hobby.  Eventually, the two slashers face off in a battle that all of us already know how it will end.  Ken Kirzinger is bland as Jason; Kane Hodder was undoubtadly the best actor to ever don the hockey mask and his absence is very missed.  The rest of the cast, which includes the comely Monica Keena, Destiny's Child Kelly Rowland, and Jason "son of John" Ritter all breeze through the film with no problem.  The special effects and makeup and gore are almost top notch, although some of the CGI is incredibly lame.  All that aside though, Freddy VS Jason is definitely worth seeing for longtime horror buffs of both franchises, although many might not enjoy it as much as others.  New Line's Platinum Series DVD is yet another special features packed set from New Line, and is a definite must own for afficiandos of both series'.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>Who knew?  Elm St. is like 10 miles from Camp Crystal Lake, and you thought your neighborhood was bad?  Do you think Jason ever wandered into town to just get away from it all?  His hockey mask is now considered a throwback so he has the kids cheering for him.  Freddy has all the quippy one-liners and that snazzy hat.  How can you lose with this one?<p>It has everything you would expect!<br />Gratuitous shower scene<br />Girl falls down in woods, then just waits to get killed.<br />Bumbling town sheriff<p>Young whipper-snapper deputy that is all gung-ho<br />New inventive ways to kill and get killed<br />Jason still just walks - you could be a cheetah and he'd still walk and get you.<br />Freddy's make-up is still bad.<br />Yet another culmination on the same pier in Crystal Lake.

Fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Freddy vs. Jason (as in Nightmare on Elm Street Part VIII and Friday the 13th Part XI, all in one) sheds light on a pair of familiar, though not too friendly, faces: that of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.  Freddy, who has successfully been forgotten by the community he has been terrorizing, uses Jason as a means by which to implicate himself in a series of gruesome murders, hence allowing him to return in people's fears and subsequently their dreams.<br /><br />Things become a little complicated when Jason becomes a tad overzealous and Freddy gets a little bit jealous ...<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the acting, and the dialogues are all very good.<br /><br />Monica Keena is delightful as Lori Campbell and a little "exposure" would have been pretty nice...<br /><br />In a nutshell, Freddy vs. Jason is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I mean wow.<br /><br />Alright, now  this movie just seemed to take the standard style like scream and all the rest.  Luckliy the story has it's own unique type of feel to get you mildly interested throughout the film. I mean it is just bearable and then the final fight happens.  This was easily one of the stupidest things of all time.  Well shot, no doubt, btu just retarded.  I mean come on, after like slicing Jason up like 150 times, if he doesn't die, wouldn't you at least start going for his head?  But somewhat fun just like the whole movie was.<br /><br />Ronny Yu talks about Rocky in the interviews on disc 2.  Also some deleted sces, good featurettes and other goodies in this 2-disc set.<br /><br />Now the commentary was outstanding.  I have never had the oppurtunity to listen to a hong kongt director's commentary.  Beign a huge asian film fan, I actually enjoyed this more than the movie.  And it wasn't Ronny that made it great, Robert Englund is just hilarious.  SO they try to gloss over how bad the movie is but still very enjoyable.<br /><br />I  give the movie a 2 and the special features a 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>I remember first getting into the Friday the 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street movies. They were never scary, but the theme of a bunch of na?ve teens having to combat an undead supervillian never grows old. I've always been a bigger fan of Jason in all honesty, preferring his 'silent but violent' approach to Freddy's 'make 'em laugh to death' style, but both series of movies have their moments. You don't expect Oscar winning performances or scripts when you watch a slasher flick, do you? (if you do, you're an idiot) The characters of Jason and Freddy have become bigger than their own franchises...their fans watch to see their 'hero' (lol) appear on screen and cheer as they kill the deliberately stupid and poorly acting characters in a variety of original ways. Continuity has also worked quite well throughout the series too. I've seen one review on here complain that he is a 'hardcore fan' and that Jason's mask is missing it's axe-mark (from the end of Friday 13th part 3) and Jason himself is missing his blind eye. Such a 'hardcore fan' should have noticed Jason getting a new mask at the start of Part 8 (Jason Takes Manhattan), after his old one was split in half at the end of Part 7 (The New Blood) and actually being 'reborn' in Jason Goes To Hell. And as for Freddy feeding from souls, not fear...well, Freddy has been feeding from fear ever since the original 'Nightmare', when Nancy actually defeated him by not being afraid of him. But I digress...<br /><br />Freddy vs Jason, for all it's years in the making and various script rewrites is surprisingly good...my only misgiving with it (as a staunch Jason fan) is that it feels like much more of a 'Freddy' film than a 'Jason' one. But the best elements from both series are all present and correct...na?ve teens, intentionally exaggerated characters (unfortunately, most people view this as unintentionally poor acting and miss the point completely), deaths which are so over the top and savage that they're actually funny (think Itchy & Scratchy style violence) and an exciting climax which, as ever, leaves the film wide open for a sequel. It isn't the best movie ever made, and certainly isn't better than the best examples from the 2 series on which it's based (Friday 13th Part 6: Jason Lives is still a comedy-horror masterpiece in my opinion, along with the amusing demise of Johnny Depp, in the first 'Nightmare' film, lol), but it's very entertaining and has much respect for the history and legacies of both of it's 'stars', unlike Paul Anderson's utterly pathetic Alien vs Predator (possibly one of the worst films ever made). The critics that have completely savaged this film are the sort of people who did not like the other Freddy or Jason films (apart from maybe their first appearances). Freddy vs Jason is made by fans, for fans, and doesn't disappoint the true fans of either series at all. As I've mentioned before, it's infinitely more entertaining, and has a much more satisfying climax than Paul Anderson's AvP movie which is a real example of how a great idea can go belly up in the wrong hands.<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention is the possibility of a Freddy/Jason/Evil Dead crossover at some point...although everybody noticed the hand of Freddy drag Jason's mask down to Hell at the end of Jason Goes To Hell (which sparked the whole 'Freddy vs Jason' rumour), nobody seems to have noticed that in the same film, the Book of the Dead made an appearance, and the dagger from the Evil Dead movies was actually used to send Jason to Hell. Bruce Campbell vs the Krueger/Voorhees tag team?

What we get here is a lot of mindless action in a duel of the monster titans, and although Freddy retains his sarcastic reign, Jason comes across like a broken shell of a man, retaining none of his over power presence. What makes matters worse is the entire cast of onlookers & victims that mindlessly scream into the camera until you want them to shut up. Unlike its predecessors, the cast of young folk here are without charm, and for that matter, without coherence in their babble.<br />The major downfall here is you couldn't care less who survives, which makes the harrowing action around them completely meaninglessness in outcome. Therefore this movie fails at providing any real terror or even concern when putting these undesirables out of their misery could only be a benefit. Absolutely worthless venture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>seriously, way better! one thing I didn't expect to see was someone from Destiny's Child trying to act.

I was roaring with laughter at the scene where Jason is stalking some losers at Camp Crystal, then all of a sudden he recieves the call to go to Elm Street. Next scene: he's on Elm Street! What the heck? Did he take a cab?<br /><br />They overdid it on the metal music during the fight scenes, and the overall effect was very plastic. Not that I expected an Acadamy Award Nominee (though that would be cool...) but I was hoping they'd try and capture at least some of the darkness that made the early Friday the 13th installments decent.<br /><br />Or they could've just gone all out like they did in JASON X or LEPRACHAUN IN THE HOOD (both classics...) and summon the belly laughs, which they did do in several scenes.<br /><br />Dunno, this will certainly appeal to those who are into WWF and the last few Freddy films, but for those of you who were wondering if maybe, just maybe they reacptured some of the old flame...don't get your hopes up.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Kind of a terrible movie, but its cool battle scenes and cutting-edge special effects make it fun to look at.a companion film to both FRIDAY THE 13TH and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET,but FREDDY VS.

Freddy was given better scenes, if that is saying much. Also, Freddy's makeup was much better than the makeup job on Jason.<br />What is up with the annoying woman who played Jason's mother? She didn't even look like Betsy Palmer. I had to laugh at the kids with their glowsticks at the rave, and the cheesy dancing to the cheesy music. Also, The blood looks like red syrup. Why is it in all these movies they perceive psychiatric wards as places were people wander around in strait jackets and drooling?When they showed Jason as a child, what was up with the bad sound dubbing?

They aren't going for scary this time., They are just out to make a fun movie for fans to see. We all know Freddy had the scarier movie, but Jason is stronger so he'll definately win, because he doesn't quit, unlike Freddy. Jason is gonna win.

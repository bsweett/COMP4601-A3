When his father unexpectedly dies, Britt is thrust into his father's job -- a job he's unqualified for and doesn't take seriously.<br /><br /> To strike back at a father who may have been the toast of the city but was a cold, distant dad, Britt enlists the assistance of his father's automobile mechanic, Kato (Jay Chou), in some local vandalism.  Security cameras pick up their grainy images but the newspaper staff assumes the perpetrators are members of a gang.  Britt orders his staff to write about the unidentified culprit and give him a snappy name that will sell papers.  They call him "The Green Hornet."<br /><br /> Up until this point, the film isn't bad, and it promises some interesting dramatic moments balanced with action.  But director Michel Gondry goes the route of camp in gagging up every situation that follows, with Rogen's mugging and terrible acting undermining any attempt at a decent picture.<br /><br /> Rogen is a limited actor who has become identified with man-boy social-misfit roles.  In that capacity he's fine and has developed a fan base.  But he is clearly not action hero material.  He goes through the motions, recites the lines, and tries to look determined, but we never once believe his character as a serious threat to the bad guys.  His Green Hornet is a human cartoon doing everything but running off a cliff and remaining suspended in midair as he looks helplessly toward the camera.<br /><br /> Chou's Kato comes off as interesting, but he can't sell the comedic side of his role.  It appears he has all he can handle to deliver his dialogue in English.  There's no irony, no timing, and no sense of humor in lines meant to elicit chuckles.  In the action department, Chou is more effective showing off Kato's lightning-fast karate moves and proficiency at building amazing gadgets and equipping cars with gimmicky weaponry.<br /><br /> Satisfying the unwritten rule of action movies that in stature the bad guy must equal or even surpass that of the hero, Christoph Waltz plays Chudnofsky, the deadly crime king of the city.  In an opening scene that borrows the menace of Waltz's Nazi officer from "Inglourious Basterds," Chudnofsky shows that despite his mild-mannered appearance and soft-spoken voice, he is a formidable villain.  Equipped with a dual-barreled pistol, he is adept at knocking off upstart criminals, including James Franco in an unbilled cameo role, who threaten to muscle in on his turf.<br /><br /> Cameron Diaz plays a secretary hired by Britt shortly after he takes over at the newspaper.  Modeled on girl-Friday Pepper Potts in the "Iron Man" films, Diaz' Lenore Case has little to do that is significant to the plot and is present primarily for attractive window dressing in this testosterone-driven flick.<br /><br /> There are some good action sequences in "The Green Hornet," including one involving several cement mixers, excitingly staged car chases, and an improbable scene in which a severed car continues its rampage through an office building.<br /><br /> Humor is a tricky element in an action picture.  It has to be incorporated in measured doses to be effective.  The original "Superman" movie got it right, charming the viewer with gentle comedy without turning its superhero into the object of jokes.  "The Green Hornet" looks as if a group of drunk, rich fraternity brothers put it together, assuming their sophomoric approach was hugely entertaining.  When Hollywood throws its money into an ill-conceived project like this, it can only result in a dud.<br /><br /> "The Green Hornet" is rated PG-13 for violent mayhem and strong language.</p></br><a href="../users/AZAEJB1ECT9HC.html">AZAEJB1ECT9HC</a><br/><p>I watched The Green Hornet tv series with Van Williams and Bruce Lee when it originally played on ABC and always enjoyed it.  When I heard that Seth Rogen would be playing the Hornet in the movie version, I expected the worst. (Sort of like Will Smith in "The Wild Wild West," a horrendous fiasco that should have never been made.)  I went to see this film in the movies and was pleasantly surprised: despite being silly at times, it turned out to be an entertaining film.<br />First of all, a little of Seth Rogen goes a long way and he can be quite annoying at times. (Hes much more down-to-earth in the special features.)  Jay Choi is good as Kato, the man who seemingly can do everything, Christolph Waltz is a riot as the villain of the piece and Cameron Diaz contributes nothing but having Rogen and Choi fight over her.  (Theres along and ridiculous fight scene between the Reid and Kato over Diaz that should have wound up on the cutting room floor.)<br />Whats great about this film are the action scenes and stunts which are terrific.  Theres an incredibly long chase and action scene between the Hornet's car, the "Black Beauty," and many heavily armed vehicles of the bad guys that goes on forever.  (This scene is even longer in the deleted scene segment of the special features.)  The car scene ends and another explosive fight scene continues in the offices of the Daily Sentinel, the newspaper owned by Brit Reid, the secret identity of The Green Hornet.  The stunts and action scenes were performed by legendary stuntman, Vic Armstrong and many members of his family.<br />Look, as stated, this film can be very silly at times and Rogen can be hard to take, but, for the most part, this is an exciting and enjoyable film.  The special features on the blu-ray are very good: deleted scenes, gagreel, features on the writing of the film, the creation of the "Black Beauty," the stunts, the special effect, etc. etc.  The picture and sound quality are terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>First Impressions:<br /><br />The Green Hornet is based on the original radio serials of the 1930s, predating Batman, yet has enough similarity to make audiences get in tune.<br /><br />This movie was a lot of fun for the most part -- millionaire playboy whose Dad (and now Britt) works at the Daily Sentinel, and has a partner (Jay Chau, Kato) and pretends he is a criminal when he is actually fighting crime.<br /><br />On the Radio:<br /><br />So far, this aligns well with the radio show (except Kato in the radio show was Filipino -- but I digress), except the radio show was straight and this is a comedy. Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet is also the executive producer and the co-screenwriter so this is clearly his baby.<br /><br />I loved the fast cars, the incredible skill of Kato and the egocentric jerk that is Britt Ried! His egomania really gets on Kato's goat and they fight it out with each other -- a slapstick fight that was a bit boring I must admit.<br /><br />Lenore Love Interest:<br /><br />Catherine Diaz plays the secretary who through her criminology knowledge actually unwittingly helping them out with her explanation of gang profile. The subplot of a love triangle was not played up which is fine, since that was not the main theme anyway!<br /><br />The bad guy wants to control all of LA crime. He is paranoid and lives on a trigger. This guy is bloodthirsty and has no qualms about killing people who disagree with him.<br /><br />The impossible stunts, the over-the-top action and the crazy situations the Hornet and Kato get into is just as goofy a comic book-like movie as you can see. There's even panel shots!<br /><br />If you liked other similar films such as Rush Hour or even Lethal Weapon.<br /><br />End Credits Worth the Price!<br /><br />The ending credits play the original Green Hornet theme as composed by Billy May back in the 1930s, and we even listen to the singing of Jay Chau (Kato). Recommended for older teens and adults due to the over-the-top death by car and the gross methods of accidental and purposeful death!<br /><br />Fun film! A nod to Bruce Lee and coffee baristas everywhere, LOL!<br /><br />Michel Gondry ("Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind") directing from a screenplay by star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg based on the radio series created by George W. Trendle. The movie is played purely for laughs and should be taken that way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I've said it before, I'll say it again. January is a wasteland at the multiplex. The studios are too busy concentrating on award buzz for the films released in December. Some of these films receiving buzz may get a wider release in January, to capitalize on the nominations, leading to more box office, keeping the film current and viable until the big daddy of award shows, the Oscars. They simply don't have time to adequately promote a new wide release. For that reason, January (and early September) is a dumping ground; any film getting a wide release is a film the studio has zero confidence in. These films have been "delayed" a few times, or you might see a notice in the newspaper indicating the "studio declined to screen the film in time for a review". These are bad signs but generally good indicators you need to stay clear.<br /><br />For this reason, we have "Season of the Witch", "The Dilemma" and "The Green Hornet" hitting screens in our neighborhood.<br /><br />By late January, the fervor has cleared and they begin to release new films they have time to get behind, new films they expect to see generate revenue. It is generally safer to go back to the multiplex. "The Green Hornet", the new superhero adaptation starring Seth Rogen, Jay Chou and Cameron Diaz is being released in the middle of January. It presents a conundrum.<br /><br />Columbia Pictures must be trying to fill a void with a brilliant counter-programming move. Well, yes and no. There are a lot of reasons to think "Hornet" might be the exception to the rule. And it is better than most of the films released in January. But it is still not very good. And paying extra to see the film in 3-D sort of rubs salt into the wounds, making an OK film even worse. Don't even think of seeing this film in IMAX 3-D. It is not worth it.<br /><br />The first reason you might suspect the film will be OK? It seems to have been a passion project for Seth Rogen. He has been everywhere, promoting the film, he has talked about it while promoting other films, he lost a lot of weight to play the role, and he even wrote the script with his longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg. All of this points to a famous comedy star trying to break out of the confines of the genre and work in a new and exciting area. I am sure he saw Robert Downey Jr.'s current rise to uber-stardom as "Iron Man" and wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />Rogen clearly wants people to enjoy this passion project as much as he does. But there are certain things we expect from a superhero movie. You want a believable back-story leading to the hero's creation or emergence. You want great action scenes mixed with a little humor (maybe) to keep things moving. You want a believable, scary villain. The major problem with "The Green Hornet" is the mix of action and humor is completely, horribly off balance. Much of the film involves Britt Reid (Rogen) having discussions with Kato (Jay Chou), Lenore Case (Diaz) and Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz, "Inglourious Basterds") in which Reid takes on the laid-back persona Rogen has perfected and has a riff with his co-stars about something, anything. These moments almost seem ad-libbed and pointless. In fact, in many instances, the person Reid is having a conversation with doesn't seem to get or be in on the joke. This creates an odd disconnect; Rogen seems like he is trying to be funny, what he says seems like it should be funny, it would be funny in "Knocked Up" or "Superbad", but he is more often than not delivering these lines to a brick wall.<br /><br />Rogen is smart enough to realize he isn't going to be able to pull of the lion's share of the action. So they found Jay Chou, a Taiwanese actor, to play Kato. His action scenes are good. But every time he delivers a line of dialogue, it is almost painful to watch and listen to. I highly suspect he had a dialogue coach standing off screen feeding him the lines phonetically. What this doesn't do is help him understand the meanings of the lines. His performance is a bit like watching Robert DeNiro, Michael Phelps or January Jones host "Saturday Night Live". During every live segment, they read their lines from a teleprompter unable to infuse the dialogue with any meaning. They are all clearly out of their element and their comfort zone.<br /><br />The scenes between Rogen and Diaz are just confusing and painful to witness. Reid, a former playboy, openly ogles Diaz's Lenore Case, his new assistant. Every time they talk, Rogen begins the conversation with an awkward come on she ignores. This banter goes on for a few minutes before they get to the reason for the conversation. This happens every time they talk and it is never remotely funny. Even worse, there are similar scenes between Kato and Lenore, which are also painful, but for other reasons. Really, the dialogue seems like it was written by a twelve-year-old fan-boy for other twelve-year-olds. I half expected Rogen's character to say "ass" and then start giggling madly.<br /><br />Rogen realizes the villain needs to be scary and menacing. The writers address this in their typical way; the villain discusses the issue himself with others who question his effectiveness. This is actually an amusing idea and the funniest running gag in the film. When we first meet Chudnofsky (Waltz) he barges into the nightclub of a rival who criticizes his lack of scariness. But there are many examples throughout the film illustrating this Chudnofsky's ruthlessness. Yet, the villain still has a complex about it. The role is a balancing act. On the one hand, Waltz has to reveal the character's self-doubt, playing the part a tad seriously for us to get the joke. But he also has to be tongue-in-cheek throughout. Waltz achieves this balance and is the best thing in the film.<br /><br />For all of the exposition, all of the discussions in the film, there are quite a few things left unanswered, or not given enough attention or explanation. The most important of these would have to be why the Green Hornet feels he has to fight crime while portraying a criminal. They go so far as to make it look like the Green Hornet shoots Reid. There are a few scenes in which Reid talks with someone about a new aspect of his mission as the Green Hornet. They discuss a few options and then Reid latches on to one, smiles broadly and shouts, "That's it. Good job my friend". Rogen smiles goofily and they are off. It seems as though Rogen expects us to take his overt enthusiasm as reason enough for this idea or theory to exist. If these moments existed with other scenes depicting a better realization, they would work. Rogen's fan-boy enthusiasm is not enough. These moments seem intended to illustrate the Green Hornet's creation, but in reality they simply amount to a series of exclamations.<br /><br />One of the primary reasons I thought "Hornet" might be a surprise is the director, Michel Gondry. Best known for "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", Gondry is a strange choice to helm a super hero film. I was hoping the combination would be more strange-good and less strange-Ang Lee-"Incredible Hulk". His work is actually a little of both. There are a few strange, odd touches in the film. When Kato and Reid are fighting some street thugs, Kato kicks one and he goes flying over the trunk of a car. The trunk seems to multiply and extend almost as though Gondry is trying to give the impression of 3-D in a 2-D film. It is a fun, interesting sort of retro idea.<br /><br />Gondry wants to present a more realistic vision. At times, dust floats through the air highlighted by a ray of sunshine, at others, the sun causes light flares as the camera passes. Both of these touches make the film seem more real and personal, but they also obscure the 3-D elements in the film. If the 3-D added depth to the film, it wouldn't matter that the new process doesn't enhance the action. But it doesn't, so you kind of want, and expect the 3-D to help the action pop. But because Gondry seems to relish using corny, older techniques to give the illusion of 3-D, these moments lose any power they may have had.<br /><br />"The Green Hornet" is a disappointment and further proof you should stay away from any studio film receiving a wide release in early January.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>I agree with a couple of the other reviewers, the 1966 TV show had a better feel for the Green Hornet then this concoction. What the heck is this movie? I knew it wouldn't be that good when I saw the trailer with Seth Rogen hamming it up. The lure for me was, hey, it's a superhero movie that could potentially capitilize on a unique comic hero. Brit Reid was way too much of a clown. Nothing even closely emulated real life situations. Kato, with better material could have worked. It (the film) should have been called Kato! What a waste of my time.<br />  Let down again by another "hip" reconstruction of a superhero. Cameron Diaz picking up a paycheck, Seth Rogen being indulged, and blank charactors wanting to make something happen sums it up. If your into The Green Hornet, check out an old Now comic for an interesting take on it. Great audio but so what if I can't connect a film to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I have to say that all of the one-star reviews destroying the abomination that is THE GREEN HORNET has reaffirmed my faith in mankind...or at least the American movie-going public.<br /><br />I will admit I was a little skeptical when Michael Keaton played BATMAN in 1989, but that movie was a pleasant surprise.  No masterpiece, mind you, but Tim Burton's funky visuals and Jack Nicholson's daffy and sinister Joker made it worth seeing.<br /><br />But Seth Rogen as a superhero?  Come on!  He has all the charisma and star quality as the Grape Ape cartoon.  And which genius thought it would be a good idea to let Rogen help write this monstrosity?  His schtick was getting old in teen stoner movies!<br /><br />But reading all the reviews of people WHO LIKE SUPERHERO MOVIES who couldn't even finish THE GREEN HORNET has made me proud of my country again, like after 9-11.<br /><br />(I love how the recent commercials pushing the DVD release feature Rogen in only one shot.  Kato gets about three or four.  I think the car gets more.  That, ladies & gentlemen of the jury, is my last exhibit for this stinkbomb).</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>I really like Seth Rogan, But it felt like he was doing it by the numbers in the writing of the movie. Basically he takes the plot of the television series where a rich playboy, after finding out his father was killed by a hornet sting. We then find out that he is made the owner of the paper his father ran. He then turns to a crime because of his torrid relationship with his father so that he can use the newspaper to report on it. . He then sees some people in need of help, then turns on the other criminals. Basically he does bad stuff and then blames it on other criminals. I felt that aspect of it was really strange because he is basically committing crimes but getting away with it.<br /><br />I mean this series isn't nessacry Batman, Superman, or even Spider Man. It's one of those cult figures that goes under the radar and becomes something new for a audience. The show really lasted a short time, but it did bring Bruce Lee to us, but since Lee is gone, Chou took the reins and really shined as Kato. He showed off his talents by making us look at him in Awe as he did most of the stunts of the movie as they were nothing. He has a remarkable talent and I hope he is in future films that can also show what he is all about. The writing was all over the place in the movie, it felt like it had no direction and the dialogue was just plain ok.  Also, the direction by Gondry was some of his best, showcasing his music video skills, and implementing them into the film. It was a fun to watch movie mainly because of the stylistic direction. But the one big problem I had with the film was based on two actors. One underused, and one that was useless. Cameron Diaz, who I dislike, was in this film but yet she had no place, no big moments, and not anything else. I feel she was just here for us to look at her sagging face while Rogen cracked a joke. SHe was just a waste of space.<br /><br />The villain, Waltz, was not a villan at all. I mean what is it with writers and underwhelming villans? I mean there was one in Knight and Day, Mission Impossible 3, and numerous other movies that have been released in the past 5 years. Waltz is better than this movie, the man has a Oscar to his name yet he is doing movies like this that made me shake my head at the absurdity of it. He's a good actor, but he needs to pick better roles, and quit phoning it in.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this film was a mess, but it was watchable in some parts enough. I get the feeling people were just seeing it because they got sick of seeing True Grit or numerous other movies that have been out for almost a month. The film is not that good, but I expected it to do well, and I commend the movie studio for their thinking.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>If you happen to hear the sound of a high pitched whistle just as you're about to hit your DVD play button be forewarned. A bomb is about to explode on the television screen. This bomb I'm speaking of can be more easily identified under the alias 'The Green Hornet'. Yes, this film IS that bad! Who would have ever thought someone would portray a superhero in such an unlikeable fashion that the audience would absolutely hate him? I wouldn't have thought it possible but then what do I know.<br /><br />Obviously something went horribly wrong during production. They didn't know whether they should play it straight or go with a comedy touch. The end result was neither. A word to Seth Rogen (aka: Green Hornet). Seth, green is not your color and if you ever don that mask again you may be forced to defend yourself off the screen as well as on it. As for the Hornet's trusted partner Kato (Jay Chou), he was the only redeeming part of the film. Thanks for trying your best to save this dud.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Hey man, wouldn't it be AWESOME if they did a superhero movie where the heroes were two childish jerks who really, REALLY hate each other?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />OK, man, then let me rephrase. Wouldn't it be COOL to have a superhero movie written and produced by that guy from "Knocked Up," and he's also the star, and he's the same jerky guy he was in "Knocked Up" plus he has this humongous sense of entitlement that comes from his being a billionaire from birth?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Oh, come ON, man, "The Green Hornet" rocks! Seth Rogen plays a real bully, which is cool because bullies are cool, and they have all these great explosions and car crashes and megadeaths that look like Michel Gondry brought Michael Bay in to direct for him, and Cameron Diaz is really, really mean in this but she's really, really sexy too so we're supposed to root for her as the heroine, and you gotta laugh at those idiots Christoph Waltz and Tom Wilkinson because they actually try to give (chuckle) PERFORMANCES! "The Green Hornet" is everything a movie SHOULD be, man! Just explosions and car crashes and a hero who really lords it over everybody! You GOTTA love it, man! You BETTER love it! You better love it or I'll STING you! BUZZ! BUZZZ! BUZZZZZ...<br /><br />SWAT!</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This film is a non-traditional version of the Green Hornet and is somewhat silly. The Green Hornet is a slightly overweight rich boy who was a playboy doing silly things. When his father dies, he pals up with his father's servant who made coffee for him, and decides to engage in even more difficult pranks, to become a better gangster than anyone else. His side kick is an expert at hand to hand combat, but the Green Hornet is little more than a bumbling fool. Thus, he is not a savior, but a foolish gangster.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I have NOT seen the entire movie, nor do I intend to. I just saw the last 20-30 minutes on TV.<br /><br />From what I've seen of this film, it's really bad. Though I know next to nothing about the character, except that it was later made into a popular television series starring Van Williams and Bruce Lee-launching Mr. Lee into superstardom herre in the U.S.-I can say that this movie does NOT do justice to the series, though I remember little about it. My idea of the character, be it right or wrong, is that it's supposed to be a straight-up story with absolutely little to no comedy (and if there is humor, it should NOT be crass, crude or vulgar humor), no cursing and minimal, non-graphic violence with a solid story that has plenty of action, suspense and drama. And absolutely NOTHING over-the-top, ala this idiot Rogen or Robin Williams (though he mostly does comedies and when he does drama, he's strictly serious, which is the mark of a good actor). I do NOT recommend this movie. This is a film that screams, "REMAKE." But it HAS TO BE a good one, faithful to the character.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"The Green Hornet" (2011) shown in 3D features Seth Rogen as Britt Reid who becomes The Green Hornet. He's the kind of over-the-top comic who can become very annoying and exasperating if you're not on his wave length. It helps if you have an adolescent fondness for zany and oafish playground humor. The real star of the movie is Jay Chou as Kato.<br /> Britt is a party animal who who lives a wasted existence until his tyrannical father, James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), mysteriously kicks the bucket via a bee sting. Britt inherits the family newspaper. When he meets his father's chauffeur, the brainy Kato who has designed fantastic cars, Britt decides to be a crime fighter, but to be different, he chooses to be a vigilante. With his inherited newspaper he can build up the Green Hornet as a bad guy. Kato builds a car, the Black Beauty, which has more gizmos, gadgets, and armament than any James Bond vehicle.<br /> Britt is a klutz, a know-it-all who knows nothing. He can't fight. He thinks he's great, is an egomaniac who after Kato beats up a gang of toughs tries to take the credit and denigrate his sidekick, but Kato has spunk and won't sit back and be a flunky. Kato is a terrific martial arts fighter and seems to have super powers. He can whip up elaborate inventions in a few days. He's the muscle and brains of that outfit.<br /> Britt thinks he can get any woman he wants, but he better look out for Kato. The movie has a love interest, but you'll be surprised at who ends up with the girl.<br /> There's way too much mayhem in this, and the car violence gets tiresome. The Green Hornet seems to wipe out as many cops as bad guys.<br /> If this movie succeeds, I can see sequels lying in wait, but they could very quickly become tiresome just as this film does. Parts are boring and Rogen can wear down the moviegoer who's not on his whiny track. He's a comic playing a comic book hero, but playing the character for laughs can be dangerous. It's part of the crime-fighter and sidekick genre played for yacks more than kicks. There's some crude stuff not for kids.<br /> Britt as a youngster was humiliated when his father took his toy caped superhero doll and tore the head off it. So what does the boy-man do as his first super-hero stunt? He cuts the head off a statue placed in his father's honor at the gravesite.<br /> It's a goofy movie so be prepared. Get ready for lots of mad-cap action, wild car chases, explosions, yucks and jokes. There's a monumental fight between Kato and Britt. No one could possibly escape from that melee without bruises and wounds, but these two do. The villains chasing the fearless duo in the newspaper plant is a long scene that could be condensed. The film is too long and drawn-out and needs closer editing and tightening.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The Green Hornet is far from great, or even very good for that matter, but it has a few charms that I couldn't deny no matter how hard I tried. Seth Rogen is a weird choice for the lead role in any kind of action movie. He is basically just playing a slight variation of all the other lazy losers of his past films. He does get his moments to shine in the realm of comedy, but he is mostly overshadowed by the sidekick role, Kato, played by Jay Chou. He is by far the more interesting character, though he and Rogen do have a few moments of humorous interactions. Cameron Diaz seems to be here to just add a bigger name to the cast and even Christoph Waltz, so good in Inglourious Basterds, doesn't hit the right notes as the villain. It's kind of funny that my favorite scene happens within minutes after the start. I'll just say it involves an extended cameo from James Franco, who I had no idea was even going to be in the movie.<br /><br />I did appreciate the mixture of comedic relief to go along with the action, but I think the violence could have been toned down some. It seemed out of place. I mean, these "heroes" have a higher body count than the bad guys. I guess the Batman way of catching rather than killing the bad guys is just too much work when you can just spray them with bullets or stab wood stakes into their eyes. Yes, that does happen here.<br /><br />I must say that the large crowd I saw it with may have swayed my enjoyment to the more positive side. They laughed at almost everything. As I left the theater, most people seemed to be of the opinion that it wasn't outstanding, but that it was much better than they thought it would be going in. Those were my thoughts as well. Worthy of a future rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Well so much for a series of Green Hornet pictures.  This one effectively sunk the ship.  Tremendously talented cast is really wasted in this film.  I am going to have to lay the blame on Seth Rogen for this one.  As much as I like a lot of his other work, this film wasn't good.  The writing(by Seth) was not great, it went back and forth between comedy, action and thriller and failed on almost all levels.  There were some good ideas, but they never really played out in full.  The casting of Rogen as the hero was not good either.  He is in much better shape, but his acting skills just didn't work for this kind of film.  I never really believed in him.  I would say to give this a try when it comes on cable if you like some interesting action, but for the most part don't bother buying this.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>While I really liked this film, it definitely wasn't one of the best comic adaptations I've seen. Seth Rogen was efficient in mixing drama with humor, but the real star was Jay Chou as Kato! Britt Reid (Rogen) may be the main hero, but Chou owned this movie! Christoph Waltz (who took his hokiness to an entirely new level) was only OK as the villain, and Cameron Diaz was sort of a mere sidenote character. It's as if the writers (Rogen and friend Evan Goldberg) just said, "Well, I guess we have to put an attractive love interest in here somewhere." But her part -- which may seem integral -- could have been played by anyone and wasn't really all that important, as someone else in the cast could've easily brought to the table the knowledge that her character had. In fact, I wish they had gotten an actress a little younger (or at least around Rogen's age -- her 38 to his 27) and/or a little more unknown; Diaz just seemed all wrong for the part. Nevertheless, Rogen and Goldberg did a decent job with tackling a tough genre; say what you will but it's damn tough to write a decent comic movie adaptation. Definitely entertaining and well worth viewing!</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Much better than i taught after hearing all the negatives about this film.<br />Im sure the old series was more serious and better in lots of ways, but this<br />version tries to have fun, have action...have a bit of everything. One of the<br />problems is Seth himself,  great for some scenes, and stupid in others. He has to<br />let go some of the stuff he kept from the comedies he did. I have no problems<br />with Kato, he is always interested in inventing things and can kick ass pretty<br />good. The evil guys are bad but not as sadistical bad as some other. I did welcome this. And the movie cant be that bad as i did'nt fall asleep once looking at it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>My only recollection of the TV version of "The Green Hornet" is when they did a guest appearance on "Batman".  Robin(Burt Ward) fought Kato(Bruce Lee) to a draw(?!).  Kipnapped heiress Pinky Pinkston left an SOS for the Dynamic Duo in her alphabet soup.  The guest villain was the incomparable Roger C. Carmel as Colonel Gumm.  What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in "Inglourious Basterds" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz's "competition".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.  I love that Rogen took the material not too seriously but just serious enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this movie has a rich,spoiled brat with a D@#$#$^&^ for a father.he is no super hero.he does what he does for kicks.he's no mastermind.he has no cool moves.he wasnt zapped by gamma,chemicals or atomic energy.he has no powers.he claims to be the green hornet when, in fact,the guy he callsa he side kick posesses all of those traits.kado fights crime.kado is a super genius.kado is trained in the martial arts.so the spoiled rich kid funds all of the cool toys,like the weopon car,and takes all of the credit when the other guy is doing everything.<br />  honestly,im just pleased this wasnt just another horribly sick and duisgusting DC movie like "couroline","kick arse",or "watchmen".i dont know a lot about the green hornet comic book so i cant tell you if they followed the story right.<br />  on "myth busters",they proved that the tire blades would not work that well.they also proved that a car couldnt ride around with the back half missing.thirdly,they said the mounted machine guns could work but only at close range.but its a movie ,not a science test.so thats ok with me.<br />  so the green hornet is rich like batman,spoiled like a rich kid,wings it like kick arse and thats about it.its just hard liking a super hero who's such a dork all the time.now his buddy kado,they shouldve made the movie about him!i say skip this one unless you're really into comic books.it comes on the movie channels a lot.watch it there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>To keep it short and simple, this movie was not bad. Indeed the story could have been better and if I was choosing actors, I wouldn't choose so many of those actors that I saw in the movie. The criminal lord was laughable with his issues of being cool and scary and the green hornet himself was a joke. There was no clarification on the special vision that the Green Hornet and his sidekick used. I made many guesses, just to find myself there without any real answer. The first twenty minutes were dull, but the movie did get better.

Gondry makes great videos but here he looks like any other Hollywood flash director. The acting is flat out bad, but that's mainly the fault of the script, penned by the worst actor of them all here, Rogen. And that's quite a feat.<br /><br />How did this guy get this job? He can NOT act. He has ONE character. He's in almost every movie made lately, and every single cartoon it seems, and he plays the same guy in all of them, as here. Except that guy has NOTHING to do with Britt Reid! Rogen and his erstwhile writing partner in crime (and this movie truly is criminally bad) Goldberg penned one of the worst scripts ever here, trolling for cheap pointless laughs at every turn while trying to fashion a simultaneous bromance/action thriller, and failing miserably in every way.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz seems to be just laughing at how bad this is, as one imagines the whole cast was throughout the filming. It's embarrassing to watch, especially while realizing you paid money to rent it.<br /><br />All in all, a complete piece of trash redeemed only mildly by Chou and Waltz, who both somehow managed to be mildly entertaining amidst all of this self-congratulatory dreck ("Look Ma! They let me make a superhero movie!").<br /><br />I wouldn't watch this again if you paid me a hundred bucks. Seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>I cannot think of a word that truly describes exactly how BAD this film is. Seth Rogan adds absolutely NOTHING to this film. The story line is weak. It was like watching a Roger Moore era James Bond film with all the cheesy parts spliced in together.<br /><br />Jay Chou hopefully got his money up front. I wonder if he took this job thinking, "This will get me good exposure to Hollywood." He played a decent side kick in Cato.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz, let's face it, was an attempt to have some eye candy to distract you from how bad this film really is. Note to producers, she could have been butt naked and I don't think it would have made a difference.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, unless you have 2 hours to kill and there is absolutely nothing else to do. Do NOT watch this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The 2011 "Green Hornet" film opens with an arch-villain Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) gently asking (= threatening) a club owner and drug dealer "Crystal Cleer" (uncredited James Franco) to hand over the business to him. It is fun as the two actors know what they are doing, delivering delightfully scenery-chewing performances. To me the opening is the best part of the film. And the Green Hornet is not in it.<br /><br />Seth Rogen (who also co-wrote and co-executive produced the film) is Britt Reid / The Green Hornet. He first appears as a 28-year-old slacker of a Los Angels newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). Unlike most superhero films (or any films for that matter), they are not very likable persons. James is an arrogant and domineering father. Britt is just a spoiled son with no redeeming grace whatever.<br /><br />But you expect something happen to Brit, like character development. Not much. Seth Rogen remains unconvincing as the protagonist (was he?) throughout "The Green Hornet." He talks too much, but does little. What does he want to be, a crime-fighting hero or a self-conscious parody of the genre? Or just an annoyingly goofy playboy?<br /><br />Jay Chou fares slightly better as Kato. After all his character (once played by legendary Bruce Lee) can do something, like doing martial arts and making good coffee. Cameron Diaz appears as Lenore, newly-hired secretary and love interest, a thankless role made for the film's unnecessary romantic subplot. As to the actions, well, the action sequences are not great, not knowing when to stop. They lack rhythm and style. They break things a lot and that's all.<br /><br />Finally the film is directed by Michel Gondry. Those who expected (like me) a happy marriage of action/superhero genre and his imagination of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" will be disappointed. Like his previous feature film "Be Kind Rewind" something is not right about the film, as if he is not really allowed to show what he can do.</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>"The Green Hornet" stars Seth Rogen (Pineapple Express, Knocked Up), Jay Chou (True Legend, Curse of the Golden Flower), Cameron Diaz (There's Something About Mary, My Best Friend's Wedding), Tom Wilkinson (Valkyrie, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), Christoph Waltz (Inglorious Basterds, Water For Elephants), David Harbour (Quantum of Solace, appears on Law & Order TV show frequently), Edward James Olmos (Battlestar Galactica, Blade Runner), Jamie Harris (The Prestige, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events), and several others.  Story is based upon a party animal playboy who inherits his father's multi-million dollar newspaper company, and then teams up with a martial arts trained engineer genius who together fight crime and corruption.  "The Green Hornet" originates in 1936 as a masked vigilante comic book hero that was popularized by a radio series.  Since then there have been many, many remakes of the classic story.  This 2011 release with Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, and Cameron Diaz has all the necessary gadgets and action, as well as several well-known actors who are actually fairly convincing in their roles during the film.  Best part of the movie of course is the climax of battles that takes place inside the newspaper company building where the bad guys wage an all out war on the Green Hornet and Kato.  The movie has star power, but actually is fairly well done (instead of the typical famous cast of has-beens who think their name and a few lucky roles make up for a crappy performance), this time everybody in the film pulled their weight.  The sets made me feel poorer than a church mouse's servant, but hey, I enjoyed the film anyway.  Sort of like having pigs in a blanket and a coke.  A nice change from the ordinary.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>- Only the first 15 minutes are funny. The rest of the film is not. It's also boring.<br /><br />- The special effect is so so.<br /><br />- The acting is not engaging.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Myself, if I was the producer of a Green Hornet movie, I probably would have gone for a different flavor than the current Seth Rogan vehicle.  Likely, I would have aimed for an understated, cool 60's vibe (maybe even setting the movie in the 60's), with a cool jazzy score (lots of deep bass notes), snappy dialogue, and spare action (so it would really stand out when it eventually showed up).  But that's me.<br /><br />I do admit that the flavor/theme that the producers DID go for in the current film- namely, what if an irresponsible, immature buffoon and his only slightly more mature friend are suddenly driven to become superheroes- is also sort of interesting, and that the movie explores that angle entertainingly enough.  But for me, the incessant goofiness got a little old.<br /><br />On top of that, when the Green Hornet and Kato finally grow up a little and show some adult smarts and maturity, we're suddenly shunted into a huge, overwrought action sequence that takes up the whole last part of the film, preventing the movie from focusing on their new, less grating personas.  Regarding that last action sequence, again, I would have preferred spare, clever action (this isn't the Justice League, after all) rather than seeing the Hornet-mobile riding a service elevator up to the 40th floor of an office building and then tooling around a newspaper's editorial office amid automatic weapons fire from an army of goons.<br /><br />But again, that's just me, and I'm definitely not saying that the movie is shoddy or dull or poorly crafted.  It just chose an approach- broad humor, broad action- that some people will like more than others.  My wife, in fact, thought it was a refreshing change from the usual melodrama of other superhero movies.  Maybe you will, too.<br /><br />And, you know what?  Seeing that there are plenty of superhero movies that ARE done as straight-up (or mostly straight-up) dramas, like the current X-Men and Batman movies, I don't mind ALL that much that an occasional light, funny riff on this type of material, as seen in "The Green Hornet", comes down the pike now and again.  But let's keep it the exception to the rule, okay?  After all, do we really want to return to the old days of "Holy spaghetti and meatballs, Batman-- the Pasta King is loose in Gotham!"</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>What's good: Action, physical comedy, and a brief nod to Bruce Lee who had the Kato role all those years ago. (Watch the sketchbook.)<br /><br />What's not: Sane plot, Cameron Diaz, acting like a grownup. I mean, all those things are great in themselves, but they're just not used in this flick. (Diaz is under-used to a baffling degree - this could have been just her kind of flick, if they let it be.)<br /><br />Seth Rogen, in his role as the spoiled rich kid, is simply obnoxious. Except for the hefty paycheck, I can't think of a reason in the world for Kato to hang around and take the abuse. In fact, that abuse flows out of the screen and onto the audience. If that's what you want, humor a cut above jokes about passing gas, have fun. I shouldn't have bothered.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters<br /><br />PS: The recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG99QS">Tron</a> movie also has the "son inherits father's commercial empire" aspect, but that movie takes the premise and runs with it.

This leaves his playboy son Britt (Seth Rogen) to run the show.  Seth in turn is looking for a good cup of coffee which introduces him to an inventor and martial arts coffy maker Kato (Jay Chou). Out of boredom Britt and Kato come up with the Green Hornet thing. Lacking direction they pilfer ideas from criminology student Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz). Will their plans be foiled by a real criminal Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz)? Or will they be able to accomplish their goal? And does anyone get the girl?<br /><br />Great Green Hornet movie. Seldom do we get a movie with a beginning and an ending to match. There is emotion, action and depth of character.  With the exception of some rap music, the background and filler music matched the scene and did not overwhelm the dialog. There are plenty of car chases and structural destruction; yet in all of the mayhem there we do not see gratuitous blood and guts (maybe a few suggestive bullet holes.) Cameron may have been a distraction at first; however when she got down to acting you enjoyed watching her character.<br /><br />On the DVD media (that I watched) itself there are the standard coming attractions before the film and plenty of fairly new Blu-ray gimmicks that are not relevant to the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>In the sixties the comic book icon Batman was turned into a television series that was low on detective seasoning and high on camp. The show became so popular that it was soon followed by a spin off, The Green Hornet, based on the pulp fiction/radio show character from the past. The show never took off like Batman did, but it did introduce the world to martial arts expert Bruce Lee as the Hornet's sidekick Kato. Talk of a new film version of the series went on for years, even Kevin Smith the director of CLERKS was involved at one point. So fans were delighted to see the Hornet finally appear on the big screen.<br /><br />Seth Rogen stars as Britt Reid, the goofball son of publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). The senior Reid puts out The Daily Sentinel, a newspaper that prides itself on reporting the real news and focuses on the issues of crime that happen daily in Los Angeles. When suddenly dies of a bee sting, Britt is left in charge as well as left to finally grow up.<br /><br />Despondent at first and unable to fill his father's shoes, Britt turns to the man who took care of his father's cars and who made his coffee, Kato (Jay Chou). In Kato he discovers a kindred spirit; someone who loved yet felt much anger at his father and a man who feels a need for heroes much as Britt does.<br /><br />Through a misadventure in which they save a couple from an attack by thugs, the pair decides to take on crime in LA. Kato sets out pimping their ride, a car now armed to the gills with missiles, machine guns, a flame thrower and more. Then Britt turns the newspaper on its ear, insisting that they do extensive coverage of the Hornet, going so far as to come up with his name. The next thing they do is hire an assistant for Britt, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), who knows more about crime than he does, going so far as to predict what the Green Hornet will do next. In truth, her predictions become their directions.<br /><br />It seems that the entire criminal element in LA is run by one man, Benjamin Chudnovsky (Christoph Waltz), a bloodthirsty criminal who has made it his life's ambition to control crime from top to bottom. Chudnovsky makes a point of striking fear in those who would oppose him. And when the Green Hornet starts interfering with his operations, the Hornet becomes his number one target.<br /><br />So does it work? In some ways very much so but in most not quite. As with the recent GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, we're presented with a star that needs someone to rein him in, to mold him into the character rather than have the character twist into something its not. Rogen can be a great actor at times but here he tends to run wild and use certain mannerisms that he has in past roles, none of which tend to enhance the character of Britt Reid. Instead much of the movie has Britt as the same goofball he was when the film started except rather than party non-stop he behaves like a kid who finally gets the chance to play the hero. It would have been nice to see the change in Britt come about far earlier in the film than it does and to have left more of the comedy out. The story deserves more action and less comedy.<br /><br />Chou does a great job of presenting himself here. Pretty much an unknown in the U.S., he does a fantastic job of combining martial arts mastery with acting ability, much like Bruce Lee did when first starting out. The scenes with Chou feel more like the Green Hornet than do those with Rogen.<br /><br />The supporting cast seems just to be walking through. Waltz shows less of the menace in his character here than he did in INGLORIOUS BASTARDS. And Diaz seems to have such a minor part as to nearly qualify as a cameo.<br /><br />Much of the film comes together towards the last 20 minutes or so. It would have been nice to see many of the things that work well there happen 30 minutes earlier and the movie be taken a bit more seriously than it was. Instead, while entertaining enough, the film seems more like a Seth Rogen vehicle and less a comic hero film. Was it enough to garner a sequel? Doubtful, the box office wasn't stupendous, something Hollywood expects these days. If one does come about, let's hope they find a director willing to tell Rogen to rope it in and to play it straight for once. He has the ability, now he needs someone in charge to convince him of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>When I saw the trailer for this film a year ago, my heart sank! It looked like as disaster about to unfold right in front of me. I mean Seth Rogen! as the Green Hornet?!!! I didn't even run to rent this, but found myself with a free rental and nothing else looked interesting that I hadn't seen yet.<br /><br />To my surprise this film was very funny and even though purist will cringe at the liberties taken with the original story, this film is a refreshing goof on superhero films. First off, we have a hero who is delusional and so inept, that his "sidekick" is really the driving force behind all his power and intelligence. Kato played by scene chewing Jay Chou is the perfect balance for Rogen's flippant style and the two make for a very unconventional team, with a refreshing rapport that I haven't seen in these types of films before.<br /><br />I gave this film 5 stars because I think there are way too many 1 star reviews for this misunderstood action movie and maybe with a little push this film will be recognized for its witty and undeniable original take on the super hero movie. 4 stars for a jolly good time and making me eat my words!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>You know something is wrong when the worst character in "The Green Hornet" is The Green Hornet himself. As portrayed by Seth Rogen, we see a twelve-year-old trapped in a man's body, a bratty and talkative megalomaniac that does none of the dirty work and truly has no idea what he's doing. Rogen, who is also the co-writer and one of the executive producers, is not only tragically miscast but has also written his character badly; rather than a bold and debonair crime fighter, as he was in the original 1930s radio program, The Green Hornet is now a broadly defined goofball, a spoiled and whiny jerk who can do little more than say how cool something looks before getting his butt kicked. In the annals of pulp fiction, few characters have been this unlikeable, unimpressive, and cowardly.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that this "new" and "improved" Green Hornet sets off a chain reaction that brings down the rest of the film. This is bad because all the ingredients were there; Cameron Diaz was smart and sexy, Jay Chou was fast and fierce, the action was entertaining, the special effects were convincing, and for the first time in ages, the 3D process was full and immersive. For God's sake, they even got Christoph Waltz, who so effortlessly earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Inglourious Basterds." But when the best you can do is have the title character run away from a crime scene shouting, "Save me, Kato!" when he's supposed to be a ruthless vigilante, then something has gone terribly wrong.<br /><br />In the film, Rogen plays Britt Reid, the son of James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), the editor in chief of a Los Angeles newspaper called "The Daily Sentinel." Still upset over the death of his mother, and bitter over his father's constant disapproval, Britt lives his life as an irresponsible slacker who likes to drink, party, and embarrass his father by ending up on the front page of the morning newspaper. James dies unexpectedly, apparently the result of a bee sting; Britt must now take over as editor in chief, a position he's neither qualified for nor motivated to take on, mostly because he didn't get along with his father and is disheartened by the public outcry over his death.<br /><br />Even though he fired all of his father's staff, he rehires Kato (Chou) simply because he makes a damn fine cup of coffee. But Kato has other talents - he's an inventor and a mechanic, and I'll bet one of his creations is a time machine because there's no way a person can single handedly assemble a car so quickly. He also likes classical music, is skilled in the ways of martial arts, and possesses an inhuman ability to scan thugs and pinpoint their weapons. I will now skip a number of inconsequential details and get to the part where the two decide to become crime fighters. Their angle: They will wear masks, pose as criminals, and infiltrate the lairs of real criminals. In no time, Kato has rigged up a muscle car dubbed the Black Beauty with bulletproof glass, virtually indestructible steel, missiles, machine guns, and other various overkills. Kato then supplies Britt's vigilante alter ego with a name: The Green Hornet.<br /><br />Britt secretly relies on his newly hired secretary, the beautiful Lenore Case (Diaz), for tips on behaving more like a criminal, since she's a serious journalist with a degree in criminology. He creates his own publicity by publishing stories about The Green Hornet in "The Daily Sentinel," much to the chagrin of assistant editor in chief Mike Axford (Edward James Olmos). The articles catch the attention of Benjamin Chudnofsky (Waltz), a heartless Russian mobster who has control over all of the city's crime families. If you know what's good for you, you won't tell him he isn't scary, nor will you fumble pronouncing his name (an uncredited James Franco learns both lessons the hard way). Also alerted is Los Angeles District Attorney Frank Scalon (David Harbour), whose efforts to rid the city of crime have been undermined by The Green Hornet.<br /><br />I'm making this movie sound a lot better than it actually is. In the hands of Seth Rogen and director Michel Gondry, the fast-paced and entertaining plot is overshadowed by the jokey and immature antics of the main character, a man so thoroughly off putting that I found myself going against everything movies like this stand for and wishing his secret identity would be exposed. How often do we root for the sidekick instead of the hero? "The Green Hornet" makes it impossible to do otherwise; Kato is smarter, braver, more skilled, and way more charismatic than Britt ever was. What a mockery of character and tone. Rogen can be a good actor (see "Funny People"), and he can also be a good writer (see "The Simpsons" episode "Homer the Whopper"), but here, he errs, and he errs badly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>My time is precious and I won't hesitate to salvage every minute I can instead of wasting another second on such a fowl film!<br /><br />The Green Hornet had the feel of a TV sitcom.

If they're not, right about now, there's a chance that they're spinning around in their caskets. But if they're still with us, they're probably furiously digging a grave for Seth Rogen, a disrespectful gent what just torpedoed the Green Hornet franchise. If you're a fan of the 1960s television series with Van Williams and Bruce Lee - or even if you're a fan of the 1940 serial with Gordon Jones - this new adaptation may find you grinding your teeth. Of course, you may have the same reaction even if you're not familiar with the Green Hornet.<br /><br />Some things change for the better, but this adaptation makes a case for entropy. Feckless playboy Britt Reid has just inherited his murdered father's crusading newspaper, the Daily Sentinel. Reid's alter ego, the Green Hornet, updated to these contemporary times, is still the scourge of the criminal underworld. He's still viewed as a villain by the police and the general public, which is all part of the plan as the Hornet had, from jump, meant to pose as a lawbreaker (and I actually find his reasoning for this logical as hell). This time, his purview is Los Angeles and his main villain an underworld crime boss who touts the hard-to-pronounce name of Chudnofsky. Chudnofsky, by the way, agonizes over his image, which he worries may not be intimidating enough. This becomes a running gag throughout the film and eventually results in Chudnofsky's assuming his own costumed persona, but a lame one. Behold Chudnofsky as he becomes... Bloodnofsky. Everyone must now cower.<br /><br />What were they thinking, the powers that be? That to properly revive a once popular pulp hero, it required a comedic swerve? Seth Rogen is absolutely wrong for the Green Hornet role. And since Rogen gets co-writing and co-producing creds here, much of what happens onscreen has to be laid at his feet. A touch of humor is always welcome and appreciated, but only so far as it services story and plot and even characterization. The Green Hornet ain't supposed to be frivolous and silly like the Mask. You couldn't tell that in this movie.<br /><br />Even more egregious than the off-putting comedic tone is Rogen's choice of how Britt Reid is portrayed. His Britt is abrasive and buffoonish, which I guess is okay to start with. But as the movie went on, Rogen doesn't do or say anything to redeem his character or make him more appealing. He starts out obnoxious and then treads water. And this Britt Reid, he's not even clever. No wonder he becomes envious of Kato.<br /><br />Speaking of, one of the film's few saving graces is Jay Chou as Kato, inventor extraordinaire, expert kung fu master, and Britt Reid's right hand man. Kato is clearly the brains in this operation, and this eventually becomes a source of tension between the two. There are some rough patches in which you can't make out what he's saying because of his thick accent, but Chou carries himself well. Kato's resourcefulness and his fight scenes are the film's highlights, although the one knock against his fight scenes is that there was this clear catering to 3D, and so we get those extraneous special effects.<br /><br />Some other saving graces? I thought the Hornet's Black Beauty - a sleek 1965 Chrysler Imperial - was awesome. And the gas gun. And, okay, I did appreciate the exploration into the hero-sidekick relationship, and the neat swerve of the sidekick being ridiculously more capable than the lead hero.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz comes in as the eye candy that drives a wedge between the Hornet and Kato. Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos spend their time onscreen avoiding eye contact with their self-esteem. What does it say about the film when the best moment it offers may be when the Hornet and Kato are in their tricked-out ride singing along to 2Pac's "Gangsta's Paradise"? Or, wait, maybe the best scene is the one in which Britt Reid tries to come up with a code name for his new alter ego, and he arrives at "the Green Bee." Or maybe that's just wishful thinking. Because THE GREEN BEE may have fared better. It doesn't come with the baggage of nostalgic expectations. Somewhere, Nicolas Cage is still marveling over his good luck. He abandoned ship just in time.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff (which features Seth Rogen's incredibly annoying laugh): Audio Commentary by Seth Rogen & co-writer Evan Goldberg, director Michel Gondry, and producer Neil Moritz; the "Awesoom" gag reel (00:07:19 minutes long); "The Black Beauty: Rebirth of Cool" - a segment focusing on the Green Hornet and Kato's ride (00:07:19 minutes); and a segment in which co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg discuss their writing of THE GREEN HORNET (00:10:36).</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Seth Rogen is a funny guy as we all know.  The idea behind the re-making of "The Green Hornet" in this smug, part humor part action is nothing new.  Not even for Rogen.  Remember "Pineapple Express"?  Well, this is no "Pineapple Express".  In fact I'm more reminded of the 1960's "Batman" TV series with Adam West.  Yes, I laughed a few times but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with taking comic book heroes and converting them into jokes.  And if you're going to do it, maybe a more anonymous hero(s) would work better.  In fact, how about "Kick-Ass" which is much better?  Anyway, this feature falls into familiar territory.  Short fights with plenty of adversaries, long fights that should have ended with 1 punch (Kato & Hornet) and a ridiculous finale that defies any reality.  The filmmakers obviously had a big budget and damn, I suspect they used every bit of it, but in the end, the film doesn't hold up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>The Green Hornet seemed like it was fighting an uphill battle as soon as it went into development. Most projects that were either influenced by Bruce Lee or are trying to continue a story he started just turn out to have disappointing and unfortunate results. The Green Hornet lost Stephen Chow shortly after it was announced he would direct and star in the film while many didn't think Seth Rogen was the type of guy who could do an action film. The main villain role was originally intended for Nicolas Cage before he eventually dropped out. With its release continually being pushed back and critic and early screening reception being practically nonexistent many wondered if The Green Hornet could just pull off not being a total disaster. Despite all of its issues, The Green Hornet is actually an extremely humorous and entertaining thrill ride.<br /><br />Stephen Chow was replaced with Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunsine of the Spotless Mind, Be Kind Rewind) and his unusually artistic and spectacular visual style does get put on display on more than one occasion. Two of Kato's fight sequences, Britt's thought process in the Chinese restaurant, and the screen being split into multiple segments after a bounty is put on The Green Hornet's head are all great examples. Gondry usually manipulates scenes in extraordinary ways. In Kato's fight scenes, one car suddenly becomes a dozen while floating heads transition one scene to the next while Britt is in the restaurant. The great thing is his style works really well within the world of The Green Hornet.<br /><br />The cast is a serious plus, as well. Seth Rogen brings a lot of the comedy he's become associated with, but juggles the action aspect fairly well. Rogen isn't exactly a stranger to action as Pineapple Express had its fair share of it. I seriously loved Pineapple Express, so him being The Green Hornet wasn't as bothersome to me as it was to others. Jay Chou is no Bruce Lee, but he's an entertaining Kato nonetheless. There were a few smaller roles that are worth keeping an eye out for. Edward Furlong is around long enough for you to say to yourself, "Wasn't that the kid from Terminator 2 and American History X?" Indeed it was, sir or madam. Indeed it was. James Franco shows up and gives a hell of a speech, as well. After seeing him in something like 127 Hours, it's amazing seeing him not only jump back and forth between genres but give such exceptional performances in everything he's a part of. Then there's Christoph Waltz whose Chudnofsky character seems to be just as fun as Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. Chudnofsky is funny in a twisted kind of way, maniacal, and misunderstood by everyone around him while Waltz seems to slip into the character with ease.<br /><br />One of the more interesting and unexpected aspects of the film was the way certain things in the film were connected. Only the simpler things seem to come to mind now; Britt being interested in saving people at an early age, how The Green Hornet name comes to fruition, the one thing Kato can't do, and DA Scanlon's true motives. It all just comes together really nicely while little things are connected to the big picture and revealed later on. The Green Hornet isn't the best written piece of film, but everything flows really well and is put together in a way that'll surprise many who expect this to be nothing more than popcorn entertainment. There's even a brief nod to Bruce Lee in there.<br /><br />If you hadn't noticed, Cameron Diaz has yet to be mentioned in this review. While her character is important to the storyline, Diaz isn't. Anybody could have filled her shoes. When she first shows up on screen, the woman next to me said out loud, "What's she doing here?" It was pretty hilarious since I was pretty much thinking the same thing. She doesn't have much screen time either. Christoph Waltz was around more yet she received top billing after Rogen and Chou. It just seems kinda weak even if she is the bigger star.<br /><br />The film gets kind of rough towards the end though when it comes to special effects. While certain ridiculous things are shown in a light that almost make some of them seem feasible, the CG and green screen work is really noticeable during the conclusion of the story. It doesn't necessarily ruin the film, but it hurts it a little.<br /><br />The Green Hornet is really a hell of a way to kick off the new year as far as movies go. It's an amusing and exhilarating thrill ride from beginning to end while its solid and well-rounded cast in addition to the film having a surprisingly well-written storyline is just icing on the cake. The Green Hornet is just a fun film that can pretty much be recommended to anyone. So the next time someone asks if The Green Hornet is actually a good film, be sure you reply by saying, "That's a bingo!" (sorry, I had to)</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>Seth Rogen shines early, and the premise is promising, but so much of this movie just plain doesn't work.  Every other character seems false and about as 3-dimensional as cardboard.  Diaz and Chou both seem lost or characters from another movie.  Waltz's arch-enemy character is lame and how on earth did the editors decide that 2 hours of this would be a good idea?  You could edit it down to half that easily.  Just a big mess that had me checking my watch incessantly through the last half.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>What's not to like about The Green Hornet? Yes: a rhetorical question.<br /><br />Well, it's big, it's loud, it's daft, it's funny and it's utterly preposterous. Will you, if you're a normally adjusted adult, be entertained? Yes, you will.<br /><br />Seth Rogen, as you'd expect a seasoned stand-up to, aces every line for comic effect in his performance as Britt Reid, millionaire newspaper heir and crime-fighting party animal. He has a barista black-belt, martial arts-toting sidekick called Kato with a garage full of bad-ass souped up Camaros (pedants: they're Chrysler Imperials, but they *sound* like Camaros, and I want one - with or without rocket launchers). Indeed, Kato is so competent that he presents a plot dilemma: Why does he even need the Green Hornet in the first place? He can do Bruce Lee's one inch punch. He can design sports cars. He even knows how to make those funny fern leaves in the froth on a cappuccino. And he shows us: bonus.<br /><br />The film also boasts Cameron Diaz, with all that implies including, as her standard terms and conditions of engagement apparently demand, an entry in which she winsomely sashays in and wallops the camera with a shameless "it's me! Cutesie Cameron Diaz!" gurn. The producers failed to accompany this, as their contractual obligations surely require, with Gary Wright's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002KFV">Dream Weaver</a>, which no doubt led to some anxious exchanges with her agents and lawyers when they saw the rushes. Still, comedy was extracted (bravely, from Diaz' perspective) from the fact that her character, at the tender age of 36, is knocking on a bit. (Diaz is 38!). But not to the point where more couldn't be extracted from Rogen's covetous glances at her backside.<br /><br />Yet at the same time The Green Hornet has a body count, some cheerily gruesome deaths and a wanton demolition quotient that reaches back in time past Bruce Willis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4HIY0">Die Hard</a> franchise and yearns for mid-eighties Arnie Schwarzenegger prime carnage. So: it will definitely go over well with the boy racers and even the rest of the cinema-going constituency would have to be a bit churlish not to be swept along. Which isn't to say some of them won't be.<br /><br />There is, of course, stuff not to like, but much of that falls squarely in the sour-puss cinema snob category. But here it is, for the record:<br /><br />Firstly, the film has evidently had a difficult midwifery. It has been optioned on and off since 1990 and has had more directors, producers, screenwriters and actors "associated with the project", many walking out as a result of "creative differences", than most films not directed by Alan Smithee, and even the release of this final version seems to have been plagued by delays (who orchestrates the global release of a film a week after schools have gone back in January? Were they that scared of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037KMHRY">Tron Legacy</a>?)<br /><br />Furthermore - and yes, this is a pet, well, bee in my bonnet but I'm going to say it anyway - this film is in 3D and it absolutely shouldn't be, save for the closing credits and one classy Brian De Palma-style split screen sequence when, oddly, each "screenlet" was actually in 2D, just arrayed differently in 3D space. Otherwise, there really wasn't much call for, or use of, 3D, and it didn't look much good, to the point where I wondered whether it was added in post production, a la the train wreck that was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1BQ">The Last Airbender</a>. A subsequent browsing of the blogosphere would suggest this is indeed the case.<br /><br />There's also the possibility that venerable superhero lore is being permanently trashed here. The original Green Hornet radio series is ancient: it predates Superman by a couple of years and, from what I can tell, it was rather earnest fare with less enduring legacy than Superman, and this big budget farce, which upends it in every conceivable way, may consign it forever to oblivion. A more reverend take may have been more interesting: Even the 1960s TV series, in which Kato was played by a young Bruce Lee, might have been a better setting (opening up the possibilities of some Mad Men styling) than the rather dull, present day. Indeed, modern technology presents some plot difficulties with which the screenwriters failed to adequately deal: armed with the critical MacGuffin, a USB drive full of incriminating evidence, our heroes race across town, batman style, to their newspaper offices to post it to the internet. Er, come again? You have a custom built rocket propelled car, but you don't have wifi?)<br /><br />In any case, it sounds as though every possible approach has been tried and rejected, and at the end of the day what we're left with is a pretty entertaining night at the movies. And that, I dare say, is what the Studio was aiming for. Rogen was candid enough about that on the red carpet in Los Angeles this evening: Asked if there would be a sequel he said, "I would definitely be open to it, but until the movie makes a lot of money we haven't really thought about that".<br /><br />Remains to be seen. But well worth a look in the mean time, if you need cheering up on a cold January day.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>That's right. It seems as if it is being forgotten why exactly we go to the movies... to be entertained. To go to a movie and watch it and have fun. Not every movie is meant to be Academy bait, and as much as I love a good Oscar bait flick as much as anyone, I also like to go to movies that are supposed to be brainless fun- after all, that's why I go to movies, right? As a form of scape. Ah, but it's not like the elitists know how to have fun anyway, because after all The Green Hornet- No me likey superheroes!!! Me likey psychotic lesbo ballerinas!!!!!<br /><br />That said, I will admit I was a tad skeptical- I wasn't very immersed in the Green Hornet world as I did not grow up with it, but the trailer looked fun and I was excited to see it, so my buddy and I went and saw it today. And I walked out colored had-fun!!! Like I said, I knew absolutely nothing about Green Hornet when I went in, as I had went to see it not based on nostalgia but entertainment alone, and I got what I wanted- a fun old, funny, quality time at the cinema that was full of laughs and action. So maybe I lose credibility there as I wasn't a fan before the film. But now I can confirm that my childhood already good childhood would be MUCH better if I grew up with Green Hornet!!!<br /><br />BrittReid has had a troubled relationship with his dad ever since he was a young one. Now grown up and an heir to his dad's newspaper The Daily Sentinel, he always thought his dad was a selfish jerk, and his dad being found dead from a supposed bee sting doesn't make it better. Being left the newspaper and meeting his coffee maker for the first time after firing him, named Kato, Britt is under pressure. But Britt and Kato begin to bond after Kato shows some of the 'wares, and one night after stealing the head of the golden statue of his dad and kicking some butt, they decide with Kato's technology and Britt's motivation- it's time to be superheroes.<br /><br />But they aren't the superheroes you'd wake up every Saturday morning and tune to your cartoon channel to watch. No, they are way different. They protect the law... by breaking it. Furthermore, the Sentinel dons them the name "The Green Hornet", and they find a villain- Chudnofsky, a man with a hard name to pronounce, who is a Russian mobster who plans to bring together LA's mob families.... and the man that Britt's dad was planning to expose!!!<br /><br />I will say one more time that I am surprised that we've forgotten how to have a good time at the cinema! Sure this film isn't going to win any Oscars and bait gleaming reviews from the critics- one particular offender being Roger Ebert. But then again I stopped taking him seriously years ago, so not much I can do there, besides he gave Country Strong a positive review. This film is fun, and what's all you need to expect!<br /><br />It's full of action. It's full of thrills. It is overexaggerated and it's unrealistic as hell. But that's the point! It's a superhero movie people. None of you complained when in The Dark Knight, Batman fell a great height from the party in the building, survived without a broken bone. The action scenes are awesomely well done, with great use of slo-mo, and even in 3D, the "Kato-vision" scenes looked awesome. The fight scene in the middle between Kato and Britt that goes on and on was probably the funniest scene, as you'd expect to get tired, but it just gets funnier and more ridiculous as it goes on.<br /><br />So overall, if yo have a brain you are willing to turn off for 2 hours and just sit back and enjoy pure fun, you will enjoy the Green Hornet. My only quibble is that there wasn't enough Christoph Waltz, but then again, I had tonnes of fun- too much to care about that, so I ain't complaining there. Just go and watch and have fun, as this is a great start to the new year's movie season, and a must see for belly laughs, action and quality dialogue.<br /><br />Oh, and you will believe a car can drive when it's split in half!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Much has been the case with many action/superhero movies over the past few years. Are the creators of these movies not sure if they're gonna make any money with their project or have action scenes become that expensive? If their gonna skimp out on the action scenes, how about writing a really good script that compensates for it. Well, they didn't really do that either.<br /><br />Many of these movies are falling into the exact same cookie-cutter formula style movie making. Iron Man 2 must have had the exact same screenwriter. Introduce bad guy in the beginning, spend an hour or more delving into the personalities of the hero(s) and then pour everything you have into a slam-bam finale. Oh, and since there isn't a whole lot going on in the middle, have hero shoot fruit in a drunken stooper or have hero(s) fight each other for no good reason.<br /><br />I give credit to the filmmakers for stepping away from the special f/x riddled movies we see these days, and keeping many of the stunts completely real, but everytime Jay Chou/Kato does his thing, does it have to be in slow motion? As real as the car chases and car smashes were, the fighting scenes were Matrix/Resident Evilish.<br /><br />Green Hornet isn't a complete waste of time, but it was certainly disappointing in an ongoing calvade of movies being paraded out over the past few years that have no depth, creativity, no quality writing and seem to only have one goal in mind, to dazzle visually. GREEN HORNET doesn't even do that, and if it wasn't going to do that, then they should have written a script that grabbed us.<br /><br />On a final note, Oscar winner, Christop Waltz "Bloodnofsky" was completely wasted in what could have been a great and memorable bad guy. Yet, he was delegated to a scene in the beginning, a short scene in the middle and the finale.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I don't really remember the original Green Hornet stuff, so this review is based strictly on watching this movie in the theater, and--I LOVED IT!  I saw it in 3D, which was nice but not necessary. (3D is older than dirt, but it didn't seem to go over well in the old days.) You may remember Seth Rogen from "The 40 Year Old Virgin".<br /><br />The movie begins at The Daily Sentinel (Daddy's newspaper business).  Young Britt Reid is sent home for fighting in school, but was really trying to defend someone.  Daddy James Reid gets so mad, he rips the head off the boy's favorite toy, a super hero doll.  Britt grows up hating his father, believing that Daddy is way too hard on him.<br /><br />Fast forward probably something like 20 years or so.  Mr Chudnofsky is the head crime boss in Los Angeles.  He controls all the drug stuff and dares anybody to try to do their own thing.  When something happens to Daddy, the family business is dumped into Britt's hands.  Britt/Seth Rogen is not a go-getter.  As a matter of fact, it's about all he can do to find his coffee in the morning and boink the ladies while living off Daddy's money.  As you might have guessed, Chudnfsky and the Hornet's parallel activities collide.<br /><br />Britt meets Kato while searching for his coffee and they bond.  Kato was Daddy's mechanic, but also so much more.  Kato can design and build some super neat stuff--like he is an electronic genius!<br /><br />This flick is extremely entertaining.  It has lots of action, lots of stunts, martial arts, and is pretty darned funny.  There are gunfights, car chases, and lots of really cool gadgets.  Seth Rogen is wonderful as Britt/Hornet, and so is Kato.  Cameron Diaz also plays a newspaper employee.  I was pleasantly surprised at this movie and highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>On the surface this sounds like an awkward concept with extremely questionable casting, and in execution it's exactly that. I'll admire the guts it took to look at this from a totally different perspective and cast Seth Rogen as the lead, but he really doesn't step up his game to match the opportunity. His character is a complete jerk, an unlikeable doofus I couldn't pull for in the even simplest melodramatic setup, and Rogen's constant pursuit of the perfect mistimed joke only adds fuel to the fire. Of course, it doesn't help matters that the movie itself is an incomprehensible mess, constantly straddling the line between reality and exaggeration, without a tangible player in the hunt. Director Michel Gondry brings a grand total of three surreal, dreamy, inspired scenes to the table and sleepwalks through the rest of the process, which is a major disappointment. An irritatingly generic action dump with neither an emotional connection to the audience nor a tangible hold on reality. In short, a total waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>When the idea of `The Green Hornet' was born, I remember reading news on the production of the film and thinking that this was going to be amazing.  I kind of love Superhero films only because I grew up loving Superheroes and so to see my favorite characters on the big screen is a big deal for me.  Sadly, sometimes those films get weighed down by attempts to do too much or live up to such high expectations that they either shrivel up into wasted efforts or they are relegated to the closet as `satisfying fluff with no real memorable facet'.  There are some exceptions (`The Dark Knight', X2: United', `Spider-Man 2'; all of which set a bar VERY high) but they aren't the norm, especially when you consider the fact that Superhero movies are made by the handful every year.<br /><br />Anyways, back to my initial thought.  I remember thinking that the idea of Seth Rogan playing the lead was an inspired move because he is SO not your typical Superhero, and I was getting tired of seeing Ryan `twelve-pack' Reynolds getting every Superhero gig out there.  Then you factor in Michael Gondry, who is awesome, Christolph Waltz, James Franco, Cameron Diaz and Tom Wilkinson, who I practically worship, and you have my appetite whet for sure.<br /><br />Then the reviews poured in, the critics panned it and everyone I knew said it was awful.<br /><br />I just, finally, had a chance to see this the other night and I'm baffled that this was disregarded as Superhero trash.  In fact, outside of the poorly conceived Kung-Fu scenes (I think people get so carried away with the 3D idea that they forget it still has to play out on a 2D screen) and the somewhat cluttered ending, this film was GREAT.<br /><br />For me, this film soars because of two things.  First you have Seth Rogan.  I seriously think this guy is awesome.  Sure, he has his detractors, but I love his everyman humor and the way that he understands layering his `shmuck' characters with enough heart and warmth to make them truly likable (and in a believable way at that).  Here he plays a dejected son of an egomaniac who grows up without a mother and winds up squandering his potential by boozing it up with loose women in an attempt to get back at the father who never loved him.  Then his father dies and he has to take over the newspaper company he ran.  He is initially uninterested, but when he gets the chance to play `Superhero' (quite by accident) he sees that he can use his father's business to make his wildest dreams come true.  By becoming a Superhero (who poses as a villain to gain the upper hand on the real bad guys) he uncovers the truth behind his father's death and the truth behind the man he always regarded as a terrible human being.<br /><br />I didn't mean to say all that without getting to the second reason this works, but then again, I don't think I'm done talking about Seth Rogan.  Seriously, he makes this movie work.  His humor is laced on every scene (he co-wrote the script) and it becomes a part of the fabric of the film.  The dialog is beyond quotable and infectiously entertaining, and that really keeps us glued.  It reminded me of the dialog for `Super 8' in that it was so sharp and witty that it, at most times, overrode the films construction issues.<br /><br />The second reason this works is Michael Gondry.  His stylistic approach to filmmaking is used expertly here, but not in a way I initially expected.  Instead of fantasizing in a way that most would approach a Superhero film, Gondry scales back his visual inventiveness for a film that thrives on revisiting the nostalgic atmosphere of the pulp, crime noirs of yesteryear.  No, this is not a noir (by any means) but it has such visual presence and references that era nicely.  From the sets to the costumes to the score, this really embodied a strange sense of class that I wasn't expecting.  It was modern, sure, but it felt very old-fashioned and I think that was a good thing in an era so obsessed with outdoing the last `action film'.<br /><br />Yes, I hated the way those slow motion action scenes were shot.  The scene where Britt and Kato have a fight in the house is far more entertaining because it is stripped of that gawky slow motion idea.  The use of 3D is too obvious to the 2D viewer (the bottle cap moment was ridiculous) and so it takes away from the actual film to a degree.  And yes, the conclusion was a tad cluttered (so much at one time) but it worked out in the end.<br /><br />When all is said and done, I thoroughly enjoyed this.  For me, this was a nice diversion from the over-produced Superhero films clamoring for that `Special Effects' Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was pretty good. I haven't seen the tv series, so I couldn't compare it. This movie has a lot of action, comedy, and explosions! Seth Rogen stars as Britt Reid, a slacker son of the publisher of The Daily Sentinel. When his father dies, Britt fires the staff, except for Kato, who makes his coffee. Britt and Kato become friends and decide to cut the head of his dad's memorial statue. During this, they save a couple from a gang. They decide to become masked crimefighters and pose as villians. He decides to call himself 'The Green Hornet' They soon must deal with a Russian gangster named Chudnofsky.

I also don't recall ever reading the comic book or hearing the radio show.<br /><br />Truthfully, superhero movies are not really my thing.  I may have enjoyed them thirty years ago, but I have long since outgrown that sort of entertainment.<br /><br />Thus, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I started viewing this new version of THE GREEN HORNET, primarily because it's really a spoof of the genre.  Much of the film works, but also much of it doesn't work.<br /><br />As all loyal followers of this superhero know, The Green Hornet is a masked vigilante whose real identity is multi-millionaire Britt Reid, and his trusted sidekick, Kato, assists him.<br /><br />In this version, Reid is played as a wealthy, egotistical, somewhat cowardly, schmuck who dreams of being a superhero, and it's his driver, Kato, who is really the brains and the kick-ass brawn of the duo.<br /><br />That's a very funny concept, and it works quite a bit of the time...until it becomes tired, repetitive and disintegrates into little more than a special effects/CGI action movie.  That's sad, because this picture could have become a classic lampoon, much like MEN IN BLACK was to sci-fi films.<br /><br />Seth Rogen, who co-wrote the uneven screenplay with Evan Goldberg, is quite good as Reid and Jay Chou is a perfect choice for Kato.  However, it's Christoph Waltz' amusing, low-key playing of the demented super-villain that you'll remember most in this handsomely produced film.<br /><br />Michel Gondry directed a top supporting cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>This is possibly the WORST film I have ever seen in my life! Sure I may not like the Twilight films, but I don't outright hate them as they make me laugh on several occasions coupled with the fact that the third film was OK. But this? If I could rate it any lower, I would! I actually even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. The only thing I ever saw the Green Hornet was the two-part crossover featured in the original Batman series and since then have wanted to see the original series. Then I first heard about this garbage 2-3 years ago and found out Seth Rogen was writing and starring in it. At first I wondered who Seth Rogen is and then once I found out what kind of films he was in, I was like "Well people were upset when Michael Keaton was cast as Batman and look how that turned out." Boy was I wrong! He's an unfunny, talentless person (remember this is all opinion as I'm sure others have found him funny in other projects) but he should've stayed away from this! When I saw this in theatres, at first my dad and I were the only two in there but then at least five to ten more people showed up. Those other people found it hilarious. I sat there in silence, hoping it would get better. Rogen portrays the Hornet as a half-wit and screams with joy during one of their escapes as the police cars crash into obstacles. Britt Reid may want the Green Hornet to appear as a criminal but at no point, at least from the original series, does he get excited at the thought of mayhem and destruction. The guy who plays Kato, the name escapes me at the moment, was OK he didn't leave much of an impact on me (though that strange way he fights or gets pumped during a fight I thought was unnecessary and "out there") Cameron Diaz (another person I don't personally enjoy but she's OK) was wasted in this. The villain was bland, along with his recurring "joke" and the reveal of the DA being corrupt was expected. Black Beauty though was the highlight and I wish it was the Green Hornet who got totalled in the end and not the car. Believe me I wanted to like this but it was just stupid and I hope there is not a sequel. Another thing I noticed is a parallel with Batman; in the '60s, Batman was played as farce while the Green Hornet was played straight with Batman being far more successful. Nowadays, Batman is the serious one and Green Hornet played for laughs, again with the Caped Crusader far more successful. If you want to get into the Green Hornet my suggestion is to find the radio series or the much better Van Williams/Bruce Lee TV series (along with his crossover on Batman). And what really astounds me is that THIS has made more money than Green Lantern (just to clarify, Ryan Reynolds wasn't my first choice either and I actually thought they'd go with the John Stewart character for obvious reasons but he was good).</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Whomever thought that making the Green Hornet a comedy like the "Pink Panther" should be fired, kicked, horse whipped, flogged, drawn and quartered, rinse and repeat. Sure I found parts of the movie funny, but if you wanted a comedy call it something else and make it a non descript hero. Taking the good name of a serious crime fighter and making it into this mess just wasn't entertaining and only mildly funny. Kato would have been fine in a serious version, but the Hornet absolutely sucked and I'm not even a fan of the Green Hornet and I'm insulted. One can only hope they remake it like they did the Batmans and take it serious the second time around.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>So my verdict is officially in on the Green Hornet. Im going to say that I didnt like it. I have a feeling that 2011 will go down as the year the funny man killed the super hero movie. Im not one to pigeon hole an actor and I think Seth Rogen should be given the chance to spread his acting wings. Sadly he didnt do that in the Green Hornet. The movie comes off as a bromance comedy with a Rush Hour feel. I like my super hero movie gritty with doses of one liners. The Green Hornet feels more like a running one liner with a super hero subplot. Kato (Jay Chou) is the only saving grace for the movie. Great slow-mo fighting style and all the gadgets that would make Bond blush. Christoph Waltzs acting ability is severely undercut by the horrible comedic lines hes supposed to deliver. And the less said about Cameron Diaz in this movie the better. Leave your Dark Knight expectations at the door and get ready for something in between a Schumacher meets Michael Bay type movie. By all means check it out for the great special effects and comic book style camera angles. Be ready to cringe during the musical number of Gangstas Paradise which goes on much much longer than it should.

Well, okay, the scene where the Green Hornet's 1970s Chrysler plows into the newsroom of Seth Rogan's character's newspaper is funny, with all the tschoktkees on the reporters' desks just like in real life, is funny. Otherwise, I was a little bored, despite attempts to rev this up with a rock soundtrack mixed REALLY loud. There's a lot of chasing and fighting. Too much, to the point where it becomes numbing, really. As these superhero movies go, this is just okay.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>Seth acts stupid in the movie the only hero in the movie is the Asian.  i love the weapons gadgets and car.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This movie was excellent, the 3D was spectacular, and it was pretty funny, all great things for a action flick. I was very surprised that hardly anyone liked it. I almost didnt watch it myself because of the bad reviews, but my local library had it so I decided to give it a shot, and I am so glad I did. I ran out to Wal Mart right away and bought the 3D version. Give it a shot, you will be happy you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A really fun action movie with a bickering buddy/couple at its center. Not a spectacularly good movie, but a fun way to kick back for a couple of hours of entertainment which will neither challenge nor insult your intelligence. The post-converted 3-D produced a few odd visual artifacts with facial contours and especially struggled with a patterned purple shirt Seth Rogen wore in one scene.</p></br></body></html>

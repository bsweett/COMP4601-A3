Written and directed by Scott Derrickson. Father Moore goes on trial after the failed exorcism of Emily Rose that lead to the young girl's death. Absorbing movie opposing faith and scientific explanations. You don't have to be a horror movie fan to appreciate this film that is more a courtroom drama than another sequel of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000524CY">The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)</a>. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's more like a psychological drama. It's definitely not a horror movie. It deals with religous faith, science and something that science can't explain. The acting is Ok. One of another good thing is it's based on a true story.<br /><br />It's worth viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Emily" gives the impression of being a courtroom thriller based on a true story of exorcism-gone-bad.  In this case, a noble if small-town priest played by Tom Wilkinson ("In the Bedroom") tries to drive out a mob of nasty Latin-speaking demons from the mortal form of Emily Rose...or so he says once he's charged with negligent homicide following her death.  Laura Linney is the up-and-coming attorney assigned to defend him.  A non-believer herself, Linney's courtroom adversary (a shockingly aged Campbell Scott) is a small-town prosecutor whose devout churchgoing makes him more disposed to hanging the priest than sparing him.  Back-tracking with witnesses, we see the horrific visions suffered by Emily - was she an epilectic/psychotic as proposed by a prosecutor's expert witness (Henry Czerny), or is this "the real deal"?  Linney's case is the priest, but her actual client is the Church itself, and the archdiocese wants the case settled quickly, with no question of the accused priest testifying.<br /><br />In that vein, "Emily" could have been an effective courtroom drama, one exploring the ethical implications of being the attorney for both a Church and one of its cast-out members at the same time, and leaving enough room on the subject of the supernatural so that we could go either way.  However, though making inroads in that direction, "Emily" decides to go the Hollywood route - Linney gamely goes after an impassioned defense, and more critically, the film leaves little doubt of where it stands on the authenticity of the supernatural - when Emily sees something, we see it; and when soembody else sees Emily (but presumably not her terrifying visions) we see her visions anyway; The priest has some visions as well, and the script never considers making Wilkinson's character unsympathetic enough to doubt.  Finally, Linney has too many of her own episodes at "The Witching Hour" (3 AM, if you must know), which include a locked front door that is nevertheless wide open and a dictaphone that plays by itself.  "Emily" is definately a chiller...<br /><br />...that manages to work.  Though using a fair amount of CGI and other effects, "Emily" remains on top by its use of effective pacing and its resolute intentions to remain first and foremost a movie about people who are in fear rather than fear itself - everybody looks like their scared, and the script gives them adequate reason to, so why shouldn't we.  Ironically, the movie is almost at its scariest when asking us to ocnsider Emily's condition as purely rational - meaning that it's entirely reasonable for her (and us) to be forced into all manner of painful and bone-breaking contortions while her pupils dilate and her mind is full of visions of demons.  "Exorcist" was scary enough when we thought it was fiction, but scenes of Emily lying on the floor, her limbs in odd directions, suggest a colder and clinical diagnosis for which there is no salvation or the protective cushion of CGI.  Though no horror film has yet topped "Exorcist", "Emily" remains a movie about demonic possession that actually grabs you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Yes, it's scary, but did you know that this isn't a horror movie?<br /><br />Not really.<br /><br />You should know that, despite the trailers during its theatrical release, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is more of a courtroom drama than a horror flick. Now, ask yourself: were there *any* scenes out of a courtroom from the film's trailer? Any shots of the defense attorney (who is the main character)? Why didn't they want to be upfront about the film? Why did they want it to seem like it was a supernatural thriller a la Stigmata?<br /><br />I don't know, because it's a pretty good courtroom drama, and made more interesting by having an element of horror about it, an element of the supernatural. However, at heart, this is a movie about whether or not those things *could* exist, and respecting those people who believe it, and not primarily a movie about demons trying to kill people. It's a movie about the role that faith plays in our lives.<br /><br />All that said, the horror-elements are well-done. My fiancee jumped five or six times during the film. :) Its horror is mainly found in suspense; not a lot actually *happens* other than Emily Rose looking evil and twisted at the camera, but it's still effective and the exorcism scene is excellent and powerful.<br /><br />It claims to be based on a true story. I don't know the details of that true story, or how close this movie gets to it, but I can believe that something like this could happen. This is more of a philosophical piece than a modern horror flick (it has nothing in common with, say, Saw or Scream), but I'm here to tell you--that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's room for Saws and Screams, and room for this movie, too. It's only unfortunate that the film's creators didn't think it would sell as well, if they were straight-forward as to what it's actually about.<br /><br />Bottom line: this movie is thought-provoking, interesting and entertaining. Four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>A priest is accused of murdering a young 19-year-old girl, Emily Rose.  Some say she had epilepsy.  Others say Emily was physiologically unwell.  Some even say that she had a mixture of both.  Emily, in fact, was possessed by evil spirits, and she was taking medication to help her.  The priest who came to do the exorcism on her told her to stop using the drugs and focus on religion to help cure the evil in her.  This, however, didn't work.  It made her case worse, and she ended up dying just to escape the spirits.<br /><br />The girl who played the part of Emily Rose was outstanding; I was really convinced that she was actually possessed and not playing a part.  Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, a lawyer, who defends the priest.<br /><br />This movie mainly takes place in the courtroom, where witnesses tell their side of the story, which intern flashbacks to the scenes of where Emily is alive.<br /><br />There is a lot of dialogue in this movie, and some may consider it boring.  I found the storyline very interesting and well written.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>This is a great movie that will give you the creeps and keep you on the edge of your seat. I usually like those movies that aren't all hyped up and this was one of them.This freaked me out more than the original Exorcist and I never thought another movie would. It doesn't steal any ideas from the Exorcist and has a pretty good ending, I thought. If you like horror movies that are more true to life and not the typical slasher movie, this is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>It's hard to rate this movie. It's based on true-life events, and it's also a faithed-based horror movie that draws on our own, deep-rooted beliefs in God and the devil, something that has always found success in the movies, starting back with the original horror classic The Exorcist. Though it is a movie about the tragic events of a young girl who was obviously tortured in life, The Exorcism of Emily Rose captures everything that modern horror films don't. Simply speaking, it scares us. And it handles Emily Rose's story sensitively, without making her appear as no more than a Hollywood monster, like Linda Blair's character has become. With that out of the way, I will go onto the review.<br /><br />Exorcism begins "in media res" (beginning in the middle), starting the movie with Emily's death. It's a good start to the movie, because it introduces the other main character in the process, Father Moore, the priest who watched over Emily and attempted the only exorcism. From there, the movie becomes a court trial, literally. Emily's story is told through witness testimony and flashbacks while Father Moore's story is taking place. Father Moore has been charged for Emily's murder, and faces ten years in prison. Though a plea-agreement was proposed, he refuses every attempt and decides that he wants to go to court, so that Emily's story can be told. During the trial, Emily's possession is detailed and played out, and we, from start to finish, see the things she had to go through. All the way up to the actual exorcism, the horror is really no more than a feeling of creepiness (at least for me) but when you realize what is possessing her, and just how outnumbered Father Moore and Emily's family truly is, then it takes a violent shift towards horrifying. In that final epiphany, the torture of Emily and the hopelessness of her exorcism is presented. It doesn't take an understanding in Humanities to know who and what Father Moore has attempted to chase away.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, when all the facts are in place, you can't help but have a feeling of despair, both for Father Moore and for Emily Rose, as both of their separate endings were and are inevitable. Yet, in both of their fights, their goals are achieved.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie for fans of the Exorcist, or for anyone who has any prior knowledge of the Emily Rose possession and the happenings that surrounded her death. I'd even recommend this as a weaker companion piece to Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, as both contain stark moments of pain and horror, and both can help us tap into our religious selves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Father Richard Moore, played by Tom Wilkinson (upcoming Seperate Lives, Batman Begins), is on trial for the supposed murder of 19 Year Old Emily Rose, played surprisingly in a believable performance by Jennifer Carpenter (White Chicks). As Wilkinson's Lawyer, Erin, played by the always good Laura Linney (Mystic River, p.s.), is told the tale of what happened to Emily Rose from Wilkinson himself and defending the people would be Evan Thomas, played by Campbell Scott (Rodger Dodger, Big Night) and he's also good. Emily Rose was taking medicine and suffering from delusions, seeing things, things made her so stuff but Wilkinson knows that she was possessed by a demon or more demons...they say 6...including Lucifier. Scott Derrickson doesnt do a bad job but this isnt a masterpiece and it could possibly...is...the years spookiest if mixed with courtroom dramatics,movie. It's better then White Noise, let's say that because we all know how bad White Noise was. Carpenter is the real deal here and her character beind 19 Years Old and seeing her suffer even though she's acting on screen, you get a chill down the back of your spine if it was you who was witnessing everything that happened to her, even the part in the chapel where she is crying, asking the boy she likes to please say with her...you feel as if you want to stay with her, comfort her as she goes threw all of this. Also starring Colm Feore (City of Angels, Storm Of The Century), Henry Czerny (Mission:Impossible, Clear and Present Danger) and Alec Roberts (Tv's Stargate SGI, 13 Ghosts(2001). I dont know, you decide...it's your opinion but in my mind, I felt like The Exorcism Of Emily Rose was a good movie even if it had it's falts along the way. Other thing is that Derrickson stated that he didnt rip off The Exorcist...some might disagree with him, I on the other hand dont see any of The Exorcist in this....well, the only thing is that it's a young girl, like in The Exorcist but I cant say it's ripping from it.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>This is a very special movie, probably the first film ever to deal honestly with the subject of demonic possession from a purely Christian perspective without all the usual special effects. Based on a true 20th century account, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' chronicles the unfortunate tale of a young college girl who had the misfortune of being too sensitive and caring. Traits that apparently attract spiritual evil and can leave one vulnerable and susceptible to demonic attack and ultimately possession.<br /><br />Are demons real and can one become possessed by the spirits of evil? The makers of this film think so.

I know those types of forces do exist.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>In an age when most "horror" films belong in the comedy section, I can think of only a couple films in the last five years that seriously horrified me. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is one of them.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The movie is based on the actual story of a German girl who died while being exorcised in the late 1970s. The priest was then put on trial for neglectful homicide. Google it for details.<br /><br />Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) plays an agnostic who defends the priest (Tom Wilkinson), the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) is a believer. This creates some problems: How can an unbeliever defend a believer who performs a service that apparently kills the young woman? How can a believer come against another believer who was simply trying to deliver the girl from spiritual malevolence?<br /><br />The prosecutor makes the case that the woman was ill with various mental disorders and that the exorcism was just a bunch of superstitious mumbo jumbo. By contrast, Erin Bruner argues that these illnesses were the RESULT OF possession -- that the girl's possession brought on the symptoms. This makes sense in light of the scriptural evidence of Jesus Christ delivering people from evil spirits who induced insanity, muteness and deafness.<br /><br />Another important argument of the defense is that a potent drug that Emily was prescribed trapped her in a mode that was resistant to the exorcism.<br /><br />The fascinating story provokes many questions. We need to take an honest look at our mental health practices and institutions. Although there are some genuinely good people working in this field who care about the patients, it seems that the best we can do is drug people and make them, more or less, numbed-up living zombies or even mindless vegetables. Unfortunately this is how they're damned to live the rest of their lives, subservient and dependent on the mental health establishment (that actually needs them to stay ill in order to exist).<br /><br />Such people don't need more drugs and "therapy." What they need is delivered. They need delivered from evil spiritual powers that have possessed them. They need FREED. Don't mistake me here, I'm not against mental health people or facilities because I realize they're just doing what they know to do. It's just not working. Again, the mentally ill need delivered not force-fed more drugs and essentially locked-up for the rest of their lives. That's not life, it's living death!<br /><br />Of course, releasing a horde of religious wackos into our mental institutions isn't the answer. Yet, what if some believers who walked in the boldness and authority of Jesus Christ were available, people who show documented evidence of DELIVERING the mentally ill? The New Testament relays case after case of Jesus Christ exorcizing demons from hundreds of people, maybe thousands. He didn't numb `em up and sentence them to a life of living death. Rather he came to set the prisoners free from darkness, heal the sick and heal the brokenhearted! If there are people out there who walk in this same anointing of power and freedom, shouldn't we allow them to minister to our mentally ill?<br /><br />Unfortunately a large percentage of the church is very weak in regards to spiritual deliverance. Except for offering eternal salvation, their gospel is powerless and next to worthless. Yet this wasn't the way of the early church. Paul, Peter and others offered total deliverance. Thankfully, there are still a remnant of these types of believers and these are the ones who can help our mentally ill, as long as the oppressed WANT freedom, healing and deliverance (some WANT to stay dependent and "cared for").<br /><br />I'm only raising such moral/theological/philisophical questions because the film provokes it, so please don't be irked at me for getting all heavy and theological.<br /><br />Despite the numerous courtroom scenes there's certainly enough horrifying elements in "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" to please most horror fans, just don't expect Freddy or Jason shenanigans. Like my title blurb points out, this film will literally scare the hell out of you.<br /><br />Interestingly, while it's horrifying "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is also somehow warm and faith-affirming, even sometimes beautiful.<br /><br />My only criticism is a theological theory introduced late in the film. This theory is incredible wrong. I won't elaborate except to say that God would never allow the option of Emily's possession as a supposed testimony to the world of the existence of dark spiritual powers, rather His purpose is always to deliver such people, which not only testifies to the existence of the malevolent powers but, more importantly, sets the person FREE and gives glory to God.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>Based upon a true story, part supernatural horror film, part court room drama, the film achieves what it set out to do.

After all, what horror movie fan would not be interested in a movie about possession and an exorcism, especially a movie that was supposed to be based (at least in part) on a true story.<br /><br />The "Exorcism of Emily Rose" succeeds in sparking one's imagination regarding the philosophical debate between whether possession or mental illness is the cause of some of these mysterious types of frightening manifestations and unexplained phenomena that sometimes occur in various individuals.  From this standpoint, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is clearly a success.  From a horror movie's standpoint, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" comes up a bit short.  In all fairness, this movie should not even be classified exclusively as a horror movie notwithstanding the disturbing images in the movie.  These disturbing images, Emily's manifestations of possession or mental illness and the story's message itself are what carry this movie from a horror movie's perspective, but is it enough?  Most experienced horror movie fans would submit that it is not enough.  Does this mean we need more blood and gore in the movie?  Certainly not, but there just is not enough to this movie to sustain any real sense of horror and fear in the audience.  In fact, when compared to Friedkin's "The Exorcist" and "Amityville II: The Possession", "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is about as scary as the Bugs Bunny cartoons relatively speaking.  Of course, comparisons of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" to Friedkin's "The Exorcist" are unfortunately inevitable.  However, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" clearly fails to hold up to scrutiny regarding the movie's ability to evoke unadulterated horror in the audience.<br /><br />Obviously, the courtroom scenes are an integral part of this movie, but this clearly takes away from the movie's ability to sustain horror in the audience.  Don't get me wrong as I love a good courtroom drama as much as the next person (as I am an attorney believe it or not), but the courtroom drama in this movie causes the movie to work against itself at least as far as this movie's merits as a horror movie are concerned.<br /><br />Overall, the acting, directing and production values in this movie are pretty good.  The story works fairly well, but the movie is clearly unable to sustain enough horror to satisfy the pure horror movie fan.  From a drama fan's perspective, this movie is great, but it just does not work as well as a horror movie.<br /><br />Perhaps, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" would best be described as a hybrid or quasi Drama-Horror movie.  Still, with that being said, Emily's screaming is not quite enough to instill the viewer with unadulterated horror.  The disturbing images that Emily sees are quite effective, and the one scene where Emily's body is completely contorted is very effective and probably the scariest scene in the movie, but is it enough to satisfy the horror movie fan?  I would argue that it is not.<br /><br />Still, with that being said, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is, all things considered, an effective thought-provoking drama-horror hybrid movie, but if you are expecting a pure horror movie, you will be as disappointed as I was, and you will definitely find parts of this movie dull and boring.  Nevertheless, you could do a lot worse than to watch "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" as it is quite a thought-provoking movie, but just DO NOT compare this movie to the horror movie classic "The Exorcist" because if you do, you will be sorely disappointed.  Overall, I would consider "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" to be an average movie...thus the TWO stars rating with my biggest criticism simply being that there was not enough to this movie to make it into a good solid horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is based on the story of Anneliese Michel, a German student who, in the mid-1970s, was the subject of one of the rare exorcisms sanctioned by the Church in modern times. The results were less than ideal: Anneliese died of starvation, and her parents and the priests involved in the exorcism were put on trial for negligent homicide.<br /><br />In the film, Anneliese has become young Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a devout small town American girl who heads off to a big city college and goes and gets herself possessed. The family priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), is called in after Emily returns home. Believing she is possessed, he performs an exorcism that goes awry, resulting in his standing trial for her death.<br /><br />Trying the case are prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a self-described "man of faith" who nonetheless scoffs at the idea of demonic possession, and Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), an agnostic corporate attorney looking to climb the ladder in her firm. Thomas attempts to establish a medical basis for Emily's death, while Erin - thanks to some creepy moments courtesy of the "dark forces" (as Father Moore calls them) surrounding the trial, comes to realize there may be some credence to the priest's story.<br /><br />Anyone who's seen the previews and is coming into this movie expecting a straight-up horror flick is going to be disappointed. What we have here is a courtroom drama, punctuated by horrific flashbacks. Naturally, any movie that deals with the concept of demonic infestation has to be careful it doesn't draw too many comparisons to the Big Kahuna of the subject, "The Exorcist." Fortunately (or not, depending on how big a "Law & Order" fan you are), "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" dwells less on the possession itself than on the subsequent trial. There are elements of Friedkin's classic here, as any possession movie is going to contain creepy demon fu and a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. But "Emily" also pulls in references to "The Amityville Horror" and "Ghostbusters" (you'll know it when you see it) as well.<br /><br />Linney, as always, does a fine job, and Wilkinson is believable as the tormented priest, but Scott is stuck playing a guy who's such a douchebag he doesn't see the hypocrisy in decrying a ritual based on "archaic mythology" when he himself is a Christian (he also has one of those James Keach moustaches favored by LAPD officers). Then again, if anyone gets short shrift, it's Jennifer Carpenter, whose Emily Rose spends most of the film in painful contortions and barking in Aramaic (maybe Mel Gibson can find a part for her in his next movie).<br /><br />I have to admit, I don't believe in this stuff any more than Scott's character, and yet it still freaks me out. The exorcism scenes are reminiscent of the 1974 film (which I count among the scariest of all time), without being utterly derivative. And even the idea that the defense could trot out some of the stuff they did during the trial and not get laughed out of the courthouse was amusing in it's own way.<br /><br />Why Sony decided to assemble a cast that includes the likes of Linney and Wilkinson and then place the untested Derrickson at the helm is beyond me, however. In a more capable director's hands, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" could have been both a gripping courtroom drama and a chilling "is she or isn't she?" horror tale. What we have instead is a movie that drifts, almost unmanned, from plot point to plot point. A few more scares and a little less chatter from the principals would have made "Emily" much more memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>What struck me about this film was the interesting debate between theological speculation and scientific reasoning.  Was Emily Rose's death caused by a evil spirit or was it murder?  Laura Linney and Oscar Nominee Tom Wilkinson give strong performances in this very intriguing motion picture.  Director Scott Derrickson does a great job of trying to keep our interest by giving both side of the arguement without trying to insult our inteligence with a ridiculous and predictable storyline.  A more inexperienced director would have tried to shock us with blood and gore, turning it into a forgetable "B" movie.  By not taking the low road, this film actually becomes rather entertaining and spiritual. Don't let the title fool you.  Give this movie a chance.

The thing that left me confused is why exactly the priest was on trial. I don't think that was fully explained. They were holding him responsible for Emily's death but wasn't it her family that put him in charge? He didn't ask for that position. And then he used his faith based methods to try and help her (DUH! He's a PRIEST!) and then they wanted to throw him in prison when it didn't work. That didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I was very let down by the DVD extras. I really wanted to learn more about what REALLY happened. I know everything they showed happening to Emily was totally made up for the sake of the movie but how much of the trial was reality based?

A movie that really should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is based on a true story, which would be the exorcism and death of in 1976 of Anneliese Michel, a young German girl.  The "Klingenberg Case" unfolded in the wake of the release of William Friedkin's "The Exorcist" and two years later prosecutors brought Anneliese's parents and the two exorcists to trial on charges of negligent homicides. What Scott Derrickson takes from that true story are not so much the details of the young woman's possession and the attempted exorcism, but the drama of a trial in which the state seeks to convict a priest for believing in faith rather than facts.  Consequentially, this 2005 is a rather unique blend of a trial film with a horror movie, and with regards to both parts of the equation it is both provocative and effective.<br /><br />Our vantage point in the story is that of Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), a criminal lawyer who has achieved notoriety for successfully defending a murderer.  The head of her firm (Colm Feore) dangles a partnership in front of her for taking the case of Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), who has been charged with negligent homicide in the death of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter).  Diagnosed as having epilepsy, the Father convinced Emily that she was a victim of demon possession and got her to stop taking her medication.  An exorcism was performed, but it was unsuccessful, and Emily starved to death.  Prosecuting the case if Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a man of faith who believes in facts.  Bruner is an agnostic, which makes for an obvious irony as she defends the priest whose only concern is that he be allowed to testify and tell Emily's story.  Towards that end he has refused a plea agreement pushed by the archdiocese.<br /><br />Emily's story emerges in flashbacks during the trial, which puts the prosecution's case at a disadvantage from our perspective.  Thomas' alternative explanations for things like how Emily comes to know so many ancient languages ring hollow compared to what we have seen and heard in the flashbacks.  It is key that Thomas is a man of faith, that he is a believer whereas Bruner is not, but when he dismisses Moore's beliefs as archaic superstitions is he merely being a Protestant or is he drawing a line in the theological sand elsewhere?  To the point, does he believe in God but not Satan?  In both but not in possession?  More to the point, when faith and facts collide, why does he obviously side with the latter?  These questions matter to me because by focusing on the trial the story here is about what religious beliefs the law allows.  What is the difference between the religious exemption that allows Native Americans to smoke peyote and allowing  Christian Scientists to refuse medical treatment, and the right of the Catholic Church to perform the "Ritulae Romanum" of the Great Exorcism?<br /><br />Emily's position is succinctly put in her own words: "People say that God is dead, but how can they believe that when I show them the Devil?"  When "The Exorcist" came out I remember a poll where more people believed in Satan than in God, which seemed to me to be backwards from the standpoint of logic because Emily is right: the existence of Satan prove that of God, but believing in God does not necessarily mandate a believe in the devil.  Maybe that is where Thomas makes his stand.  But Derrickson has stacked the deck here: those who authorized the exorcism are off the hook, as are the parents, and the earnest Moore faces martyrdom essentially alone.<br /><br />What this film has going for it above anything else is an exceptionally strong cast.  Linney is an actress who exudes intelligence in everything she does, Scott shows measured disdain with just about every sentence he utters, and Wilkinson brings a remarkable sense of reasonableness to a priest in his position.  But special credit goes to Carpenter, who manifests most of Emily's possession through the use of her voice and body (the special features indicate the exceptions in this regard).  The fact that for the most part Linney is in the trial film rather than the horror movie helps her so much that in those few scenes where we are supposed to believe the demons are after her actually work against the movie because it works better if her perspective is no different from that of the jury.<br /><br />In the end I am bothered more by the film's resolution than by its implicit rhetorical questions.  I appreciate the importance of ambiguity in such a film, that for it to really work both Moore and Thomas must be right at face value, but it really is skewed towards the "truth" of the possession and having it both ways in the end is too much of a cop out for me.  Even the characters do not try to come to grips with what it all means given the battle that has been waged in the courtroom, which is why I round down on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I had very high expectations of this film because I studied under the school of techniques put forth by the author of the book it was based on--Dr. Felicitas Goodman. She was a shaman, but in my eyes not only a shaman, but one of the last of the forerunners in the western world who was truly schooled in the olde way yet capable of working that path into the frequencies and energy currently available to the planet. She was a rare bird. Apart from her very open and well schooled view on shamanic work, she had the ability to blend the psychological, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual into her work to create amazing outcomes. She excluded nothing. So of course in that light the film had nowhere to go but down.<br /><br />The film is based on her book "The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel", and it's fantastic. The book is her translation of the documents and letters surrounding the possession and subsequent death of Annelise Michel. I could elaborate all day on what makes it unique in the field of depossession. Suffice it to say that she stumbled on some findings that if others in the western world had conceived, did not have the confidence to assert them publicly. I had read her other works before this one and already realized her contributions in shamanism, but when I read this book I really felt like I was reading the words of a pioneer in an incredibly misunderstood field of wellbeing.<br /><br />Anneliese was a young German woman from a very closed off town that was deeply religious. No really--deeply religious, which is very significant to her plight. As she became college aged and was faced with moving to the city and having a boyfriend she began to have problems. Thinking they were mental concerns she was treated for epilepsy. She insisted that she was possessed and the medications weren't helping. As she was an adult and could legally decide for herself, she eventually stopped taking the drugs, stopped eating, and died while the exorcism was being carried out. She essentially chose to starve herself to death. Her parents and two priests went to prison short-term for her death.<br /><br />The film butchered her story. It still managed to assert some of the core truths of Goodman's work, but it was all very wrapped in conjecture and voodoo. The film's goal was to blend a horror and courtroom drama and it failed both miserably. It really should have picked one and run with it. It wasn't particularly scary, but there was one scene that lasted a split second that was gruesomely gorgeous. It was absolutely haunting and it really seemed to capture the essence of what Anneliese actually went through. I am going to check out "Requiem" when it comes out on DVD, as it's supposed to be more true to her life story. It always irks me that Hollywood has to shake up real cases of experiences with the paranormal, when if they would stick to the real story, it's far more hair raising than any special effect. But we don't want to portray the truth of what's possible. That would be too close to home.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" effectively mixes courtroom drama and affect from "The Exorcism" and other spooky films for a cinematic, or DVD, experience that is enthralling until the very end, when it seems to unwind and turn vanilla.<br /><br />The story traces the actions of a priest that performed an exorcism on the named character and the courtroom drama around his work, which the prosecution suggests led to the girl's death. The courtroom drama  takes up most of the scenes, which are interspersed with reconstructions of Emily's takeover and the exorcism.<br /><br />The film effectively eschews most of the gore, blood and guts that have appeared in many of these movies and is still effective all the way through to the end, where it lets the viewer down by trying to satisfy everyone.<br /><br />Two wonderful actors -- Laura Linney and Campbell Scott -- play the attorneys on each side of the court case in this thriller. Linney, coming off her Oscar-nominated work in "Kinsey" is more multidimensional than I can recall seeing her before. Campbell, a terrific supporting actor who has appeared in a lot of movies, takes on an older, more mature, more conservative appearance in the movie playing a God-fearing lawyer than must bebunk a priest whose actions, he believes, led to Emily's demise.<br /><br />The interaction between the two attorneys in the courtroom is what drives the action in the film. There is a subplot of demonic possession that transcends the titled character, a plot contrivance I've never before seen in an exorcism-takeover movie. It adds somethig fresh to the overall horror production.<br /><br />However, an equivocal ending -- apparently based on what happened in real life (the film is said to be based on true events) -- robs the movie of forward motion, bringing everything to an unengaging stop. It gave me the impression that everything leading up to it was less important than I previously thought.<br /><br />Still, this is an effective thriller with riveting performances by the two lawyers and a convincing plot built around real events. There are epilogue scripts onscreen after the flick that tell you what happened to everyone after the court case.<br /><br />This is a good movie, very effective until the end, where I felt like a deflated balloon. Not all viewers will have this feeling, of course.

If, you know, Lifetime aired stories about demonic possession.<br /><br />In this case, the terrible dialogue, written by someone I can only assume has never actually spoken to an actual person before, almost totally distracts from the wooden acting. What sort of drugs were given to a cast that includes some fairly dependable actors to turn them into listless zombies, I can't guess.<br /><br />Absolutely skippable, especially if, like me, you think the premise and structure sound really intriguing. The reality of the final film just proves all the more frustrating, in that case.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>With eerie atmosphere that sticks with you throughout its duration, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is a compelling and well-drawn tale of horror and courtroom drama.  In it, Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, an aggressive (and agnostic) junior partner at her law firm who jumps at the chance to defend a Catholic priest in a negligent homicide case.  She has a track record of "getting off" guilty parties and she also wants to make senior partner.  With a high profile case like this, she'd be a fool to pass it up.  Unfortunately for her, the case isn't as easy to digest.  It involves a young lady's death after a failed exorcism.  The girl, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), had been diagnosed by medical professionals to be both epileptic and psychotic.  However, under the guidance of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), the family takes Emily off of her medication and seeks to have her undergo an exorcism in an attempt to remove her demons.<br /><br />The case is very interesting to watch as it plays out on the screen.  Campbell Scott is perfect as the prosecutor attempting to find Father Moore guilty as charged.  He attacks the medical angle of the case while Linney's character, getting hammered in the courthouse, attempts to prove that Emily actually was possessed by some sort of demonic forces.  The deeper that she and Father Moore get involved in the case, the stranger things get.<br /><br />With time split between flashbacks of Emily's agonizing experience and the battle in the courtroom, this tale is woven in such a way that the viewer has little relief from the tension that builds.  The story moves at a pace that builds on fear and faith, making for a brilliant ride.<br /><br />The acting is superb in this film.  Carpenter literally changes from a sweet and innocent young girl into a ravaged carcass under the grip of no less than six demons.  One demon in particular will be quite familiar to all of us.  Wilkinson is believable as the parish priest intent on telling Emily's story with no regard for his own life.  As stated before, Scott handles his role in superior fashion.  Perhaps the character who changes more than any other (excepting Emily) is Laura Linney's.  Though she begins this film as an agnostic, her soul is chipped at by the dark forces she is fighting in the courtroom.<br /><br />With equal parts drama and religious struggle, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is one of the best films to come out this year.  It will make you question your faith, fear the unknown, and, perhaps, even strengthen your own beliefs.  Highly recommended for its wonderful and horrid tale, though this unrated version is nothing for young children to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>This movie was to my surprise a very good film about what is supposed to be a true story about a poor, unfortunate young woman who people either said was crazy or possessed. Was she just ill, as doctors called it, or was she truly possessed? Which is right this time- science or religion? This movie showed the battle on each side, and both the lawyers in this film were the two opposing sides pretty well, the problem was they cancelled each other out, making good points on each side which were interesting to hear and observe. To make such a decision I would have found hard. Emily Rose could have been ill, and most probably would say after watching this movie she probably was, but everyone knows there is doubt in the back of all of our minds, that goes beyond our logic, that says there are some things that we just do not know for sure, and this story could have very well been one of those things we could not know. We were not there, we could not know what was going on. Yet it is hard to just automatically believe the story as well, and frightening to even consider.<br /><br />The acting was pretty well done in this film, I liked the way they played out the film and the story itself will leave you thinking about the situation even after the film, making it a story you'll never truly forget.<br /><br />The only problem? I found that they could have shown a little more on Emily Rose. I wanted them to show more of her and what was going on with her, just to shine a little more light on her. Most of the movie is set in the courtroom which is fascinating but I wished they had shown a scene or two more of Emily Rose's tragedy, that's the main reason everyone wanted to see the film so a star goes off from that. Yet I really liked the courtroom part of the film, for it showed the very dilemma of the whole story, and it was a hard one. I think...the jury made the right decision. I feel in my heart of hearts they did. That was not an easy decision, and I think they acted with both logic and faith, which indeed was best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Many horror films lately are built so that it uses disorienting camera trickery and loud music jolts and call it a horror film. Many well done ones were more about atmosphere and tension. This film does have it where you feel slightly unnerved and not extremely calm although as a film it might have certain elements you may not like.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the story tells of Emily Rose, a 19 year old college student who died. The main suspect is Father Moore, who disallowed any medical or hospitalization of Emily. Why? Well it's believed that she is the carrier of a demon and a victim of possession. After a failed exorcism she turns up dead so was it his fault or something else entirely? Well I might as well say it now, the film doesn't answer this and I bet it was designed so it wouldn't.<br /><br />I always find it funny that Muslims, Buddhists and Catholics will so strongly believe in a higher power(naturally God or Jesus Christ or Allah) and yet we completely shoot down any possibility or demons or creatures. We're interested in the stars and possible planets capable of supporting life yet we find aliens and UFO phenomenons absolute sci-fi nerd nonsense. So when the prosecutor mentions he's a man of faith, we go "you believe in one higher power but not the other?"<br /><br />The film doesn't really rely on shock tactics like Boogeyman or Amityville Horror remake but it relies mainly on mood. In other words, the filmmakers are trying to mess with your head and leave you uneasy and it's quite effective. There is a couple jump scenes as I call them but they're few and far between.<br /><br />Performance-wise is straight across the board(except for whoever played the prosecutor. His cry baby objections get grating). Laura Linney is always reliable, being a very versatile actress and Tom Wilkinson, last seen playing a mob boss in Batman Begins is effective as Father Moore. In particular mention is Jennifer Carpenter playing our unfortunate title character. A lot of her performance is for real and that makes it more chilling and quite a lung power on her.<br /><br />Where the film falls on its face is where information is told to us in periodic moments so something new shows up. The 3 AM thing shows up but it's not explained until way later. Even certain keywitness are ignored. One particular witness is never even called who witnessed the exorcism. You can see the filmmakers intent to drum up curiousity and makes us question things but since speculation runs rampant on whether it's a science explanation or a matter of faith, many events are just standing there without us figuring out where to put our mind.<br /><br />If you want a genuine film that'll creep you out, can't go wrong here. I'm not buying it since it's not my taste but guys, if you're renting this so your woman can cling to you you might just cling back.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>This movie begins at the end. Emily Rose [Jennifer Carpenter] is dead, and her priest, Father Moore [Tom Wilkinson] is in custory. Prosecuting him is devout church-goer Ethan Thomas [Scott Campbell]; defending him is hard-drinking, hard-working agnostic Erin Brunner [Laura Linney]. This juxtaposition of faith and doubt, and how each character is tested and forced to the brink of a crisis of belief makes for a engaging, suspenseful story. In addition, Jennifer Carpenter's acting, done with very little makeup and instead through incredible body and face control, is masterful.<br /><br />The Exorcism of Emily Rose could have been a four-star movie. What holds it back is two things--as interesting as the character's struggles are, they could have been more richly drawn. The result feels more like chess pieces moving about a board than people being tormented by their beliefs. Also, the medical aspects of the case are very poorly handled--the diagnosis of epilepsy is made without ruling out other likely causes, such as brain tumor, metabolic disorder. This may seem nit-picky, but anyone who remembers how medicine was used in the Exorcist will know that delving into this and the invasion of the body that it brings would make an effective foil to the demonic invasion. They could have gotten the medicine right and made a better movie.<br /><br />Still, very worth seeing, but don't set your expectations too high.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Emily Rose is dead, and the court of law must determine the reason. I know horror film fans would love the film, and some reviewers have found it intelligent, but here I beg to disagree. Yes, the film is not bad, but at the same time I believe somewhere deep inside `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' there is a better film that could have been.<br /><br />The spooky opening scene effectively introduces us to the world where the supposedly possessed girl was living in a secluded house. Then you are to meet Tom Wilkinson' priest Father Moore who is charged for negligence that the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) says resulted in the death of Emily Rose. Very ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) takes up the case to defend the priest.<br /><br />From this point, `The Exorcism of Emily Rose' starts to look like two films in one, one about the courtroom and the other about the death of Emily Rose.<br /><br />[COURTROOM DRAMA] The film says it is based on the true events, which are in themselves intriguing and intelligent too - `People vs. Exorcist' -- but what you see in the film's two hours you saw somewhere else in other countless courtroom dramas. The film has strong acting from the strong cast, but the characters are terribly flat. Though the frequent flashbacks attempt to hide the fact, the courtroom drama itself is boring and fails to live up to our expectation that we have from the initial scenes. The ambitious female lawyer is working under the slimy guy in suit. New evidence appears and witness appears and disappears as in some other films. The judge is severe (but fair). Haven't we seen them somewhere else before?<br /><br />[HORROR] Horror part of the film, which is mainly shown in the flashback scenes are slightly better, greatly helped by the very committed acting from Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose. She doesn't have to be Linda Blair with her rotating head, but it is easy to imagine she had to endure a lot. The film tries to give us shocks very often always with Ms. Carpenter doing something painful, like bending her body backward, scratching the wallpaper, and eating insects. And of course she has to growl like a demon. It is a cheap trick, some might say, but at least it is not boring.<br /><br />And whatever the producers might say about the film and its `based on the truth' story, we are attracted to the scary part of the film, and `Emily Rose' is certainly scary. But intelligent debate about the religion and the law? No, even though the film obviously wants to be so.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Scott Derrickson<br /><br />Cast:  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, Jennifer Carpenter, Colm Feore, Joshua Close, Kenneth Welsh, Duncan Fraser.<br /><br />Running Time:  119 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for thematic material, including intense/frightening sequences, and language.<br /><br />Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter, "White Chicks") is a young, naive girl, eagerly heading off to college. Upon arrival, Emily is seemingly attacked by demonic forces, which leave her on the brink of sanity. After her mysterious death from a botched exorcism, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is put on trail for her demise, leaving exasperated defender Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) at a loss as to how to approach the case. As Erin probes deeper into Emily's alleged supernatural behavior, she begins to feel evil forces are following her, and puts her job and reputation at stake as she moves forward with her controversial defense that Emily was not mentally ill, but possessed by a demon.  The marketing of "Emily Rose" shows frightening images of a young girl violently possessed, a sweaty priest battling thunderous malevolent forces, and an inquisitive woman persistently trying to find out who Emily Rose was and what happened to her. To the surpise of the initial theatrical viewing, this is not the film you get with "The Exorcism of Emily Rose."  The film is more a courtroom drama that examines the theoretical differences of medicine and the Church, exploring how the belief of God and His work (and the work of the Devil) has diminished and society is outwardly focused on facts, results, and money.  "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is certainly no "Exorcist", but the film succeeds because in no shape or form is it even trying to be.<br /><br />In many ways, 'Emily Rose' is different from almost every past horror movie of the genre in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. Instead, director/co-screenwriter Scott Derrickson seems content to make us think. There are several questions raised in the film regarding religious beliefs and the public's general perception of them, but these are all handled in an objective and impartial manner.  As for the scare factor, since the filmmakers aren't overly anxious in trying to scare the audience, the film actually is frightening at several points - again, unusual for a horror film. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are all the more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable. (although the cheesy demonic animation, as shown in the trailer, could have been done far better) It's true that composer Christopher Young seems unable to resist the horror movie clich&eacute; of having horribly over-dramatic music which builds to a climax at the most frightening moment, but for the most part the movie is able to surpass the usual horror clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead, giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest, Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress, delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. Unfortunately, the characters of Campbell Scott (as the faithful, yet assertive prosecutor) and Colm Feore (Erin Bruner's boss at the firm) were really badly written, coming off as the typical antagonistic figures, and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances, despite their one dimensional characters, especially Feore, who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters, and giving them life and personality nonetheless.  While the film does achieve an excellent feeling of unease and suspense, it ultimately fails to live up to the promise made in being such a unique perspective on religious suspense with a strong cast. While it is indeed a unique film and possesses strong performances, it fizzles out due to a lackluster climax in which the verdict of the case is presented.  An interesting take on the horror genre worth seeing, but no classic by an stretch of the imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>More a psychological horro-drama, the film does deliver several "creepy" scares. The scenes that most disturbed me were of the dark shadow man following the priest. All the Emily stuff was essentially a clone of The Exorcist, which over 30 years later, still sets the standard for these clones.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I tried to watch this movie with an open mind. I feel that the origional Exorcist was the most terrifying movie I have ever seen and knew that I shouldn't try to compare the two. This movie not only doesn't live up to William Peter Blattys first movie it doesn't live up to the third one Legion Exorcist III with George C. Scott. Not sure it was even as good as the horrible Heretic or the last two bombs that they did twice cause they stunk.<br /><br />Now to get to Emily Rose. I found this movie to be one thing that a movie based on an exorcism should at least try to be and that is scarey. It wasn't scarey in the least. Not one time. As a court room drama I thought it was boring and blah. If they were going to present this as a court room drama they could have just done that and not passed judgement or had all the hocus pocus mumbo jumbo and let you decide. But they try to make it realistic by having and showing a trial (which I guess did happen in Germany in the real story of a girl with Grand Maul Epileptic Siezures that a bunch of morons convinced themselves was demonic possession and pumped her full of drugs and her haulucinations along with the epilepsy convinced them that she didn't need medical care but a witch doctor priest and they let her starve to death and die of neglect).<br /><br />I thought Laura Linney was boring and Campbell Scott was so ineffective and boring that I didn't even record or recognize him simply cause I didn't care. The movie is just bad and ineffective at what it should be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" was a great surprise for me.  Based on a true event, I was expecting a horror movie like "The Exorcist", but actually it is a great story of trial, with the confrontation of science and religion, but with an agnostic lawyer defending and a religious one accusing a priest.<br /><br />It is the horror plot and the plight of Emily Rose which engages the audience most though. Her story is told in a series of flashbacks that are never disjointed or abstract. It is the realism of her tragic story that is the most frightening thing in the film. It may even make you curious to read up on the true case the film is based upon.<br /><br />My only criticism would be that promising sub-plots end up going nowhere. Don't let this put you off though. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is that most rare of things. A good, contemporary horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>First of all, from reading most of the online reviews, I can tell that most of the viewers missed the point of the entire movie. This movie is not a horror story at all. In fact, it's more of a courtroom drama if you will. The film is centered around a catholic priest named Father Moore played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson. Father Moore is being prosecuted and standing trial because the exorcism he performed on teenage Emily Rose resulted in her death. This is where medicine versus spirituality begins. This movie was done brilliantly because it's not told from a biased prospective. It doesn't try to persuade you to see it from one prospective or the other because both sides are equally expressed. This movie wanted to be politically correct, and it didn't wanna ruffle any feathers from either side. Meanwhile, showing the viewers both sides of the story from two different points of view. By the end of this movie we still can't be sure what actually happened to Emily Rose. Was it demonic possession? or Was it pychosis? However, I will say this, even the non-believers must admit that some of the prosecutions arguements were too far-fetched. Then again, there's always gonna be the so-called "realists" who think that there's a scientific explanation for everything, and then there are "spiritualist" who think that there's a higher power that goes beyond medicine. I am on that side because what I saw was clearly demonic possession, but that's just an opinion, and we all know what they're like. I thought the ending was most impressive because I sat in the theatre waiting for a more in depth explanation as to why the demons attacked her in particular, and in the end that question was answered. Father Moore took the stand and read Emily's final letter that she wrote just before she died. I thought it was so interesting that after a failed attempt to drive the demons out. After Emily's body had been starved, beaten, worn, and attacked by a legion of demons she actually got to see the "Virgin Mary" Of course, she wants to know why she's suffering this way, and of couse it's because she's a "saint" or meant to do God's work. At this time she's given a choice to die and be delivered from all her suffering, or she could stay and be a martyr thus continuing to suffer even more, but the demons still weren't gonna leave her body. At this point, Emily chose to stay, and at that time I thought it was very foolish. However, in hindsight I see it was a very courageous thing to endure. Emily chose to suffer so that her story could be told to the world. So that everyone would know that demons do exist. That was Father Moore's sole purpose to make sure Emily's message got delivered. On the other hand, you have the prosecuters expecting us to believe that Emily's behavior is another form of psychosis or epilepsy treatable by proper medication. They're trying their best to get us to believe that the rest were just muscle constrictions and elevated voices. They want us to believe there was nothing "spiritual" about this whole ordeal. Emily was not possessed, and she didn't suffer the stigmata because she was a person ordained by God, but she wondered outside in a daze and grabbed some barbed wire thus getting the wounds on both her hands. They want us to believe that she stopped taking her medicine that the doctor prescribed, and that's why she is indeed going crazy. In my opinion, that's ridiculous! They didn't wanna entertain the possibility of demonic possession, but they could entertain the thought of that other crap.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>First of all, I was upset that this selection is only available in widescreen format.  The entire time, I was growling about it.  Now, to the movie.  I expected more than what I received.  I wasn't very interested in the court drama, it was like watching Law and Order made into a movie.  I was impressed by the few scenes they showed when Emily Rose was possessed, but that was the only thing that truly held my interest during the entire viewing.  There weren't very many extras, nothing that would really be worth taking a look at in my opinion.  I think a rental is good enough, a lot may disagree, but I can't see spending 20.00 on this.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>We're all dogged by our own little demons that cast doubt, shake our faith in ourselves and pull apart our world. However unlike the character of Emily Rose in this thought provoking drama none of our demons are named Lucifer. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" tackles the issue of faith, how science has displaced our belief system rationalizing everything around us and pulled us out of the psychological barbaric dark ages. The film dares to ask, what if our rational side is wrong? What if there are supernatural forces beyond our comprehension which drive the world around us every day? A compelling tale that mixes fact (the film is based on the true story of Anneliese Michel documented by Dr. Felicitas Goodman in the book "The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel") with the format of a suspense thriller, court room drama and delves into the place of faith and reason in our society. I've seen many people disappointed by the fact that this isn't "The Exorcist". This is a suspense drama NOT a horror film like "The Exorcist". The exorcism itself isn't the focus of this movie but, instead, a sidebar. This is really about the after effects of what happens to Father Moore and Erin.<br /><br />Laura Linney plays defense attorney Erin Bruner an agnostic gun for hire that recently won a highly publicized murder trial. When the head of her firm (Colm Feore) asks her to take on a case for the Catholic Church involving a priest Father Moore (Tom Wilinson) accused of negligent homicide of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) she finds her disbelief melting as she's drawn further and further into the case. It seems that Emily, her family and Father Moore believe that she was possessed by the Devil. The prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) is a man of strong religious beliefs who finds himself convinced that the girl was an undiagnosed epileptic who died because she was denied nutrition, medical help and the medication to control her seizures. This collision of church and state creates more than sparks as Erin discovers disturbing evidence that Father Moore may be right. She's further disturbed when strange things begin to occur to her just as they did to Emily and to Father Moore after the death of Emily. A warning though to fans expecting gore galore--this isn't your typical horror film like "The Devil's Rejects" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Instead, it's more of a suspense thriller using elements of the horror genre.<br /><br />A thought provoking film filled with intelligent performances, some genuinely scary sequences and many unanswered questions, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" may come across as a bit too pat at its conclusion but the ride itself makes the film worth it. This unrated version runs about 3 minutes longer than the theatrical version.<br /><br /> "Exorcism" doesn't have the heavenly glow of the many brightly colored epics and comic book films we've seen this year and that works to the film's advantage. Filled with moody cinematography, striking images and plenty of mystic fog the transfer looks very good. There are some minor issues with compression particularly during one sequence involving heavy fog but, on the whole, the film captures the stark and scary look of its theatrical debut. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround soundtrack becomes genuinely spooky during many of the scenes involving Emily and Father Moore but the more tense court room scenes come across as much more passive involving only the ambience of the court. That stark contrast between these two worlds and experiences make the scenes involving Emily's "breakdown" and exorcism all the more riveting.<br /><br />We get a featurette that examines the history of the film and how the real event inspired the filmmakers to tackle such a daunting project with such an unusually intelligent approach. There's also a featurette that focuses on the visual approach for the film this is interesting as the director is, essentially, telling two different stories from two different points of view. As I mentioned before very few films have balanced the thriller aspects with those looking at the role of faith in our society and "Exorcism", like "The Exorcist", manages to transcend the limitations of the genre. We also get a single deleted scene that, although important from a character development point of view, clearly would have slowed the narrative down and was wisely extracted.<br /><br />The commentary by director/co-writer Scott Derrickson focuses on many aspects of the production from the elements they borrowed from the real case to those of performance and integrating visual effects into the film in a believable fashion. The latter was missing from both "Dominion" and "The Exorcist: The Beginning" and, hence, undermined both those films from becoming little more than a footnote in the suspense/thriller/horror genre. In many respects, Derrickson's film acts almost as a "sequel" to "The Exorcist" (as that film was also based on a real life exorcism they share an incident that occurred as the basis of their projects). Derrickson's comments are intelligent and thoughtful about the project and the challenges he and his cast faced in making the story both compelling and believable.<br /><br />The unrated version (which is the version I saw)doesn't appear to me to feature any more gore than the theatrical version. My guess is that it features scenes that run just a tad bit longer but weren't included in the theatrical version. While the film sputters a bit by the time of the conclusion, the two hour journey was still more than worthwhile. A warning though to fans expecting gore galore--this isn't your typical horror film like "The Devil's Rejects" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The film manages to combine elements of "The Exorcist" and shows like "Law & Order" into a compelling mix all its own. Drawn into the darkness that consumes Emily both Father Moore and Erin are changed forever by their experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>In a little under a month (as of this writing) one of the year's best movies, "The Exorcism Of Emily Rose", will be coming out on DVD.  It's coming in two formats - the theatrical edition and the unrated edition, which presents something of a dilemna.  Normally I Always go for the full uncut version of a movie, even if it means waiting a long time, but now in the case of two movies I've seen at the theater this year (this and "Dark Water") there are unrated editions coming out of what was perfect the first time around.  My curiosity and my instincts are to go with the extended editions ("Underworld", "Dawn Of The Dead" etc. would Not have been as good with Any of the material in the Unrated Extended Editions absent), but there's a vague fear of 'why tamper with perfection' in this case?  I don't know, maybe I would have felt the same if I'd first seen "Underworld" or "Dawn" in the edited theatrical versions, although I can't think of anything that could have been cut from either of those movies that wouldn't have diminished their greatness.  Anyway, the theatrical version is what I've seen, so that's the edition I'm reviewing.<br /><br />  First of all, if you have any qualms about not seeing this movie because of it true life connections (as opposed to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", which despite the hype was only Very loosely based on real events, the basis of the story having already been formulated - according to Tobe Hooper - before he ever heard of the Gein case) I'd urge you to see the movie anyway.  I admit to having had some uneasiness myself, unlike with a series such as "Amityville" which was launched with the support of the people actually involved in the real (I suppose I should say supposedly real, although I find the story credible) events.  "The Exorcism Of Emily Rose" was based on undeniably real events - whether or not you believe in the possession angle - involving real tragedy, so I did have my doubts.<br /><br />  Suffice it to say that the first half hour of the movie annihilated those doubts completely, and not just because of the super quality of the movie.  I can't be specific without risking spoilers, but I'll say that "The Exorcism Of Emily Rose" proved to me that not only was it based on events where it was acceptable to make a movie out of it, but advisable.<br /><br />  Juxtasposing the horror movie, the courtroom drama, and the 'theological/philosophical/ethical issues' movie as if it were the most natural thing on Earth, "The Exorcism Of Emily Rose" tells the tale of an exorcism gone wrong (not a spoiler; that's apparant from the first five minutes) and the ensuing criminal case charging the priest who presided over the exorcism with negligent homicide.  Told, in about equal ratios, in two timeframes - one leading from the aftermath of Emily's death through to the court case and beyond, the other from before Emily's initial possession through to her eventual death - the movie perfectly brings to life a cast of characters that it's impossible not to care deeply about (helped in no small part by the universally brilliant performances).  The battles in and out of the courtroom are heated, but ironically there are no human 'bad guys' in the movie.  The prosecuting attorney believes in his position, actually more strongly than the defending attorney does in hers, at least initially.  The 'bad guy' element is provided by what happened to the Emily Rose character.  In pursuing the route of an actual possession, few movies have ever come close to being so terrifying in their depiction of true, literal Evil.  And yet at the same time there is an abundance of brightness and inspiration in the tale.  Unbelievable suspense and some unforgettably horrifying moments mixed so fluently with the other side of the coin is in itself a great achievement, and "Exorcism" hits all the other marks with equal force: outstanding production, incredible visuals, tremendous musical score, superb character interaction, the whole range of everything you could ask for.<br /><br />  Truly one of the greatest movies of all time, definately one of 2005's very best.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I orginally saw this movie as a rated version and came away very confused. I really enjoyed the unrated version of this film. It made much more sense to me. I don't know the difference in the two, but this one (to me) gave alot more explaination to what had happened. I do give the priest alot of credit going the full length and seeing it through. I won't give it away, so just see the movie and decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I was expecting, based on the commercials I'd heard and seen on the radio and television, a film that would be insanely disturbing and unsettling.  The point of this story runs far deeper than gore and disturbing imagery could conjure.<br /><br />This movie is extremely well produced and performed - and it plays on our fear of possibility.  We've all heard stories of forms of possession and exorcism - never knowing what truly happened in these instances.  This allows the viewer to be drawn into the movie.  The mysterious occurrances portrayed will no doubt stir our suspicions.<br /><br />The courtroom setting utilized brings these unearthly and mysterious elements into the "real world"; the world where reason is supposed to dictate what is perceived as truth.  This exposes us to the ways in which people react to the telling of such experiences.  We are then left to form our own conclusions, drawing on our beliefs and fears: the belief of what is possible and our fear of those very things actually happening to people.  All of this makes for great entertainment and great reflection.  Expecting a film to disturb and rattle me, I was unprepared for what I was exposed to.<br /><br />The DVD contains 3 featurettes: Genesis of the Story, Casting the Movie and Visual Design.  These lengthy featurettes give great insight into the film's production, from the origins of the desire to create a film based on the real life experiences of Anneliese Michel to the means by which the filmmakers visually created the world of torment Emily Rose suffered.  All elements were carefully chosen in creating the "look" of the recalled scenes of Emily's experiences.  Great attention was paid to the color, lighting, sound and dialogue of these scenes - all of which is discussed in the featurette.  There is also a deleted scene included in the special features which wouldn't have done much for the film had it been included.<br /><br />This film did not turn out to be what I had expected, yet it entertained me in a different way and had effects that lasted beyond the viewing of the movie.  It will please fans of horror movies, thrillers, dramas, etc...</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Every once in a while a thoughtful horror film comes along, one that creeps the audience out and makes it ponder at the same time. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is one of those films, written by Paul Harris Boardman and director Scott Derrickson, who were inspired by a true story. When a young woman named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) dies of starvation and self-inflicted injuries at her family's Midwestern farm house, the State prosecutes her priest, Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson) for negligent homicide, claiming that his encouragement to abandon medical treatment for epilepsy led to Emily's death. Emily had been suffering from frightening hallucinations, seizures, and violent behavior which she came to blame on demonic possession and believe could only be cured by exorcism. Ambitious agnostic attorney Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) defends Father Moore and the possibility that Emily's affliction may have been spiritual, while the practical, church-going prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) lays the blame for Emily's death squarely on religious superstition that fed her psychosis.<br /><br />"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is part courtroom drama, part horror movie. This turns out to be a good combination, as the courtroom scenes allow Emily's story to be told in flashbacks, which paces the horror evenly throughout the film. And the horror punctuates the courtroom drama so that it never becomes plodding. The first thing that struck me about this film was the quality of the cast. Laura Linney and Campbell Scott in a horror flick? This obviously isn't schlock. Great character actors bring much-needed credibility to this spooky tale of the maybe-supernatural. Campbell Scott's role as the prosecutor, a religious man himself, brings stronger conflict to the courtroom than if it were simply a secular prosecution. Jennifer Carpenter's physicality as Emily Rose is remarkable. She's a sweet, earnest woman who does some very freaky stuff, terrifying herself and everyone else. Carpenter's incredible physical performance allowed the use of visual effects only as subtle enhancement, grounding supernatural events in realism.<br /><br />The second thing that struck me about "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is how good the film looks. Director Scott Derrickson has an impressively cinematic vision. He took great care with framing, colors, and production design. The courtroom scenes are especially captivating, thanks to production designer David Brisbin, who found a middle ground between realistically dreary institutional courtrooms and Frank Lloyd Wright. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" claims to be "based on a true story", but "inspired by" is probably more accurate. The real case took place in the 1970s in Germany. A devoutly religious woman named Anneliese Michel, who had been epileptic and psychotic for 6 years, died in 1976 of self-imposed starvation after a series of exorcisms. Two clergymen and her parents were brought to trial on charges of negligent homicide. In the real case, it was clearer than in the movie that Miss Michel's problems were medical. But it was also clear that she had exhausted the offerings of the medical community, which was unable to successfully treat her after years of trying.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): Bonus features include 1 deleted scene with optional director's commentary, 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In "Genesis of the Story" (19 min), writer/producer Paul Harris Boardman and writer/director Scott Derrickson talk about the film's themes and researching cases of demonic possession. The film's cast also discuss their characters. We hear how Derrickson found his actors in "Casting the Movie" (12 min), and Jennifer Carpenter talks about her role.  "Visual Design" (18 min) includes discussion of Scott Derrickson's visual philosophy for the film, inspired Francis Bacon paintings. He and production designer David Brisbin talk a lot about he color palette. Costume designer Tish Monaghan talks about trying not to give the impression of a particular era. And visual effects supervisor Michael Shelton, of "Captive Audience", talks about his team's contributions. There is a good audio commentary by writer/director Scott Derrickson. He discusses the origins of the project and his intentions with the film, providing a scene-by-scene commentary on the actors, characters, visual design, pacing, sets, filming, and some technical details. Subtitles for the film are available in English only.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Well I thought this would be a horror movie for one thing. The previews showed nothing but a girl going out of her mind and going insane from the demons taking over her body. Well that's only about a half hour of the movie. The rest of the movie is courtroom mumbo jumbo. It's bad enough all my wife watches is Law and Order and every CSI, but when I want to watch a horror movie, I don't want to see more courtroom babble. This is not your daddy's Exorcist.<br /><br />The movie was well acted and the girl that played Emily did a great job, but there just wasn't enough to keep me interested. For a movie about a young girl being possessed, the movie is more about the defense attorney who defends the priest who is charged with criminal manslaughter or negligence or something. I'm sorry but it takes more than a lawyer waking up at 3:00 AM and discovering her front door is unlocked to frighten me.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is when the exorcism is being performed and the climatic part out in the barn when the demon finally admits he is the same demon that possessed Cain and Nero.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this DVD at the pawn shop for next to nothing. Like I said I was expecting a horror movie. This movie could barely get a 13 year old girl scared.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>If your a gullible person!?! then this dramatic thriller might change the out-look of your tiny god fearing existence!

Yet, for all its production histrionics it ultimately sucks, and sucks boulders, because one never relates to it -- which is of course a blessing given the grotesque world it is about -- but I mean relate to it in a way that would make us care about any of its characters and consequently the film itself.<br /><br />Thematically, it straddles between a kooky courtroom drama and a pandering ode to The Ring/Dark Water crowd. Our eponymous Emily Rose has already succumbed to the devil -- literally, we are led to believe -- thanks to a priest who meant to exorcise her. The film is thus split into a legal trial and some flashbacks detailing a somewhat labored version of what may have led to her death/murder.<br /><br />This sets us up for a plush serving of all the standard-issue thrills one expects from such endeavors: a disheveled protagonist clutched by evil spirits, hectic sound bursts, strange eye colorations, sudden 360-degree cranial rotations, leaden-footed testimonies, and that inevitably sweaty closing from the defence attorney.<br /><br />One soon wonders what the "Based on a True Story" moniker really accounted for. To the extent that the real life trial may have led to some seminal litigation pitting medicine against theology, it might be true in a WMDs-in-Iraq sort of a way. But there is precious little here to engage true horror fans, with the possible exception of some convincing acting. I have never paid attention to Campbell Scott before but found myself respecting him in this venture. Linney is rather different here from her spate of softie roles as well, she rises to the occasion with a passion.<br /><br />Too bad that the occasion never seems to warrant much rising to. It fares decently for a venture with ace cameramen and predictable imagination, but that is clearly too sparse a reason to recommend a film for theatre or a rental. Anyone but ardent horror fans should do well to catch it when it hits a channel near you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Based on a true story of a girl that dies while a priest is performing an exorcism. Was it abuse? Was it a natural death? The always reliable Laura Linney stars as the high-powered lawyer who is defending the priest, nicely played by Tom Wilkinson. The movie's namesake is harrowingly played by Jennifer Carpenter, whom I only new from her role on Dexter (as his sister). She turns in a very strong performance here, showing a different side than her turn as Deb Morgan. The movie overall is pretty good, but I'm always a little cynical, and a big part of me wonders how closely this follows the facts of the true story. But regardless of the truth, the film does raise some interesting questions about the place where religion and law intersect, such as where does belief end, and psychosis begin? Hmmm...</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE had an excellent start to what could have been a really outstanding upgrade to exorcism films of old (obviously I'm thinking about THE EXORCIST). But the ending had so many strikes against it that I nearly turned the movie off.<br /><br />The initial premise of the film was wonderful, though, making it appear as if the audience would decide what really happened to Emily (Jennifer Carpenter). Showing back-story during the court case in which a priest is on trial for her death intrigued me. The courtroom drama unfolded with two aspects being shown: one moment we see the medical possibilities of what Emily may have gone through ("Was she an epileptic with a form of psychosis?"), while the next we're introduced to the possibility of demonic possession ("Can an epileptic be conscious during a convulsion and speak Aramaic?") I was spellbound by the medical/religious dueling and I gave a bit of credence to both sides ...for a while.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson plays Father Moore, the Rose family parish priest, who was assigned the task of performing the exorcism by the local arch-diocese. But the exorcism goes horribly awry and "the demons" remain in Emily. She deteriorates and eventually dies ...which is where the film starts. We watch a medical examiner enter the Rose house and proclaim that he can't prove Emily's death was by natural causes, so Father Moore is arrested for negligent homicide for not seeking medical attention.<br /><br />The Catholic church has an attorney firm on retainer and asks for their rising star lawyer, Erin Bruner (Laura Linney, THE SQUID AND THE WHALE), to represent Father Moore. But taking on the case may just be the start for Ms. Bruner. Father Moore tells her that "evil forces surround this trial," and it is here that the film begins to unravel. Instead of leaving it to the viewer to decide what might have happened to Emily, the film becomes a heavy-handed treatise on God, sainthood, and excessive religious symbolism. This completely deflated any possibility of a medical diagnosis, thus ending any after-movie discussion about what the message of the film might be about.<br /><br />Conveniently, Erin Bruner finds a locket on the ground with her initials inscribed on it, giving sledgehammer understanding as to why she decides to continue with the case ("I found that locket, of all people, and I guess it means maybe I'm on the right path"). Give me a break. Strike one!<br /><br />Then Father Moore miraculously produces a letter that Emily had wrote before she died, telling everyone that because Emily was a good person, and made a tough spiritual decision, she "might be considered for sainthood in the future." Excuse me? Sainthood for one action? And what about the wounds to Emily's hands and feet. Stigmata, of course. Wait. Stigmata? On a possessed person? Strike two!<br /><br />And then we get to the sentencing of Father Moore and the ridiculous "recommendation" by the jury. Would a judge really, honestly, legally, consider that? Maybe. But was it believable? Absolutely not. Strike three! You're out!<br /><br />Had the film retained its "is it medical or spiritual" uncertainty throughout its length, I felt this would've been a fantastic success. But as it sits now, it's just a pile of rubbish. What a shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>This is a religious propaganda masquerading as horror film. The courtroom scenes were interesting but ridiculous, mostly because the filmmakers try to convince us by any means that this possession really happened. The exorcism sequence is scary (sort of) and thrilling yet too long in my opinion. Jennifer Carpenter does an okay job screaming and making idot funny faces, while Laura Linney's talent is once again waste in a movie that doesn't do her justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>I enjoy a good horror story, and this one is that much better by being inspired by the true story of Anneliese Michel, a German woman who experienced a similar progression of events to those depicted in this movie.  I found the movie to be eerie and chilling, and a great movie to inspire thought about the existence of demons in our modern world.  The movie adroitly avoids determining whether there are demons, leaving each viewer to make their own decision.  Though I have always been skeptical regarding stories of possession, this movie certainly was convincing in its portrayal.<br /><br />Emily Rose starts life rather unremarkably.  She was brought up in a family that was strongly, but not extremely, religious.  She went away to college on a full scholarship, the pride of her family.  After a while, Emily began experiencing hallucinations, and she became convinced that demons possessed her.  A number of physical manifestations of Emily Rose's symptoms were very realistic and frightening.  Eventually Emily Rose requested an exorcism be performed after medical treatment seemed to fail.  Soon after the exorcism was performed, Emily Rose died.<br /><br />The trial of the priest that performed the exorcism is the central plot to this movie.  We see Emily Rose's life through the priest's eyes.  The story builds in terror as Emily's symptoms increase.  When the priest's agnostic attorney experiences bizarre manifestations, I started really getting chills down my spine.  I am unable to provide more details without giving away so much that there will be no need to watch the movie.<br /><br />I have always thought that the best horror movies rely on psychology.  This movie does just that.  The amount of blood is minimal, though some of the images are horrifying.  I was unable to see anything in the movie that I thought deserved more than a PG-13 rating, which makes the unrated version a lot of hype, but what is there enhances the chill factor substantially.<br /><br />Hollywood rarely attempts a movie with this level of sophistication.  When it does, it seems like there are inadequate rewards.  In the case of this movie, I confirm Siskel and Roeper's two thumbs up.  Fans of psychological horror and those who have always believed in demon possession will find this movie sufficiently horrific that they will want to watch this one more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>Spooky, Creepy, Scary, Suspense are words that describe The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  Based on a true story this film "scares the stuffin" out of you the old fashioned way . . . with suspense.  It proves that a film need not be a slasher movie to be frightening.  Nor does a film need to be stupid.  This film, set as a courtroom drama, delivers its emotional punch while presenting the viewer with a thought provoking subject, the conflict between religion and science.  The film also manages to treat religion in a respectful manner without forcing viewers to believe.  The director does a wonderful job of completing a task that at the first seems impossible.<br /><br />The film has its problems.  It probably isn't gory enough for teens raised on slasher films.  It probably is too frightening for the youngest viewers.  Its title probably will discourage thoughtful viewers who shy away from horror flicks.  It doesn't leave the viewer with a "feel good' ending, appreciated by those who go to the movies for light escapism.<br /><br />In short, it is a good film, but might be overlooked by people conditioned toward formula films.  It attempts to be a horror film for thinking persons.  Is there a market for such a production?  Only time will tell.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I remember when THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE first came out.  I was highly suspicious of yet another girl-gets-possessed movie from hollywood. I mean, hadn't Linda Blair pretty much embodied that idea ever since 1973? Besides, EMILY ROSE? Isn't that a bit too much like AUDREY ROSE? So, I put off watching it. Silly me! After having just watched EMILY last night, I can admit to being totally wrong, mistaken, and pleasantly surprised. It's a well-told story, played out as a courtroom drama, w/ most of the demonic happenings shown as flashbacks. Both Tom Wilkinson and Laura Linney are superb as the priest and his defense attorney respectively. Of course, my favorite scenes were those of Emily herself, played w/ violent glee by Jennifer Carpenter (QUARANTINE, tv's DEXTER). While the prosecutor hammered away w/ cold logic during the trial, Emily's plight was played out in a beautifully tragic fashion, allowing Carpenter to swing wildly between calm, lucid moments, and animalistic frenzy. I was impressed! It was also fun to see "Deb Morgan" in such an unrestrained role. All done without 10,000 F-bombs, puke, or a single 360 degree head-twist! Amazing!

In my book, that's excellent, although I would not recommend watching this alone at night. Or at least not alone period. The movie was very well done and captivating. My best friend and I absolutely enjoyed this Exorcism. It ropes you in from the beginning with a riveting tale based on a true story. It's something I will no doubt watch again and again, though only in the company of friends who don't mind helping me check my closets before they go home.

Emily believed she was possessed by six demons, and although authorized by Emily and he parents, Father Moore is accused of negligent homicide, since he had suggested Emily to interrupt the use of medications for epilepsy. In order to avoid a scandal, the Archdiocese hires the successful, ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner, and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas. Along the days, there is a battle between science and religion in the court. There are some very interesting scenes in this movie, that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. And an incredible performance by Jennifer Carpenter. This is not a full-blooded horror movie, but definitely one of the most unsettling, disturbing and thought-provoking dramas, seeing Emily possessed is terrifying.

As Emily's story is told in flashbacks during the trial's testimony, the viewer, like Linney's character, begins to realize that the most unbelievable aspect of the case--that demons and evil exist outside of ourselves--might just be at the bottom of the case.<br /><br />Excellent performances from everyone, sharp writing.  This film doesn't have the overwhelming dread that THE EXORCIST left with audiences but its ambition is a little more involved: it asks questions for the audience to answer for themselves.<br /><br />If you're looking for an artless, empty slaughter house of a horror movie, then move on.  There are plenty of slasher and zombie fests out there.<br /><br />But if you're looking for an intelligent, well-made film that doesn't limit itself to one side or another, then check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>You have two camps of people with this film.  Some knock it totally saying it is in no way a horror movie.  Others see it for what it is.  It has never been called a horror film .  It has a presence of horror in a different way and is a true story that is more a courtroom drama that explores how the legal system deals with the case of a girl who died after an exorcism and while under the direct care of a priest.  Was she epileptic and psychotic?  Or was she possessed.  Medical facts verses spiritual facts.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST was a story that had the exorcism and gore galore in the forefront with the story of its characters in the background.  THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is about an exorcism with the strong story in the forefront.  This is a 5 star film.  We have three of the best actors of this decade - Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Scott Campbell.  These are hardcore actors and each tackles their role with strong intensity.<br /><br />Now before I continue I want to comment on how the film appears in blu ray.  It is absolutely astounding.  The 1080p high def picture is crystal clear and the truehd audio will blow you away.  This must be viewed with a 5.1 theater system.  I have seen this film many times and the clarity in blu ray makes the courtroom scenes seem as if I am watching a play and the actors are in my room.  The film does manage to expertly show the progression of Emily Rose's deterioration and if you view it with blu ray and a theater system the sound will have you on the edge of your seat and jumping out of your skin.  (Important note, if you watch DEXTER, it is great fun to see Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose.  She is superb.)<br /><br />Blu ray allows the viewer to see the emotions of the actos much more clearly.  Laura Linney is the attorney defending the priest accused of Emily's death and she is at first a self professed agnostic.  But the film is largely about how the whole affair affects her.  At the end she is very troubled and doesn't know what she is.  But her life is totally changed.  Even with all the great acting the film in my opinion belongs to Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter.<br /><br />If you want a standard B horror film with blood and gore this film is not for you.  This film is an insightful, intelligent courtroom drama about a very unique case and it is scary, suspenseful, troubling and dramatic but for different reasons.  Excellent film and even if you own the dvd you MUST purchase it on blu ray.  It is a demonstration of blu ray at its best.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I watched "Emily Rose" when it first came out on DVD a year or so back, but for the life of me could't remember it? This past weekend I dug the DVD out of the closet for another view.<br />While there are some spooky and eerie images found in the film, the movie actually plays out more like a "Law & Order" episode than a horror film. And while Emily Rose gets titled billing, the story really focuses on the Laura Linney attorney character Erin Bruner, and her journey from skeptic to believer. The cast does a really great job, Jennifer Carpenter does a good job as the title character and Tom Wilkinson strikes a perfect chord as the priest accused of allowing Emily to die while under his care.<br />But, if you are in the mood for a horror film, you may want to pick up something else. "Emily Rose" is a decent courtroom drama, along the lines of "A Few Good Men", except in this film, the case deals with possible demonic possession as opposed to a marine's death.<br />It's not a bad film by any means, well directed, and does its best to maintain a spooky mood (but doesn't quite achieve that goal). If you are looking for straight up horror look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>With such a recent plethora of movies based on torture and gore to achieve their chills, it is refreshing to find a movie that retains some intelligence and still manages to get a few spine-chilling moments, with barely a speck of blood or guts to be seen.<br />First and foremost, this is a court room drama. And yet there is an interesting twist, because the subject is one based on belief, not on facts.. and it makes for some interesting moral questions.  The movie starts at the tail end of events as the priest is taken into custody.  A young woman, Emily Rose, has died in his care following an exorcism.  Was it neglect on his part keeping her from medical care for a psychotic epilepsy condition, or were his efforts justified and in fact medical intervention nullified the effects of the exorcism?  We are led through the events in flashback throughout the course of the trial, sometimes to eery effect, as the priest refuses to cut a deal and insists on telling Emily's story to a jury.<br />At the centre of the movie is the relationship between Laura Linney's jaded and agnostic defence counsel and her client the priest played by Tom Wilkinson.  The two leads play with conviction, but Jennifer Carpenter's physically demanding role of Emily Rose should not be overlooked.<br />Admirably, the tone is not one of full on shocks and scares - there is a neutrality which gives you space to make your own mind up, and yet allow you to see events as the Father Moore and Emily saw them.  It's this intelligence towards the subject which sets this apart from most other recent horror movies and makes this worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>The trailer of this flick is misleading.<br /><br />A somewhat decent courtroom drama, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is not a horror movie as the advertising would have you believe.  It's an okay put together study of was she/wasn't she possesed melodrama that doesn't fully answer that question, but that's about it.  The suspense in this film is stillborn and the chills are fleeting.  When first released the marketing campaign led the wary viewer to the conclusion that they would be subject to a new fangled 'EXORCISM' movie with a dark and dreary plot regarding a new, fresh take on demonic possesion.  Instead this motion picture is more of a character study for LAURA LINNEY's lawyer character, who strugles with the assumption that her  client (the exorcising priest, TOM WILKINSON) is or isn't witnessing the supernatual.  All of the supernatural events are witnessed in quick flashbacks which were all shown in the previews and aren't too unsettling at that.  I was waiting for some huge plot twist at the end which never came and made the proceedings even more laborious.  Given the subject matter this could've been creepier and better on a whole, instead the viewer is given the kind of movie typical of the SCI-FI channel sans any action or twisted humor.  A well made but run of the mill drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>With all due respect to the reviewer Shashank, this movie was never meant to appeal to the fluffy scarefest audience of recent years... the "Ringu" crowd. Ideally, the audience that will find this movie a refreshing change of pace will be those of us over the age of 35 (like Ebert and Roper... WAY over 35).<br /><br />And as for Shashank's "WMDs in Iraq" comment.... guess what? If one took a room full of biological agents, and hid them in a region as big as California... it would be near impossible to find this buried supply. One cannot prove they are present, but this doesn't remove all suspicion that they are there.<br /><br />Which leads me to the case concerning  possession and exorcism... the evidence regarding the reality of these things is minimal... albeit greater than most people realize. But keep this slogan in mind... "THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE is NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE."<br /><br />If something remains "unproven"... whether it's current WMDs in Iraq or the actual possession of the girl given the pseudonym "Emily Rose"... one is NOT compelled to believe in such things. Yes, doubt and skepticism are healthy. Transversely, one cannot definitively DISMISS the reality of such things. They remain UNPROVEN, not DISPROVEN.<br /><br />Also, there are evidences that fall short of "absolute proof," but they are still evidences of value. I have personally heard the recorded voice contortions during the exorcism this movie is based on, and it would be the type of rasp that would hurt a normal throat after five minutes. This seemingly possessed girl would go on and on in this gutteral voice for hours.<br /><br />The movie plunges into actual theology, much as the original "Exorcist" novel did decades ago. I'm glad to see the return of intelligent horror. For me, a scary movie is actually scarier when it's not slapping us with a startling scene every three minutes. Less is more!!<br /><br />Crawling, decaying corpses and cgi- effects are out there, for the new generation of fluff movie goers. It's nice to have a movie for us older people on occasion.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>The timing of this film could not be more propitious as the courts struggle with Darwinism, Creationism, and separation of church and state, creating embittered conversations about fact versus faith.  The fact that this film adaptation of an actual event results in a work of such touching tenderness is due to the imagination and artistry of writer Paul Harris Boardman and co-writer and director Scott Derrickson, as well as a fine cast of some of our best actors.  This is not a horror flick: this is a thinking person's film that has the courage to discuss the possibilities of things on one can explain.<br /><br />Father Moore (a brilliant Tom Wilkinson) is a priest being tried for negligent homicide in the death of a young college student Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a parishioner who sought his help feeling she was possessed by demons.  The archdiocese hires pragmatic, agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney in another superlative role) to defend Father Moore.  The prosecuting attorney is strongly religious Methodist Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott in an atypical role well realized).  The film is basically a courtroom drama: the polar sides being scientific (medical) facts versus spiritually based possibilities and the writing for both lawyers is bitingly incisive.  Mixed into the testimony and preparation for the trial are flashbacks to the events leading up to Emily's death, including the gradual possession of Emily's body by six demons and her reaction to the possession, and the exorcism performed by Father Moore.  The priest does not fear jail or loss of clerical collar: his only concern is that he be able to tell Emily's shared story, a story that raises more questions in everybody's minds than providing legal results of the trial.<br /><br />Laura Linney is extraordinary as the agnostic hardened lawyer whose very being is shaken by the case which she tries. The nuances of her character are so well conveyed that we come to understand the un-understandable as she sees it.  Likewise Tom Wilkinson and Campbell Scott shine, as do all of the minor characters.  The cinematography of Tom Stern  is among the most artful of the year and the musical score by Christopher Young is intensely atmospheric. This is not yet another in the endless line of horror flicks, though the Para scientific manifestations of demon possession are graphically enacted (not my cup of tea but necessary for the story).  This is a much more important story than that and one that would be helpful in aiding understanding if both agnostics/pragmatists and spiritual people watched and listened carefully.  Highly recommended.

I had never seen Emily Rose so I gave it a try this past weekend (and the price sure was right for a used copy here on Amazon!). It turned out that those other reviewers that I referred to were correct; Emily Rose is a well done, well acted, thought provoking and scary movie told in a sequence of flashbacks from two points of view: those who believe it was demonic possession and those who would discredit and even prosecute the priest responsible for Emily's exorcism and ultimate death.<br /><br />Jennifer Carpenter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N0QEJA">Dexter</a>) is Emily and while she never goes completely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001992NW4">Regan</a>, she gets pretty close at times and does a heck of job creeping the viewer out. Yeah, in fact Director Scott Derrickson keeps viewers completely creeped out for the whole film.<br /><br />According to the opening of the movie, Emiliy Rose is "based on a true story".  Derrickson uses some clever deception tactics to make you think that the characters and events in Emily Rose actually happened, but in reality the movie is mostly Hollywood imagination that is quite loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel. (If you look up Anneliese Michel on Wikipedia you'll find a brief description of her events and a link to a 90 minute tape if Anneliese's actual exorcism...which I wouldn't have the guts to play if you paid me!)<br /><br />I'd highly recommend checking out Emily Rose if, like me for whatever reason, you missed it back in 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>This is not so much a horror movie (though there is an ample amount of creepiness) as much as it is an absorbing courtroom thriller.  The cast is first rate.  Laura Linney, Campbell Scott and Tom Wilkinson bring immense talent to the roles of courtroom combatants in trial over the death of a young woman who was allegedly possessed.  The movie leaves little doubt that she was - the question becomes whether the priest's intervention constituted negligence which led to Emily Rose's death.<br /><br />There are theological undertones in the film, good versus evil and he forces of evil at work in the world today.  It is a rebuff to atheists and agnostics alike; to acknowledge the role of the Devil must admit that as a foil there exists a God.  The movie avoids any preachy tone and it is supposedly based on a true story.<br /><br />The ending appears to be a less than satisfying "half a loaf" conclusion, and I will say no more lest I spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie.<br /><br />A good film!</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>I'm usually wary about movies that trade on the Catholic Church's use of the exorcism ritual. It's a rare moviemaker who will pass up the chance to show compassion for victims or exploring the nature of evil than of exploiting dark supernatural forces for a big box office. TEER promised to take the phenomeenon of demonic possession seriously, but fell into using overworn cliches and plot devices.<br /><br />TEER purports to be based on the story of a young woman who supposedly died in the midst of an exorcism. A young woman goes off to college, and soon starts seeing and hearing scary things. She is found in odd, rigid, almost impossible postures. Her condition is not relieved by medical doctors, so her parents bring in their local parish priest, who attempts to drive out demons that he believes are possessing her. When she dies (this is no spoiler, as it happens in the first minutes of the film) the priest reponsible is charged with reckless homicide.<br /><br />The film is laid out as a combination horror flick and courtroom drama, with flashbacks between legal events of the present with dramatized scenes of the past. Laura Linney, as the agnostic defense counsel Erin Bruner, does a fine job as a straightlaced and hardworking attorney moving up in her legal firm. Jennifer Carpenter  is extraordinary as the possessed girl. She has such incredible control of her facial features that it's hard to tell where she leaves off and the special effects group steps in. Tom Wilkinson as Father Richard Moore is quite convincing as the humble man of God determined to get Emily Rose's story out in court.<br /><br />It seemed at first that Director Scott Derrickson was trying to film an exocism movie that could be read from a naturalistic point of view as well as a supernatural one. If so, he was gradually overwhelmed by the gravitational pull of cinematic conventions that are trotted out when the Devil makes an appearance. There are scary frosty window panes, people whose eyes go black, morphing paintings and frightening nighttime visitations. The victim, portrayed as completely normal and innocent (a farm girl, even!) is suddenly making weird inhuman vocalizations, injuring herself, frightening animals and running around in the rain in her nightgown. Have we seen this before? But is the girl crazy, or possessed? The film destroys the mystery by having various characters tormented in a peculiar, signature manner. Would the real Devil be as transparent about leaving clues as the Riddler in the Batman series? More damning (!) is the way the film cynically twists the true story of Anneliese Michel, upon which the film was supposedly based. Look it up for yourselves.<br /><br />TEER introduces a few unwelcome twists to the genre. That being medicated interferes with exorcism was bothersome from a theological point of view. Either the name of Jesus expels demons or it does not. And the weird "deus ex machina" denouement seemed tacked on and unconvincing. If you need to suddenly inject a heavenly visitor into the script to give your film credence, you're in trouble. The courtroom theatrics and the final verdict were also unconvincing. I had a hard time believing such nonsense would be permitted in a US court of law. And instead of telling me that Emily Rose's grave was a pilgrimage spot, couldn''t you show me a few dropping by?<br /><br />This is the rare DVD in which the extras actually dimish the film. Learning that some scenes were shot with a full-scale anatomical model did not impress me. The interview material with director Derrickson was banal and pompous -- I don't believe for an instant that he read 2000 books about demonic possession. The interview with the set designers was interesting, though. The movie has an odd, gray/blue washed out palette that they worked hard to create and maintain.<br /><br />Whether intended to play against the genre or, in spite of some fine performances and a few scary jump scenes, The Exorcism of Emily Rose was just another tired old devil flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Scott Derrickson, 2005)<br /><br />There are some movies that, when I see them for the first time, simply blow me away. There are some movies that don't really have much of an effect when I'm watching them, but that creep me out later, upon reflection. There are very, very few films that both blow me away and creep me out later for thoroughly different reasons. In fact, I can only think of one-- the original Candyman (which got me when I watched it for the final scene, and kept me awake nights for weeks afterwards because of the Oscar-worthy sound effects editing in the parking garage scene)-- that did it to me before I saw The Exorcism of Emily Rose.<br /><br />This is a "wow" movie-- one that, if I were writing reviews for the local paper, would get simply that word as a review. It is a fantastic movie from beginning to end, with its positives far outweighing its negatives. If you ignore the rest of the review, here's all you need to know: see this movie.<br /><br />I heard a pundit, back when it originally came out, refer to this movie as "Law and Order with demons." To an extent, that's true; the movie centers not around Emily Rose (White Chicks' Jennifer Carpenter) herself, who is already dead as the film opens, but around Erin Bruner (Laura Linney of The Mothman Prophecies), an attorney for the law firm representing the diocese where the priest in the case, Father Moore (The Full Monty's Tom Wilkinson), attempted to exorcise Emily. Emily's story itself is told in flashbacks as Erin gets more of the story from Moore and others who knew her. (Okay, so maybe it's actually CSI with demons.)<br /><br />As with most horror films of this nature-- though in retrospect, it's hard to call The Exorcism of Emily Rose a horror film-- the real disturbance for the viewer is going to come in the subtle things. The changes in Emily's appearance as the story goes on are obvious, but there are subtleties that really kick the viewer in the teeth. You might not even notice them on a conscious level, but they're the things that make all the difference in making this look real. (The devil is in the details, indeed.) But behind the "we're out to give you nightmares" aspect lies excellent filmmaking; the camerawork, script, pacing, etc. are all wonderful. The acting is good, though no one turns in a truly great performance. That said, Linney is far, far, better here than she was in The Mothman Prophecies. Wilkinson, as always, is on his game (though the film's one major failing is that his attempt at a rural American accent is, at times, pathetic to the point of laughability). Colm Feore, as Erin's boss, has a small but wonderful part that makes the most of Feore's innate creepiness. The real pleasure here, though, is Carpenter, who finally gets a solid role with meat in it, and turns out to have quite the appetite.<br /><br />The final straw, of course, is that (unlike The Amityville Horror, whatever Andrew Douglas wants you to believe) The Exorcism of Emily Rose is based on a true story. (How closely based, I have no idea, as I have not yet tracked down The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel, the book on which this film is based; it's been out of print for a while, and to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been reissued. Odd, that.)<br /><br />Flirting with inclusion in my all-time-100-best list. Really, Tom Wilkinson's accent is its only stumbling block. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>A priest is charged with wrongful death when a young woman dies while he is performing an exorcism. A hot-shot attorney defends the priest even though she doesn't believe in the Devil or God.<br /><br />Based on a true story, this is a thoughtful movie that will keep your interest. If you are looking for any of the head spinning, puking like the exorcist you wouldn't find it in this movie. There are some scary scenes, but the movie itself isn't scary because it is told through flashbacks in the courtroom. also the question of possessed or psycho is not really answered at the end of the movie. Maybe they are planning a sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>There are some shots in this film that are stunning, horrifying in a novel way, without any gore or splatter. And the director achieves an eeriness, a tension in little things.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional throughout. All the main characters are played with true intelligence behind their eyes. You can tell there is really someone home there. (In the case of Emily Rose, there may be more than one intelligence behind her eyes.)<br /><br />Campbell Scott, playing the prosecuting attorney, was a special surprise. I had been vaguely aware of him as a character actor in other films, but he comes into his own here. The DVD commentary identifies him as the son of actor George C. Scott. He performs his courtroom scenes with the same intensity his father was known for, but without any over-the-top tone of antagonsim.<br /><br />However, I have several problems with the movie. I would have liked the DVD commentary to elaborate on just how much it is based on real events. But the commentary is silent and disappointing on this point - and so leads me to believe that any connection to a real person or real events must be tenuous at best.<br /><br />But more crucially, I had a problem with the courtroom scenes. The battle lines seem to be falsely drawn. On the one side is the defendent, a priest being prosecuted for treating Emily Rose's condition with an exorcism rather than by referring her for further psychological help. On the other side is a loose consortium of psychologists who contend that is was criminal not to have continued treating Emily Rose for - perhaps schizophrenia, perhaps some manic-depressive disorder.<br /><br />I don't believe this is even remotely the way any actual court case would have aligned. First of all, it seems much likelier that if any criminal charges were brought in such a case, they would have been brought against Emily Rose's parents for failure to get her continued, modern medical care. It would have been a charge similar to one that has been brought against Christian Scientist parents who have insisted that their children be treated only with prayer in instances where those children had some specific, operable medical conditions. That is what should have been at issue here. Did Emily Rose's parents have a right to maintain a strictly religious interpretation of Emily's symptoms? Does the State have a right to compel parents to submit their children to modern medical practice?<br /><br />But even given the movie's premise that is was the priest who would be prosecuted - the only medical people arrayed against him were psychologists/psychoanalysts presenting the vague alternative that Emily had a mental problem. In the DVD commentary, the director does state that he was striving for an unspecified time frame for this movie. He wanted it to look as if it could have taken place anywhere from the 1970's to the present. Certainly though, the action takes place in recent decades. And some more strict medical explanations of Emily's condition would have been available.<br /><br />Oliver Sach's 'Awakenings' discovery would have been known. So the possibility that Emily had contracted some encephalitis sort of illness that led to catatonia, convulsions, and hallucinations could have been entertained. Or, enough might have been known about the genetic nature of Huntington's Disease to suggest that as a possibility for her illness. In Huntington's Disease, the severity of the illness and its time of onset depends upon how many repetitions of a certain sequence of nucleic bases exist in a gene on the victim's Chromosome 4. The more repetitions, the earlier and harder a person is hit with rigidity and hallucinations.<br /><br />I don't say that either an encephalitis germ or a Huntington's gene would have been the answer to Emily's condition. I'm only saying that some such concrete medical explanation for such symptoms would have been advanced in recent decades. The possible explanations for such suffering would not have been limited to vague psychological diagnoses - 'maybe some sort of schizophrenia, maybe some sore of, ah, manic depression.'<br /><br />So by failing to represent the real issues any court action brought in such a case would have revolved around - the whole movie loses credibility. I realize it would have been harder to maintain dramatic tension with the introduction of germ and DNA testimony. However I think it needed to be done. As things stand, this movie gives the Devil more than his due - and diminishes the possibility of Him in the process.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is one of those rare modern-day horror films that actually thrills. Unlike most recent entries in the genre, the film does not rely on overdone violence and grotesque images to scare its audience. Instead, it uses story and atmosphere to create hysteria and mounting suspense. The film has a great story to tell, and it tells it well.<br /><br />This is possibly the first horror film ever set mostly in a courtroom. The film chronicles the trial of a Catholic priest (Tom Wilkinson.) He is accused of negligence that resulted in the death of 19-year-old Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), whom he believed was possessed by demonic spirits.<br /><br />A lawyer (Laura Linney) whose star is rising takes the case at the behest of her boss. Unfortunately, he seems more interested in serving the interests of the local Catholic diocese than that of the client, who refuses to take a plea bargain because he wants to tell Emily's story in court and let the jury (and the audience) decide what really happened.<br /><br />The possession and exorcism scenes all take place in flashback while various parties give their testimony. This technique allows the film to portray Emily's suffering a la' Rashomon, but with a significant difference: There is little disagreement about what actually happened to Emily. It is all a question of interpretation.<br /><br />By giving us the facts as seen through the eyes of the various characters, the film is asking the audience to be the jury that decides the case. All of the information that is provided is intentionally left out in the open for the viewers.<br /><br />The exorcism scenes are scary and creepy, but they are not of the pea soup-spewing kind. The film tries to ground itself in the reality believed in by the priest who is on trial for Emily's murder, so the horror is more psychological than grotesque.<br /><br />The courtroom aspect of the film may put off some horror fans, but I think it works extremely well and results in a great deal of tension and suspense, albeit very few, if any, surprises.<br /><br />Structuring the story as a courtroom drama increases the horror because it takes place in a believable context. Whether you think Emily is sick or possessed, what happens to her is almost beyond endurance. Moreover, since the fate of the priest rests on the trial's outcome, it is clear that the horrific events in the story have dramatic consequences. What happens is part of a convincing story, not just a series of gratuitous special effects.<br /><br />If anyone has seen the trailers for the film, they probably thought this was the sort of violent horror film I mentioned earlier. It is far from it. In fact, this is a very well-made thriller that has many suspenseful supernatural moments, and does not go for the cheap scares and predictability many audiences are used to.<br /><br />The trailer is obviously designed to draw in the cheesy horror fans, but there is something more intelligent in this film and most of them will be bored, disappointed, or both.<br /><br />The performances in the film are top-notch, with Wilkinson's turn as the exposed priest is heartbreaking, while Linney and Campbell Scott are fantastic as dueling lawyers. The real standout is Jennifer Carpenter ("White Chicks"), who plays Emily Rose. She has quite a bit of silent screen time and pulls it off well without "demon" makeup," just contorted faces, uncomfortable postures and nerve-shattering screams. She is creepy, yet vulnerable. She is scary yet innocent. She gave an amazing performance.<br /><br />Although the credits claim that the film is "based on a true story," there seems to be just a bare fragment of truth in its script. Before the end credits, a title card tells us that the priest involved with the story cooperated with an author who wrote the book that served as the basis for the film. Screenwriters Scott Derrickson (who also directed) and Paul Harris Boardman purchased the rights, but neither the book nor the author are credited.<br /><br />The book is in fact "The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel," and the only point of similarity between the actual events and the film is that a young woman dies during an exorcism and that the priest is put on trial for negligent homicide. It seems clear that in the actual case, the young woman's death did result from negligence. She died from malnutrition after undergoing a series of exorcisms for months.<br /><br />"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is definitely a film worth seeing. It may not be fast-paced enough for some horror fans and a little rough for others because of the subject matter, but it is certainly a fascinating film presented with dignity.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" approaches its subject matter with a bit more intelligence and thought than we are used to in films of this type.  The movie, in fact, is more of a courtroom drama with supernatural elements than a flat-out horror film in its own right.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the film begins with the death of a 19-year-old girl from what appears to be a botched exorcism.  The priest in charge of the ritual, Father Moore, is arrested and put on trial for negligent homicide.  Erin Bruner, a self-described "woman of doubt," is the attorney hired by the Catholic archdiocese to defend the case.  At first, Bruner is skeptical of Father Moore's story of what happened to the girl, but after she herself begins to experience strange, unexplainable phenomena in her own life, she comes to believe that there just might be a plausible supernatural explanation for the death.<br /><br />Eschewing most of the over-the-top silliness usually associated with demon-possession scenarios, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" prefers, instead, to concentrate on the running battle between science and rationality on one side and religion and faith on the other that has become a commonplace in our more enlightened modern times.  Although the movie clearly sides with the supernatural explanation, it still leaves room for the more skeptical among us to have their say.  The dialogue is generally sharp, insightful and thought provoking and the screenplay treats the spokespersons from both sides of the argument with dignity and respect.<br /><br />Although this film is set in the rural Midwest, the actual "Emily Rose" was a German girl named Anneliese Michel who died in 1976 and whose grave in Germany has since become a pilgrimage site for believers convinced that she was indeed possessed by Satan.<br /><br />The real focus of the film, however, is on the lawyer, Bruner, who undergoes a spiritual reassessment as a result of her involvement in the case.  Laura Linney, as always, brings a seriousness and intelligence to her role of a woman who has her entire view of the world and how it works irrevocably shaken up and altered by the experience.<br /><br />Diehard horror film fans may be disappointed by the relatively short shrift given to the possession sequences, which are seen only in flashbacks and, which, despite their commendable restraint, often have the feel of a warmed-over "Exorcist" about them (although that is practically inevitable with any movie on this subject at this point, I would imagine).  However, it is as a courtroom drama that the film scores most of its hits, and those of us who have watched with dismay the steady degeneration of the horror movie genre of late are quick to welcome this approach.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>The Exorcism of Emily Rose caught me off guard. I thought I was in for a thriller/horror movie with the same old Hollywood elements. Man, was I wrong.<br /><br />The Exorcism, of Emily Rose is a movie based on the real life story of Emily Rose, a young lady who headed off for college and ended up losing her mind or being possessed by Lucifer...you decide.<br /><br />All the elements of a great film are there: wonderful storytelling, incredible acting, good pacing, and entrancing visuals. Jennifer Carpenter (as Emily Rose) puts in one of the best acting performances I have seen in a while. I am headed to find more movies with Carpenter in them as I write. Laura Linney as Erin Bruner and Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore are strong as well.<br /><br />Make no mistake, the Exorcism of Emily Rose is not a horror movie, per se. But...it is very scary. I found this movie more unsettling than any horror movie I have watched this year, and I have watched many. The scene with Erin Bruner in her home was amazingly tense. Also note that there is no blood and gore in the film.<br /><br />This is not a film with average frights, as it may linger in the minds of even seasoned fright buffs. I went to bed after the film (I work second shift), rolled over to look at the alarm clock, and it read 2:59. It turned 3 AM as I looked. I had to get up and check all the doors in the house. I was truly creeped out.<br /><br />I guess the fright in the film comes from the fact that it could happen to any of us. It also comes from the unknown. Was Emily crazy?<br /><br />Anywho, I can't say enough good about this film. It is a court drama, a story about people you will care about, and one heck of a frightening and unsettling film that tackles huge questions about God and demons.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 89<br /><br />48 (out of 50).

The movie is a terrific courtroom drama and a terrifying horror story of demonic possession.  The movie raises the question of the validity of demonic possession, and lets the viewer determine whether or not the possession has occurred.  Based on true events in 1976 Germany, the movie opens with a Catholic priest being charged with negligent homicide in the tragic death of young Emily Rose.  Father Moore had attempted an exorcism on the girl a few days earlier, and her death is blamed on him, as he had suggested she stop taking her medication.  Emily had been diagnosed as epileptic with resultant psychotic tendencies; Father Moore and the girl's family believed Emily to be possessed by demons.  An ambitious agnostic attorney is hired by the Archdiocese to serve as his defense, and a Methodist prosecutor is representing the state.  What truly elevates this distinguished film is its cast.  Laura Linney, one of today's best actresses, gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Erin Bruner, the hot shot defender who finds herself questioning her own beliefs during the course of the trial.  I've always admired Ms. Linney's work even in below average films (e.g. Congo) and she rises to the occasion in this riveting performance.  Equally brilliant is Tom Wilkinson, who plays the tormented priest who wants to tell Emily's story and insists he is not responsible for her death.  Nominated for an Oscar for his performance in IN THE BEDROOM, Wilkinson gives a sincere and intense picture of this good man.  Campbell Scott gives one of his most effective performance as Ethan Thomas, the churchgoing prosecutor who leaves his beliefs outside the courtroom and is determined to see Father Moore convicted.  Jennifer Carpenter is devastating as Emily, a girl tormented by demons and the destruction of her life as she knows it.  Her performance is so real it is disturbing at times to watch what happens to her.  Joshua Close as her boyfriend is also very good in a demanding supporting role.  Director Scott Derrickson keeps the movie riveting with superior timing and some really spooky scenes.<br /><br />THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is a marvelous film that asks us to question what is possible in this straight-laced world of ours, and stays with you long after you view it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Only in the postmodern era could a film of such content achieve notoriety as a "horror film".  "Emily Rose" is more an exercise on the ins and outs of religious faith within the framework of the American legal system than a horror movie, an interesting meditation on how belief in the metaphysical goes over in complicated situations like the tragic one depicted here. Having read about the actual case which really took place in Germany and did not for a second involve the Catholic Church, I thought it was a little distasteful that the director decided to suggest here and there that this might have been a real case of possession.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself goes, though, the meticulous construction and ill-fated plight of Emily Rose (Anneliese Michael) manages to entertain and even get a tad spooky here and there.  Needless to say, this only happens when the fictitious elements are added.  It is above all worth watching as a courtroom drama.  Tom Wilkinson is utterly forgettable as Father Moore and Jennifer Carpenter delivers a fairly convincing performance as Emily Rose in both her "normal" state and "possessed" state.<br /><br />Laura Linney and Campbell Scott, however, are phenomenal as two lawyers bent on both stealing the spotlight and proving each other wrong.  At times you really can't help but side with the prosecution, though, as Linney is clearly unprepared for the case despite her character's supposed voracious drive for victory.  How you could pull off an even tentative acquittal such as the one Moore receives at the end is beyond me in this particular case, but she manages it.<br /><br />For my part, I was not left with the desire to watch the film again and again.  Although the plotline was elaborate, coherent and gripping, I found the "exorcism" scenes ridiculously short and unconvincing.  What you are left with here is not a burning question as to whether Emily was really possessed or just epileptic, but tremendous pity for her psychological and physiological suffering.<br /><br />That said, this is worth watching.  Maybe some aspiring horror director will pick up on the good parts and make another actually frightening film about exorcism.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>This frightening and gripping tale is based on a true story of a German student who, in the 1970s, died during an attempted exorcism.  The two German priests who attempted the exorcism were accuded of negligent homicide.  This film is based on the life of a young college student, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter).  Suffering from horrifying hallucinations and bone-rigid seizures, it was believed that Emily was suffering from some sort of psychosis and epilepsy.  However, the family soon places Emily in the care of their parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson).  He has a totally different explanation for Emily's behavior; he believes that she has been possessed by the devil and he plans an exorcism to rid Emily of her demons.<br /><br />However, the exorcism goes terribly awry, and Emily dies during it.  Soon, Father Moore is arrested and accused of negligent homicide.  Scrambling for alternatives, Father Moore's parish hires defense lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) to defend Father Moore.  A up-and-comer in her law firm, she just won a high-profile case before accepting the defense of Father Moore.  One more big victory and she will become a senior partner in her firm.<br /><br />Serving as prosecutor for the trial is Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a church-goer and Sunday School Teacher who believes that religious beliefs are not above the law and intends to prosecute to its fullest extent.  After rejecting a plea deal of reckless endangerment which would have carried a six month jail sentence from the prosecution, the two sides go to trial.<br /><br />The trial is loaded with scientific explanations and religious theories about the cause of Emily's death.  From psychosis and epilepsy to demon possession, many theories are presented by both the prosecution and the defense.  Which side will the jury believe?  Will Father Moore be found guilty or innocent?<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely exciting to watch.  The trial scenes are riveting, and the cut-away scenes showing Emily fighting her condition are the high points of the movie.  The acting is first-rate.  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, and especially Jennifer Carpenter as the torn and troubled Emily are all excellent in their roles.  If you remember seeing "The Exorcist", this movie will scare you even more.  I highly recommend this movie.  The courtroom drama will draw you in, and the exorcism and possession scenes will keep you glued to the screen throughout.  Watch this true story and see how possession, scientific theory, and exorcism meet head-on in a clash of beliefs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>Read the other One Star reviews -- they trash this film and deservedly so.<br /><br />Let me review it from the legal end.  The court room drama is bogus.  It doesn't matter if the real story took place in Germany, or "based on" in America -- legal procedure does not work as portrayed.  For example, the judge scolds the defense attorney in open court for being late.  That is grounds to request a mistrial (which would be denied) and later used as one of the issues on appeal.  The judge would have called both attorneys to the bench and quietly told them if either one was late they would be held in contempt of court.  By scolding the attorney in front of the jury -- which would not have been called in until both attorneys were present -- it sends a message to the jury that the judge is anti-defense attorney.<br /><br />More than likely some of the jurors were christian and maybe catholic.  (A good defense attorney would have made sure at least 4 of the jurors were catholic in an attempt to hang the jury.)  The D.A. does everything he can to insult the priest -- thereby insulting the jurors christian beliefs.  Even if the jurors don't believe in the priest's exorcism rites, they do believe in Christianity.  The D.A. has made himself unlikeable to the jury.  He shows the priest no respect and thereby the Christians of the jury no respect.<br /><br />(It is not uncommon for a jury to side with the attorney they like, regardless of the facts of the case.)<br /><br />A doctor who can help the defense approaches the defense attorney and says he will testify for the priest.  He is the key that will set the priest free.  What does the defense attorney tell him?  Come to court tomorrow morning!  The first thing she would have done is that night take his deposition in the presence of an attorney from the D.A.s office.  Then when he was killed, she could have entered that document into evidence.  A document does not carry the weight of live testimony with a jury, but it does with a Court of Appeals.  So, the doctor is accidentally killed and she has no great witness nor a document of his testimony.<br /><br />Half way into the trial, she discovers that she needs an M.D. who can rebut the states M.D.!  Excuse me, she would have deposed this M.D. prior to the trial -- she would have known exactly what his testimony was going to be.  Prior to the trial she would have lined up at least 3 M.D.s to rebut the states witness.  She would not wait to the last minute and have the light bulb go off in her head.<br /><br />And she tells her associate -- during the trial -- that she knows nothing about exorcisms. So the two of them get a stack of books to study -- and she's due back into court the next morning!  In other words, she did not prepare for the trial.  She works for a huge law firm.  This is a high-profile case.  Everyone in that firm would have contributed to making her defense.<br /><br />Out of desperation, she reads a book authored by an "expert" in exorcisms.  And what do you know -- the expert is available to testify.  But the expert can only testify as to what people of faith believe exorcisms to be, not if the priest performed a correct exorcism, or if an exorcism was even necessary.  And this is where the D.A. dropped the ball -- he could have (in a polite way) shredded this witness.  He only asked a couple of non-relevant questions.<br /><br />And finally, the defense attorney gives the worst closing argument in the history of jurisprudence.  Rent the film just to watch that closing argument.  She deliberately makes the case for the D.A.  She continually repeats all the strong points of his case, and underlines the weaknesses of her case.  She concludes by saying to effect, "Hey maybe there are demons -- I don't believe in them -- but the priest did, so you should give him the benefit of the doubt and set him free."<br /><br />The priest has grounds for appeal based upon his attorney giving up on his defense and surrendering to the D.A., and her lack of preparedness for trial.  He was definitely not represented by a competent attorney.  She should be disbarred.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />As far as satanic possession films go, this one is pretty good. Based on a true story (Isn't half of them anymore?), "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" does have it's devilish pleasures, & it's creepy skin crawlers, but one has to think, have we not seen this all before, & better done? Yet, this is well worth the watch for those so inclined to be possessed by possession films!<br /><br />"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>I enjoy this movie very much.  The movie was very good and the preformances top notch.  What I enjoy watching the movie over and over again when I am in the mood because there is a spiritual message behind it or meaning behind it.  As a Catholic I have what I believe in and I believe the movie did a good job showing what Emily Rose went through and the impact it can have on a person's life.  Also I like the ending where they show what happened after the trial and that people go to see the grave of Emily Rose as a holy shine.  Just my personal feelings I believe the Devil tempts the strongest of believers to test us and our convictions.  But as for the movie if you want something to watch as both a powerful drama mix with horror scenes then see this movie and see how it impacts you after seeing it. I am sure you will enjoy the movie as much as I have over the past few years.</p></br></body></html>

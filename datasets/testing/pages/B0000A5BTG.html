Yep, it surely is...although I must admit, I do have a soft spot in my heart for this big budget flop-o-ramas, especially ones starring academy awards winning actors/actresses.  The caramel nougat center of this movie is the core of the Earth has stopped spinning, causing problems in the magnetic field that surrounds the Earth, keeping the dangerous microwave and other bits of space radiation at bay.  What caused the core of the Earth to stop spinning?  Who knows?  But I bet it was something we did...it's always something we did because if there is anything I've learned from Hollywood, it's that humans are a self destructive lot, and we're not happy unless we're cutting down trees, pollutin' the oceans, or tearing up the ozone.<br /><br />Anyway, in a plot mostly lifted from a slightly less crummy movie (Armageddon), a special team of scientists is assembled to travel in a specialized ship, made of (get this) Unobtanium, to the center of the Earth and jump-start the now stalled core using nuclear weapons.  At a certain point in the movie (like five minutes in), you will have to turn the logical part of your brain off to be able to keep watching, as there are plot holes bigger than a house throughout the film.  I'm no geology whiz or an expert on physics as such, but I can tell when someone's trying to feed me a humungous, steaming pile of droppings, even if it's on a silver spoon, the silver spoon being all the high tech special effects, which looked good at first, but then became sort of cartoonish after awhile.<br /><br />It's funny how a bad movie can turn almost anyone into a fortuneteller.  By about an hour into the movie, I was able to correctly guess who was going to live and who was going to die within the crew with such accuracy that I was tempted to go out and buy a lottery ticket.  Equally amazing was how I was able to almost predict the order and manner in which the deaths occurred.  After determining that I have no divine powers of prognostication, I aptly realized that the script was actually telegraphing all the information needed to come to the conclusions that I did.  If you are unable to discern who will bite it and who will survive, it's only because you've probably lost interest in the movie or are laughing so hard at all its' flaws and gaping holes that you missed said elements.  I mean really, the only way it could have been made more obvious was if a neon sign appeared next to the character saying, "I'm going to die."<br /><br />So what happens?  Is the Earth saved?  Who survives?  Who dies?  Who cares...seriously, I felt all the actors did adequately well, but this turkey would have required nothing short of the hand of God for salvation.  My favorite scene, which isn't in the movie, was located in the Deleted Scenes section of the disc.  It involved the scientists witnessing a demonstration of a device that uses ultrasonic waves to pulverize rock.  The device, being rather small, made a pencil size hole in a rock, followed by a poof of smoke.  The one arrogant scientist then made a sarcastic statement about having to wear protective equipment for such a catastrophic event.  The character I liked the least was Rat, played by DJ Qualls.  He was the hacker supreme tasked with controlling all information regarding the catastrophic events caused by the loss of rotation of the Earths' core.  Your classical nerdy computer geek, he often referred to his skills as a hacker as his 'kung-fu', making such inane statements like, "My kung-fu is strong."  These attempts to make him an endearing character made me cringe, mostly because the movie offered little evidence that he was as good as he was supposed to be, creating programs and hacking sites and basically controlling information flow on the worldwide internet with relative ease.  A few keystrokes and he could access security of the highest levels.  If the Internet is as unsecured as it is in this movie, then we're all screwed.  Overall, while I understand these types of movies usually require a certain level of suspension of disbelief, this film asks way too much of its' viewers in that manner.  This movie is listed as a drama/sci-fi/action/thriller but really it's a fantasy.  If you keep that in mind going into this movie, you may derive more enjoyment out of it than I did, but I doubt it as it's derivate plot, clich&eacute;s and total lack of scientific credibility are so painfully obvious and the whole thing is just so damn predictable.  The mantra in making this movie seems to have been 'If you can't intelligently work out a plot detail, just make something up'.<br /><br />I do acknowledge that this film has the appearance of a more traditional movie, but seeing as how this is the 21st century, using certain methods used in the past to work through the plot doesn't hold water as it did in the past.  As our general knowledge increases through the myriad of outlets now available, we are generally more informed, and less likely to accept implausibilties as we were in the past in contemporary work such as this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>I'm not a big scientist, but even I found a lot of flaws in the logic they were using.  So, don't expect to be wowed by its intellictual value.  <p>This film reminds me of &quot;Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Independance Day&quot; so if you liked those movies, you will probably like this one.  Not quite as entertaining as those two, but I would say it was just about there.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>I did not bother with the cinema release and got the DVD because there was not much left to rent in the store. Truth be told, I enjoyed it because the film is less - USA is going to save the world! and more about the characters in this film. The premise is sci-fi simple. The Earths core is no longer rotating and that means we are all going to fry unless some scientists can get together and develop a unit that can drill to the Earths core and launch a load of nukes to start the core spinning again.<p>Basically this is a B-MOVIE!.. and once you get that then it really does move along at a good pace. The story is character driven and the environments are pretty cool with lots of action along the way.<p>In short go into this one with low expectations and you will enjoy the core. It is great B-Movie fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>Hillary Swank went from &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; to this? Looking for a money making blockbuster ay?<br />The latest in special effects natural disaster movies..<br />I disagree with others and refuse to rave about the cheesy effects in this film. I do agree it is smarter than &quot;Armegeddon&quot; and can be fun as &quot;Journey To The Center Of The Earth&quot;..<br />But you can guess with accuracy who will survive and who will die.<br />I loved the Geode scene however. I laughed how the ship  just popped out of an ocean vent at the end ...Good for mind numbing entertainment. I still don't understand Hillary's interest in this project.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>I bet it sounded great in the pitch session....<p>&quot;Hey what if we crossed 'Armageddon' with 'Journey To The Center Of The Earth'? And what if we ignored just about every scientific or geological fact on record? And let's rip off a couple of older movies...wouldn't it be really cool to toss in a nod to Hitchcock at the beginning?&quot;<p>Yup, &quot;The Core&quot; is really that bad. So bad, that I was half expecting some stop action animated dinosaurs at the center of the earth as an explanation as to why the core had stopped rotating. But instead, we get the same old Military/Industrial complex conspiracy goop. At least &quot;Armageddon&quot; kept the politics to popcorn rah rah. And the less said about the derivative, cheesy disaster effects, the better. After &quot;Independence Day&quot; or &quot;Deep Impact,&quot; if you're going to level a city, you'd better have more than boiling water and crazed pigeons. <p>It gets two stars becuase Hilary Swank and Stanely Tucci don't totally embarrass themselves. But folks, if this is the best you can get, you need new agents.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by this film.  I was looking for hard scifi, something that is entirely plausible, yet projected into a fascinating future.  Red Planet comes to mind, as does Andromeda Strain:  you can really believe the story if you are knowledgeable about science, at least while you're watching it.<br /><br />This film starts promisingly:  there are mysterious catastrophes that are linked to man's messing with the Earth's core.  They have to fix it.  Unfortunately, what they come up with is what can only be called a magical technology:  a ray to cuts anything, and a material (for a tunneling device) that is more or less infinitely strong.  Once this magic is established, it has to succeed.<br /><br />The characters are the strongest part, as the actors are really good.  Also, some of the underground locales are fun.  But this isn't good hard scifi.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless you want action rather than hard scifi.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Watches stop.  People with pacemakers drop dead.  Thousands of pigeons (and one fish) fly into things at Trafalgar Square.  All these things are symptoms of a greater problem.<p>One scientist consulted on one of these problems does a little data compilation and reaches a terrifying conclusion:  There is something wrong with the planet and we are all going to die.  He asks for help from a more public scientist (a back-stabbing plagiarist) and his fears are confirmed.  But military minds do not like defeat without a fight so they put every conceivable resource to bear on the problem.<p>We wind up with an expedition to the core of the planet for the purpose of setting off a pile of nukes in hope of getting the core to spin properly again.  Time is on the essence but gives way to billions of dollars and the expedition sets off.<p>We are then treated to some serious assaults on science as we find a geode the size of the Superdome, diamonds the size of Cape Cod (theorized to exist in planets the size of Jupiter), and a ship without power that somehow races to the surface.<p>The novelization was better as it did not suffer from the harsh editing.  For example, the film skips over the crucial problem that the instructions fro the nukes are in French and their Frenchman is dead.  The supposed change of heart in the plagiarist does not work when he says, "Yes, this ship is yours, but I wish it could have been ours."  It comes off as if he wanted credit for yet another discovery of someone else's.<p>All in all the movie is sort of like Armageddon with it's absurd science, but not quite as fun (space scenes a cooler than a shot of an uninteresting ship surrounded by red-orange whatever).  Still, I am sure there are many who will enjoy this one and it is quite superior to Deepcore (the movie Terry Farrell left Deep Space Nine for).</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"The Core" is a fun film to watch.  Like all films in this genre, it has an impending disaster with catastrophic results waiting in the wings unless a motley crew of scientists, military folks and nerds can get something together to put an end to the destruction of the world.  It has sensationalized gizmos, unbelievable heroics, and wonders out the wazoo.  But let's be honest, that's why people watch movies like this.  They're fun, sometimes moving, and a great way to kill a couple of hours without having to worry about the real world.<br /><br />You could bunch this movie together with similar disaster flicks like "Deep Impact," "Armageddon," and "The Day After Tomorrow."  Heck, you can also throw in movies like "Independence Day."  On the other hand, "The Core" has something that these films don't, and that is good acting and a fairly decent script.  I actually felt for some of the characters in this flick.  Aaron Eckhart has one particularly moving scene with Hilary Swank's character after she is forced to make a decision that results in the death of a crew member.  In the typical scenes of this genre, where a character sacrifices themselves for the others and the good of mankind, the acting is so good that you forget how standard this type of scene is in a disaster film.  That's what sets "The Core" apart from the rest of the pack.  Throw in great comedy from D.J. Qualls as a hacker-supreme and the snooty air about Stanley Tucci's professor and you've got a fun film worth multiple views.<br /><br />With a brilliant cast, good special effects, and a solid script for this genre, I highly recommend "The Core" for some rainy-day, popcorn-type fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Jon Amiel<p>The Core stars Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Tcheky Karyo.  The previews made this movie look like Armageddon, only this time they go underground.  I wasn't too excited for it, but I started seeing reviews that said it was better than Armageddon (which despite the bad rap the movie later got, it was enjoyable the first time I saw it) and had more story and detail.  I thought that sounded okay and rented the movie.  It is just like Armageddon, and it wasn't better.  <p>Even though I've already said that the movie is just like Armageddon, I'll give you the basic plot anyway.  Early in the movie strange things start happening: a bunch of people drop dead, the only connection is that they all had pace makers; animals start acting crazy, and the weather becomes erratic and unseasonal.  It turns out that the core of the planet has stopped spinning and the effects of this will be catastrophic.  I'll leave it the movie to explain the hows and whys of that.  What can be done?  The core must be restarted.  A character in the movie says that that is impossible because there is no machine/vehicle that can reach the Earth's core.  Oh, but there is.  The United States Government puts a team together to drill down to the Earth's core and try to restart it (unlike Armageddon, these men and women are actually scientists rather that oil riggers).  <p>That's the movie in a nutshell.  The trip down to the Core plays eerily similar to Armageddon (up to and including a scene that looks exactly like the crash on the asteroid in Armageddon).  There is more scientific detail and explanation in the Core, and while I did appreciate that, the movie just became more and more unrealistic, and despite my acceptance of that fact, it made the movie hard to bear.  This is a disaster film, and with a disaster film you would imagine that the special effects would be impressive.  At least that would have helped the movie.  Unfortunately, the special effects were rather weak and in a couple of cases, a little cheesy.  Director Jon Amiel had some talented actors to work with, but unfortunately the movie was a failure.  It was not interesting, or visually striking, and was ultimately boring.  To borrow Roger Ebert's trademarked line: "Thumbs way down."</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>I really like this Paramount DVD.  It offers you a choice if you want to see previews or just go right to the main menu.  The core of the earth is slowing down and it is causing alot of disasterous phenomenon.  Sudden traffic accidents, birds flying and hitting every thing in sight.  Even the space shuttle has a problem.  They must suddenly touchdown in Los Angeles.  The Los Angeles River that is.  A space shuttle pilot and a professor and others in a probe-like craft must go inside the Earth and reach the core to fix the problem.  If the core should stop, the results would be horrific...death.  Total fantasy of couse, but might be fun to watch.  DVD includes deleted scenes and extended scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"The Core" is nothing but fun, I know, but as the cast is very  impressive and the company is Hollywood major studio Paramount Pictures (the one renowned for "Star Trek" series), I expected pretty much from the film.  This sci-fi film is not so bad as critics might find.  Only too familiar, that is the problem.<p>The opening part is very effectively spooky, thanks to the director Jon Amiel ("Copycat").  Strange things start to happen all over the world -- one of them is re-enactment of Hitchcock nightmare -- and scientists are assembled to investigate the case.  The truth behind the disasters turns out something not very encouraging; the inner core of the earth has stopped moving, and the world as we know is to meet the end very soon.<p>So the story starts well, but soon becomes something very familiar, like the updated fashion of "The Jorney to the Center of the World."  The scientific theory is replaced by the uninspired ideas, and when the crew of the subterranean ship "Virgil" is gathered, we know that instead of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, we see such faces as Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Greenwood (whose previous film was most appropriately the submarime film "Below".)  Well, the cast is not bad, though.<p>Nevertheless, the film gradually shows the lack of any kind of  originality, and if you have seen "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact," you can predict every twist in the storyline.  Sure, somebody must go, and during the comparatively long running time of the film, some cities must go, too.  The underground scenes are realized pretty good CGIs, but you cannot deny the fact that those scenes also somehow betray the limits of our imagimation, while we are looking closely at them.  Because no one has ever seen the core of the earth, the visuals have to rely on our own creativity.  So, I thought, these images could have been much more surprising and even wilder, but strangely, the visuals look as if telling the film takes itself too seriously.  <p>The main trouble with the film is not, however, those parts.  The cast, especially Swank and Eckhart both talented professionals, look miscast in the role they are playing.  They look neither enthusiastic nor cool as the hero and heroine of the film which requires the wit of Indie Jones or the dedication of Ripley.  Only Stanley Tucci convinces us as the pompous doctor, breathing life into cardboard character. And "The Core" uses some ideas that might make you sigh at some points, and some players are typecast.  See, for example, D.J. Qualls (the geeky guy in "Road Trip") cast as a computer wiz.  I guess he deserves much different types of roles, but the studio would probably listen.  <p>Corny and predictable, but as an updated B disaster film "The Core" ends up so-so.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>Let's make one thing absolutely clear here: you do not go to see a movie like "The Core" expecting to see high level film-making like "The Godfather" or "Citizen Kane".  Heck, you don't even go expecting to see something on the level of "Enemy of the State" or "Crimson Tide".  A movie like "The Core" falls firmly in that campy genre known as the 'disaster' film.  Hollywood became enamored with and perfected the formula for the disaster film in the early 1970's, with such movies like the "Airport" series, "Poseidon Adventure", "The Swarm", and just about any film involving George Kennedy.  The past decade has shown a resurgence in this genre with "Twister" in the 1996, the dueling 'volcano' movies in 1997, and the dueling 'asteroid hits the Earth' movies in 1998.  "The Core" is just the latest in a long line of movies to fill that genre.<br /><br />"The Core" comes complete with all the elements that make a disaster film work.  It has the hammy, over-the-top acting.  It has the cheesy, yet somewhat compelling, special effects.  It has the feeling of impending doom looming over a group of people (or the entire world) if a motley group of heroes can't achieve their goal.  Finally, it is entertaining.  As "The Core" possesses all of these characteristics, there are worse ways to spend two hours and a few bucks than on this movie.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, of "The Core" centers around the impending destruction of the Earth as a result of one of the military's nefarious experiments. It seems there is this project called "Project Destiny" which is designed to create earthquakes anywhere in the world at any time to destroy the U.S.'s enemies. Alas, the experimentation with this project has caused the Earth's core to stop rotating. As a result, the magnetic field around the planet that protects the us from the Sun's harmful rays is slowly disappearing, leading to the eventual 'roasting' of the entire planet. Of course, there's a desperate plan that can save the planet before the final disaster strikes. It seems that there is a reclusive scientist who has developed a material that withstand the pressures and heat of the interior of the Earth. The material is called, of course, "Unobtanium", which is a science-fiction parlance for any material that is needed to have magical properties that allow the plot to progress. In this case, a ship is built from this material with the goal of going to the center of the early and setting off nuclear bombs to 'restart' the core.<br /><br />The plot sounds pretty preposterous, and it is. Also, don't try to develop an understanding of real science based on this movie. The motley group assigned to go on this mission is your typical band of stereotypical movie types. The actors chew scenery faster than the ship chews up earth. Yet, there is no denying the fact that this movie is fun to watch. No matter how ludicrous the premise, bad the acting or flimsy the plot, any film that you can come out of and say "That was a fun movie" is worthy of a recommendation. "The Core" is one of those kinds of movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>In this grim and silly drama, our government has developed a secret weapon called "Destiny" which can cause devastating earthquakes anywhere in the world. This has caused massive amounts of radiation to wipe out the California, Rome, and other cities around the globe. A team is chosen (which includes astronaut Hillary Swank and professor Aaron Eckheart) to build an earthship and fly it earthship down to the center of the earth carrying and deploy four nuclear bombs.<br /><br />I was ready to bail at this point, because it was just too ridiculous. The fact that the actors played it with poker faces made it even more absurd.  There is never any sense of danger because the lead actors take it all in stride as just another day at the office. Neither Swank nor Eckheart were convincing in their roles, so despite a big-budget-look, the film falls flat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>THE CORE is a great movie....not because it has a marvelously written script.  It's a great movie because it's what you want from a disaster movie, and has a tremendously talented cast.  Aaron Eckhart is marvelous as the heroic Joshua Keyes---not your typical matinee idol handsome, Eckhart has a masculine tenacity, a lot of sensitivity, and performs his role as if it were a Shakesperean oddyssey.  Eckhart is the heart of the film.  Stanley Tucci is appropriately snooty, self-serving and annoying, yet even he metamorphasizes into an almost hero.  It's to Tucci's credit that he pulls this one off so well.  D. J. Qualls as Rat is awesome in his nerdish role as the computer hacker supreme.  Alfre Woodard in a small role shows why she's such a good supporting actress.  Delroy Lindo is great as the shy, soft-spoken inventor who finally breaks loose in a dramatic scenario.  Hilary Swank doesn't posit the &quot;I'm an Oscar winner...let me steal this movie.&quot;  She fills her role admirably and shows no signs of prima-donna hysterics.  Richard Jenkins and Bruce Greenwood fill out this cast.<br />I liked this movie a lot, as it reminded me of those great old disaster movies like &quot;Towering Inferno&quot; and &quot;Posiedon Adventure.&quot;  The effects, particularly of the birds going wacky in Trafalgar Square, are great.  See if you can find the trout which was included as an inside joke by director Amiel.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>&quot;Hang on -- this isn't going to be subtle!&quot; says the hotshot NASA pilot as he prepares to crash-land the space shuttle in the dry concrete basin of the L.A. River...  As good an introduction to this film as you're likely to get.  This science fiction/natural disaster movie was a very pleasant surprise!  It's about an intrepid group of super-scientists who take a fantastic voyage to the Earth's molten core, in order to prevent global catastrophe.  Y'see, it seems the lava inside the planet has stopped spinning for some reason, causing all of nature to go haywire, and threatens our very existence. Which is very bad.  So, the US government assembles a scrappy little Scooby team, and off they go, to die one-by-one and make heroic sacrifices as they meet their dates with Destiny.  This flick was pretty fun &amp; funny in a complete-suspension-of-disbelief kinda way... It doesn't take itself too seriously, and thus never flounders by trying to make everything seem &quot;real.&quot; In fact, the humor (which draws on some great, casual one-liners and fine performances all around, particularly the laconic, good-natured college professor, played by Aaron Eckhart) skillfully disarms us to the special effects sequences are all the more enjoyable.  The &quot;science&quot; is ridiculous, but who cares?  The film is a gas!</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>ahhh what did i watch? i felt like i was eating bad takeout. deep impact had a better story than this one , but the wonderful grace that saved this film from being a total bomb is the special effects in it. if you're curious then rent it, you'll be glad you save some money then paying dearly later on. they should've made this into a comedy it would've been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>Before I get into my review, let me say that &quot;The Core&quot; is an exciting movie that will probably have you on the edge of you seat wondering what will happen next. However, this type of &quot;the end of the world is coming so let's get a crew of scientists together to save the world&quot; film has been done many, many, many times before.<p>The story is mainly about how the earth is losing it's electromagnetic field due to the fact that the outer layer of the earth's core has stopped moving around the inner core (there is a lot of scientific jargon in the film that explains all of this). So a group of scientists go to the earth's core and try to jumpstart the outer core into moving again. Because of the wearing away of the electromagnetic field, the earth is prone to the radioactive particles, gases, etc. from space that will ultimately turn the earth into one big fireball.<p>There are many scenes of destruction and the obligatory widdling away of the crew due to various methods of death. Then there is the climactic scene where the surviving members achieve success and head home.<p>I'm not saying that &quot;The Core&quot; is a bad film, but it's something that we've all seen before and I can't say that it's that interesting that it's a must-see.

The Core is an engaging but fluffy bit of pseudo-science. The Premise? When the Earth's molten core stops 'rotating' due to mankind's tampering, it wreaks havoc with the Earth's environment, resulting in widespread natural disasters and eventual global destruction.<br /><br />Who can save us? Yes, believe it or not COLLEGE PROFESSORS  can save us. Yes, that's right...Not only is there a Santa Claus Virginia, but Earth will be saved by an Academic! If I weren't too busy laughing at the idea, I would've enjoyed the film even more. Ludicrousness aside, you have the usual group of characters. The hot-shot (and oh-so-cute) stronaut, the misunderstood scientist, the cowardly rich boy, the dedicated professor, and the wizened veteran, each one contributes something to the team and some pay the ultimate price. (I'll let you guess who).<br /><br />This was a fun, but predicable film. If you like "Volcano" and all those movies about Asteroids hitting earth, you'll like this one. Mindless fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>It seems like every summer, the world is about to be destroyed by a disaster of epic preportions and the plots seem to get more ridicilous every year. If you sat through Michael Bay's "Armageddon" in 1998 then you've probably seen this one before. This time, trade an asteroid the size of Texas for a whole bunch of solar storms that are being caused by a top-secret government project that has caused the planet's core to stop rotating. The Earth's only hope is a mixed bag of geophysiscists, astronauts, and other super-nerds who plan to drill into the Earth and restart the core with a bunch of nuclear weapons.<br /><br />The script from "Core" seems like it was ripped right out of Michael Bay's recycle bin. We've got all these picture perfect know-it-alls who seem to be both smarter and more clever than their government counterparts. We've got countless CGI disaster sequences. Hell, they even shamelessly steal the "drawing straws" concept from "Armageddon" as well. Unfortunately, it never manages to "borrow" the most appealing aspect of a Bay film which is the over-the-top honky tonk melodrama. Jon Amiel uses his share of big special effects pieces but it all seems more for show than anything else. Maybe it's the fact that I've been treated to more apocalyptic disaster films than I can count on two hands but "Core" just seemed far too predictable. The sense of dread that comes with an "end of the world" event like this seems noticeably absent.<br /><br />"The Core" is more of the same generic junk food that Hollywood loves to recycle. If you still haven't had your fix of disaster movies with overqualified ensemble casts then by all means, give this one a whirl. It makes "Armageddon" and "Volcano" look like National Geographic specials in comparisson.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RJXK6KF3LL5R.html">A1RJXK6KF3LL5R</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie alot.Everyone in my family likes this movie.It's nice to watch a movie and enjoy it.The people who wrote bad reviews for this movie are expecting too much from a movie.This movie entertains which is what it is suppose to do,not teach us science.A great movie for anyone who enjoys these kind of movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The Earth's core has stopped spinning. Although playing a bit of Motown might have solved the problem, it's decided to send a team of terranauts to the Earth's core in hopes of jumpstarting it with a series of nuclear bombs. Jon Amiel's entertaining flick is a bit light on the science (although more plausable than Journey to the Center of the Earth)but a nice update on the classic disaster/sci-fi flick that was standard fare during the 50's and early 60's. Playing like an entertaining cross between Fantastic Voyage and Journey, it has all the right elements for a light disaster flick. <p>The optical effects range from very good to astonishing (I was less impressed with the collapse of the Golden Gate Bridge than the destruction of Rome). Some of the science is accurate and works but there's enough credibility holes to drive a truck through.  I do have to disagree with Roland Zwick's review about the time spent in the confines of the ship as it burrows to the core; the confined, claustrophoic setting works in favor of the film. Also, Amiel has a "b story" that looks at the effects of the disaster on the surface of the Earth. The performances are quite good as well with Stanley Tucchi and Bruce Greenwood virtually stealing their scenes from the stars of the picture. Greenwood is a marvelous actor whose potential has not been realized by movie directors (with few exceptions). Tucchi plays the gloryhound physics professor and National Security Advisor role to the hilt; he also manages to invest some interesting character touches in what might otherwise have been a one dimensional role.<p>Amiel stated that his purpose was to do an update on films like Fantastic Voyage and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Those films managed to overcome many of their b-movie cliches through the strong performances and effects work in each film. Amiel has achieved his purpose with this entertaining (if overlong)and tongue-in-cheek disaster film. There are many that have attacked the film as contrived and cliched without realizing that Amiel is playing with those very conventions of the genre. <p>The Core entertains without stretching the scientific truth too much. Amiel has managed to breathe new life into a genre that sunk due to the bloated hyperdirection of films like Armageddon. Enjoy the film and take it for what it is; a Saturday afternoon b movie with an A movie cast, witty script and visual effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I liked this move, the whole concept is that the core of the earth has stopped rotating and we as mankind are about to die.<br />Thus, the government comes up with top-notch scientists and avaitors to solve the problem.  How? By a big old craft that can burrow down to the core,withstand heat that is hot as hell,literally (perhaps they are going through hell?) and restart the planet's engine, so to speak.<br /> I loved the actors, especially D.J. Quall who played the cyber-nerd and I liked how they added some comic relief through a very serious problem.The graphics were great bringing you right along with the crew and my favorite scene was the singing whales. Wonderful!  All in all this movie to me was entertaining in a big way, pulled at my heartstrings when many of the crew members were lost and ended with me having a chuckle at the antics of our cyber-nerd!  Good job! Good movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Despite my one-star rating, this is an acceptable time-killer: good-natured, forgettable and not real bright.  Poor Hilary Swank - from that movie where she was a boy to this in a few short years.  Of course, her fall wasn't as steep as Cuba Gooding's (from Jerry Maguire to Boat Trip in one movie) or Jamie Foxx's (from Ray to Stealth in one movie).  She looks like Jolene Blalock - T'Pol from TV's Star Trek Enterprise, and it wasn't until the credits that I realized it was actually Swank and not Blalock in the movie.  Perhaps Swank was trying to camouflage herself.<br /><br />The movie begins with a space shuttle landing in the LA River, which is interesting, but has nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.  Next thing you know, the valiant pilot is recruited to some mission to drill to the center of the earth to restart the core, which got some spyware or something and stopped working.  As a result, the Coliseum and the Golden Gate Bridge get wiped out by lightning.  Don't ask.  The Feds then assemble a team to take a magic vehicle to the core, drop some nukes, and reboot the earth.<br /><br />We learn some interesting things on the way, such as: Molten rock is completely clear.  There are really unconvincing sets with big fake crystals deep inside the earth.  And, if you're a jerk, you'll get killed by rolling nuclear weapons and then repent.<br /><br />You can guess how it ends.  It's not great art, but it's dumb fun on a rainy day.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>I've noticed that a lot of people have blasted this DVD for lacking in scientific veracity.  Well, gosh, although I slept through Geology 101 in college, I'll bet there are little more than kernels of truth in what the story contends about the Earth's electromagnetic field.  However, I must ask the obvious $60,000 question to the vociferous critics of this movie:  WHAT did you expect, exactly?<p>If you want a natural disaster movie that isn't happy-go-lucky where everyone goes on a suicide mission and miracuously all come back, then this one is worth a look.  If you want a film with some eye-candy special effects, then look no further!  <p>There have been a few movies /  cartoons in the past where an inventer would create a machine with a giant drill at the front end.  This contraption would take he and his crew to the center of the Earth, or at least far down.<p>In the present story the method of drilling is updated:  the ship uses lasers to blow its way through the Earth's mantle.  Is it believable?  Certainly not.  However, it is far more "watchable" than the giant drill-nose machine.<p>For myself, I did enjoy the allusion to Dante's DIVINE COMEDY.  The inventor of the ship names it the VIRGIL, after the Roman poet Publius Vergilius Maro. In the INFERNO it is the dead Virgil who leads Dante the Pilgrim through the lower depths of hell and up to the top of Mount Purgatory.  Nice touch.<p>The acting is decent, although I think they could have done better than the fellow they recruited to play the computer hacker nerd.  The highlight of the film is Hilary Swank.  She's certainly not hard on the eyes and also lends a nice feminine dynamic as the only non-male member of the crew.<p>All in all, this one is worth purchasing.  No, it's not scientifically accurate, but then again neither is Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (yet I don't hear people shooting that one down because of its lack of credible science).  Just remember:  at the end of the day it's a MOVIE!  If you can keep that in mind, you'll be all set to begin your journey to the core.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>If you want to bring hard science to this party, you might as well stay home; The Core is just about the most unrealistic and unscientific Armageddon movie I've ever seen.  It is also riddled with all the clich&eacute;s you would expect to find in a movie of this sort.  Despite these faults, however, it can be an exciting ride if you decide to just go along with the storyline.  There is just something about this film that drew me in, although I am hard pressed to explain it.  Maybe it's the Jules Verne lover in my soul that enjoyed revisiting the center of the earth, although I hate to think what Verne would have thought of The Core.  Journey to the Center of the Earth is actually more believable than this special effects-laden thriller.<p>The opening scenes of this film are just fantastic, as the unusual camera perspectives we first see, when about three dozen people suddenly fall over dead in one localized area, instantly dip your toes into surreality; this scene doesn't even compare to the next one, though, as The Core goes Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds one better.  And then, in a scene that is robbed of a little of its power and spectacle by the very real loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, we witness the most spectacular emergency landing of all time.  These opening scenes really grab you by the collar and shake you a little bit.  Of course, it's all downhill from here, but in terms of entertainment value I still consider this to be a better than average end of the world story.  One great thing about The Core is the fact that the brilliant science guy who has to save the world is someone other than Jeff Goldblum for once.  Aaron Eckhart fills the role of Dr. Josh Keyes, humble science professor turned savior of the planet.  He figures out that the electromagnetic field around the planet has more than blown a fuse, and his discovery leads him to seek the counsel of Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci); Zimsky is your stereotypical great man of science who looks down on everyone around him, but he quickly comes to realize that Keyes is right: the earth's core has stopped spinning.  He also knows why, but that's classified information.  All life on earth will be gone within a year.  What can be done?  Luckily, the eccentric yet very likable Dr. Ed Brazelton has invented a machine that can tunnel through rock like it was melted butter.  In three months, the earth-digging ship (dubbed &quot;Virgil&quot;) is built, a crew is put together (including space shuttle navigator Rebecca Childs, played by Hilary Swank), the world's biggest hacker nerd is called upon to keep the truth of the crisis away from the public (which is quite a job given some of the disastrous events that soon take place on earth), and we're off to the earth's core in order to kick-start the darned thing with the help of a few handy nuclear bombs.<p>Everything you expect to happen does in fact happen.  Some crew members do not make it home, those wacky scientists crack a number of stupid jokes or else criticize each other's work during crisis situations, everyone learns something about himself/herself, etc.  The dialogue serves to weaken the movie in a few places, but at least some of the clich&eacute;d moments are pulled off with at least a tinge of originality.  The special effects aren't that great once we get to the underground scenes where the ship is tunneling through rock, encountering empty space or mountains of crystal or diamonds, and luxuriating in the ultimate steam bath of liquid magma.  The underground effects pretty much had to rely on CGI, but I think some of the CGI effects could have been less obvious.  <p>By and large, I really enjoyed watching The Core, but I am sure many people will not like it for all of the faults I was willing to accept in the interest of personal entertainment.  This movie runs well over two hours, so it can be a long haul for those who will react negatively to it.  It doesn't wait and pull the rug out from under you at the last minute, fortunately, as the implausibility of the whole thing comes through loud and clear early on; that's a good thing.  If those in doubt can lay their eyes on the trailer, I think that would do much to show prospective viewers whether they will be inclined to enjoy or merely scoff at the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>There's no question that the science behind The Core is unconvincing and absurd. Of course, the outer core *could* conceivably stop spinning because of a device invented by a madly genius  and egotistical geophysicist, and this *could* cause a disruption in the electromagnetic field that protects us from the sun, but the manner in which it happened in the film is bizarre and unlikely. Also, the likelihood that the "savior" who built the machine and developed the hull of the ship that protected it under the tremendous and heat as they bored through the earth is, well, silly.<br /><br />However, the science behind Star Wars is similarly unbelievable. Why is Star Wars exciting then? (And I'm not referring to the first two films, which aren't terribly good - the word is still out on Revenge of the Sith.) Because it presents a scenario that is exciting and edgy, replete with suspense.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, I believe that The Core has received undue negativity because of the improbability of the science behind it. However, it's not the science that is the driving force of the film. As viewers, we need to do the same thing we did with films like Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: we need to suspend disbelief with regard to this quixotic undertaking . Once we successfully do that, we have a taut, engaging film with good performances, even if some of the dialogue is trite, and the interpersonal relationships rife with clich&eacute;s, as well as the actual characters themselves. What causes the film to rise above the scientific anomalies, the dialogue, and the relationships is the solid acting and the exciting race to the center of the earth.<br /><br />Hilary Swank was criticized as being miscast for her role in this film, and upon watching it, I was puzzled as to why. Certainly, choosing her character to be second in command was perplexing, even if she did manage a seemingly unnavigable landing in the beginning of the film. Nevertheless, her acting was solid. She has been miscast in other roles, but not here. Her humane resiliency seemed ideal for her character.<br /><br />One thing that I particularly enjoyed about The Core was that nobody was safe. At any given moment, anyone could die. This is a risky undertaking. Too many films have all of their heroes happy and fine at the end, but here there were no guarantees. High props for that.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from the film, and was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed it. While I am writing what certainly comes off as a highly favorable review, I can't ignore the problems I mentioned above when coming up with a final rating. The overabundance of unimaginative characterizations brings this from a potential four-star film to a three star film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Every one knows all too well that far too often trailers for movies contain the best bits and that when you see the entire film it fails to live up to the expectations inspired by the aforementioned trailer.  That was hardly the case with the trailer for "The Core," which was totally upfront with the fact that this 2003 film is about the end of the world as we know it coming about because the earth's core has stopped spinning...<br /><br />You really cannot type anything after you make a declaration like that.  I can remember the first time I saw the trailer for "The Core," hearing this premise and turning to my wife to request that she provide to me, free of charge, a respite from sexual intercourse (only not in those words).  Granted, I never took physics (or chemistry or biology) so my knowledge of rudimentary science is just about nil, but even I would think that not only would the core not stop spinning that if it did we would all be dead before we knew it had happened.  We have been waiting for large objects from outer space to strike the earth in movies from "When Worlds Collide" to "Armageddon," but having global destruction come from the heavens we are now going the other way.<br /><br />What stops you from totaly dismissing "The Core" is the cast.  You have Aaron Eckhart as Dr. Josh Keyes, the first scientist to put together what is happening; Tch&eacute;ky Karyo as Dr. Serge Leveque, the weapons expert who is not thinking about saving the entire planet but more his wife and kids; Delroy Lindo as Dr. Ed Brazzleton, who creates the technology that allows our merry little group to get to the center of the earth; Stanley Tucci as Dr. Conrad Zimsky, supposedly the smartest man on the planet (by his own admission);  Bruce Greenwood as Col. Robert Iverson, space shuttle pilot and commander of the group; Hilary Swank as Major Rebecca Childs, the hot-shot navigator who still has something to learn; DJ Qualls as "Rat" Finch, the greatest computer hacker on the planet; Richard Jenkins as Gen. Thomas Purcell, in charge of the emergency project; and Alfre Woodard as Talma Stickley, head of mission control.<br /><br />That is a pretty solid cast with Woodard the only one who is really wasted and every one of them totally buys into their role.  They treat this stuff seriously and have these intense discussions as if they really were figuring out how to restart the core and save the planet, coming up with whatever plan in the alphabet is needed after each goes horribly wrong for some unsuspected reason.  In an interview Qualls talks about how the science in the film is understandable.  Not realistic or, say, scientific, but that you get what they are doing and why they are doing it as they go along.  That is true.  You can laugh at what this film comes up with for science, but you do understand what it is they think they are doing, even if you could not go out and explain it to somebody else two minutes later.<br /><br />Director Jon Amiel ("Sommersby") has a reputation for emphasizing character and story over special effects, and that is indeed the case here.  You can laugh at the story and what these characters are doing, especially when they are out wandering around outside their ship at the center of the earth, but I think you will find it difficult to laugh at the characters (well, okay, Tucci is asking for it throughout, but he is the film's "heavy").  However, we keep getting back to the story.<br /><br />Clearly the makers of this film do not want to deal with the subject on a realistic level.  The first deleted scene on the DVD is a touching moment when Eckhart's Dr. Keyes informs his two lab assistants that they have had a crush on each for a long time, gives them his credit card, and tells them to check into a hotel and order a bottle of champagne.  He knows the word is going to end within 100 days and they run off, never seeing the tears in his eyes as he confronts the end of the world.  But that scene gets cut because there is little in the film that deals with the terror of the end of the world.  Instead we get guys quipping about funding emergency project to save the world should be done with a credit card rather than a check (you get mileage that way).  The change in the credit card point in this movie says it all.<br /><br />I know that this is supposed to be a science fiction in the grand tradition of those films from the 1950s and 1960s when smart people figure out what is wrong and smart people figure out how to solve the problem (e.g., "Them").  I know that this is, on several levels, simply "Fantastic Voyage" for this generation, and yet another part of the genre that insists that no matter how dire the circumstances, human ingenuity can save the day (unless it is a planet rather than an asteroid that is going to crash into Earth, in which case we draw lots and save a couple dozen people).  I am also pretty convinced that all the science is purposefully absurd, but when I learned the nuclear devices had to be placed at the right spots within inches and exploded at the proper times within microsecond, my bubble of suspended disbelief popped.  Ironically, the fact that the actors are so earnest and so good in their roles just made the absurd science seem all that more absurd.  You can certainly enjoy "The Core" on some level, but it is probably safer to be prepared to be disappointed, even with the trailer giving fair warning.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Journeyman director Jon Amiel, who gave us COPYCAT and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE looks like he's gone for B-movie territory somewhere between cliche-ridden disaster movie and tounge-in-cheek action. The special effects do look impressive, and it could be one of those dumb but fun popcorn munching flicks. But with a no-name cast (Except for Hilary Swank) and non-existent plot, this is one of the few upcoming movies that could go both ways. Not that many people care though.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>I always have to chuckle when folks watch science FICTION movies for scientific accuracy.  Remember, in the genre type, science is the adjective and fiction is the noun.  I am an engineer by education, a dedicated amateur astronomer, and a huge sci fi fan.  Almost 20% of my extensive home video library is catagorized as sci fi.  I don't watch sci fi movies for scientific accuracy; I watch them for entertaining creativity.  All sci fi movies take a kernal of scientific knowledge, add a little social spice, then creatively extrapolate the recipe to the ridiculous while presenting the theme as realistically plausible.  The Core is no different.  It is just a fun movie to watch. The cast worked well together with contrasting personalities.  The core seeking sub was creatively designed but unfortunately constructed out of a silly named material.  Finally, like most sci fi movies, shows, and many novels, the end wraps up a little too quickly, but The Core is still a fun science FICTION movie to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>The Core: 5 out of 10: Disaster movies always seem to do better when the disaster is local in scope. A city threatened by avalanche, a tower threatened by an inferno, a Poseidon threatened by an adventure, that kind of thing. Earth killer movies are always a harder road.<br /><br />You have your 4 standard horseman of the earth disaster; nuclear war, space invaders, plagues (esp. those that create zombies), and meteors. Lately earth killing movies have gotten creative and lets face it stupid, global warming (The Day after Tomorrow), President George W Bush (Fahrenheit 911) and now The Core with it's well' I'm still not sure what broke.<br /><br />The core of the earth stopped spinning (not the earth itself mind you) which is causing the electromagnetic field to dissipate. Okay, that sounds serious. So that would cause what exactly? Apparently the movie wasn't all that sure so we get scenes of some the lamest and implausible disasters ever. Let's put two under the scientific microphone shall we.<br /><br />One involves birds going all Hitchcock in London due to their inability to navigate using the magnetic field. Okay that may effect the birds ability to fly south (Oh my god the pigeons they're going east!), but even the Mr. Magoo of the avian world wouldn't start flying into statues and buses.<br /><br />In another of the all too short montages of disaster a lightning storm destroys the Roman Coliseum. I'm not sure which are more unlikely, lighting striking relatively short rock structure, or the granite exploding when it does. Lightning, last time I checked, was attracted to metal.<br /><br />But what would you expect from a movie that puts a giant windshield in a rock-drilling machine (Made with that magic metal Unobtainium). Keep in mind I've only scratched the surface of the silliness.<br /><br />Acting wise Stanley Tucci is a joy, Hillary Swank still kind of looks like a guy, and everyone else is forgettable. The Core is enjoyable in that bad 50's sci-fi kind of way.

Its hangs together on the worst kind of cliches, and as previous reviewers have said, has no scientific basis at all. At the start its not that bad. The crew of a space shuttle have to land in the middle of L.A. because of the start of the Earths core slowing down, which leads the Shuttles guidance systems astray. This is done quite well although the CGI special effects aren't that great. From there its a rapid decent, excuse the pun.<br /><br />The film is reminisent of Armageddon in style, and amazingly probably not as good, because its even more scientifically unlikely. Quite why Hilary Swank decided to do this film is beyond me. However she and Bruce Greenwood (so good in Thirteen Days as JFK) are the only redeeming features. If you loved Armegeddon you will probably love this, so if in doubt rent it first!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>I've watched every big budget SciFi/Fantasy/Horror film that has come out since 1983. And although some have pleased me greatly (Lord of the Rings, The Ring, etc.), I have to say that The Core fell pretty flat.<br /><br />One of my favorite genre-related films of late was K-Pax, starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Why? Because the CHARACTERS were paramount to the story, not any form of technology or science.<br /><br />Here, in The Core, we have a bit of a mixture but most of the emphasis was placed on the science needed to get the characters TO the center of the earth. At least that's the way I saw it. The ship design, the lasers, crush depth pressures, etc. got a bit too much screen time for my liking. I would've liked to have learned more about these people, their lives, their families, why they're willing to risk everything and try and save the planet. We never really find this out (with the one exception being the butthead scientific advisor to the Pentagon who does it all for fame and fortune...in the beginning). So when several of them begin to die off in gruesome fashions, the emotional impact is negligible on the viewer.<br /><br />Hollywood? Are you listening? Look back to the days of old! The Day the Earth Stood Still, for example. It's always GOT TO BE the characters that pull the story along; not the science.<br /><br />Some might say that I'm anti-science. But I'm not. For science fiction films, that element has to be in there in some way (usually).<br /><br />I will commend whoever wrote the dialogue. It wasn't forced and had some zing! to it:<br /><br />Example, "What will it take to make your ship in three months, Doctor?"<br /><br />"Oh about 15 billion dollars."<br /><br />"Will you take a check?"<br /><br />&lt;other charcter chimes in with> "I thought you'd go with a credit card for the frequent flyer miles."<br /><br />Good and bad aspects in the film.

After such a movie is over, you might think back on how illogical or improbably it all was. You might even watch it again to see how the filmmakers tricked you into buying the plot. Likewise, great action-adventure movies [especially those with great special effects] are such a thrill ride that you overlook or forgive ludicrous characters, inane dialog and comic script construction. For me, "The Core" failed as either a thriller or as escapist entertainment. <p>The movie's title refers to the earth's core - the vast cauldron of molten rock that lies a few miles underneath our planet's surface. As the film starts, random electromagnetic storms are happening all over the world. It turns out that the core is starting to stop spinning, and if man doesn't do something quickly, the planet is toast. As luck would have it, a scientist has invented a ship that can bore through to the core, and it's up to a stalwart [American, of course!] crew to get on board this craft and SAVE THE PLANET!<p>Admittedly, this story line is no dumber than that of "Armageddon" or "Independence Day", but here the special effects are, at best, cheesy and the actors seem especially embarrassed to have taken roles in which the pay checks, rather than the performances, are what's important. Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci and others completely waste their time and ours. <p>I have read reviews by people who defend "The Core" by claiming that dumb movies are dumb movies. I see their point, but to me, there are `good' dumb movies and `bad' dumb movies. "The Core" is in the `bad' category.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>For reasons unknown, the earth's inner core has stopped rotating. Instantly, life around the globe begins to change dramatically. In Boston, 32 people with pacemakers, all within a 10-block radius, suddenly drop dead. In San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge collapses, sending hundreds of people plunging to their deaths. In London's Trafalgar Square, flocks of pigeons lose their ability to navigate, flying into panicked crowds, slamming into windshields and causing drivers to lose control of their cars. And in Rome, as thousands of tourists watch helplessly, an electrical superstorm reduces the ancient Roman Colosseum to rubble. Scrambling to resolve the crisis, government and military officials call upon geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes and a team of the world's most gifted scientists to travel into the earth's core in a subterranean craft piloted by Major Rebecca Childs (Hilary Swank)and Commander Robert Iverson. Their mission: Detonate a nuclear device that will reactivate the core and save the world from sure destruction.  This movie was very predictable.  Problem arises, the government is called in, a device is made and the world is saved.  The End.  If you've seen Armageddon with Bruce Willis, there's no need to see this.  The only difference is that this movie takes place at the earth's core.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>This is a delightful remake of the 1976 movie, At the Earth's Core, starring Peter Cushing (later to be famous for playing the evil Moth Tarkin in Star Wars), and Doug McClure. Much of the science is completely fictional, of course, but don't let that deter you from watching this movie. And actually, much of the structural geology is accurate about the interior of the earth which gets used to good effect in the movie. At one point, the ship is dodging giant diamond crystals the size of Manhattan.<br /><br />Overall though it's just fun, mindless entertainment, and in our sorry age of universal social decay and brouhaha, chronic economic stress and financial disasters, and endless political stalemate and nonsense while Rome burns anything that can provide some diversion is welcome. In fact, Rome does burn in one scene in this movie when the electrostatic discharges in the earth's atmosphere get out of control and fry Rome on what was until then a nice day. With a solid cast including Hilary Swank, Delroy Lindo, Bruce Greenwood, Stanley Tucci, and Aaron Eckhart, more than competent special effects, and a dramatic story, it's an intense sci-fi ride all the way to the earth's core and back.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>THE CORE (2003) is a sci-fi "disaster-ecological-threat" film that is a perennial favorite of mine. While it is fairly straightforward as a plotline (we buggered the earth's core, made it stop spinning, disasters ensue, will get worse, geniuses try to fix it, take ship to center of the earth ... you know) the effects are splashy and the talent is "thick on the ground" as they say.<br /><br />Let's skip the usual details and leave it like this: star power includes the ever-wonderful Aaron Eckhart as the geophysicist who seems to hold a million degrees and helps save the day. Hilary Swank is the Air Force pilot who pilots the Salvation Ship (it's my nickname for the inner-earth vessel "VIRGIL"). Stanley Tucci is the Great Physicist-All-Around-Know-It-All, and the wonderful, charming Delroy Lindo is Dr. Ed Brazzleton, who I name because he's the coolest of them all. He's the guy who is directly responsible for the ultimate saving of the earth.<br /><br />D. J. Qualls is the hacker who is employed by Uncle Sam to assist. The legendary Richard Jenkins is the modest, brave general who heads up the military end of stuff. Bruce Greenwood, yet another super-great but not quite superstar, is the other ship's pilot.

Yes, the film's derivative, to say nothing of its disgustingly obvious plot-hole. Yes, much of it seems to have been thought out in a backward fashion - but it isn't bad for all that. It is far better than, say, SPHERE or about equal to THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW (another favorite of mine). It is loads better than ARMAGGEDON and DEEP IMPACT.<br /><br />If you have never seen it or seen it only once, get it: it is worth having as opposed to not having, and it is funny. It never takes itself too seriously and I was most impressed by the fact that the politics are tongue-in-cheek or just outright missing. In one important scene, Karyo, chuckling, says loudly, "It's a total disaster!"<br /><br />You can't say that about any of the other comparable disaster films, which are usually complete disasters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>My 11 year old bought this DVD and asked me to watch it with him.  How could I say no?  Actually, the movie starts with a rather engrossing beginning.  Strange things begin happening and affecting living creatures seemingly at random.  If we didn't know the name of the movie we were watching, the possibilities could be limitless.  However, the story-line continues on in a challenging but somewhat believable evolving theory.  Top scientists and struggling scientists team together, analyze the problem, and go warp speed on creating a "Fantastic Voyage" on a global scale.  The special affects to this point are really fairly decent.  It's the voyage itself that taxes the imagination to bankrupcy.  I may have missed a scientific explanation or two but I could never figure out how the vehicle was actually able to sustain its' journey.  My 11 year old doesn't worry about such technicalities but I do.<p>The acting is fair to middling.  Everybody chosen for the journey seems to know each other which is, I guess, in keeping with the theme that it's a small world.  On the other hand, I shouldn't be too rough on a film that the whole family can watch together with at least some of them enjoying it.  If you have an 11 year old son who wants a DVD for his birthday, this is probably a reasonable choice.  After all, I could never get mine to watch "Old Yeller".</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>The above line spoken by Oscar winner Hilary Swank is indicative of the dialog in this special effects driven sci-fi saga. Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above. <p>Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are  respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's "studly" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner. <p>The film is passable entertainment. <p>I just kept waiting for the discovery of an underground "civilization" that might have been responsible for all the above ground havoc.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>The advance reviews of Jon Amiel's CORE were terrible so I had rather low expectations that ranged from special effects, to dialogue, to plausibility.  I was pleasantly surprised that CORE delivered in the critical areas that a disaster movie is supposed to.  The opening scene of birds flying amuck brought back some twitching memories of Daphne Dumorier's THE BIRDS.  Other vignettes of geological and meteorological minor catastrophes well prepared me for the initial premise that would destroy the earth: that the spinning core of the planet's molten center had--well--stopped spinning, thus destabilizing the earth's magnetic fields and exposing humanity to the full force of incoming cosmic radiation.  Now, even though I had no previous awareness that the core rotates, I could accept that it might stop.  The so-called cheesy special effects were not cheesy at all.  The lightning bolts ripping apart the Colloseum in Rome looked real enough. Further, the images seen through the drill ship's camera of the earth's core reminded me in a wacky way of the sights and sounds experienced by James Mason and Pat Boone as they also headed down towards the center of the earth in the film of the same name.  Having a lovely female terranaut-scientist aboard brough back an image of Raquel Welch from FANTASTIC VOYAGE.  To carp over the unlikelihood of humanity's being able to build a drill ship in three months is to miss the point.  As the terranauts drilled their way down to the core to restart its rotation, I found that I actually cared about their collective fates.  The ability of the audience to do that is what separates impure dreck from its more pure cousin that CORE certainly is.  CORE is not a great movie, nor is it even a very good one, but is is good enough to be the latest update of a colorized 1950s B movie about the end of this world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>I love Sci fi movies and I truly appreciate how the digital and technological advances have served movie making in the last few years, helping to take the viewer to a level, that was in itself in the realm of science fiction..But one thing I love in a movie, is to forget that I am watching one, and be totally engaged in it regardless of the genre.<br />The Core, put simply, was unable to achieve this most basic requirement.<br />The problem with the film revolves mainly around two reasons,<br />The first are the digital effects.<br />Primarily their purpose is to take the viewer into a world of make believe,and dazzle and entertain him/her in the process.In the Core, I was constantly AWARE of these effects, time and time again, which tended to be overwhelming without being impressive. The ship looked like a cigar case, while the earth's insides looked like a computer generated goo.<br />Sci fi films of the past, and the first Star Wars is one very good example, became such hits by using comparatively speaking primitive effects (miniatures..), but their success was due to the fact that the viewer was so engaged in the film that he/she were either not aware of the technicalities of the sets/action or did not really care..This alas was absent from the Core.<br />The second reason behind The Core's failure in my opinion, was the emphasis on character.Let me explain..<br />If you watch the making of, the director and producer stress over and over again that their film is not merely effects but is character based as well,and much deeper than its genre would suggest.<br />I have a problem with that..Because on one hand there is nothing wrong with films (Sci fi/horror/action) who do not pretend to be deeper than they really are, but offer sheer escapist entertainment..There are countless excellent films that are actors based and are zillion years better.<br />On the other hand, watching the Core, and with lines like 'the world is destiny and the destiny is the world' you really wonder where on earth is this character based angle of the film? There are such similar lines in the film that gives you that nauseous feeling you have after eating too much cheese!<br />The actors who signed for the film are very good, especially Hilary Swank and Stanley Tucci(but his character came out more like a dandy bon vivant than the genius scientist he is supposed to be).<br />To be fair, and to give credit where credit is due, some of the effects, especially the crazed pigeons in Trafalgar Square were well done, but they seem so much like isolated scenes that do not make one whole movie.<br />The film could have been much better, with its simple story of a group of scientists trying to restart the rotation of earth electromagnetic field, and save the world, had digital effects been less in 'your face' and had the filmmakers not troubled themselves too much with their emphasis on characters,a nd taken themselves and their film less seriously ..but alas they did not, and as a result that Core is very shallow.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>As seeing so many disastrous disaster films, with only a few exceptions, I had put off seeing this for a long time. But, this film is pretty good. Yes, some of it is predictable, but there are also some novel ideas presented. Much of it is believable. The action is not edge-of-your-seat, but it is nail-biting at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>Some people rip this movie to pieces for various scientific implausibilities, I like to look at it as a two hour comic book, a good way to pass a rainy afternoon.<br />Yes, it is unlikely that a scientific loner working alone in the desert for 20 years on a shoestring budget could develop a miracle rock cutting laser drill and a miracle alloy(?) he calls Unobtainium, but it looked good on screen.<br />The silliest bits I saw in the whole plot were the three month construction time (three years would be super speedy),the crystal geode like cave miles down our heroes briefly get trapped in, the giant diamonds they collide with (in a flow of magma?, I 'd say the heat would destroy them)and that super X-Ray I guess they used to see their way to the core (three feet of lead from 50 feet away?, that kind of power in an X-Ray would kil anyone near it). That stuff still looked pretty good though and they were the worst of the effects.<br />I thought that the emergency shuttle landing in the L.A. river channel looked very good but hokey at the end, the disoriented birds in London scene looked real, the San Francisco and Rome scenes were good, Rome better.<br />I found the cause of the rotation failure to be interesting and as believable as anything in the movie (if stronger than likely reality). It turns out that there was an Us vs. Them(who were they?) arms race in which both sides built a planet damaging bomb, the other guys tested theirs first with disastrous results.I also liked the way Our leaders were going to save the day by setting their own bomb off, until the crew of the Virgil got word back to the staff hacker (who was supposed to hack the internet to keep the disaster secret)who then hacked into the bomb base and basically turned the lights off just in the nick of time.<br />Not a great movie, kind of like the old 50's stuff with better FX, and slow at times but I still say it's a good way to use up some spare time.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>I'm not really sure how to critique a movie that never really aspires to do anything more then what's already been done before. <p>That said, it was made in the same mold as Independence Day, Armageddon, the list could go on forever.

I agree with most reviewers that this film was not hard sci-fi, but had some nice ideas, good CGI and fine performances.  I don't think there is enough there to warrant several viewings.<br /><br />Note, that the term "unobtainium alloy" referred to in the plot was widely used by many engineers (at least) since 1971 when I heard it jokingly referred to at P&WA's materials research & development lab (MRDL). It was probably coined and used years ago by other engineers and scientists and the author did not originate this cute handle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The subject is interesting. The topic is fascinating. The treatment is quite reassuring. But the ideology is hateful. Imagine some natural, geological or cosmic catastrophe meaning the end of the earth, hence of humanity. The loss of the magnetic field of the earth is one possibility since it has been going down for a few decades and no one can explain. If such a phenomenon were truly happening, the normal reaction would be to bring all scientists around the world together to find a solution. There cannot be any moral and acceptable salvation for humanity, or even a little part of humanity if it does not mobilize everyone, every country, every nation. The film is unluckily hijacked by the military that imposes the vision of some aggressive attack from an enemy. They seem to listen to the scientists and politicians for a while, but at the same time they have their own Plan B ready which is purely military. That is why the military should have no power whatsoever and their finances should be scrutinized constantly, for them not to be able to have their own plans. That's why the finances of the military are supposed to be voted by Congress, but is what Congress votes always clear? Certainly not and that is true in every country. There are some blind or invisible lines hidden in some other budgets. That is revealing about a lack of democracy in our countries: the armed forces are not 100% open to public scrutiny and they do things they have never been allowed to do. The film though takes a clear stand against this and manages to defeat Plan B, thanks to a hacker in the place. We could of course wonder why they brought that hacker into the sanctuary. But for the film he was needed and was able to fulfill his promise. I must say I did not like his nose. Too visible, too outstanding. A hacker is supposed to be absolutely invisible, hence just plain normal, average, banal, in no way conspicuous. Then the treatment of the volunteers in that last chance mission is quite flat after all. A little bit of rage but a lot of positive tension. A situation in which one must sacrifice after the other should create a real tension that could be and become negative, including the absolute loss of all reactivity in an individual who knows there is no way out. But It was a pleasant film after all.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>Saw this movie in 1999 when it was called "Armageddon".<br /><br />This version is no better, though I knew it was a dog before I got it.<br /><br />Yeah, "suspend the disbelief" for the science - I get it. However, I have problems with the "real" part, too, which includes lightweight birds completely shattering car and store windows (they mostly just bounce off), the space shuttle improbably landing (haha) where it did, general vehicular physics (such as whiplash), and the fact that although the movie managed to spell "acquire" correctly, they could not spell "on its way" correctly (it's not "on it's way") in the cyber cafe scene at the end.<br /><br />I was able to recognize both of the famous actors, Hilary Swank and Alfre Woodard, because they were the only females. Who were the guys, again?<br /><br />The commentary is OK, but I haven't gotten to the "making of", a special effect "deconstruction", or deleted scenes yet.

Now, that being said, the movie is watchable in the same light as Armageddon, Volcano, Day After Tomorrow, or any of the other "End of the World" schlock that exists.  These movies are the 2000s equivalent of the "post-apocalyptic" genre of the 80s.<br /><br />What can mankind do to save the ENTIRE world?  Well, a handful of the world's best scientists ought to do the trick.  I was on-board for the ride once this movie got rolling.  I bought into space shuttle landing, I even bought the excessively-long "pigeon genocide", but I had to draw the line at "The-single-female-space-pilot-ties-a-windsor-knot" scene.  It took me a while to recover from that.<br /><br />All these things being said, I enjoyed the movie.  Truly it is only a time-killer and not to be taken for ANYTHING more than that.  It is not a social statement.  It is not a "humans-are-bad" statement.  It is JUST A MOVIE.  There are plenty of worse movies that actually get awards each year.<br /><br />It is kind of interesting that the Earth that the heros are trying to save plays the only antagonist in the movie...but let's not start "social dialogue" at this point....</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>The end of the world is a concept that has been dealt with in movies several times, sometimes successfully, other times not so much.  The successes when they occur are generally huge box office blockbusters, such as; "Armageddon" and "ID4: Independence Day", unsuccessful examples would be the dismally boring films, "Deep Impact" and "Battlefield Earth".  Generally speaking, when Hollywood deems it time to do another end of the world disaster movie, the threat originates from somewhere in outer space, whether it be asteroids streaking towards Earth or aliens determined to annihilate us, space is where it all begins.  To shake things up Warner Brothers decided to do another end of the world disaster movie, but this time have the threat to civilization come from within Earth itself.<br /><br />The story of "The Core" is the `what if?' tale of the Earth's core (or engine as it is referred to in this movie) no longer spinning.  This event causes numerous geological disasters to occur that will culminate with the complete destruction of the ozone layer, allowing the sun's rays to blast us into oblivion.  To prevent this disaster from occurring a team of scientific specialists are brought in to drill a hole into the Earth's crust down to it's core, using an experimental ship to get them there, and detonating a nuclear bomb that will in theory `kick-start' the Earth's core into spinning again.<br /><br />With a hokey storyline pulled directly out of a B-movie science fiction film.  That borrows heavily from previous disaster films ("Armageddon" for example), Warner Brothers looked as if they had a gigantic stinker on their hands.  But surprisingly Warner Brothers pulled off an entertaining, though predictable summer movie.  Good acting and dazzling special effects provide enough distraction from the flimsy storyline that feels way too much like "Armageddon", in the sense that the scientists must pilot an experimental ship into the Earth's core and detonate a nuclear device to prevent disaster.  That sounds an awful lot like a team of oil drillers and NASA scientists being sent into space to detonate a nuclear bomb that will split a huge asteroid in two pieces, averting disaster.<br /><br />Complaints aside this was a well-acted film with a talented cast comprised of Delroy Lindo, Aaron Eckhart, and Hilary Swank.  Though I felt I had seen much of the movie before due to similarities, I still enjoyed the film for what it was, a good popcorn flick that is not intended to be thought provoking in any way at all.  If you are in the mood for a good disaster flick, or to just get away from it all for two hours then I recommend sitting down and watching "The Core".<br /><br />"The Core" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>I'm a huge fan of Delroy Lindo, I think he is such a good actor. When I saw this DVD on my library shelf I picked it up.  I'm really glad I did.  For some odd reason he earth's core stops spinning.  Folks with pace makers suddenly drop dead.  Birds go crazy, and some serious landmarks are destroyed.  The world could end.  6 people are selected to help save the earth by going into the ground to restart the earth's core. Dr. Joshua Keyes(Aaron Eckhart) a college professor, Rat (DJ Qualls) is a computer hacker, NASA Astronaut major Rebecca Childs (Hillary Swank), Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanly Tucci) Ed Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo) who is a recluse that designed and built the drill and ship to be used on the mission.  Rounding out the cast is Commander Robert Iverson (Greenwood).  I have to say Stanly Tucci played his role well.  I hated him!!!<br /><br />A magnetic storm destroys Rome.  Watching the Golden Gate bridge fall was amazing!!!!  Out of the whole cast only two survive.  The reason I enjoyed this movie is the focus was not just on special effects.  You got a nice story about the actual crew members involved in this assignment. The characters were well rounded, and there were scenes in the movie where I really felt for some of the characters.  When Rebecca had to make a heart wrenching decision that resulted in the death of a crew member, it really made me feel for both characters. I was on the edge of my seat, holding my chest.  This movie had a good plot.  I was not bored by this movie at all.  It actually intrigued me a great deal.  Not to mention the subtle humor that was interwoven throughout the film.  As usual the government was involved.<br /><br />I could care less if this type of scenario could happen in real life.  It's a movie.  I thought with movies you could make up far fetched scenarios that will be entertaining and provide some escape for a couple of hours.  Well that's what this movie did, and it did it well.  I think the Core is almost as good as Armageddon.  Armageddon had more action, but the Core came close.  The movie was entertaining, and to me that's all that matters. This movie made me think of Fantastic Voyage.  That was also far fetched, but the idea of being able to send a ship into the human body was entertaining.  This was a good movie.  It's one I would be willing to add to my DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>My my my...what a stellar cast for such a bone-headed film. Yes, disaster flicks per se are not intended to be Shakespeare, and are known for predictability, but a good one is not flat-out stupid.<br /><br />OK. So, the core of the earth has stopped, possibly due to something called "Destiny", which resides in a standard-issue, mysterious but rectangular, hiding-in -plain-sight Government desert hangar thingee.<br /><br />It's time to burrow into the earth, blow stuff up with big bombs, and kick-start the earth's engine.<br /><br />Since there's no way this could work without something happening along the way, the back up plan involves using this "destiny" thing.<br /><br />Again.<br /><br />That's kinda stupid.<br /><br />Moving on, the actual coring through the earth was fun for the first part...crunching through the crust I guess you could say. Then it gets sort of psychedelic, like they're flying through some bad Peter Max LSD trip.<br /><br />I thought of the film, "Yellow Submarine."<br /><br />That's not complimentary to this film though.<br /><br />Certain scientific plot devices seem to be skimmed over, as if the filmmakers feel too much thought in any one area is "bad."<br /><br />There will always be a little of what I call "Yeah right" in any good disaster film. Any person with more than four functioning neurons will be able to point to a part in any end-of-the-world/city/state scenario, roll their eyes, and say, "Yeah...riiiight."<br /><br />That's OK. That's part of the charm of big, dumb fun movies.<br /><br />You just don't want to be thinking that too much or too often. Then "dumb" turns into "stupid".<br /><br />On the other hand, the set of actors they have for this film is staggering! Had they focused on the crew and their interactions while in the drill-train-shuttle, we could have really had something here. They work wonders with what they're given.<br /><br />And there ARE some genuinely exciting moments, as I forced myself to give in to this film. I love this sort of stuff; I just wanted it done a little better.<br /><br />"Armageddon", for all it's faults, is a big, dumb, fun film.<br /><br />This is no "Armageddon".<br /><br />Take that for what you will.</p></br><a href="../users/A5WMBIOGE8Q6N.html">A5WMBIOGE8Q6N</a><br/><p>Dr. Josh Keyes is the commander of the ship designed to journey to the inner core.

It was a really dumb, but I was entertained nonetheless.  Don't see this is you are expecting a good movie just because it has a good cast.  But if your looking to laugh at a bad movie, then you will find this quite entertaining.  I'll just give you a quick summary of what this movie is about.  It stars Hilary Swank as a brilliant scientist/earthship pilot.  The world is about to be destroyed because the earth's core has stopped rotating, and everything is chaos.  In order to fix this little problem, Swank and some others must go down into the earth's core and shoot it with missiles or something along those lines, and get the roatation back in business.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>"The Core" has all the elements of one of those Hollywood blockbusters. You've got your fancy (cough, cough) CGI special effects. You've got a cast of well-known actors, at least a few anyway. You've got the requisite "save the world" theme. You've got the requisite moral quandaries. And you have the "do or die" dialogue necessary for an apocalyptic action film. With these components in full view, how could the movie do anything but succeed? Unfortunately, the mindless, mediocre plot with more holes in it than a pound of swiss cheese ultimately sinks "The Core." Perhaps Tinseltown can't help itself anymore; they are so desperate to bring in audiences that they'll heap more and more eye candy atop a shallow premise if they think people will buy into it. Movies like this one have finally convinced me that the airheads in Hollywood think most people are idiots. No wonder we have to put up with the political natterings of Babs Streisand, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, and Rob Reiner; these folks actually think everyone else is so stupid that what they say will sound like the learned musings of brilliant minds. The next time you see one of these "celebrities" on a political talk show belching out the latest far left dogma, remember that these are the people responsible for films like "The Core."<br /><br />The plot is so simple a two year old could summarize it (and probably see through it, as well). At the start of the film, we see about thirty people keel over for no discernable reason. The military calls in a couple of big shot professors, one of them Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) from the University of Chicago, to ask them whether the fatalities were due to a terrorist attack. Nope, say the professors, and that's the end of it until a bunch of pigeons go nuts in London. Suspecting something is amiss, Keyes and a couple of his graduate students figure out that the earth's magnetic fields are going bonkers. Moreover, he concludes, with the help of arrogant government scientist Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), that the planet's core no longer turns as it should. If the problem is not corrected in a short period of time, the results will prove catastrophic: electrical storms of savage proportions and the solar wind will turn the globe into a blasted ball of dirt within a year or two. Fortunately, the government knows of a way to possibly avert such an unpleasant series of events. It won't be easy, not by a long shot, but it could be possible to send a crew of humanity's best to the center of the earth in order to restart the core, thus arresting impending destruction.<br /><br />Conveniently for us peons, the smart people have a few tricks up their sleeves. First, there's Dr. Ed Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo) mucking around out in the desert with a laser contraption that will cut holes through solid rock in a matter of seconds. Too, this guy just happened to invent a substance that will withstand massive amounts of heat and pressure--called with a straight face "unobtanium"--that will make for the perfect shell to any potential underground craft. Yippy! Now all the government has to do is bring on board hotshot space shuttle pilot Major Rebecca Childs (Hilary Swank), along with the best computer hacker in the world (D.J. Squalls), and the mission is a go. Everything's slapped together in a matter of months, amazingly enough, and the team sets out with a bunch of nuclear bombs to set matters aright. Predictably, all sorts of problems emerge that the team must deal with to complete the mission. Also predictably, most of the crew perishes in the attempt. There are even a few moral quandaries tossed in for good measure so we can learn how the various team members grow as a result of the difficulties encountered. Am I giving anything away when I say that the mission eventually succeeds? Nope.<br /><br />I'm not saying this picture doesn't have its uses. "The Core" is fun in a so bad it's acceptable sort of way, although it cannot compare to the endlessly entertaining atrocities brought to us from Ed Wood, Jr. or Herschell Gordon Lewis. This picture relies on those immensely overused tried and true formulas straight from the stilted minds of La La Land. There's the evil government weapons project, the secretive military/industrial complex, rampant and ludicrous environmentalism, and fruitcake science all wrapped up with a pretty bow for your viewing pleasure. Overall, the movie does entertain if for no other reason than you can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing (and the lousy CGI effects). The one scene that arguably takes the cake is how the surviving crewmembers manage to steer the shattered remains of the vessel from the center of the earth to the surface without using the rock cutting lasers. I can't repeat the phrase I blared out repeatedly as I witnessed this inanity unfold. Oh brother!<br /><br />Aside from the film, which runs an amazing two hours plus, the DVD comes with a bunch of extras. After watching "The Core," you can listen to a commentary track with director Jon Amiel, view deleted/extended scenes, learn about the special effects seen in the movie, and watch a "making of" documentary. Trailers included on the disc are "Timeline," "Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life," and a promo for the "Indiana Jones" boxed set. I can think of dozens of science fiction films worth watching instead of "The Core." But if you want to laugh out loud at antics wallowing in sheer absurdity, this one might well serve your purposes.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Make no mistake The Core isn't science fiction. In fact, the little bit of science it has in it is closer to fantasy than fact. The Core has more in common with Journey to the Center of the Earth than with The Posideon Adventure or Earthquake!. At its (pardon the pun)core is the spirit of adventure. <p>The planet's core has stopped rotating. That's bad news because the electromagnetic field generated by the spinning core protects us from harmful microwave radiation and temperatures that make those in the Sahara seem like a spa. Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) has discovered this due to a fluke. He passes along the information to a world famous scientist with an ego the size of the Titanic (and just as flawed I might add). <p>This scientist (deliciously played by the talented Stanley Tucci)is alarmed enough to contact the government agencies he works with. Suddenly Keyes is pulled in to work on a project to literally jump start the planet's magnetic core using nuclear devices. Otherwise, all life on Earth will be dead within a year leaving behind charred, burned desolate corpse of a world. <p>An inventor (well played with humor by Delroy Lindo)has come up with a new compound that actually increases its strength the more pressure it is exposed to. It can also withstand molten temperatures. A crew of 6 is selected to make this perilous journey with a very good chance that none of them will come back.<p>Certainly you have to suspend your disbelief. The Core stands in fine company as a theatrical roller coaster ride. The optical effects are generally outstanding. Director Jon Amiel indicated in interviews that he wanted to recreate the awe he felt when he saw films like War of the Worlds and Journey to the Center of the Earth. He manages to do so. This isn't Shakesphere but the entire cast plays their roles with humor and bring their respective characters to life. Filled with cliches, tongue in cheek humor and inventive touches, The Core transcends its limitations. It's a great little popcorn movie.</p></br></body></html>

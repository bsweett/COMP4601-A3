I have not read any of the books, and will only comment on the movie as a stand-alone piece of work.  The strongest impression I had of this movie is the amatuerish feel of everything, including the dialogue, acting, action scenes, story line, and soundtrack.<br /><br />First, the dialogue was simple and boring, full of short sentences and seemed to be ripoffs from other movies.  For example, there is a scene when an evil sorcerer named Durza leads an army of grotesque humanoid creatures into battle.  From the setting of the scene, to the way it was shot, seemed like a total copy of the scene in LOTR: Two Towers when Saruman sends his Uruk-Hai army of to battle.<br /><br />Second, the acting was horrible.  From the death scene of Brom, to King Galbatorix's musings on his throne, most of the serious scenes looked fake.  One good example is after Eragon finds his uncle dead.  Brom tries to take him away and Eragon resists with angry words but weak actions.  Brom easily puts him on a horse and leads him away.  It seems Eragon knew the entire time he had to leave, but was just trying to throw a tantrum.  A more realistic version would be to have Eragon resist Brom violently, and the latter having to knock out the former with a good punch in the face.<br /><br />Third, the action scenes were very disappointing.  This is most apparent at the end when Galbatorix's army invades the land of the Varden.  The ensuing swordfights looked totally staged, and there were several times when two swords are supposed to clash, but no sound is heard.<br /><br />Fourth, the story line was full of holes.  The entire battle scene seems to belong to the bad guys, but somehow the good guys end up victorious by the movie's end.  How did this happen?  Also, who teaches the dragon Saphira how to breathe fire.  One moment she blows hot air; then after one night with the Varden she can blow streams of fire.<br /><br />The soundtrack was also a big disappointment.  I heard one tune repeated over and over again for all the action scenes.  The rest of the movie the soundtrack was unnoticeable.  Of all the recent fantasy movies so far; LOTR, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia and this, this movie has the worst soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, a bad viewing experience.  It was not the worst movie of 2006, but for the hype it received, it was the biggest disappointment.  Unfortunately, the ending scene promises that a sequel is in the works.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>If ever there was a poor man's Lord of the Rings, this would be it.<br /><br />Wow...it was sooo bad!<br /><br />The special effects were ok sometimes. Sometimes. Other times they looked like PS1 graphics.<br /><br />The costumes and set design were so cheesy and the acting was pretty bad. Especially the villains who ham it up every step of the way. And the actors were all wrong for their roles. None of them looked the part. Especially the lead who looked like he should be standing outside an Abercrombie and Fitch store in the mall.<br /><br />And a lot of scenes seemed very...umm...Brokeback Dragon to me. Especially one scene with the main character and his cousin!  Those were the only interesting parts. The rest had me falling asleep.<br /><br />There are supposed to be two more of these movies?? I hope they get a better director and script writer.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Eragon', directed by Stefen Fangmeier, is based on a screenplay by Peter Buchman, from the first novel by teenaged author Christopher Paolini. To point out that the story is loosely based on themes from and the style of the `Lord of the Rings' films is less interesting than to say that it is also based heavily on themes from `Star Wars' and Anne McCafferty's `Dragonriders of Pern' series, both of which are themselves heavily influenced by the `Lord of the Rings' novels first published in 1955 through 1958 and even more so on the first Middle Earth quest described in `The Hobbit'. So, since Tolkien's tales from Middle Earth have had a pervasive influence on fantasy fiction and role-playing gaming for the last 50 years, we must take their influence as a given and move on. The immediate influence on the novel and the movie is not Tolkien's books so much as the great success of the `Lord of the Rings' movies. I also detect some influences from the Matrix trilogy in some scenes, although these influences are minor.<br /><br />The problem now faced by `Eragon' the movie is that with the `Lord of the Rings' movies, Peter Jackson's realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's story has raised the bar so high, practically no one outside of fantasy creative powerhouses such as Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas have the juice to put the kind of creative energy and money into a film to match Jackson's benchmark. The film version of `The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' comes close, but basically served as a proof of my contention that even with a classic script based on a C. S. Lewis' novel and all the resources of the Disney studios, we get a movie which at best comes in a distant second to `Rings'.<br /><br />It may be just a bit less obvious than with `The Fellowship of the Ring', but `Eragon' story is clearly the opening chapter of a series. Virtually the only area where `Eragon' is superior to `Fellowship' is that like the first (Episode IV) `Star Wars' flick, the story is fairly self-contained, with a reasonably satisfying ending. Otherwise, the story is weaker than `Fellowship'. My first observation is that while `Fellowship' had at least fourteen (14) interesting characters, `Eragon' has barely three, and that's counting the dragon. `Fellowship' had the nine members of the fellowship plus Bilbo Baggins, Arwen Evenstar, Elrond, Galadrial, and Saruman. And that's not counting the black riders, Barliman Butterbur and the Balrog! I count Jackson's greatest achievement with the filming of `Rings' is his (and Elijah Woods) making the character of Frodo Baggins interesting and sympathetic. Through countless readings of `Rings', I could never shake the notion that Frodo was a wimp. In the movie, he is beset with doubt, but he does not come off as a wimp! So, compared to the character of Eragon, the filmed Frodo Baggins is much more interesting. Eragon's mentor, played well by Jeremy Irons, is simply no match for Viggo Mortensen's realization of `Ring's Strider / Aragorn character. Again, I was never entirely happy with Aragorn on the written page. Director and actor really make the most of his character.<br /><br />While there was no dragon in `Rings', we do get a superb realization of an intelligent, speaking dragon in the gloriously limned picture of the great Smaug in `The Hobbit'. In comparison, our friendly dragon Saphira, voiced by Rachel Weisz, carries her own.<br /><br />The primary heavy, the `shade', in the employ of king Galbatorix (a waste of the talents of John Malkovich) is no match for the heavies in `Fellowship', that being primarily the black riders (who still give me nightmares after reading about them one late Saturday night, forty years ago), the Balrog, and the Uruk-hai (Saruman's own special breed of orc).<br /><br />When it comes to pivotal scenes, `Eragon' pales in comparison to `Fellowship'. One can claim that Jackson actually drags out some scenes just a bit too much to milk them for all they are worth, but I totally forgive him for his totally convincing realization of the encounter between Gandalf and the Balrog. Director Fangmeier has nothing that comes even close.<br /><br />The other speaking characters in `Eragon' seem to never be adequately introduced or explained, and in the world of grand mythical fiction, that is the cardinal sin, as it is the primary legacy of Tolkien's work. In no other world of science fiction or fantasy do we have the depth of realized legend, language and lore as in Tolkien. McCafferty in `Dragonriders' and Lucas in `Star Wars' come close, and that is why the work as well as they do.<br /><br />The director's commentary on this DVD was interesting, but it failed to provide much of the mythical background I so much want in works like this. This is a fair effort, but the series has a long way to go to come up to its legendary model.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>Having not read the books I came to this film with an open mind and although it's not amazing, it is a pretty decent medieval type fantasy adventure. Following Eragon as he acquires a Dragon egg and subsequently learns to be a Dragon Rider, this film has plenty of CGI animation and sword fights. Eragon has to fight to rid the lands of an evil king and his tyrannical rule and battles against a shade (or wizard to you and me) in the form of Robert Carlyle. All in all this is pretty standard fantasy film fare, with nothing highly original or earthshaking. The effects are good and the story, although lack lustre, manages to keep you watching. I'm inclined to feel if it was much longer I'd be getting bored though. The cast is sadly underused and Jeremy Irons and Malkovich could deliver so much more. If you like fantasy type films then you'll probably enjoy this, even if you've enjoyed better examples of the genre in the past and if you don't watch many then this will still provide a couple hours of light entertainment where you don't have to think too hard. From reading other reviews you may enjoy this more if you haven't read the books! Good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>** SPOILERS ahead, in case you can't predict the whole movie anyway **<br /><br />Another entry in my neverending quest to watch every last fantasy and science fiction film ever, no matter how bad,  ERAGON - based on the supposedly awful first novel by the then-teenage Christopher Paolini - is surprisingly enough not nearly as terrible as I expected it to be.  It kept me awake at least, and only had one or two actually cringe-inducing moments; I suspect that, as much as I'm bored with generic stuff like this, I'm also more able to tolerate some of it simply because I like the Tolkien-influenced genre tropes to begin with; those who don't have patience for stuff like farmboys-becoming-chosen-heroes for no reason whatsoever other than that's what the story says will probably be less generous than I am, and perhaps be annoyed that they've seen it all before even if they haven't seen it nearly as many times as I have. There's something to be said for being a genre specialist I suppose.<br /><br />But generic this story is, unfortunately, and ultimately its greatest sin is dullness and predictability. Let's see how few words it takes to sum it up: years ago there were dragons and dragonriders that protected the land of Alaga?sia, until one day one of them went all bad and decided to kill all of his buddies and take power over the land for himself. His name was John Malkovich, oops I mean Galbatorix (Paolini's strength, if he has one, is not in naming). But one egg somehow got saved (this is never explained) and eventually a young woman guarding it, Arya (Sienna Guillory) saves it from the king's evil magician Durza (Robert Carlyle) by sending it to Eragon (Ed Speleers) a young farmboy. The king soon realizes what's up and sends people to kill the kid, but not before the dragon hatches. Soon the town is aflame and Eragon has to escape with his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) - which grows to adulthood instantly in one of those "magic" moments. They're helped out by an older, wise man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, sorry I mean Brom (Jeremy Irons, who also narrates the opening few minutes) who knows - well, you'll figure it out. They have to get to the Vardens, the people who resist the king, but Eragon gets a psychic message from the imprisoned Arya and decides to go save her; Brom of course counsels against this but Eragon being headstrong goes ahead, penetrates the Death Star and saves Princess Leia with the help of the brash young Han Solo, but not before Brom sacrifices himself in the fight against Darth Vader...oops, there I did it again. Well, you get the idea. And at the end there's a spectacular battle as the dragon has learned to breathe fire and Eragon gets to avenge Brom, yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />What saves this from being really horrible is the acting of Irons and Weisz, who really put a lot of heart and seriousness into this silly stuff, some nice photography that actually has a decent range of light and color palettes compared to the typical modern action film (courtesy of DP Hugh Jackson), and relatively competent and brisk direction on the part of first-time feature director Fangmeier. Yes, the 104 minutes gloss over an awful lot of stuff that must have been developed better (well one hopes so) in the book, but this being so utterly lacking in originality only the stupidest or youngest and least experienced of viewers are going to really have trouble knowing what's going on or filling in the blanks. Even really idiotic scenes like Irons' reappearance in the magician's stronghold just in time to save Eragon by taking a spear for him can probably be explained through "magic" which we gradually learn lets dragonriders do just about anything. How convenient.<br /><br />So I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if you're in the mood for completely undemanding, mindless fantasy there's plenty out there that is much worse, and I'm happy to give it two stars; in a really generous mood it could even push for a third.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>What I liked about this story was how dazzlingly original the characters and plot elements were.  A young farmboy who finds a secret weapon and becomes the savior of the land?  A bearded wizard who guides him to maturity?  A spunky princess in need of rescuing?  A besieged group of good guys who triumph unexpectedly when all seems lost?  The henchman's evil right-hand man who is killed, beyond all hope, at the very last moment?<br /><br />Truly groundbreaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Eragon (Stefan Fangmeier, 2006)<br /><br />Fangmeier, the visual effects supervisor for a number of high-profile effects-heavy movies (among his resume are Saving Private Ryan, Terminator 2, and Twister, among many others), takes to the director's chair for his big screen debut. And my oh my, is it an ambitious one-- Christopher Paolini's epic novel Eragon, here adapted by Peter Buchman. Don't know the name? Well, this was only his second project. The first was Jurassic Park III.<br /><br />Are alarm bells going off in your head yet? They should be.<br /><br />If there's one thing Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien taught us, it's that if you put a lot of effects in a movie and back it up with some solid characters, audiences will, in fact, sit through three hours of movie. (Most other countries in the world recognize this. It's only America where we have this odd attention span problem with movies over two hours.) And Eragon demands a three-hour treatment; I mean, come on, this is a book of almost six hundred pages, and it's dense. Paolini packed a great deal of action into those pages, but there was more than enough room for character development, uneasy alliances, witty repartee, and all the other things that made the book such a fun read. Buchman, in short, butchered it. Major characters disappear entirely, and others exist only, it seems, to pacify readers of the novel. (Murtagh is the biggest major character given short shrift, getting only eight lines; the big plot twist regarding him is relegated to a useless piece of trivia in the film.) He did keep a good portion of the action, but that's about it.<br /><br />Worse is (some of) the acting. There are a number of big names in here, and they give varying levels of expertise in their performances. Jeremy Irons, by far, is the brightest light among them. As Brom, Eragon's mentor, Irons conveys the character's mix of amusement, despair, and gratitude quite well (in fact, Irons makes Brom a much more likable and three-dimensional chap than he was in the book). John Malkovich comes perilously close to overacting to unintentional hilarity as King Galbatorix; his only saving grace is that he doesn't get enough screen time to really mess things up. Joss Stone is as flatly uninteresting an actress as she is a singer. Robert Carlyle I didn't even recognize, he's so cardboard here. Djimon Hounsou looks as if he's about ready to burst into laughter at the ludicrousness of it all. Edward Speelers, the unknown cast in the title role, comes relatively close to getting it right, but there's no sense of him going from na?ve farm boy to accomplished warrior-mage. (I am, however, willing to place the blame for that entirely on the butchered script.) The others? Don't bother. Speelers, Irons, and Rachel Weisz (as the voice of Sephira the dragon) are the only characters here who get more than twenty or thirty lines in the entire film.<br /><br />The one thing Eragon does have in its favor is the visual effects. Given Fangmeier's usual job description, that's not surprising. A lot of the effects seem rather unrooted in the storyline, but there you go. And while Sephira's development is mostly sacrificed in the interests of saving time, what we see of her is wonderful, especially the scenes of her as an infant.<br /><br />Despite the above, I have to say, I seem to have liked the movie a lot more than most people did. It is not the book by any means, and it is clumsily-handled in the extreme, but I think it does manage to do what it sets out to-- be a mindless action flick with a whole lot of special effects. For a turn-your-brain-off good time, it's not awful if you've never read the book. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>ERAGON is one of those films that makes Sci-Fi and Fantasy lovers cringe. It is plainly a horrifically done adaption of Christopher Paolini's book by the same name, slashing vital plots into nothingness, showing forced performances by some the best actors of our time (the most noteworthy being John Malkovich), and producing a main character (Eragon played by Edward Speelers) who grows too fast and is rarely sympathetic in the short 104 minutes of the entire film.<br /><br />Note that time: 104 minutes. Chris Paolini wrote Eragon as a sort of epic, brandishing derivative works such as Tolkien's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618640150">The Lord of the Rings</a> series and McCaffrey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345340248">Dragonriders of Pern</a> stories. But Paolini was only fifteen when he started writing it, so quite a bit of leeway was given to him because of youthful inexperience. He did create an interesting world, but the book was lukewarm at best (in my opinion) yet sparked the imagination of younger readers. Perhaps his book could be considered a gateway to the more in-depth novels by Tolkien, McCaffrey, and the other great fantasy authors. Regardless, his "epic" was slashed to 104 minutes ...although the ending of this movie certainly leaves it open for a sequel even though there's NOTHING on the film radar/horizon to suggest one is coming. Which pretty much leaves this flick dead in the water. Dropping off plots in order to wedge the story into a certain time-frame for a certain audience has proved disastrous time after time. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings movies</a> (178 min., 179 min., and 201 min. respectively), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia</a> (143 min.) and many, many other lengthy films proved this. Although they did make alterations to the literary works, they kept almost all of the plots intact. Of course longer movies mean more costs for the production studio, too.<br /><br />So the first big strike against Eragon is its short length in comparison to the depth the novel gave us.<br /><br />The second is the acting. When the best job is done by a CGI character who's voiced by Rachel Weisz (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1PXM">The Constant Gardner</a>), you know there's a problem. Her Saphira voice-over is done well, leaving all the other actors/actresses in the dust. Although Jeremy Irons (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDWKXI">Casanova</a>) does a middlin' job as the old dragonrider Brom, it most certainly isn't his most shining moment on celluloid. Many of his lines are stilted and sound as if he's afraid to use more than five words in a sentence. From here, the acting takes a serious nosedive into oblivion. Newbie Edward Speelers as Eragon is rip-your-eyes-out bad. You can tell he's trying way to hard to make his character empathetic and interesting but the script wouldn't allow it. Sienna Guillory as the magical Arya is practically unknown to the viewer, never letting us know why she, of all people, is carrying something so important through such a dangerous land. Robert Carlyle as the dastardly Duza is probably the most forced evil character you'll ever see, making you laugh at him more than fear him.<br /><br />The best quality within the movie was the CGI. The images were rendered exceptionally well and the dragon Saphira has a very authentic look to her (which was good considering how much time she's onscreen).<br /><br />If you loved Paolini's Eragon novel, you'll probably screech in dismay at this adaption. If you didn't, you'll probably screech in dismay anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>This movie features one incredible character! He's unbelievably sexy, intelligent, quick-witted, fast on his feet, more than able to swing a sword or shoot an arrow. He's everything you would want in a movie hero!<br /><br />His name is Murtagh, and sadly he's basically just a low-level sidekick.<br /><br />The actual "hero" of this movie is named Eragon. He's a pathetic little creature. Arrogant, self-centered, obnoxious, annoying, oblivious and generally just awful.<br /><br />"Eragon" the movie is an almost perfect translation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044023848X">Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)</a> the book. It very excellent captures the pointless characters, the ripped-off plot, the badly-done setting and clunky dialogue. To those things is adds mediocre acting, lousy directing and even worse dialogue.<br /><br />On agonybooth.com there's a write up of this movie. It points out certain things that seem obvious, but escaped the filmmaker's attention (like why is Eragon hunting in the middle of the night? Why does this "poor farm boy", live on what is, by mideval standards, a small estate? Why does he keep his bow strung and hung on a wall? Why does his cousin wear blue jeans? This, mind, is in the first ten minutes). The film also leaves one wondering why the Evil Bad Guy (tm), keeps his throne room so darkly lit. Surely there's tons of people who wanna stab him. Logically, shouldn't he keep his space bright and cheerful in order to keep from being snuck up on? (and no, I'm not sure of the grammar there, either)<br /><br />Given the source materiel, I don't know if it was possible at any point for this to be made into a decent movie. None of the actors are bad. Some of them are quite good, just horrible in their roles. I know it would've been helpful had the elven character had pointy ears and had the dwarf character not been the same height as everyone else.<br /><br />Basically, this is a movie that makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXQM">Dungeons & Dragons (New Line Platinum Series)</a> look intelligent and complex. It's the kind of movie that gives fantasy films a bad name. Had this film been made before the Lord of the Rings movies, it would have merely been stupid. Now it's just insulting to fans of fantasy and movies in general.<br /><br />The final black mark against this movie? I HATED the book. Just check my review of it. I'd still rather read the book again than watch this movie. That's how bad it is.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Reading over a few of the reviews of this film I noticed one major difference between those who enjoyed the movie and those who, well, hated it.  Folks who read the book this film is based on generally seemed to regard this film as an atrocity.  Those people who didn't read the book (such as myself) either really enjoyed the movie or thought it was a mediocre film at best.  I happened to really enjoy the film.  It isn't the greatest fantasy flick to ever grace the silver screen but, then again, most fantasy flicks aren't out to be the greatest.  The bulk of them simply tell a generic story of a "chosen" one who sets out to fulfill their destiny or sacrifice their livelihood for the good of others.  To say that the film is cliche is cliche in and of itself.  Even those films and books considered to be some of the best fantasies involve a singular hero (Frodo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, etc.) who, with a small band of friends, faces off against terrible odds and somehow manages to succeed.  Lesser fantasy films like "Krull," "Willow," "Dragonslayer," and others all reflect the exact same story as do the great ones.<br /><br />"Eragon" falls into this "lesser" fantasy category.  It's a very fun, fast-paced film that tells the story of a young boy who becomes the "last dragonrider."  He's expected to lead the war against the wicked King Galbatorix and his legion of evil.  Along the way he develops friendships with shady characters and honorable fellows.  It's a stock fantasy to say the least, but it's still fun to watch it unfold.<br /><br />I agree with others that say there are plenty of underdeveloped characters.  I also see where many would say that the film is too rushed.  However, with that said, I still found this film to be palatable.  The special effects are well done.  The dragon, Sephira (voiced by Rachel Weisz), is wonderful to look at.  The actors do a fine job with what they're given to work with although some, especially John Malkovich, lack sufficient screentime to really get a grasp on them.  The music fits the fantasy setting very well.  There's nothing that's overly terrible about the movie as a whole in my opinion.<br /><br />So, if you enjoy fantasy films along the same lines as "Krull" and "Willow," "Eragon" should be right up your alley.  If you've read and enjoyed the book, I'm pretty sure you won't enjoy this movie based on the opinion of others reviewing this film.  I had no problem with it and also have no problem with adding this film to my personal collection.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fantasy film fans.  Not recommended to fans of the book this is based on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Eragon was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, and Djimon Hounsou among others, though by no means is it a bad movie.<br /><br />A young farm boy comes across a strange stone that holds the key to the past, the present, and the future...<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but really nothing great), the dialogues are weak, the plot is average, the setting is good, while the special effects are very good.<br /><br />On the negative side:<br /><br />1) The unoriginal story/plot, which is heavily "borrowed" from LoR, Star Wars and the Dragonlance Chronicles by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis (all three being AMAZING btw...)<br /><br />2) The rather poor choice for the lead actor.<br /><br />3) Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle being given poor lines and majorly cliche roles to play.<br /><br />4) Djimon Hounsou looking completely out of place in this film.<br /><br />5) John Malkovich counting 2-3 minutes of actual play.<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />1) The Fantasy setting<br /><br />2) The very good special effects; Saphira was great!<br /><br />3) Sienna Guillory (!) who definitely has potential.<br /><br />So it's an average plot, weak dialogues, decent acting, an interesting setting, respectable music (though it could have been better), and a good cast, which when put together fail to take off.  The potential for a great movie was definitely there and although it's far from being a masterpiece, it will provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>Unlike "Lord of the Rings",I was in stitches within the first five minutes of this movie.<br /><br />Instead of the stately&perpetually talented Cate Blanchett speaking of the changes in Middle-Earth,we gave the pious,noble narration of Jeremy Irons.Irons has one MAJOR problem--he has a hard time saying "Alagaesia" (it's Al-uh-GAY-zuh,to quote the book's pronunnciation guide).So does Sienna Guillory.Jeremy Irons is great as Brom;he imbues his role with a sense of humor&nobility.He has to do all the acting--because nobody else.<br /><br />John Malkovich gets the hilarious opening line of "I suffer without my stone.End my suffering." Galbatorix,both in the book&the movie,isn't a menacing villain.In place of a Lidless Eye,the audience gets a hammy emo Goth.Thankfully,Malkovich is having a rip-roaring time.<br /><br />Ed Speleers plays Eragon as a pretty boy,who makes Luke Skywalker&Frodo (in the Peter Jackson movies)come across as downright macho.He even goes Napoleon Dynamite,saying,"I have skills!"<br /><br />The director,Stefen Fangmeier doesn't mind borrowing openly from the Star Wars trilogy--such as when Eragon watches the sunset.The plot is basically Star Wars.Orphaned farm boy finds out he has magical powers,belongs to a vanquished order destroyed by an evil king,his uncle is slain by an Evil Empire,he rescues a captive princess with the help of a rogue.Yes,you've seen this movie before.<br /><br />The forced,sappy romance between Eragon&Arya brings on a gag,as well as memories of Aragorn&Arwen.It made me long for the sexy,strange romance between Frodo&Galadriel.Besides,I prefer the shirtless Frodo scene in "Return of the King" to the gratuitous shirtless Eragon scene in this movie.<br /><br />The highlights--this movie has great special effects,the scenery is spectacular (Farthen Dur is in actual volcanic crater),and Patrick Doyle provides a great soundtrack,even hearkening back to his better "Henry V" one.<br /><br />"Eragon" is hardly a great epic movie.But it's wonderful dumb fun.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>"Eragon" is surely a film which will please families with young kids, even if there are some graphically intense, quite violent, scenes which warranted the film's PG rating. However, I suspect diehard fans of fantasy film and literature will be quite disappointed. Sadly "Eragon" comes across as a mediocre imitation of "Star Wars", with the hero, Eragon himself, as a pale fourth-rate version of Luke Skywalker (There is a scene in the film which all too readily echoes the classic image of Luke staring out from his uncle's Tatooine farm at sunset, pondering his fate.), combined with a barely credible version of sword and sorcery harkening back to Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings". While other Amazon.com customer reviewers have severely criticized the film director and screenwriters for producing a poor film adaptation of the novel, I can't help but wonder whether the fault lies too with the author, Christopher Paolini, for producing what is at best, a second-rate version of fantasy literature, borrowing too extensively from classics like "The Lord of the Rings" and the "Chronicles of Narnia". There are truly a handful of good reasons to see this film, starting with Jeremy Irons' fine portrayal of Brom, the Obi-Wan Kenobi-like figure, who becomes a mentor to young Eragon. Another fine reason is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Durza, the wicked wizard, who comes across as a more malevolent mixture of Brad Dourif's Wormtongue and Christopher Lee's Saruman from Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" cinematic trilogy (John Malkovich's evil King Galbatorix steals every scene he appears in, but alas, it's only for a few brief moments at best.). Last, but not least, I think Peter Doyle has composed a memorable film score which ranks with his earlier, classic scores for Kenneth Branagh's splendid cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare. Otherwise, unless you are a diehard fan of the fantasy novel "Eragon", I recommend skipping this film and renting instead Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" from your local DVD rental store.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>Warning, may contain spoilers, but if you've seen Star Wars it's okay you'll see them coming anyway.<br /><br />The are no words to describe the anger, the unadulterated fury, the blinding rage, that I felt while I watched this sorry excuse for a film. Literally every shot in here is copied and pasted from one movie or another, whether it be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225814">Dragonheart - Collector's Edition</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a> or their two favorite sources <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCT">Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)</a>. How dare they? The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are two of my favorite films of all time and they have done a great deal to shape me into the person I am today. For anyone who has fallen in love with the works of JRR Tolkien/Peter Jackson and Gorge Lucas you will be angered beyond all comprehension when you see this "film" rip off those great men's work. I'm telling you, EVERY SINGLE SCENE in this movie is copied and pasted from other, much better works.<br /><br />But apart from the obvious rip off factor, the movie manages to fail all on its own as well. The obvious flaws are there for anyone with any amount of sense to see and are too blatant to ignore. It literally takes one day for our hero to change from an everyday farm boy (Luke Skywalker) who doesn't even know how to hunt to superman who's now all of a sudden breaking into the evil castle (the Death Star) and saving the damsel in distress, (Princess Lea) using his magic (the force) and being saved by his wise old mentor (Obi One Kenobi) who then dies heroically. It literally takes him two days to<br />A) Learn how to fly a dragon,<br />B) Learn how to use a sword,<br />C) Learn to use magic,<br />D) Learn how to sneak stealthy into heavily guarded castles, and much, much more. Wow, what is he smoking and where can I get some?<br /><br />Shortly after escaping the previously mentioned castle, he then leads an army of men who look like Easterlings from LOTR against an army of bad guys who look like Orcs in a fort that looks like Helms Deep while wearing Elvin armor. The bad guy leading said orcs also looks like Dracula from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KVUKM">Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition)</a> and they engage in a battle with an odd resemblance to Dragon Heart. Of course, they win and the beautiful girl he saved, the one he has YET to have a full conversation with despite being with her for about half the movie, runs off to plan to defend her home nation against the evil king who will be attacking in the inevitable sequel (a movie I will make it a point not to see whenever it DOES come out).<br /><br />In short, the plot moves too fast, the characters are bland and one dimensional, the acting is sub par at best, the effects looked like they were done on a ten dollar budget, and it blatantly rips off some of the greatest works of fiction ever made. There is absolutely nothing original about this film, everything here is merely copied and pasted from much better works. Eragon so desperately wants to be The Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, and Bravheart, and Dragon Heart, and Van Helsing, and this, and that, but in the end it fails to be anything but a silly kid's movie so shallow that only the blindest movie goers will manage to get anything out of it. So I ask again, who do these people think they are?<br /><br />Re-watch value; EXTREMLY low.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>In the land of Alagaesia, a 17 year old farm boy named Eragon goes out early one morning to hunt. Out of no where appears a shiny blue stone the size of a large watermelon. He takes it home with him and at first tries to sell it to a local vendor. The vendor realizing immediately this is something King Galbatrorix (John Malkovich) will want to kill for will have nothing to do with it. Eragon takes it home and hides it in the barn.<br /><br />What Eragon doesn't know is he has been chosen by an elfin princess who sent to stone magically to him to keep it away from the evil King. Shortly after hiding the stone, which is really one of the last dragon eggs to exist, it hatches before Eragon's eyes. What emerges is a beautiful blue dragon which quickly grows up to become a very large dragon. A dragon that read his thoughts and communicate telepathically with him. Her name is Saphira (Rachel Weisz). She tells Eragon she's waited 1000 years to be born to the right person. Her rider. Him.<br /><br />Eragon learns from the local storyteller named Brom (Jeremy Irons) that the land used to be filled with dragons and their chosen riders. They were the peacekeepers. Even the King use to be a rider. Over time greed inhabited them and a civil war broke out killing what they believed to be all the dragons and most of their riders. Brom who was also a dragon rider carries much guilt about this battle. He takes it upon himself to mentor the boy who has also inherited the magic that comes to every rider.<br /><br />Eragon starts off as an arrogant boy who acts prematurely. Brom tries to instill in him to be wiser with his actions because a rider will live if the dragon dies but if a rider dies so does his dragon. And the evil King knows this also which puts Eragon's life and that of his dragon at stake. At the moment his biggest hurdle is the malicious wizard, Durza (Robert Carlyle), sent by the King to kill Eragon, and finding the Varden Rebels who went into seclusion after the age of dragons.<br /><br />I felt all the actors did an exceptional job. I even enjoyed Jeremy Irons who I've never been especially warm to. The dragon special effects are a highlight to be sure. Saphira is magnificent and blue! The movie is listed as containing violence and mature themes but I didn't find it nearly as violent as Narnia or Lord of the Rings (both of which I loved). In some instances the relationships did feel sped up causing a loss of connections but the real characters are the dragon and her rider. Eragon ends with one battle over only to lead the way for another. I sense a sequel. This movie is based on the book of the same name by Christopher Paolini and is part of a trilogy. I have not read the books but after seeing the movie and checking out the "spanning time" feature on the official website I'm putting them on my wish list. I was very excited about this movie and really enjoyed it. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"Eragon" wants to be "Lord of the Rings." It really, really wants to be. In a pinch, it'll settle for "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe" with a dash of Harry Potter.<br /><br />But those hoping for a spectacular PG-rated epic shouldn't hold their breaths, because the adaptation of Christopher Paolini's bestseller is a massive bellyflop. The direction is stilted and plodding, the acting is on par with tree stumps, and the whole thing is uninspired -- it never moves beyond "quick cash-in."<br /><br />A young woman is being chased through the woods by a band of evil soldiers, trying to recapture a bright blue stone she stole from evil King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), but she magics it away. It's found in the woods by a young farm boy, Eragon (Edward Speleers), who unsuccessfully tries to trade it for food. But the stone turns out to be a dragon's egg.<br /><br />When his home and uncle are destroyed, Eragon escapes with his now-grown dragon Saphira (Rachael Weisz) and a mysterious stranger named Brom (Jeremy Irons), who knows a lot about the Dragon Riders. Now Eragon and Saphira may be the only hope for the land, not to mention the captive elf princess he's dreaming about, and whom he has to rescue from the evil king.<br /><br />Dragons, damsels in distress, magic spells, an evil king and his evil wizard, and a Young Hero in the Luke Skywalker mold... well, "Eragon" had a lot of obstacles in front of it from the start. It sounds like the love child of "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings"... except it's infinitely more clumsy than either of those movies.<br /><br />And the director doesn't help -- Stefan Fangmeier is horribly crude and clumsy in his directing, with a style that manages to be both stilted and choppy. The scripting is even worse. Expect the most pompous, cliched fantasyspeak imaginable ("It is your fate to be a Dragon Rider. The Varden need a Rider if they are to defeat Durza and the king." "I didn't ask for any of this!" "But you were chosen, nevertheless!").<br /><br />It's not surprising, since Fangmeier has never even directed a short film before. His only prior movie work has been for visual effects, which might explain why the CGI for Saphira the dragon is so beautifully detailed and fluid. Wonderful work there. But not enough to make you forget the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Speleers looks like a deer in the headlights, while Sienna Guillory has all the elegance and magic of hobbit feet, and Malkovich is given the most 2-D villain role of the 21st century. The supporting actors give the only solid performances, miscast as they are -- Weisz gives a wonderfully nuanced performance, while Irons is solid as the mentor figure.<br /><br />"Eragon" has the occasional good performance or moment of excellence -- usually from Weisz as Saphira. But the rest of the time, it's an amateurish example of how NOT to make a fantasy movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>ERAGON takes place in world that resembles a middle-aged Earth, but on film looks more like a cheap imitation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS Middle Earth. Eragon (Edward Speleers) is a young farm boy who lives with his uncle and cousin. They live in the country, but the kingdom in which they live is ruled by an evil dictator named Galbatorix (John Malkovich). Galbatorix is the last of the dragon riders. The dragon riders used to be guardians of justice and agents of peace, but Galbatorix took advantage of fractions within the riders to kill them or their dragons off until he was the last of the dragon riders. He then took control of the lands he was supposed to protect and killed any who stood in his way. Much of the resistance was destroyed, but a fragment remained, hidden somewhere in mountains at the edge of the kingdom. In addition to being the last dragon rider, Galbatorix also has an ally in a Shade named Durza. Shades are basically magicians with demonic powers.<br /><br />Anyway, one evening while Eragon is hunting he discovers a large, beautiful blue stone. Thinking he might be able to trade the stone for food he takes it. It isn't until later that he discovers the stone isn't a stone at all, but is a dragon egg that hatches before his eyes. The dragon is named Saphira and has selected Eragon as her rider. Saphira was stolen from King Galbatorix and he's really mad about it. Once it hatches, he wants Saphira's rider killed because if you kill the rider you kill the dragon. Eragon doesn't realize the peril he is in until a town vagrant named Brom comes to his aid and assist him on a journey to the rebellion stronghold in the mountains. The return of the dragon riders was prophesized years ago and Eragon suddenly finds himself as a new hope for the fledging resistance.<br /><br />The plot of the movie sounds interesting enough, but the execution of that plot has been done poorly. Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, and Djimon Hounsou are all excellent actors but only Irons has any real screen time while the others are basically reduced to playing cameos. Also, although Irons has a lot of screen time, his character doesn't have anything new or interesting to say. The actors do their best, but with the writing given to them they come off being as water-downed version of characters from THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, HARRY POTTER, or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.<br /><br />Therein lays two of the major problems of the movie. The writing is pretty lame and the most significant moments of the film seem to be cheap imitations of some of the most memorable fantasy and sci-fi films made. Remember in LORD OF THE RINGS when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are escaping the Ring Wraiths by leaving the Shire and crossing the river Brandywine? That scene is in this movie. Remember in the original STAR WARS when Obi-Wan Kenobi lets himself be struck down so he can become a part of the force and better help Luke? That scene is in this movie, too.<br /><br />Another problem with the film is the pacing. The entire movie runs about ninety minutes. I couldn't believe the film was over when it ended. Many things had been rushed through or totally skipped from the novel. The movie could have easily been expanded to two or two and a half hours and would probably have been a better picture. A fantasy film of this magnitude needs time to simmer and fermentate. It shouldn't be rushed. I mean, the average children's animated movie runs around ninety minutes now, an epic fantasy adventure should at least be two hours long.<br /><br />The one thing that I was rather impressed by in the film was the dragon. Saphira looked very real on screen and is a beautiful creature to behold, fantastical or not.<br /><br />Overall, ERAGON is an average fantasy film that moves at a very rushed pace and never reaches the promise of the great movie it could have been. I don't blame the director, but I do blame the studio because I know they pressured the filmmakers to finish the movie as fast as they could. An epic fantasy film shouldn't be filmed in just a month. Fans of the book might enjoy the movie, but they will probably be disappointed. Instead, this movie version is more for very young children and those looking for a short, non-original fantasy movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I liked it more than I expected to. People keep comparing it to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, and I didn't find it quite as good as either of those, but I had read the book, and decided I should see what they did with the movie, since I could get it at a bargain price.<br /><br />The special effects, especially Saphira the dragon, are very good. I liked her best when she was a baby, though. In fact, she reminded me of both the Mogwai and of the baby dragon Rubeus Hagrid hatched out. There's something about baby animals, no matter how fantastical they are. Ed Speleers did a good job as Eragon, but I thought he and his cousin looked a little too much alike: hard to tell them apart when they were fighting.<br /><br />The villains were a little too unbelievably villainous, but I suppose that's the way they are in a fantasy; the heroes extremely heroic, the villains extremely villainous. It just seemed a little too much like a story made for children, or at least adolescents, and I suspect that's the simple truth. Besides, I'm not much on battle scenes.<br /><br />I want to give it four stars, because there was much to like about it, but I have to say that in comparison with others I've given four stars to, this one only merits three. It's good, but it's not great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Eragon (Widescreen Edition) is a movie based on the book by the same title by Christopher Paolini. Not having read the books I did not come in with any expectations how it should be. However, even so I do have the feeling that the movie feels short. The storyline could have been much more developed and some of the scenes just seem rushed. For instance the growth of the dragon happens in an instance. The special effects are alright but nothing special. While I am not a disappointed as many as the other reviewers I can still say that I can only give this movie a 3 out of 5. Maybe a directors cut will come and settle things right. 3/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LAA9SCENXLKN.html">A2LAA9SCENXLKN</a><br/><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />So yes, this is pure popcorn entertainment. Now, let me get this the bad stuff off as quickly as possible. The idea of being able to hear your thoughts is a constantly used idea that makes no logical sense at all. Not because it's physically impossible, but because it's mentally impossible. Some thoughts aren't in the English language. What if your working on a math test? Keep in mind the brain uses thinking not just to talk undisturbed, but too also make sense of situations, solve problems, and understand both points of view of life. Meaning, that you will think what you think you don't want too think even though you don't really believe that. So the idea of having one read your mind, would make the greatest confusion of all time, AND SHOULD BE PARODIED BY MEL BROOKS IF HE IS STILL WORKING! But anyways, that's the one big problem I had with this movie.<br /><br />I'd say this is a good combination of Harry Potter, Godzilla and The Lightning Thief. Nothing is too deep, everything is completely fantasy and nothing at all hast to make sense. See the thing I love about this kind of movie, is that they're able to explain something that's completely illogical and make it sound completely logical. The actors, director and writer are able to immerse themselves in the impossible and understand just for the movie that it is possible. And that my friends! Is true genius. I cannot truly explain it. It is just an extremely fun time for nerds and geeks alike. Unless of course, your angry at what they cut from the book.<br /><br />Now, lettuce go back to a movie called Night of the Living Dead. What was it innovative for? Well, many things. It started the rating system, it's known as the great great godfather of modern horror. But, too a naive perspective, it is innovative for it's African-American lead actor. Now, lettuce think of any other dragon besides this one. King Ghidorah? Guy. Smaug? Guy. Pete's Dragon? Guy. Godzilla? Guy. Just about every single dragon you can think of was a guy. Now, now, think about that for a second. That's been ingrained into your brain through the society's stereotypes. Here, they blow the roof off society and bring in a female dragon into cinema. Now that my friends, is truly innovative.<br /><br />The CGI, I thought was impressive. I'm not gonna compare it too anything (and no coughs either,) because my brain might be fogged. But, I thought the CGI was very detailed and lifelike. Like, as if it was real material. I thought that was pretty impressive for a movie of this nature. Heck, being of this nature is impressive enough. So, in other words, I think this movie is extremely underrated. At least, from a non-book-reader's perspective. Well then...shall we give this movie a rating?<br /><br />The Rating? Well...I think it deserves a good 4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Although "Eragon" is palpably derivative of a number of fantasy franchises ("Star Wars," "Lord Of The Rings," "Wizard Of Earthsea," et. al.) it is still quite enjoyable, if a bit on the lightweight side.  I have not read the original book, but coming into this blind, the film was about what I'd expected. Obviously it's been streamlined and no doubt dumbed-down a bit, but the special effects are good (the dragon, mostly, looks cool) and the story clops along at a decent pace.  Nothing here will surprise you, but it's hardly the dismal filmic disaster other reviews have implied...

I don't care for Malkovich usually, but even in this film, his acting wasn't what it could have been. Jeremy Irons' character on the other hand was quite despicable! and his acting was right on for the part.<br /><br />The storyline was also pretty basic, and because the opening credits mentioned this was an adaptation of a book, I realized many situations might be missing from the screen.<br /><br />Also, I didn't find the dragon Saphira, feminine enough.

On course if you are young and impressionable and have not seen this standard story before it may not be noticed. I used to watch "The Cisco Kid" and was impressed as a child.<br /><br />Naturally, there is nothing one can say to the reader of books except that many times, as with this example, the transition to the big screen will lose a lot of the story. However, the screenwriter did not have to tell his own story, even if it is needed to keep up the momentum. The movie does look like a pilot so maybe more will come in a sequel or a TV show.<br /><br />See the story much better done as "Star Wars" (1977) the farmer's nephew must become a hero after his uncle was burnt to a crisp. Only the mentor is Obi-wan and Saphira, our dragon is two robots and a Chewbacca.<br /><br />This film can be fun but there is nothing exceptional.

First of all, fantasy/adventure is a genre that isn't explored enough these days. You can count the number of fantasy films made over the years on your fingers and toes. Of course, you have the Lord of the Rings, Dragonheart, Dragonslayer, Conan etc. Secondly, how many times do you get to see a huge fire breathing dragon that looks really cool and REAL? Excellent effects.<br /><br />So, why only two stars?<br /><br />ERAGON is based on a book written by Christopher Paolini, who is most noteably known for beginning writting ERAGON when he was fifteen years-old. Good for him. I wish I were so lucky with the novel I wrote in high school.<br /><br />I haven't read the novel, but after watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that many of it seemed borrowed from other films. Many young writers write stories that steal from films they have seen. I know because I did. I know because many fellow writers I know struggled with the same thing. It's just nature. You watch movies and something grabs you. So, you cook up your own version in your head and put it to paper.<br /><br />So, with ERAGON, you get a story of a boy who falls into his destiny as a dragon rider. Yet, many of the themes of the film are borrowed from other films, like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Dragonheart, Harry Potter etc.<br /><br />ERAGON is a decent film. Yet, a forgettable one. I'm just disappointed that hollywood has once again put its weight behind a novelty movie. There have been many fantasy stories written in recent years, and many of them would have been more memorable and more lasting films. Yet, they weren't written by a teenager.<br /><br />Oh, and of course there's a sequel coming. I wonder if people will still be interested when the sequel comes out?</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>I have not read the books associated with this film so I'm in a good position to evaluate the film on its own merit. Clearly people are all over the place with this film (from one star to five stars and everything in between) and I can detect without difficulty that many folks feel strongly about the movie either one way or another.<br /><br />THE STORY: This film manifests your basic "good versus evil" theme. A malevolent despot king rules the land but he has one fear -- that a "dragonrider" (and a dragon) will reappear to ultimately dethrone and destroy him. This nasty king has a powerful wizard of sorts, ready at his beck and call to deliver on his evil plans. The wizard rules over a really nasty pack of dreadful pseudo-humans who possess magical powers and skills.<br /><br />But the dragonrider, Eragon, and his female dragon, Saphira, also utilize magic to do battle with the bad guys. Various mentors and allies come along to guide and aid Eragon and, of course, there is a culmination of the two factions in a Battle Royal. The film's conclusion clearly leaves the way open for the sequel film.<br /><br />Let me say up front that this is a fine fantasy film, lots of action, a good story, superb cinematography, and great acting. What I detected was a number of "film techniques" (for lack of a better phrase) which mirrored the action in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>.<br /><br />I realize that they are the same sort of story and that "Eragon" may, in fact, soon turn into a series of films like LOTRs; however, at every turn I kept finding myself reliving scenes from LOTRs so I was just a tiny bit distracted by this.<br /><br />The huge bulk of complaints that I see on this film (especially at IMDB) is that the books are purportedly so much better than the film. Well, when was this not true in the case of nearly any film which had its genesis in a book? So I therefore discount much of this facet of criticism, even though it may be true. I felt the same way about LOTRs but this diminution of excellence from book to film was a personal expectation -- as a consequence, I was not disappointed when I viewed the film trilogy.<br /><br />So here are my recommendations: if you have read the books and feel strongly that the film will be a weak second, then don't watch it. But if you've never read the books and you want to see a fine film (even if it borrows a bit in technique from LOTRs), then I think that you'll enjoy this one.<br /><br />The Special Edition version contains a second disc -- here's what you'll find on it:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with Director Stefen Fangmeier.<br />-- extended and deleted scenes with optional director's commentary.<br />-- "Inside the Inheritance Trilogy": "The Magic of Eragon" documentary.<br />-- "Eldest" -- the first two chapters of the second book in the "Inheritance Trilogy".<br />-- "The Inhabitants of Alaga?sia" character featurettes.<br />-- Arya's Ambush original animatic sequence with optional director's commentary.<br />-- Vision of Eragon conceptual art gallery.<br />-- pronunciation guide.<br />-- original and unused storyboard galleries.<br />-- Christopher Paolini interview.<br />-- "The Secrets of Alaga?sia" visual effects featurette.<br />-- Saphira's animation guide CGI featurette with director's commentary.<br />-- original teaser and trailer<br /><br />This 2006 film is in widescreen and runs a total of 103 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>NOTE: This review contains major spoilers<br /><br />Seeing as how the original novel by Christopher Paolini is the worst novel I have ever read (for now), I became curious as how the movie adaptation fared out. Critics panned the movie for obviously being a LOTR/Star Wars ripoff, and audiences disliked it for being unfaithful to the source material. Despite all the criticisms, however, I saw the movie, anyway. Now, I've seen some really bad films in my life, such as Battlefield Earth, The Hot Chick, Chicken Little, and so forth. "Eragon" is.....well, I wouldn't necessarily say that it's worse than the movies I've just mentioned, but I'll explain.<br /><br />First, I will say the film does have some nice scenery and a couple of decent special effects shots (the flight sequence, for example). But it all ends there as the rest of the movie fails to achieve greatness in many ways. The story, much like the book, is heavily borrowed from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and even The Wheel of Time (The Spine, anyone?). While the movie is notably different from the book, you can still spot the clich&eacute;s from beginning to end. I mentioned in my written review for the original novel that the author basically recycles one of the oldest fantasy formulas ever known (average villager leaves home, goes on a quest, delves into his family history, becomes a great warrior, etc.) and adds nothing that's new to the genre. Well, the evidence in the movie is still strong if you observe closely. The mentor trains our main hero to become a great swordsman, that's a clich&eacute;. The mean heroine is pretty much a damsel in distress, that's another clich&eacute;. Our main hero is revealed to be the Chosen One, that's the most obvious clich&eacute;. You know, I find it interesting that in many fantasy stories, there's just one person who is destined to restore peace and destroy evil forever. Why not a trio of heroes, or a quintet? Well, anyway, the plot is pretty much riddled with clich&eacute;s, and adds nothing new to the fantasy genre. The movie itself is basically one of the most simplistic fantasy films ever created. And you might argue that this is just a family film. Well, families aren't stupid.<br /><br />And if you think the story is bad, you haven't examined the character of Eragon (Ed Speleers). One of the biggest problems I had with the book was the main character: his personality was disorganized, and his chemistry with the other characters were very awkward (Arya, for example). Nothing is changed. The Eragon that we see in the film is the same handsome boy who embraces the same exaggerated nobility and becomes the same savior of the human race. The arrogance in the character is also shown in the middle of the film when he confronts Brom (Jeremy Irons); he acts like a grownup before and after he realizes that Brom used to be a dragon rider himself. In fact, the entire race of the Varden seems hopeless until Eragon enters the picture. In addition, I've noticed that Eragon's clothes are remarkably clean for a villager. When he's living in Carvahall, his clothes look like they come from a prince compared to everyone else. Did he just buy his own washing machine or something? So basically, there are many things wrong about this character. I mean, here's a kid who enters a fort to save Arya (Sienna Guillory), and no one is aware that he is about to rescue one of their own prisoners. The guards must be idiots. And what's worse, he doesn't even get hurt when he escapes. Not a scratch. The guards must REALLY be idiots. And Durza (Robert Carlyle), one of the main antagonists in the story, can't even break this kid's finger. HE must be an idiot. And Brom is the only one who is fatally injured. He's.....pretty lucky to be killed off in a movie like this. To be quite honest, Eragon is one of the oddest characters I have ever seen in a movie. This so-called average villager finds a blue-colored egg in the woods and he is not the least bit shocked that it hatches and out pops a baby dragon. He just smiles. Like an idiot. He's an idiot. Then, he has high hopes for becoming a dragon rider, and yet he doesn't think of the dangers that he would face. Can't he just pose for GQ or something? And THEN, he wants to rescue Arya, and he thinks that he can take on dozens of people with only a sword and a limited use of magic. The guards are still idiots, but not as idiotic as Eragon.<br /><br />And do they really expect us to believe that Eragon can learn to become a dragon rider in such a short time? And learn a different language in such a short time? And fall in love with an unknown elf who looks old enough to be his mother?<br /><br />Incredible.<br /><br />But we're not going to stop there. There are other things about this movie that can make you lose your appetite.  The dialogue is cheesy and poorly written. The music is horribly overblown. John Malkovitch as Galbatorix is an embarrassment, complete with a terrible attempt at a foreign accent. Ed Speleers as Eragon is a terrible bore, and he isn't trying hard enough to actually act (granted, this IS his first starring role in a movie, so I guess that's the reason why). Rachael Weisz's voice is inappropriate for Saphira as her lightweight tone doesn't mix with the character's strong-minded personality. The sexual innuendo is pretty obvious (this is rated PG, right?). The special effects are bland; nothing special comes out of it. The action scenes are dull. What have I left out? Oh yes, a few scenes are unintentionally goofy, so don't eat or drink anything while you're watching this movie.<br /><br />Reading the novel was a dismal experience. Watching the movie was a dismal experience. Knowing that Hollywood actually had the guts to adapt the novel into a movie was a DISMALLY dismal experience. "Eragon" is basically a silly, simplistic, clich&eacute;d, badly written, badly directed, badly acted, and badly pretentious fantasy film that doesn't deserve the $250 million that it earned at the box office. It's one of those movies that just don't work. Babies, kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, and humans in general deserve better than this.<br /><br />Grade: F</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>-- just not very deep. So let's start with the parts that work. The computer graphics are beautiful, as we've come to expect. The adventure story is classic: the evil tyrant, the secret cabal of rebels just waiting to strike for freedom, the young hero-to-be, unknown even to himself. Dragons are cool, especially when they're done as well as they are here. The castworks pretty well, too, with Jeremy Irons as the mysterious mentor and Sienna Guillory as the magical princess in need of rescue. Her slight resemblance to Tilda Swinton is a minor but enjoyable benefit to the role.<br /><br />The story, written by a 15 year old prodigy, has plenty of excitement - but that's about it. Characters tend toward the one-dimensional, and a few strands in the story seem not so tightly wound with the others. Set your expectations accordingly. The "Eragon" movie is big and beautiful, it's exciting and kid-safe, and that's enough.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>Watching this well-done SFX feast, it's easy to guess at the major influences of Christopher Paolini: Anne McCaffrey's Pern series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618640150">The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>.  In fact, "Eragon" might almost be described as "A New Hope" without spaceships--but that doesn't make it any the less enjoyable.  Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a 17-year-old farmboy who's been raised by his mother's brother (Alun Armstrong) following her precipitous and mysterious disappearance from his life.  His country groans under the tyrannical rule of Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the last of a corps of dragon riders who for thousands of years were the guardians of the land and its people until they fell to quarrelling among themselves and gave him a chance to destroy them from within.  Eragon knows he'll soon be of age to be impressed into the king's army--his cousin has already headed off into the wilderness rather than meet that fate--but before he can decide what to do about it, he finds a beautiful blue object from which hatches a small dragon.  The creature grows rapidly and soon is communicating mentally with him, explaining that he is her destined Rider.  But the King and his sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) know the egg has hatched, and send assassins after its Rider.  Only with the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an antisocial villager with secrets of his own, do Eragon and his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) escape.  Then there's the matter of a beautiful young woman (Sienna Guillory) being held prisoner by Durza and the King, a band of fugitive rebels hiding in the mountains, and the young archer (Garrett Hedlund) who saves Eragon's life.<br /><br />It becomes clear fairly early on that Eragon isn't a Rider because he has a dragon: he has a dragon because he's a Rider.  The ability to work magic is in him--he just needs it trained--and Saphira has somehow sensed this (a dragon will wait forever to hatch if it has to, rather than emerge without its Rider to bond to).  There's plenty of fast action, scary villains, great costumes and armor (especially Saphira's wonderfully articulated suit), and of course splendid special effects (created, of course, by George Lucas's ILM), plus a powerful soundtrack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NI3G2S">Soundtrack</a> by Patrick Doyle.  Nothing's been heard so far of further film adaptations of Paolini's trilogy; I hope they're in the works!</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>Chris Paolini, with author of the book that the film "Eragon" is based on, was only 15-years old when he began writing his fantasy fable.  While the age at which he wrote it is remarkable, the end product is predictable from someone that age.  It is a very shallow and derivative story that translates to an unsatisfying movie experience.<br /><br />"Eragon" tells the tale of a young boy, the titular Eragon (Ed Speleers), who comes into the possession of a magical dragon egg that hatches to become Saphira, the blue dragon.  With the help of Saphira and a former dragon-rider named Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon seeks to avenge his father's death and defeat the evil forces of Galbatorix (John Malkovich).<br /><br />The tale is as old as literary time and it has found itself manifested in such phenomenal tales as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.  So, while the tale is nothing original, a new angle on its telling can still make it memorable.<br /><br />Alas, "Eragon" fails in that regard.  This story is merely generic retelling with very unremarkable characters and adventures.  It is unfortunate that this film should be this way, but is it simply a product of an unpolished scribe (Paolini) whose work I'm not certain most directors could make into something compelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>You'll want to read the novel to get the full value of this story. Might as well say that right off. However, the film is entertaining on its own, though they had to revise things to fit within the time limits on the screenplay. My 16 year old son was a little disappointed that there were parts of the book left out, or even changed, but it was still a good adaptation. When a young boy named Eragon stumbles upon an egg containing a magical dragon, the lad is saddled with a responsibility that dates back years. Can he fulfill a legendary destiny, or will Eragon's stubborn nature get in his way?<br /><br />Chrissy K.

Sure, it was a self-published hit written by a home-schooled teenager, but other than that the novel sounded like a mish-mash of different fantasy sterotypes I'd read dozens of times before.  Then, someone gave it to for a birthday present and since I would never insult that person by not reading the novel I sat down one weekend and poured through the story.  Was my opinion changed?  No.  As I thought, it was a mish-mash of fantasy sterotypes and a story obviously written by a child, with a child's viewpoint on the world.  I'll grant Christopher Paolini this:  he did create interesting characters in the likes of Eragon and Saphira, but that did not save the derivative story.  Regardless of the praise Paolini has been given, he is not the reincarnation of J. R. R. Tolkien; he is not Terry Brooks reimagined; he is not the heir to Robert Jordan.<br /><br />When I sat down to watch the movie version of the novel, I came away understanding why the film was not the success the studio had hoped it would be.  The screenwriter took a mish-mash of a novel and turned it into an even bigger mish-mash of a movie.  While the film keeps the basic premise and characters of the novel, it deviates in many ways.  So much so that it barely resembles the novel upon which it is based.  Add to that some wooden acting from usually-good actors like Jeremy Irons and Djimon Honsou along with sub-par special effects and you get a movie even fans would not enjoy.  I will grant that unknown-until-now Edward Speleers was an engaging young actor with some talent and a perfect choice for the role of Eragon. He really is the saving grace of this poorly adapted film and if he can survive the failure of Eragon he just might have an acting future.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A boy named Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest. At first, he thinks it's a lucky discovery, something that will bring meat to his poor family for the winter.

This movie is perfect for a family with children of various ages.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>A respectable cast, visually striking, ambitious film that fails to deliver on what could have been something of a masterpiece.<br /><br />Without having known in advance that the author was so young, I did find the book heavily influenced by both the written and screen work of LOTR as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHOM">Dragonslayer</a> and written in a rather amateurish fashion.  Don't get me wrong; I highly commend this young author for being able to even get a book publish in this very competitive market and he does have talent, but it's rather raw and overly visual (he may make a better screenwriter).  This is why I think Hollywood failed to do justice to his work.<br /><br />This was a picturesque novel with some very traditional themes that should have translated well to the big screen.  Some striking visuals are present in the film, but not what I had hoped for or expected following the LOTR saga.  The actors are all fine, especially newcomer Edward Speleers, and  Rachel Weisz whose voice is captivating and sexy as Saphira.  Jeremy Irons is always a pleasure to have on hand, but he does look a bit bored with his role that is all too familiar.  I expect him to yell out at any moment "May the force be with you."  John Malkovich has played so many Hollywood baddies these days that at this point he seems to be mocking those roles now.  I almost expect him to wink at the camera after delivering an evil cliche-ridden line.<br /><br />The pacing is probably the biggest flaw in this film.  My kids, 11 and 15, were rather bored with it.  They would be momentarily enthralled with the action sequences and visual effects, but then walk off to get a drink or something until the music keyed in another action scene.  The story failed to hold them as they have seen better work in this genre and therein lies the films other fatal flaw.<br /><br />The original work that this film is based upon is somewhat weak in of itself.  It lacks depth and maturity, but certainly hints at better things to come from this author.  It's hard to take a so-so work and make a successful film from it, although it can be done.  In addition, it is even harder to so with a work that is obviously very influenced by far greater works.  Still, I think Hollywood blew this one.<br /><br />Hollywood is capable of improving upon the written word at times and especially with more visual novels.  Some average visual books (IMO) that became great films are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792839064">The Great Train Robbery</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UK30">Moby Dick</a>, and the Harry Potter films which I think are actually better than the unnecessarily bloated novels upon which they are based (now don't start throwing rocks at me).  And, yes, you read right about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486432157">Moby-Dick</a>.  It is considered a classic and for good reason, but that doesn't mean it isn't filled with way too much blubber.<br /><br />In any event, my point is that Hollywood missed an opportunity to rework the weak aspects of a generally good tale and squandered the talents of those within this film.  The film is just okay.  It soars every once in awhile, but feels ponderous and bloated with self-importance at other times.  It's watchable, but not all that enjoyable or memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>In order to trim the film to two and a half hours, much is left out. My guess is that they trimmed what would have added an hour to the running time because what they trimmed was so much worse than what they kept.<br /><br />It's no surprise that Eragon feels like "The Lord of the Rings Lite", or "Star Wars Impaired", because that's what the book was. The screenwriters made no attempts, and neither did the director, to put a stamp of originality on this. That may be because they couldn't without drastically changing the events of the story. Like leaving Eragon's uncle out of the story, or Brom, or...well, perhaps even Eragon himself. (By the way, did anyone else expect to see a light saber every time Eragon flashed his sword around? I did.)<br /><br />There's a certain amount of guilt that I feel for being so critical of a story written by such a young writer. But when he is asked, "What race from your books would you choose to be?", and he answers, "A dwarf, because their language and culture is so fascinating", it soothes that guilt. He honestly believes that the dwarves have a complete language and culture. Perhaps in his mind they do, and perhaps in the minds of so many teenagers who have never read *good* fantasy they do, but for anyone who has read *good* fantasy (LOTR, for example) this rings hollow. No writer (artist) who steals so openly from others and who had half a brain or a teaspoon of common sense would say things like that. And yes, there have been many other comments made by him, similarly narcissistic.<br /><br />The acting wasn't half bad, but the dialogue (something that Paolini says is essential to make realistic) is horrid. It's also pulled nearly word by word from the text. I think that people seeing this film will have a better grasp of the weaknesses of the book, as visuals are often more striking than the written word.<br /><br />How did so many good actors get caught up into this?? My only guess is that they never read the book, never read the criticism, and thought they were going to "Ian McKellan-ize" themselves. Well...that didn't work.<br /><br />I almost gave this movie two stars because of the special effects, but the special effects nearly mirrored those of The Lord of the Rings movies. The one aspect where they could have been original (this also includes the physical appearance of the various races), and they chose not to. I cannot imagine why. The director had to know that he was dealing with a thief (even if Paolini won't acknowledge this), and he could have done so much to make this original. Again, I can't imagine why he didn't. Even with the thievery of the book's plot and characters, an original film could have been made. Sadly, it was not.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Eragon finds a stone while hunting for deer in the forest. Its an egg, in fact, a dragon egg, and it decides to hatch and mark Eragon as its rider. There aren't many dragons left in Eragon's world, and the ruler (who rules because of his own dragon) wants any other riders out of the way...<br /><br />I thought it was pretty decent at the time, but the more I think about it, the less I know why. There's mention of elves and such, but the only fantasy characters seen are the dragon and a couple of soldier-types. I've got a couple of plot questions as well.<br /><br />It's okay, not terribly inspiring though.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>I have never been a fan of fantasy films or books.  The only reason I picked this up was because I have a thing for Garret Hedlund (the guy who plays Mertock).  He did a good job despite all the annoying preachy dialogue, and being a tool of the special effects department.  Otherwise the movie just drags on forever in your typical good and evil magical conflict.  He's wonderful eye candy no matter where he is to me, but that was this one saving grace in my eyes.  Otherwise it could have been much more than it was, moving quicker and trimming the fat.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Eragon stands as a cross between a complete rip off and total homage to stories that the author grew up on.  It's part Dungeons and Dragons, part Lord of the Rings and part Star Wars...yes, I said Star Wars.  You have a young apprentice (Luke Skywalker), his mentor (Ben Kenobi), both of whom have magical abilities (the Force) as the Mentor teaches the student to use them, and use them wisely (don't go to the dark side).  We even have a princess and a Han Solo like character who pops up later.<br /><br />But don't let any of that deter you.  It's a classic setup and there is plenty of originality.  The inheritance of the Dragon and the bonding of rider to beast is a very original concept and played out well in the film.  The F/X are spectacular, the scenery and landscape are unspoiled and the pace and dialogue are efficient and well directed.  Jeremy Irons gives a solid and enjoyable performance as the mentor.  John Malcovich, who is only in a few scenes, is good but he doesn't have a lot to do.  Robert Carlyle plays his part creepy and viscious as an evil sorcerer.<br /><br />Overall the movie is very enjoyable and even though it is not terribly original you don't find yourself getting too upset about it.  It plays out more like a tribute to past movies and does so with great respect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>There's two ways to look at a movie based on a book. One is to hope it really does justice to the fine writing in the book, and brings that vision to life. The other is to completely ignore the book and hope that the movie simply is a great movie, loosely based on a book text.<br /><br />To review Eragon fairly, my boyfriend and I took two different points of view. I read the book first, so I would judge the movie against the book. He did NOT read the book first, so he could watch the movie without any bias.<br /><br />We both thought the movie did a VERY poor job.<br /><br />Let's look at why. Interestingly, the things he laughed at, I laughed at as well. Probably the most key issue was the development of Saphira, the dragon. In the book, Ergaon builds a meaningful relationship with her over time. He learns about her, she learns about him, they grow to care for each other. There are subtle interplays with Saphira's jealousy and love for him. Out of all of the book's substance, this is probably the best done, and the key for the story.<br /><br />To me, the "five second explosion" where Saphira morphs from a gremlin-like baby dragon into a full grown dragon was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. It killed much of the meaning of the story. Interestingly, Bob (my boyfriend) found this morph equally ridiculous. Even without having read the book, he could clearly see that this was wrong.<br /><br />So many of the movie's scenes and dialogue are stolen from other movies that it was hard to count them all. The one in particular that had us both rolling on the ground with laughter was when Luke Skywalker (oh sorry, I mean Eragon) was wistfully looking off into the sunset as the music swelled. We kept looking for that second sun of Tattoine. Could you have been more obvious there?<br /><br />There were sections of dialogue where I literally could recite the words along with the characters, even though they weren't in the book. The things they said were THAT predictable.<br /><br />With really well written books, like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, the set designers would keep copies of the book on set, referring to them page by page to ensure they had the details exactly right. JK Rowlings was called in frequently when the first Harry Potter book was made into a movie, to ensure that the costumes and environments were perfect.<br /><br />In comparison, you have to wonder if the movie makers here even read the book. The things they "got wrong" are staggering. Yes, you could say that the book was very flawed to begin with and that they were trying to "fix" it. But if that were the case, they would have improved on the book. Instead, even the important parts of the book are lost completely - and the thievery involved in the movie is almost even more blatant than what the book held.<br /><br />I'm not saying that the book was without flaws. For example, one serious issue for me was that the only real female character - the elf, Arya - was comatose for 99% of the book. In the movie, Arya is much more talkative. You could say they "changed the book here" - but to me it was like enhancing Arwen and Eowyn's part in the Lord of the Rings movies. The book had a flaw, and they fixed it. To me that's a healthy change. Of course, they somehow turned Arya from an elf into a human, but that was minor compared to other issues.<br /><br />In general, the damage the movie plot wrought was far more severe. They destroyed Eragon's relationship with Saphira. They destroyed much of the meaning of Brom's mentorship, and of Murtagh's friendship. The variety of villager issues between Eragon and various people was simplified to "everyone is scared of the Evil Empire".<br /><br />In the end, my boyfriend, who watched the movie "without prejudice" (i.e. no book knowledge) felt VERY disappointed by what it offered as a story. I, who HAD read the book first, felt equally disappointed with how it interpreted the book. Most movies at least either please the book readers or please movie viewers. For a movie to fail on BOTH counts is quite an infamous achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>If you like action fantasies, Eragon (the movie) has action, and it is a fantasy.<br /><br />This review goes down from there.<br /><br />Eragon (the movie) deviates in many significant ways from Eragon (the book).  From the story line, to the character interactions, to the personalities of the characters, if you have any positive thoughts about the book (and I did), you will wince, wince, wince.  And the movie mistakes!  Here a horse, there TWO horses; here no bow and arrows... now where did THEY come from!  The dragon and her rider are the fastest routes to the castle... so how exactly did Brom, on a horse, get there in the nick of time?<br /><br />Brrrr.<br /><br />With the criticism of the book of the borrowed story line and characters of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, et cetera, I was its defender.  Eragon (the book) was still entertaining and a yarn worthy of being told.  But Eragon (the movie) tried its hardest to MAKE the viewer realize the similarities between those other stories and this one (except for a couple of things... have you ever envisioned a dwarf or an elf that looked LESS like a "dwarf" or an "elf"?  And what about an evil dragonrider/king that sat around speaking softly and tried, very unsuccessfully, to appear totally ruthless?).<br /><br />My son says "it was terrible because it did not follow the book in the most important ways, and it was very, very cheesy."  And that's from a kid who's read the book at least 6 times!<br /><br />'Nuff said.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>OK, as many reviewers on the net have already pointed out, the plot of `Eragon' resembles some of the more famous epic stories in such films as `Star Wars' (I'm talking about Episode IV). But I suspect that is not really the real problem of `Eragon.' You should remember that George Lucas actually borrowed from Kurosawa's masterpiece `Hidden Fortress' when he wrote the story of the Princess, the Warriors, and two comic relief. The difference is that Lucas created the characters that almost instantly became cultural icons every one can relate to - Who can forget the `conversations' of R2-D2 and C-3PO?<br /><br />`Eragon' has promising start when we are introduced to the dragon named Saphira. Rachel Weisz effectively provides the voice of this newly-born dragon, who quickly grows to be much wiser than its `rider' Eragon (Edward Speleers), young farm boy who happened to discover the dragon's egg. The egg was in fact stolen from King Galbatorix (scenery-chewing John Malkovich) who orders Durza (Robert Carlyle) to take it back no matter what it takes.<br /><br />Well, I think this is a pretty good story. I don't see originality here. but not that bad. However, director Stefen Fangmeier (formerly visual effects supervisor for `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' and others) misses every opportunity to let us know the film's characters on the screen. If the film's story says the egg was stolen from the evil king, presenting a bit more actions (and information) about Arya (Sienna Guillory) would not hurt. It would give us more vivid pictures of the fantasy world by showing more of this beautiful fighter, but the film just forgets it. Or how about Eragon's mentor named Brom (Jeremy Irons) who says he knows much about dragons and dragon riders? I do not doubt his mumbling words, but he could have used and showed better tricks than just words and sword-fighting with wood sticks to prove his knowledge.<br /><br />The only thing we are sure of is that the young hero is a good boy but still immature, even arrogant sometimes. That's OK as long as his motives are reasonable and consistent. Apparently the director didn't think that way. While watching, we are often at a loss as to the mission or the purpose of his journey, having few clues as to what he realy wants to (or has to) do. Magic spells are cast all too sudden, rather haphazardly. Geography of the world is not clear, and worst of all it seems as if Eragon himself is causing some of the troubles (and their serious consequences). But we are required to take side of him while he doesn't know what he is doing.<br /><br />CGI of the film is nothing great, if not bad. The images of the flying dragon(s) are good, but its facial expressions need improvement. The lack of more convincing dragon's face may be forgiven in other films, but not in this where the relation between the dragon and the dragon rider plays a significant role in the plot.<br /><br />I expected more from `Eragon' because I like films about fantasy world. Yes, while watching Jeremy Irons in ragged coat, I was reminded of Obi-Wan and Jedi Master, but that didn't bother me a lot. Rather, it was the lack of the force and originality that really disappointed me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Wow, this was bad.<br /><br />I mean, staggeringly bad. I don't know whats worse - the blatant rip-offs of "The Lord of the Rings" and "Star Wars" or the very weak casting. And lets not even start on the dialogue.<br /><br />I think the main problem here is the casting. The young boy they selected to play the lead is not at all convincing or a very good actor in any sense of the word. Then there is the strange problem of character and place names. I swear, its as if the writer was so unimaginative that he actually fused together various names from LOTR and Star Wars to create new names for everything here. Pathetic.<br /><br />The dialogue is beyond bad. The language used in the book was pretty pedestrian (at least there was an excuse due to the young age of the author) but for a script to sound so sad is inexcusable. Here are a few gems (read and weep!):<br /><br />"What wisdom can I give people that they haven't already learned? What feats can I achieve that an army couldn't do better? It's insanity!" - by Eragon<br /><br />"My mind is the only sanctuary that has not been stolen from me. Men have tried to breach it before, but I've learned to defend it vigorously, for I am only safe with my innermost thoughts."<br /><br />"Oaths betrayed, souls killed, eggs shattered! Blood everywhere. Murderers!"<br /><br />"You are an enigma, Eragon, a quandary that no one knows how to solve."<br /><br />Add to that the numbing performances of all concerned. To be fair, the dragon special effects were very good, but this has been done better in countless other films.<br /><br />At the end of it, this film gives off a very "cheap" look. It looks like something that was produced for the Sci-Fi Channel but then someone had the sick idea to actually release this to mainstream theaters. Bad idea. No wonder this flopped (as it should have), as it has no redeeming features that I can think of.<br /><br />Not Recommended. You deserve better than to spend your money on this nonsense. And if you're thinking of watching this with your kids, you can do MUCH MUCH better elsewhere, with either "Gormenghast" or "Faerie Tale Theater".</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"Eragon" is a film that surprised me. According to what I had heard, it was far from being a good movie, but I was curious, so I decided to give it a try. A friend had given me the book on which this film is based as a Christmas present, and I decided to read it if the movie had at least something that managed to charm me.<br /><br />Regarding the plot, I suppose I should start by saying that the main character is Eragon (Ed Speleers), a young man that discovers a blue stone he wants to trade for something to feed his family. Unable to do so, Eragon decides to keep the stone, and receives a very big surprise when the stone turns to be a dragon's egg, and he makes the acquaintance of a new friend, a young dragon named Saphira. The birth of Saphira is a powerful magical event noticed by many, among them King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the man that rules Alagaesia the land where Eragon lives.<br /><br /> Galbatorix used to be a dragon rider, but he betrayed the other dragon riders and became a tyrant, ruling his empire with strength and without mercy. From his point of view, Eragon and Saphira are a threat, and they must join him or be wiped out.<br /><br />Galbatorix makes the wrong move, though, and turns Eragon into an enemy. The young man decides to join the Varden, those that oppose the king. With the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an old bard that is a lot more than what he seems to be, Eragon will try to find his path, with Saphira by her side.<br /><br />That sounds interesting and you want to know more? Well, watch the movie. It is not perfect, but it is entertaining, the kind of movie that engages the spectator quickly in the adventures of the main characters, and makes them care. Of course, recommended...<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: By the way, after watching this movie I immediately started reading Christopher Paolini's "Eragon", and I loved it. I liked this movie quite a bit (3.5 out of 5 stars), but the book was much better, so if you haven't already read it... What are you waiting for? Go :)</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This is a first episode and we are waiting for the second. Undeniably this is a first step on the road to fantasy and romance, but we don't know what public is really targeted, the less than 12, the 12 to 16 or the over 16. That makes the film prudish about the romantic side of things and the hero is not even allowed one farewell hug, not to speak of a kiss, with  the beutiful princess he has saved. At the same time the frightening moments when fear comes from the fast apparition of an enemy or a monster are quick and well timed hence effective, but too quick and maybe too frightening for the younger audience. The main shotcoming is that it is not centered on one field of interest, it is too multifarious. The dragon is good but another more realistic and down to earth animal might increase her, since it is a she, charm and valorize her appeal. Village life and town life are too skimpy and they deserve more precise and accurate depictions. The mountains are OK since they are necessary for the dragon, but yet it would be good to get more details about the citadels at the top of mountains. One vision from afar and entering it as if it were totally open is too easy. Can do better. In the same direction we do not get a real overview of the battle. It looks too messy to be significant. The monsters are also too skimpy. We would like to see them more and be able to penetrate their nature and monstrosity. What's more a little more sentimental content and affection if not passion would be good. Only men seems to hug and women are really out of reach. I have nothing against two boys embracing before getting separated for life, far from it in fact, but it would look more normal if Eragon could hug his princess, and if more occasion to do so among the various characters could be present. This is a first episode of what has to be at least a trilogy. Good for a first attempt. But you have to do better for the next volume to find an audience and also enter a real legend. And please make the clothing of poor people look poor. Eragon was definitely too well dressed before the arriving in the rebel camp for what and who he was. Did he go to Harrod's, or something ? And definitely overdressed. A little bit of skin does not hurt at all, you know.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Eragon is based on the novel by the same name by author Christopher Paolini. The film is about a young teen farmer who lives in a land controlled by an evil king named Galbatorix (John Malkovich). The story goes that there was a time when men and dragons fought together and Galbatorix betrayed his people and killed all the dragons and most of their riders. Now an unborn dragon named Saphira falls into the hands of young Eragon. The two are destined for each other to take out Galbatorix. So this is not one of my more skilled synopses but this movie is not really hard to sum up.<br /><br />Ok I didn't hear of Eragon until I saw the preview for this film. I never heard of the book or anything. I have no idea why I pay any attention to trailers cause most of the time they seriously make the good films look bad and the bad films look good. Eragon looked like a decent film and I expected a lot of it. This is one weird movie because it had everything it needed to be great. It had the what I'm told a great book to go by so the story was a piece of cake. It had the money so the cinematography was no problem and the CGI looked incredibly realistic. And it also had actors, so where could this movie mess up? Well for one the script to me had no heart, no feeling. You can tell when it's the actors or the writing and I'm sure it was the writing. I mean Jeremy Irons is no amateur at these types of films. Rachel Weisz was a nice fit playing the voice of Saphira and did a great job. She was the only one that had a couple of good scenes where you could feel her and she was a computer-generated dragon.<br /><br />The battles were awful and the sound quality of the battle made it worst. I've heard more sword clashing on an episode of Rachel Ray's cooking show. Some say the film was slow but to me it went too fast and just organized badly altogether. There was no suspense building up to the final battle either. If anything good came out of Eragon it was the cinematography and the base of the story itself was interesting. If there is a sequel which I'm sure there will be because this movie did well at the box office I would be tempted to see it hoping someone reads all the bad reviews and fixes the mistakes. To be honest this story has a lot to work with and the next film can be saved. I'd say save Eragon for your child or young niece or nephew who will just be fascinated by the dragon but leave some room for hope that the second will be better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>I saw "Eragon" in the theatre.  While the concept was interesting, the execution somehow fell short.  If you haven't seen the film and you want to-just rent it.  Don't buy this film unless you have seen it and you want to keep it in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>I don't know who directed this movie and came up with the plot but they must not have read the book. I can't believe the author let so much cutting and rewritting happen! If you read the book don't bother with the movie. It should have been called something else.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>The kingdom of Alagaesia used to be ruled by dragon riders.  These warriors and their dragons brought peace and prosperity to the land for many years.  But one of them, Galbatorix (John Malkovich), wanted all the power for himself.  He betrayed and killed the others and became king of the land.  As is always the case in these tales, he rules with an iron fist and is hated by all.<br /><br />Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a young man in the kingdom.  This seventeen year old is content to farm his uncle's land.  One day, while out hunting, he finds a weird stone.  He takes it home, and it hatches.  He now has a baby dragon on his hands.<br /><br />The dragon grows quickly, and Eragon learns that he is a dragon rider.  He is a fulfillment of prophecy and the last hope of the resistance to defeat Galbatorix.  He learns this from Brom (Jeremy Irons), a man from his village who tries to teach him a little about his new life while taking him to safety with the rebels.  Will they survive the perilous journey?<br /><br />First, what worked.  The acting was great.  The scenery was fantastic, and the special effects were awesome.  The dragon looked so real.  I'm seriously considering reading the books to see just what happens next.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the actors and special effects teams were working with a very weak script.  Part of that is the basic stories fault.  Based on a book by the same name, the story feels like Star Wars with bits of other fantasy novels thrown in.  Of course, most of these "original" stories borrowed heavily from what came before them, so it's not like that in and of itself is a crime.<br /><br />The bigger problem is the length.  I feel like there is story missing from the movie.  Eragon learns magic overnight and we never see him bond with his dragon.  What I thought to be plot threads were introduced then lead nowhere.  I realize they were trying to keep the running time down since the movie is aimed at kids, but I think they could have found some other way to trim the time.<br /><br />Speaking of kids, they may or may not like the movie.  There is death, scary creatures, sorcery, and a rather intense battle at the end.  Parents will have to make this judgment call on their own.<br /><br />Any movie that makes me want to read the book can't be all bad.  However, the script seriously weakens a story we've seen in other forms before.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I have not yet read the novel ERAGON (I should get to it in the next month, though), but several of my friends have and many of them were very excited this summer after learning that a movie based upon the book was going to be released in December 2006.  Due to their enthusiasm and because the next Narnia movie won't be released until 2008, I gladly went with the theatre with them to see ERAGON.  I had also seen previews of the movie and it looked promising.  I ended up leaving the theatre disappointed.  What I had seen was a film that was full of promise and potential and could have been a great movie, but instead was a rushed and riddled, hodge-podge of myth, sci-fi, and fantasy clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />ERAGON takes place in world that resembles a middle-aged Earth, but on film looks more like a cheap imitation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS Middle Earth.  Eragon (Edward Speleers) is a young farm boy who lives with his uncle and cousin.  They live in the country, but the kingdom in which they live is ruled by an evil dictator named Galbatorix (John Malkovich).  Galbatorix is the last of the dragon riders.  The dragon riders used to be guardians of justice and agents of peace, but Galbatorix took advantage of fractions within the riders to kill them or their dragons off until he was the last of the dragon riders.  He then took control of the lands he was supposed to protect and killed any who stood in his way.  Much of the resistance was destroyed, but a fragment remained, hidden somewhere in mountains at the edge of the kingdom.  In addition to being the last dragon rider, Galbatorix also has an ally in a Shade named Durza.  Shades are basically magicians with demonic powers.<br /><br />Anyway, one evening while Eragon is hunting he discovers a large, beautiful blue stone.  Thinking he might be able to trade the stone for food he takes it.  It isn't until later that he discovers the stone isn't a stone at all, but is a dragon egg that hatches before his eyes.  The dragon is named Saphira and has selected Eragon as her rider.  Saphira was stolen from King Galbatorix and he's really mad about it.  Once it hatches, he wants Saphira's rider killed because if you kill the rider you kill the dragon. Eragon doesn't realize the peril he is in until a town vagrant named Brom comes to his aid and assist him on a journey to the rebellion stronghold in the mountains.  The return of the dragon riders was prophesized years ago and Eragon suddenly finds himself as a new hope for the fledging resistance.<br /><br />The plot of the movie sounds interesting enough, but the execution of that plot has been done poorly.  Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, and Djimon Hounsou are all excellent actors but only Irons has any real screen time while the others are basically reduced to playing cameos.  Also, although Irons has a lot of screen time, his character doesn't have anything new or interesting to say.  The actors do their best, but with the writing given to them they come off being as water-downed version of characters from THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, HARRY POTTER, or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA.<br /><br />Therein lays two of the major problems of the movie.  The writing is pretty lame and the most significant moments of the film seem to be cheap imitations of some of the most memorable fantasy and sci-fi films made.  Remember in LORD OF THE RINGS when Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are escaping the Ring Wraiths by leaving the Shire and crossing the river Brandywine?  That scene is in this movie.  Remember in the original STAR WARS when Obi-Wan Kenobi lets himself be struck down so he can become a part of the force and better help Luke?  That scene is in this movie, too.<br /><br />Another problem with the film is the pacing.  The entire movie runs about ninety minutes.  I couldn't believe the film was over when it ended.  I could tell that many things had been rushed through or totally skipped from the novel and I haven't even read the book, yet.  The movie could have easily been expanded to two or two and a half hours and would probably have been a better picture.  A fantasy film of this magnitude needs time to simmer and fermentate.  It shouldn't be rushed.  I mean, the average children's animated movie runs around ninety minutes now, an epic fantasy adventure should at least be two hours long.<br /><br />The one thing that I was rather impressed by in the film was the dragon.  Since I haven't read the book, yet, I can't say how accurate the film version of Saphira resembles the way she is described in the novel.  What I can say is that Saphira looked very real on screen and is a beautiful creature to behold, fantastical or not.<br /><br />Overall, ERAGON is an average fantasy film that moves at a very rushed pace and never reaches the promise of the great movie it could have been.  I don't blame the director, but I do blame the studio because I know they pressured the filmmakers to finish the movie as fast as they could.  An epic fantasy film shouldn't be filmed in just a month.  Fans of the book might enjoy the movie, but they will probably be disappointed.  Instead, this movie version is more for very young children and those looking for a short, non-original fantasy movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I never got through the whole book of Eragon yet but from what I read it would seem the film is a little too fast paced. It skips a lot of character development to put the dragon in the hands of Eragon right in the very beginning of the movie. Heck it even has the dragon grow quickly and goes straight to Eragon training to be a dragon rider pretty quick. It's faithful to the book but with cutting out a lot of talking to mostly just have action. The best thing about the movie is the relationship between Eragon and the dragon. It's well done how they communicate by their minds and is faithful to the book. Jeromy Irons isn't bad either and is prety brave I must say. I mean he had the guts to do another dragon movie after Dungeons and Dragons...lol.<br /><br />  The direction is  kind of sloppy though since everything is just quickly thrown together with no real scenes of wonder. I don't think it's fair that it got bad reviews because everyone compares every fantasy that comes out to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Not every fantasy that comes out is gonna be that good. This is still a decent fantasy with nice looking effects and cool villians. But I'd be dishonest if I didn't admit that it was kind of a mess since it's too fast paced with everything thrown together kind of sloppy. The end makes it clear that there could be more but it's kind of cheesey and doesn't even make that much sense. Plus since this one wasn't that well received we might not even get a sequel that continues after the silly ending that shows that things won't remain happlily ever after. This is a bit of a spoiler but if the king had a dragon then why didn't he use it against Eragon and his in the first place ??</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>17-year old Eragon (Spleers) lives a fairly peaceful life with his uncle.  One day he comes across what he believes to be an odd looking stone.  Soon, he discovers it is a dragon egg, and once that egg hatches, he seeks out the village bum/storyteller Brom (Irons).  He seems to know a lot about dragons, and begins to teach Eragon the ways of Dragon Riders.  Meanwhile, the evil King Galbatoris (Malkovich) sends his minion Durza (Carlyle) to find the dragon and destroy it.<br /><br />"Eragon" is sub-par on almost all levels.  The worst aspect is that the story parallels "Star Wars" almost exactly.  I cannot help but wonder if George Lucas is getting a paycheck for this ripoff of a story.  To be fair, I am told that the film differs quite a bit from the book.  Spleers is adequate as Eragon.  Malkovich is fun to watch as always, but he gets very little screen time.  The saving grace in the acting department is Irons, who seems to be having fun despite the film he is in.  If you must see this, wait until it comes out on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Please book reviewers, review the books, movie reviewers review the movies, and never the twain should meet. Make you a deal I won't review books and expect them to be as good as the movies if you won't review the movies and expect them to be good as the books. Is it a deal? No offence but I rarely read a book reviewers review of a movie and hear anything but the movie stank.<br /><br />I didn't read these books so I can't say anything about them. But a good example is I did read the J.R.R. Tolkien books for years, long before the movies. The movies were not as good as the books, but you know what I loved the movies anyway. I realize that there was no way Peter Jackson could put all that was in the books into movies. Now if you say, I wished they had covered something better, I can understand and appreciate that. Just please don't trash it because it doesn't have everything from the book.<br /><br />I liked it myself. They obviously ended it in a way they could make a sequel. If you like medieval and fantasy movies you will probably like it. If you enjoy movies about Dragons you will probably love it. Not as good as "Dragonheart", but certainly well worth seeing. I think with a little more comedy from a well known actor and it would have been outstanding. That's why "Dragonheart" stands out so clearly in my mind is a few nice comedy moments put in to lighten the mood some of the time. Good family movie and good replayability.</p></br></body></html>

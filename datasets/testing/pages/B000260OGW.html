I'm not a big western-fan either, but this one I really enjoyed. Great camera-work, beautiful landscape, good acting (don't misunderstand me now, I like Costner as an actor - but has the man really only just one expression on his face?) especially Mr.Duvall did a great job (as usual). Yes, it's the best western-movie I've seen in years - and though it perhaps took a little too long before the end-credits went rolling after the &quot;showdown&quot;, well for me the mighty action-scene there at the end of the movie made it worth it. This gives a whole new meaning to the expression &quot;When the going gets tough...&quot;<br /><br /> And what a sound! The sound-effects are really that great I think, if you haven't seen this movie - see it in DTS if you have a capable speaker-system and you'll probably love it. The gunshots sounded almost real!<br /><br /> So all in all: Sometimes the movie seems a little slow, and you may feel that it could have been edited some more, perhaps no great surprises in it either, but I never got bored (then I must add that I didn't have the highest expectations before I rented it) - and the ending lived up to my expectations, and it wont take too long before I'll see it again. Good to have you back, Mr.Costner =)</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a decent directorial effort by Kevin Costner. The only problem is that he cast himself in the film. While it is not a bad film, the only thing that makes this film worthwhile are the thespian efforts of Robert Duvall and Michael Gambon. Somehow, they manage to pull it all together for Costner with superlative performances. Kudos to Annette Benning for opting for reality and foregoing the makeup and trappings of Hollywood that would be misplaced in this western that is set in late nineteenth century America.<p>This is a film about free grazers who drove their cattle over the open range in defiance of territorial ranchers who resented this use of their land. When free grazers, Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charley (Kevin Costner), take to the open prairies, they cross the open range of wealthy rancher Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon), a hard fisted, no nonsense Irishman, who is determined to keep free grazers off his land. Obviously, this results in a showdown. As to who wins, take a wild guess. <p>Annette Benning plays the role of  Sue Barlow, the local doctor's sister who helps patch up the wounded and provides romantic interest for Costner. Unfortunately, there is little chemistry between the two, and the only thing heating up the screen is the ever present gunfire. Still, notwithstanding the fact that this film is nothing to write home about unless you are a true aficionado of this genre, it is still worth a rental, if only to glimpse Robert Duvall and Michael Gambon at work.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>Well, I too, like others, really wanted to enjoy this film.  So I went out and bought it to add to my Western collection, and gearing up for May's release of Wyatt Earp, I sat down to watch it.  <p>Well the cinemaphotography was good, considering that it was shot around Calgary, Alberta.  The two main characters were well developed.  Probably too much really.  But the secondary characters and most importantly the villians had very little character development.  So when the final gun battle started, the viewer know little to nothing about who Costner and Duvall are shooting to kill.  Therefore, you really have no emotion attached to the off-ing of a bad guy.  In other words, when a bad guy was blown away, you were left asking, &quot;Who's that?&quot; or &quot;What's the significance of that guy?&quot;  If you knew who these guys were, you'd probably give a darn when they'd expire.  But you don't.  It's just another guy who got blown half-way across the street by the &quot;splatter gun&quot;.<p>Oh don't get me wrong, the final shoot-out was probably one of the best both visually and sounding Western shoot-outs ever portrayed on film, but like I said, you just didn't know who anybody was.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, but had the director, I'm assuming Costner, spent more time telling who the bad guys were, the movie would have probably been one of the best westerns of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>One of my criticisms of Costner as a director is that he has a tendency to dawdle when developing a plot, devoting far too much time and (albeit loving) attention to the introduction of main characters and their circumstances. Thankfully, the pace accelerates during the middle portion of this film when Boss Spearman (Duvall) and Charley Waite (Costner) finally have their shoot-out with Denton Baxter (Gambon) and his thugs. Then the film resumes its languid pace and the plot gradually evaporates. Obviously, Costner has seen and admires earlier westerns such as Shane, The Sheepman, Will Penny, and Pale Rider. There is a classic formula for westerns and Costner respects it. Probably too much, thereby diminishing dramatic impact.<p>The acting in this film is solid, although (as in Secondhand Lions) Duvall again seems to be recycling his portrayal of Gus McCrae from Lonesome Dove. Annette Bening (playing Sue Barlow) does about as much as anyone could with flimsy material. Costner seems as awkward directing love scenes as he does appearing in them. That is appropriate in this instance, however. He is entirely credible as the "socially challenged" Charley as is Gambon as the obligatory villain, Baxter. The  supporting cast is first-rate, notably Abraham Benrudi, Diego Luna, Michael Jeter, James Russo, and Kim Coates. The production values are outstanding. However, this film seems at least 20-30 minutes too long (its running time is 138 minutes) and I blame that on Costner's direction. Those familiar with Gunga Din (which has a much more complicated plot) may be surprised to know that it has a running time of only 117 minutes. This film is an uneven achievement, not up the standards set by Dances with Wolves, but certainly more entertaining than so many others which have appeared in the last few years.  <p>FYI, because this film consists of three separate but connected parts (Before Shoot-Out, Shoot- Out, and After Shoot-Out), I arrived at a Four Star rating by adding up three separate ratings (Four, Five, and Three Stars) and dividing the total by three. Because of the clumsy final scene between Sue and Charley, I was tempted to deduct a Star but decided to give Costner the benefit of the doubt. His ambition exceeded his reach but Open Range is a worthy effort nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>2003 marked a sort of a small comeback for Kevin Costner both as a director and as an actor. The work in question was the very well-done Western, Open Range. Open Range was a moderately budgeted film which has more in common with Costner's first directorial work, Dances with Wolves than his last one, The Postman.<br /><br />The film was an adaptation of the Lauran Paine novel, The Open Range Men, and it captures alot of the themes found in the novel. This was probably due to the fact that screenwriter Craig Storper didn't deviate from the novel's basic story. There were no superfluous action sequences and gunfights to ratchet up the action. Everything about Open Range was about the gradual and inevitable final confrontation between the "free-grazers" and the "barbed-wire" men. The free-grazers were played by Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall as Charles Waite and Boss Spearman, respectively. On the other side of the conflict was Michael Gambon playing Denton Baxter, the ruthless land-baron whose attempt to keep the free-grazers from grazing on his land also hides another agenda. Caught in-between these two strong-willed groups were the people in the town Baxter pretty much controls through his "town marshal" and the herd helpers under Boss Spearman's employ.<br /><br />The theme of freedom to roam the open country versus the rights of a landowner echoes throughout the film. Set in the latter end of the 19th-century, Open Range shows the clash of the more natural ways of the Old West slowly eroding to be replaced by the more industrial, monopolistic practices that became prevalent during the 1880's, also known in US History as the Gilded Age. Even the personalities of the conflicting characters mirror this theme as the free-grazers only want to use the land as it has been used for years upon years and thats sharing between all men of the West. The land-baron has other ideas in mind and everything boils down to him owning everything around him, even if it means using ruthless tactics to gather even more property.<br /><br />Open Range also has abit of modernism in its subplot of Charley Waite's growing attraction to the sister of the town doctor and the same sister's well-rounded characterization. It's not often that a traditional Western shows women in a very positive light instead of the usual submissive and stay-at-home characters of Western's past. This could also be attributed to the wonderful, underrated performance by Annette Bening who plays Sue Barlow, the doctor's sister and Charley Waite's love interest. Bening doesn't play Sue as the traditional Western female. She also doesn't go overboard and turn Sue into a 20th-century feminist. She instead plays the character as someone who knows her place in the world, but also one who is strong-willed and willing to stand for what is right.<br /><br />Open Range was a wonderful throwback to what made such modern Westerns like Unforgiven and Tombstone such a success both for traditionalists and new fans. Kevin Costner's direction was very low-key. Allowing the story to tell itself at its own pace until the final confrontation. The final gunfight in the end gets alot of attention from critics and its deserving. The entire sequence takes at least 10-15 minutes from start to finish. The fight itself was done in a realistic fashion. There was no sharpshooter dead-eyes in this film, but individuals who had skill but still missed. It was a fight where it wasn't who was the fastes, but who was the calmest under fire. There's also a suddenness to the brutality in the final gunfight that demystifies the old-style Western shootouts of past. Some complained that the film was very slow and took too long to get to the "good stuff", but I actually thought the gradual pacing of most of the film's lenght gave the final confrontation even more impact. Costner seem to have learned the lesson all good directors know: less means more.<br /><br />2003's Open Range won't go down as a great piece of filmmaking. It surely won't go down as one of the best in history. What Open Range did accomplish was putting the Western back to its epic and majestic roots, but at the same time keeping the intimacy of a character-driven story. In time, Open Range would probably go down as one of the underrated gems of the last decade and find a place next to its closest comparison, Unforgiven, as one of the best Westerns of the new era.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Entertaining but rather mindless by-the-numbers big budget western from Director, Star Kevin Costner finds Costner and cowbuddy Robert Duvall intent on a suicide mission to right the wrong commit4ed by a group of ruthless landowners. It seems the leads and Annette Bening as love interest deserve a more compelling original story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A Film By Kevin Costner<p>Open Range is easily the best western since Unforgiven, and no, it isn't the only western that has been made since Eastwood's masterpiece.  Open Range is a return to the classic western and should hold up very well in comparison to classic westerns.  It isn't quite as good as Unforgiven, but that was a genre defining (and almost ending) movie and very few movies are that good.  Thus far in 2003, Open Range is one of the year's best movies, but it may not make the final top ten list at year's end.<p>Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) and Charley Waite (Kevin Costner) at cattlemen.  They are also free grazers.  This means that they pass through the land, never staying anywhere and let their cattle graze anywhere they go, including on the property of other people.  Once, this was a common and accepted practice, but by 1882 people have become more property conscious and legal free grazing was falling out of favor with landowners.  As Boss and Charley are driving their cattle across the country, they have to send their hired man into town for supplies.  This sets up all of the action that is to follow as Mose (Abraham Benrubi) has problems with some of the townsfolk and when there is a murder of one of Boss's workers, Boss and Charley would rather stay and take care of business than be run off.  Boss has a line, "Cows is one thing, but one man telling another man where he can go in this country is something else."  That line pretty much boils down the main conflict between the rancher Baxter (Michael Gambon) and Boss.  The conflict is about the clash of the old ways with the new ways (free grazing vs private land, the old west vs new civilization) and both men are committed to their way of life.  Baxter, who is also crooked, pushes Boss too far.  <p>Charley has been working for Boss for 10 years after being a killer in the Civil War.  So, he is the perfect man for a fight.  For ten years Boss had given him the chance to live a better life, but he was never far away from the man who would kill with no second thoughts.  The movie presents a sort of emotional cat and mouse game between Boss and Baxter.  There are set up ambushes, reversals, good speeches to the townspeople on who to support and why, and to be honest this was an incredibly effective western where almost everything was working.  The gun battle near the end of the movie (which is just about all of the action, so expect a slow paced western when you see this) was outstanding.  One thing that Kevin Costner made a point to do was make sure that the gun shots were realistically loud.  Remember, there were no silencers on shot guns and six shooters back then.  If someone shoots, it is loud and it is frightening.  The gun fight was realistic and one of the highlights of the movie.  But even with the loud gun fights, the parts that make the movie are the quiet times where we see Boss and Charley interact with each other and with the land.  Nothing is rushed in this movie.  <p>The one thing that doesn't work in the movie is Charley's relationship with Sue Barlow (Annette Bening).  It feels a little forced and out of place.  Bening does what she can with the role, but there isn't much there and forcing the relationship feels out of place with the main thrust of the movie.  I understand why it was done, to show a change in Charley and a potential softening of his character, but it doesn't work as well as it should.  That was the only thing that I felt was lacking in the movie and I thought that Open Range was an excellent movie and should definitely be supported.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 9/10<br />Rate: 8<br /><br />9/10: I guess the Western genre isn't dead after all. That's because Open Range featured well-respected actors which helped to prolong its dying life. It's almost like watching Unforgiven, and I liked the human elements involved in Open Range. They made the performances and the story more sincere and interesting. The twenty somewhat minutes involving the much cliched "O.K Corral" shootout is clearly better done than Pale Rider. However, the final ten minutes was too long for me and should have been cut off. Just end it and move on. Never been a fan of Annette Bening, she surprisingly matures in her role and gives a decent performance in Open Range. Robert Duvall is at his wonted best, and that's why I will always love his body of work. Kevin Costner, once again, takes the helm as a director amid a couple of bombs in the 90's and finally goes back to the same roots in what made Dances with Wolves a memorable picture. Many, including me, were very apprehensive about him pulling a Michael Cimino, but this was a pleasant treat for me. Granted, he is a talented director that sure knows how to charm the audience. Of course, Unforgiven is a much superior film to Open Range in so many ways, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. All in all, Open Range makes a fine addition to the Western genre and is a delight to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>After a series of flops, artistically and commercially, Kevin Costner returned to the genre that first brought him success: the Western.  The best decision he ever made as director/producer was to highlight Robert Duvall in the lead role since he's one of the few actors who look comfortable in Western garb, the other 2 being Clint Eastwood & Tom Selleck.  But it's Duvall's authority and grace which really contribute to making this Western such a success for Costner.  Also he skillfully cast such fine actors in supporting roles such as the great Irish/British actor Michael Gambon as the villain and the late Michael Jeter in his last role as an ally of Duvall & Costner.  The plot of course is simple yet it really doesn't matter here because Costner, unlike Lawrence Kasdan, takes his time in developing every character in the story so that by the end of the finale after the gunsmoke clears--we really care for all of them.  In "Silverado", we get types but here in "Open Range", we get full blooded characters. And of course, even the always excellent Annette Benning has a role worthy of her talents-as a progressive middle aged woman who clearly stands on her own.  There is a slight nod in "The Unforgiven"'s direction in Costner's damaged gunfighter but overall when the gunfight occurs--we're really rooting for these two veteran cowpunchers. Duvall said in an interview that of all the character roles he's played none is more comfortable than that of a cowboy--and he certainly looks like he's born in the saddle (he once boasted that he rode better than John Wayne when he was in "True Grit").  This is one Western I'll be looking forward to in Blu-ray!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Don't know. Duvall &amp; Costner seem to be too smart to be free range cowboys. They seemed to be very 21st century to me but no manner. Costner puts his money where his heart is &amp; I repect the projects he's done. The production values are always there &amp; not cheap. He can tell &amp; I guess he figures his customers can also. Westerns have changed over the years but this one has things in common with the oldies, such as justice redemption, gunplay a little romance. Annette Benning is a delightful diversion from the all male cast. A very good western for our times. Sure, I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>If you are in the mood for a slow paced western, this is the one to see. It is not quite as slow moving as Unforgiven and the acting is top notch especially Robert Duvall who is both funny and convincing as a cowboy. The final gun shootout takes a while to happen, but once it does, it is a 15 minute gun fight that will probably go down as one of the very best western gun fights in cinematic history. Kevin Costner has finally directed and acted in a good movie. I put this one just a notch below Dances with Wolves, but it is still one of his best.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner does not strike any new territory with Open Range, but it is an immensely satisfying addition to the Western genre anyway.  Paired with the always watchable Robert Duvall, the two play off of each other with the relaxed familiarity of the two trail companions and long-time friends they portray.<p>Filmed with wonderful appreciation for the natural surroundings and beauties of the Open Range and in real weather, with wind and rain only adding to the texture and reality of what is, in many ways, a romantic film, the film unfolds its story rather than jumpcutting it all over the place.  This ain't Matrix, it takes its time.<p>It is old-fashioned in that regard, building slowly to the inevitable showdown.  This climactic shootout is a dandy, by the way, beautifully staged and with the shock and surprise of actual gun-fighting.<p>There is a love interest.  There is some slightly corny moments.  There is a lot of laconic and terse dialogue between Duvall and Costner.  There are vile villains.  Many may not care for the icons & touchstones of the genre.  I didn't mind it at all.<p>Costner has turned in a solid effort here.  Well played by all, including Annette Benning and tbe late Michael Jeter.  It may not break new ground, but it certainly goes over familiar ground in a distinctive and sure-footed way.  Well done in all departments, a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>OPEN RANGE is, perhaps, the finest western since UNFORGIVEN, with a sense of admiration and respect towards the Cowboy that Eastwood's film never achieved. While the premise of the film is simple (Western 'justice', after cowboys are ravaged by a cattleman who 'owns' a small town), the characters are so warm and human that you 'care' for them...an effect that has been lacking in the westerns of the last few years!<p>Set against some of the most breathtaking vistas ever recorded on film, crusty Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall, who steals the film), and laconic Charley Waite (Kevin Costner, also fabulous), are long-time friends who are taking a small herd of cattle cross-country to market. With only a big, affable cowpoke, Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and a young Mexican kid, Button (Diego Luna) in their crew, the four (with Waite's dog, Tig), are forced to sit out a massive summer storm, playing cards and sharing a camaraderie that feels totally real and natural. At storm's end, Spearman sends Mose to a nearby town to pick up supplies. After several days pass, and Mose doesn't return, Spearman and Waite leave Button to watch the camp, and ride to town to find their missing friend. They discover that the town is run by a ruthless, bullying cattle baron, Denton Baxter (Irish actor Michael Gambon, who has replaced the late Richard Harris in the HARRY POTTER series), who informs them that Mose is in jail, and orders them to get him, and get off his range, pronto! Mose has been beaten, mercilessly, so the pair take him to the town doctor (Dean McDermott), who treats the man for free, as the giant had given a good accounting of himself in a fight with three of Baxter's goons. The doctor's sister, Sue (Annette Bening, showing all of her years, but radiantly beautiful) and Waite feel an immediate, mutual attraction, but he mistakenly thinks her to be the Doc's wife, and holds his piece. Taking the bandaged Mose with them, the cowboys return to camp.<p>While away, Button sees a group of riders, in white hoods, hovering around the herd. Knowing that they work for Baxter, Spearman and Waite jump them, after dark, beating them as revenge for Mose...then return to camp to discover another group of Baxter's men have attacked, killing Mose and the dog, and leaving young Button for dead. Taking the boy to the doctor, they discover he had left to treat Baxter's men, and Sue takes on the task of saving the boy's life.<p>Justice must be served, but Baxter 'owns' the sheriff, so it falls on Spearman and Waite to end the cattleman's reign of terror...and it is revealed that Waite has a past history as a gunman...<p>This film is rich with detail, and has an extraordinary supporting cast, particularly Michael Jeter (who died shortly after filming) as a sympathetic stable owner. While the film is leisurely paced, it never drags, and the conversations between Spearman and Waite, about everything from getting old to the advantages of settling down, are a complete joy. Add to this a riveting climactic shootout, and you have a Western that is a truly satisfying experience!<p>Kudos to director/star Costner, for his respect of the Western genre, and for making the best film (thus far) of 2003!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Fans of Kevin Costners previous avenues into the western genre will certainly not be disappointed by this movie, and his obvious love for the material is certainly in evidence. This is a simple story concerning &quot;free grazers&quot; or wandering cattle herders that drift from place to place, feeding their cattle on the land as they go, usually only suffering from the ravages of the weather or terrain. A run in with a local avaricious land baron (aren't they always) leads to some strong arm tactics by our protagonists, which leads to a show down, and one feels long overdue come uppance for the main villian (played with some zeal by Michael Gambon). At almost 2hrs 20 minutes this is by no means a formula western, but the power to captivate the viewer for so long, with such an essentially short and simple tale is testament to the film makers credentials. Costner is more than ably supported by Robert Duvall as the crusty experienced cowhand, who won't lie down and take a beating, and a romantic interest in the form of Annette Benning is also interwoven well into the story. Some amazing camera work, with jaw dropping vistas and a real feel for the story and characters is more than enough eye candy, and although a little predictable, this is well worth a rental. Interesting extra's on the DVD add to the value, and whereas I wouldn't put this in the same league as Wyatt Earp, or Dances with Wolves, it is very close. Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>OPEN RANGE is top on the list of recent Western films - but then there really haven't been many decent Western films since Clint Eastwood's mighty THE UNFORGIVEN.  But here is a majestically beautiful, seemingly endless expanse of open range with waving grasses, field lupine, ominous clouds, torrential rainfalls, and vistas that seem to extend forever.  This 'place' is the true Star of the film and though we may long for the American prairie it depicts, in reality the star is Canada!  <p>The story is simple and direct - the cowman vs. the rancher.  Kevin Costner and Robert DuVall (both in superb acting form) are bonded with Abraham Benrubi and Diego Luna are free ranging cattlemen who encounter the antipathy of evil and corrupt rancher Michael Gambon and strike at each other until the shootout in the local town decides the victor.  The townsfolk include a Doc and his sister, Annette Benning, and a wily character plyer with gusto by Michael Jeter.  Though this doesn't sound like much of a tale it is in the telling and the visualization that the magic happens.  The discourses between DuVall and Costner are not only beautifully and subtly written, but they are played with enormous sensitivity.  Director Costner knows when to let the universal  beauty of the open range sing when it is the stage: he also knows how to handle the essentially dark interiors of the hokey little town saloon and jail.  All of the actors are in synch with the tone of the movie and it is much to Costner's credit that he has resurrected The Western as one of the significant and sublime American art forms.  A spellbinding, visually magnificent, excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Stories of redemption and revenge have always been at the core of westerns. Kevin Costner's Open Range recalls both Dances with Wolves with its languid pacing and intensive eye for the fine detail living in the 19th century. The well drawn characters and performances that seem as if they could have been drawn from the frontier give life to Costner's film. Open Range's subject matter was drawn from a conflict in real life; free range cattle were driven from land that wasn't owned by anybody by cattle barons intend on controlling their market and everything that surrounded them. Costner's elegiac western touches all the right buttons to make it a classic American western. If it fails to meet the expectations of the genre's best, perhaps its because the genre seems at a creative dead end much as it was before Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood helped reinvent the genre. Costner's own Dances with Wolves went a long way to try and reinvent the Western in the mythic style of John Ford and with Open Range he is at least partially successful.<p>Charlie (Costner), Boss (Robert Duvall), Mose(Abraham Benrubi from E.R.) and Button (Diego Luna)  are driving their cattle across the country to market. Even though Charlie and Boss have been riding together 10 years, they know next to nothing about each other's past; There's a darkness that haunts Charlie and Boss that they've never spoken of to each other. Their ghosts will soon rear their ugly heads. They've chosen a life without any roots and, as such, they literally have become their own family. Their cattle survive by eating in the open ranges across the west. Unfortunately, open ranges are disappearing as if there's a fire sale going on as rancher's fence up the surrounding countryside even when it doesn't belong to them. <p>When Mose is attacked and injured in a fight with goons working for a nasty cattle baron named Baxter (Michael Gabon in a significantly oily and evil performance), Charlie and Boss must get him out of jail. When they have his injuries attended to by the local doctor, Charlie meets the down-to-earth Sue (Annette Benning). There's an instant attraction between them. He keeps his distance believing her to be married to the doctor. When Baxter's men attack their wagon and killing and injuring their friends, the two men return to the town seeking justice and revenge.<p>Beautifully shot by cinematographer James Muro and well written by Craig Storper there are elements of Open Range that recall Unforgiven; that's no surprise as Costner had tried to purchase, star and direct that film before Clint Eastwood made off with it. There elements no doubt attracted Costner to the project but there's also a feeling of hopefulness that's missing from the much darker and brooding Unforgiven. Open Range isn't a perfect western but it is a very good attention to the genre. At 139 minutes the film is a tad too long but clearly Costner attempt to capture the lifestyle of the free range cowboy was very important to him. These details make the film and performances more believable. <p>The picture quality is outstanding. The sound mix sounded a tad flat and was difficult to hear in stereo but was just fine in 5.1 DTS. The extras include audio commentary by Kevin Costner (disc one) and a handful of very good featurettes on disc two including &quot;America's Open Range&quot; a look at the history of the real open range with Costner providing narration, &quot;Beyond Open Range&quot; a fascinating glimpse at the creative decisions Costner had to make to produce the film, deleted scenes with optional commentary and storyboard sequences. There's also a nicely put together Music Video Montage featuring the late Michael Kamen's beautifully evocative score.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>Every decade or so, either Clint Eastwood or Kevin Costner makes an artistic and entertaining western in an attempt to revive the genre. This time it was Costner's turn, and what he did was absolutely astonishing. He wanted to return to the simple and bare-bones idea of the west and what it was, both in reality and in our minds. He succeeded on a grand scale, but in doing so may have gone even further than what he intended. In many respects, the film Costner made, is a silent western.<br /><br />The story of two saddle pals grazing their cattle on free range until the evil rancher holding court over a town and all the land surrounding it attempts to stop them is a staple of the west. It will always force a confrontation between good and evil, as it does here. Just as in the legendary "Shane," Costner's character, Charley Waite, has a deadly past he would just as soon forget. It is a side he has not even revealed to his traveling companion of ten years, Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall).<br /><br />There is something mythic about this omission. It shows how the west really was, with good men being able to size each other up and not ask questions about their past. Boss is a seasoned and tough cowboy who has always suspected the gun on Charley's hip had many stories to tell, but respected the man wearing it enough to know if he had wanted him to know, he would have told him.<br /><br />The image of the soft-spoken cowboy whose dog means as much to him as any man, is shown not once, but twice: once with the death of Charley's dog at the hands of those trying to drive them off the range, and another when Charley saves another cowboy's dog from drowning. It was the one attachment a man could have without worry. His dog was a loyal friend who could never be turned.<br /><br />"Open Range" takes on mythic preportions because it remains simple, emphasizing the values of loyalty and goodness we associate with our image of the cowboy. It also elaborates on another thread in the fabric we know as the west; the fact that good men sometimes had to do bad things in order to enforce those values. It was the willingness and courage of men like Charley and Boss that would shape the west into a place where people could live free.<br /><br />Costner's homage to the American cowboy and gunfighter also shows the old-fasioned side of men who spent long hours together but were flustered at the sight of a pretty woman, having seen one so seldom. Charley's reluctance to engage in a romance with the pretty sister of the town's doctor is born not only of shyness, but his shame at some of the killing he has done. He feels she will look at him in disgust if she knew what real violence was like, and learn that no man is more capable of it than he. It is tender and sweet, and reminds us of our basic humanity and our need for love. The final scene between Charley and Sue (Annette Bening) will remind anyone familiar with silent films, of a D.W. Griffith scene. It has that same sentimental sweetness as many he directed with Lillian Gish.<br /><br />The gunfight is one of the greatest ever filmed. It is long and ugly, just as they really were. Charley's speech to Boss as he preps the tough cowboy about what is to come, and how each man will react, is one of the great moments in western film history. It is not the gunfight itself, however, which adds meaning to the outcome. It is Charley's loneliness, shown by his picking out a pattern for a gift to Sue should he not survive. You truly get the sense he would almost prefer he did not, so he would not have to face her once he reveals the violence which is second nature to him.<br /><br />Costner shows the women of the west to be something special also. Bening's character, Sue, may own some good china, but she can drink from a tin cup and tend to the wounded as well. She is strong, as women who went west had to be, but  does not lose her femininity.<br /><br />There are fine performances here from Costner, Duvall, and Annette Bening. The supporting cast is equally good, with Michael Jeter memorable in his final film. Michael Gambon, Diego Luna, Abraham Benrubi, and Dean McDermott round out this tale of the changing west. There are breathtaking shots of the open prairie that are matched by a western saga that is timeless, and could easily have been told in the early days of motion pictures.<br /><br />The story here is so simple, and it's implementation so direct, that some failed to see its greatness. It ranks right up there with "Shane" in my book. There is a timeless feel to the storytelling here. One thinks of silent westerns made from old-fashioned books like "Riders of the Purple Sage" when watching this. Films with sound and those without are two different art forms with a strong connection to each other. Costner managed to bridge  the gap between those art forms in "Open Range" and the results are unforgettable. If you doubt this, next time you're watching it, turn off the sound. You'll be able to follow the story without it. It might even help you appreciate the beauty of what Costner has done here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>After the stunning fiascos of "The Postman," "Wyatt Earp" and "3000 Miles to Graceland," director-actor Kevin Costner makes a long-overdue comeback with "Open Range" (2003). Though flawed, it's nice to see a traditional western that wholeheartedly embraces its cliches. The teaming of Costner with Robert Duvall is truly inspired and lends an emotional power to the film. Costner works best when paired with seasoned veterans such as Duvall - in fact, both actors should venture into western territory more often. An excellent cast (Annette Bening, Michael Gambon, the late Michael Jeter) and James Muro's exquisite cinematography lift this familiar range-war saga well above the ordinary, with director Costner utilizing the Alberta landscape to memorable effect. "Open Range" might have been a great western if Costner had made a few judicious cuts (the 139-minute running time is way too long) and hired a better composer than Michael Kamen, whose derivative score lacks spark and resonance. Still, it remains a film worth having in an era where movie westerns are a dying breed.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Settle back for a story that has real adult people. Actions have consequences. Cheers for Costner's faith in a genre that has faded only due to poor stories. An audience will always respond to the well done effort. Here's one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>It is with great pleasure that I take a few moments to praise and defend Costner's "Open Range." ...<p>We did not always go to movies to be bombarded with explosions, shootouts and Will Smith one-liners. There was a time when not all movies were sequels. Kevin Costner knows this. He may be punished for it at the box office, but his "Open Range" is a film that does not pander to 20-year-old boys who consider stupidity a reason to see a movie.<p>"Open Range" is not boring at all. It is involving. It has an actual screenplay with a beginning, middle and end. It pays homage to Western traditions without wallowing in them. It has movements and themes, and does not set up a single situation without resolving it. It is beautifully shot and skillfully directed by a man who understands and cares about the epic style. It is funny, dramatic and philosophical. You know, all those things that "The Hulk" wasn't.<p>There are no special effects in this movie, not on a "Matrix"/"Star Wars" level. Perhaps that baffles some people. Here is a movie that depends on characters and mood. I loved every minute of "Open Range;" it was everything I'd been hoping it would be. The sold-out audience I saw it with also seemed deeply appreciative of Costner's willingness to tell a story without the usual bells and whistles.<p>The movie also depends on acting. Duvall deserves an Oscar nod, and Costner and Bening were also outstanding (Costner, especially). People say the romance felt forced; I felt it was integral to the Costner character's essential dilemma.<p>Look, Costner has been in some bad movies. He made a real stinker back in 1997. Show me a movie star who doesn't have a bomb on his resume. "Open Range" is a terrific movie and I look forward to the DVD release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>In the realm of the Movies, Kevin Costner is the human repository of all of our collective American Dreams: of all that is Good or Just. He is Everyman.  He is Jim Garrison in "JFK" railing against all the evil in the world in a Texas courtroom in one of the most heartfelt, emotionally effective tour-de-force performances in all of the movies. He is Our modern Gary Cooper. But like all heroes, he is fallible.<br />It is a bold move to make an old-fashioned Western in these times of Crack, Terrorist attacks, AIDS and SARS but Costner, ten years after "Dancing With Wolves" has done so nonetheless.<br />"Open Range" is big and bold and it's vistas are appropriately panoramic yet it is most effective when Costner, Robert Duvall and Annette Bening are on the screen performing their platonic m&eacute;nage a trios: the men all big muddy feet, worn out boots, tied of tongue and Bening, scrubbed free of any makeup, plainly dressed looking radiant, human and womanly, as only she can.<br />There is a plot involving townspeople who want the free-ranging (cattle drivers who let their cattle graze at will) Charley (Costner) and Boss (Duvall) off the town's land and the last 45 minutes of the film is violent, vicious and bloody.<br />But mostly "Open Range" is best when Charley and Boss are on their horses riding the open ranges of America sensing that, being 1882 it's the end of an era, the end of a lifestyle that has brought them a kind of freedom and the end of the innocent world that they have come to love and expect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>OK quick, what is the worst innovation for the Western in the modern era?.....Rain, that's what. Or in this case, rain and dogs!<p>But the real problem with this flick is this - we dont know the bad guys. One particular character, advertised as the fastest gunhand in the west or whatever, makes about a 30 second appearance at the end of the movie just to get shot between the eyes. And the evil cattle baron has one scene in the beginning of the film, and then again comes back to get killed. And, since we were deprived of the &quot;bar fight&quot; that landed the big guy in the pokie, we basically are rewarded with a central conflict that seems somewhat arbitrary and as empty as a box full of air.<p>Robert Duvall was terrific and obviously very comfortable in these roles and gets an 'A' for character development, but then there's Costner's character Charlie....we dont know a whole lot about him and that's too bad. I guess he was intended to remain a mystery but to tell the audience he had a &quot;violent past&quot; and leave it at that is a major disappointment. The audience doesnt know enough about Costner's character to by sympathetic. And although Annette Benning was very good, and gorgeous as usual, there is absolutely zero spark between her character and Charlie. The final scene in the saloon is almost unbearable. Ms. Benning looks like she's in pain as she says &quot;I've been holding my love for a long time Charlie.&quot; Ouch!<p>And then there's the big climactic gunfight that is a carnival of people and bullets that refuses to end. It just goes on and on while you're impatiently tapping your feet and looking at your watch and it still goes on for another ten minutes of irrelevant nonsense. Sheesh, give it up already!<p>You know, I really wanted to like this movie, and I tried to be objective knowing what I know about Costner's style and devotion to his personal brand of noble sentimentality and detachment, but....it's just not there. &quot;We're not ourselves yet!&quot; Yeah, no kidding.<p>The DVD package is well put together. The photography is amazing, and the 5.1 sound is very good, although the gunfire sounds a bit hollow in spots. Audio commentary, a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, and plenty of deleted scenes for those of you who find yourself all that curious about this thing. Also a boring music video that I suppose is designed to be some sort of tribute to Kevin Costner's genius as a director. Like I said, it just ain't there. 3 Yorkies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>This is my second review where I use exclaimation points multiple times in the title. The first being Bowling for Columbine, a film I loved so much, that I still use examples from that movie when the topic of guns comes up. But lets talk about Open Range. I never saw Kevin Costner in a film, and I heard bad things about him. But I wanted to see Open Range, so I went. As beautiful as the field was in the beginning, I was starting to think that mabye I made a mistake. Then five minutes passed. I was into that movie straight off, and Robert Duvall's character of Boss Spearman was filled with heart and humor, the perfect mixture of a character. <p>The film stars Duvall and Kevin Costner, who also directed, as Boss Spearman and Charley Waite. They've been fellow cattlemen for about a decade now. With the help of Mose Harrison and Button, they move there cattle. With no land of their own they let the cattle graze in open field. But a man named Denton Baxter, an Irishmen who owns a small town a few miles from the field, doesn't want freegrazer's in his field. <p>After Mose heads down to that town and doesn't return, Charley and Boss go to the town and find out that he was involved in a fight, and was beaten and put in jail by Baxter, and Sheriff Poole. They bring him to the town doctor, Doc, and his sister Sue Barlow. Boss and Charley bring him back to the cattle, but they are not going to give up with fighting Baxter and his crew. <p>Boss and Charley go theatren a few of Baxter's thugs, who have been watching the group. When they return to the wagon they find Mose and the dog dead, and Button wounded. Returning to town, they leave Button with Sue and they get ready for the final showdown to get revenge on those who have hurt them.<p>A strong and powerful film, acted by Kevin Costner, the wonderful Robert Duvall, and the great Annette Benning, Open Range didn't just make me smile at the end, but it had me involved right from the very beginning. With amazing settings, and characters you grow to love, Open Range is on my list as one of the best movies of 2003. For two hours and a half of drama and suspense, Open Range is the best solution.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>Being a fan of Westerns, Bob Duvall, and Kevin Costner, guess what?  I like this movie.  I had heard the movie was not that great and did not see it in the theatres.  I finally got it once it came out on DVD and very much enjoyed the movie.  If you like Westerns or any of the actors in it, then you will like "Open Range."</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>When my wife & I first saw "Open Range" in theatres, we were mesmerized.  We came out of the theatre with the same word on our lips: Oscar!  The landscape of the film is stark, the pacing of the moving is deliberate, and the characters are unadorned.  All of this serves to create a sense of reality for the film that sucks the viewer into the film and swoops them up into the world of Bluebonnet Spearman, Charley Waite & Sue Barlow.  The climactic fight scene is breathtaking.  An entire fight sequence occurs without music, making it all the more real.  Costner allows us to know where everyone is, who gets shot & why.  "Open Range" is an amazing achievement and shows Costner to be one of our best working directors.  The 2-disc DVD is a treature.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  As Charley Waite, Costner's performance is understated, brilliantly focused on detail.  Costner was nominated for Best Actor for "Dances With Wolves," the year he won the Oscar as its best director.  The scene where he tracks mud into Sue Barlow's house, tries to scoop the clumps into his hat & with a glance to see if he's watched, picks up the carpet and brushes the last little bits to be unseen is a magical moment, wordless & profound.<br /><br />Robert Duvall is certainly one of our most recognized actors with an Oscar for "Tender Mercies" in 1983 & five other acting nominations ("The Godfather," "Apocalypse Now," "The Great Santini," "The Apostle," & "A Civil Action.")  I certainly thought his portrayal of Boss (Bluebonnet) Spearman was going to bring home a second statue.  Duvall's character is understated, but with depth and grace.<br /><br />Annette Bening as Sue Barlow also turns in a stellar performance as the hard working sister of the doctor who is just a bit past her prime, still not willing to settle for just any man, but who sees the goodness in Charley Waite.  I found the romantic conclusion to be the perfect ending to the film.<br /><br />The villain Baxter played by Michael Gambon is dastardly.  The deleted scene where he shoots the bartender Bill for not picking up a gun is so evil.  It's hard to reconcile that the same actor can then do such a magical job as Aldus Dumbledore in "Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban."  Abraham Benrubi as the burly Mose whose death precipitates the action does a great job as a modern Hoss Cartwright.  Diego Luna as Buttons turns in an excellent performance as the young cowhand Buttons.  I did not recognize him from "Frida" or "The Terminal."  Also, Dean McDermott gives a great reading as Doc Barlow.<br /><br />Perhaps special recognition must be given Michael Jeter who plays the jumpy stable attendant Percy who befriends Charly & Boss.  Perched atop the barn, he gives them clues throughout the fight to where the bad guys are.  The Emmy-winning actor for his work in "Evening Shade" TV series passed away from complications associated with AIDS.  This was his last onscreen role followed by a voice appearance in "The Polar Express."<br /><br />"Open Range" is an excellent film.  The DVD offers many extras with the deleted scenes being my favorite.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Critically acclaimed in some quarters, but snubbed by the Oscars, Open Range is a throw back to the great John Wayne Westerns of the past. With the exception of a few films, like Tombstone or Wyatt Earp, you rarely see Westerns hyped on the big screen anymore. Open Range is the exception to the rule. With an all-star cast headed by Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, and Annette Benning, Open Range is filled with all the majestic beauty of the rolling plains, small town frontier life, and shootouts between the good guys and the bad. If you like the Western genre, then you'll love Open Range.<br /><br />Friends Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall), Charley Waite (Kevin Costner), Mose Harrison (Abraham Benrubi), and Button (Diego Luna) enjoy a life of freedom and abundance as they free-graze their cattle across the open plains of the Old West. Living a life of honor and tranquility, each is content with the wonder of his daily experience. But each man's personal paradise is upended when the men drive their cattle near the town of Harmonville. Local rancher Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) hates free-rangers, especially on his land, and he uses the local sheriff, Sheriff Poole (James Russo) to control the town through a campaign of fear and terror.<br /><br />But Boss and Charley are not the type of men who back down from a fight, especially when their friends are hurt. The differing goals of each group of men leads to an inevitable bloody showdown. In the meantime, Charley falls in love with the local doctor's sister Sue Barlow (Annette Benning). At times funny, at others romantic, Open Range is a film the entire family can enjoy...<br /><br />Utilizing modern day cinematography and the natural beauty of the American frontier, Open Range provides a modern viewers with an idea of the hard life such people lived. The only major point in which it lacks realism (at least as far as I can ascertain, and I'm no expert) is in the final scenes when the good guys and bad guys finally have a showdown gun battle. This prolonged dance of the six-shooters ends up killing about seventy-five times as many people as the famous shootout at the OK Corral. Just as the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre would hardly merit a mention on today's evening news, mass murder on this scale just did not happen in those days. However, the shootout in Open Range is the high-point of the film, and the rate at which they stave off the ultimate conflict builds to the climax of the movie with a crescendo effect (which wouldn't work without the bloody gun battle).<br /><br />In the end, Open Range is a highly entertaining movie. Lots of conflict... Lots of shooting... Man against man violence. If you like that, then you're in luck with this one. The only question you need ask yourself (which in the old days you didn't have to ask yourself) is whether or not the good guys will win. Do they? You'll have to find out for yourself, and I highly recommend it. Open Range is Kevin Costner at his best - knee-deep in American history, whether it's the open plains of the West or the baseball diamonds of Iowa and North Carolina - that's why Open Range is a definite must-see film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner directed and costars in this beautifully filmed saga of courageous cattle drivers menaced by a powerful rancher and his corrupt Marshall.  Cowhands Charley (Costner) and Boss (Robert Duvall) find themselves avenging a brutal murder against impossible odds.  A brave townswoman (Annette Benning) catches Charley's eye, but is it too late?  <p>Duvall and Costner are both sensational as the simple, hardworking cowboys who have a deep bond of friendship and respect. They are not idealized, but are shown to be two good men who live by a code of honor. The movie was filmed in spectacular Alberta, Canada.  <p>I was surprised by how much I liked "Open Range."  The heroes are likeable, the script is intelligent and satisfying, and the action-filled finale is a tour-de-force for director Costner.  The little touches, like filming through old, rippled window glass, are great.  The violence is not excessive, and the blend of action, suspense, humor, and even a little romance make for a very enjoyable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>For those viewers who fondly remember, and miss, Robert Duvall's role as Augustus McCrae in the 1989 TV miniseries LONESOME DOVE, take heart. Duvall is back in the saddle again as &quot;Boss&quot; Spearman in OPEN RANGE. It's been way too long.<p>The lead role in this western actually belongs to Kevin Costner, who plays Spearman's trail partner and employee, Charlie Waite. Boss is a cattleman that practices free-range grazing, i.e. driving his herd from place to place, only staying long enough for the animals to deplete the available food supply. But it's 1882, ranchers are beginning to fence in the West, and freegrazers are an endangered species. So, its no surprise when Charlie and Boss are ordered to take their beeves and get out of Dodge, so to speak, by big time rancher Baxter (Michael Gambon), who also owns the local town and its sheriff. Waite and Spearman are soon backed into a corner when the latter's two other hired hands, Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and Button (Diego Luna), run seriously afoul of Baxter's thugs. <p>It would be hard to choose between the better performance - Costner or Duvall - both playing characters so strong, self-reliant and silent that neither knows the other's full name. And they've been riding the West together for ten years! Nor does Boss know Charlie's violent history, which included being a Civil War raider, and then a hired gun much like the ones now working for Baxter.  When Charlie falls in love with Sue (Annette Bening), the spinster sister of the local sawbones, his guilt over his rough-edged past is a self-imposed handicap that Sue, who sees Waite's inner goodness, must overcome.<p>Moviegoers accustomed to a steady diet of mindless, FX-laden action thrillers may find the first three-quarters of OPEN RANGE slow going. It's called &quot;character and plot development&quot;, an intelligent change of pace. And when the final shoot-out comes, it's perhaps the best ever filmed. While most such western confrontations seem like a choreographed ballet, this one shows them for what they were: relatively short, extremely violent, chaotic, and lacking in fancy gunplay and sharpshooting finesse. <p>Big Screen westerns are such a rarity nowadays that it's hard to compare this one with any other in recent memory. Though perhaps not as memorable as DANCES WITH WOLVES, this Old West morality play is certainly the best since UNFORGIVEN. Admittedly, we've seen similar plots before: the small homesteader/Big Ranching feud in the classic SHANE, and Big Mining vs. the small prospector in PALE RIDER, Clint Eastwood's transparent re-scripting of the former. However, the acting, cinematography and costuming of OPEN RANGE are excellent. Duvall surely deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination, and the production as a whole may merit a Best Picture nod. My only complaint lies with the editing, which left in one too many leave-takings between Charlie and Sue, the last being completely superfluous. That said, however, this is a five-star tribute to loyalty, rugged individualism, integrity, and simply doing what's right. I think, sometimes, that Hollywood has forgotten what those qualities are all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>For all the hits and misses he has had in front of and behind the camera, Kevin Costner never fails to put his money where his mouth is.  Such is the case with OPEN RANGE, which I hope will revive that most American of film genres, the Western.<p>Set in 1882, OPEN RANGE stars Costner and veteran Robert Duvall as cattlemen only trying to drive their cattle across the open prairie of Montana.  But they soon run afoul of a ruthless land baron (Michael Gambon) out to rid the land of free-grazers like Duvall and Costner; and to prove his point, Gambon has one of Duvall's men (Abraham Benrubi) killed and another (Diego Luna) seriously wounded.  The stage is set for a traditional but classic shoot-out to the finish.<p>If not on the epic level of Costner's 1990 Oscar-winner DANCES WITH WOLVES, or the standards set by people like Clint Eastwood, John Ford, Howard Hawks, or Sam Peckinpah, OPEN RANGE nevertheless demonstrates Costner's comfortability with the Western.  His is a determined performance, and his direction is equally fine, with stunning photography, done on location in southern Canada, and a fine Michael Kamen score.  Gambon is about as nasty a villain as there has been in any film in recent times, and James Russo does his natural evil best as a half-crazed town sheriff.  It is Duvall, a veteran of many westerns (TRUE GRIT; LAWMAN), however, who really shines, as is typical of this kind of caliber actor.  Always offering some wry advice but ready to take retaliation for having been wronged, Duvall is a tower of strength.  Annette Benning also does good work as the town doctor's sister, who also becomes Costner's love interest.<p>The Western genre has not run out of stories or ideas, and never will; it just needs people of integrity like Costner to keep it going.  OPEN RANGE proves that in spades.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>They don't westerns that much anymore, at least on the big screen. People in the Baby Boomer generation grew up with them on television. Western films were big at the box office in several decades, too. Well, at least Kevin Costner must have a heart for the genre as he been involved with several major western productions in the last 15 years, this the latest.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this film right out front is that it may be the best western I've ever watched. I can't give it higher praise than that! Since I've seen so many, for so long, it's especially high praise.<br /><br />I make this bold statement because of the following:<br /><br />1 - Fantastic scenery and beautiful cinematography. If it looks spectacular on my 24-inch flat-screen, I can't imagine how awesome it would be a big plasma set.<br /><br />2 - Characters you really care about, led by three actors who almost always give solid performances: Robert Duvall (the best in here), Costner and Annette Bening. Duvall, by the way, gives one of the best short "speeches" I've ever witnessed in a movie. It was nice to see Bening actually play a wholesome woman for a change. The two men who are out on the range with Duvall and Costner also were excellent.<br /><br />3 - Just the right amount of action. When the action does occur, such as gunfire, the sound is incredible. This might be one of the best movies, audibly-speaking, I've ever heard, which is another reason for ranking it Number One. There are no lulls but not a ton of action, either.<br /><br />4 - Just the right amount of romance. It doesn't get sappy, it doesn't overshadow the basic story, but it adds a nice, soft touch to what could be a very rough and unpleasant tale. And, in a different twist, it's the romance, not the usual climactic gun battle, that ends this film.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this movie except that I'm sorry more westerns like it aren't made today.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>&quot;Open Range&quot; is an incredibly poetic, simple, yet complex film that is extremely entertaining on all points.  It has probably been since the release of &quot;Unforgiven&quot; that I've watched a new western and enjoyed it this much!  Few films in today's era go so far as &quot;Open Range&quot; does as far as character and plot development, fearing that they would bore the audience to death which may well be true for many other films but it works perfectly in this exceptional movie, flawlessly building up the suspense for the ultimate conclusion of the film.<p>I would definitely have to say it has also been a long time since I've watched a film with Kevin Costner in it that I've enjoyed this much as well.  I wouldn't go so far as to say, with this one film, that he's back but this film makes a very good start at him showing the depth of his acting abilities once again.  The true star of this exceptional film is Robert Duvall.  He is a true star in all genres but he shines even brighter when it's time to don a role in a western movie.  Then there's Annette Bening, an actress of true beauty who has always been such a special influence on every film she takes up and with this role, she once again vividly displays why she is a film star.<p>Along with the starring role, Kevin Costner takes the nod for producing and more importantly, directing this intriguingly captivating movie.  I would have to say that of the movies he's directed so far that I've watched this was his best effort in the director's seat.<p>The Premise:<p>Welcome to the open range of America during the year of 1882.  This impressive film opens up to a beautiful vista of open grazing land and we're introduced to our primary characters in Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charlie (Kevin Costner) who are free grazers, which are cowboys who drive their herds on the open plains.  Along with them are two younger cowboys in Mose (Abraham Benrubit, &quot;ER) and Button (Diego Luna).  When they find they need some additional supplies, they send Mose back to the last town they came through and when a couple days go by without his return they decide that they must go back to find out what happened to him.  Not long after they arrive in the small western town they find that Mose had been in a fight and was brutally beaten despite having dished out some to his attackers as well.  They're warned away from the town by a local rancher who has the sheriff under his belt...<p>What follows from there is, for the better part, a melodramatic western with an exhilarating ending that is particularly captivating.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the western genre!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Audio Commentary with Kevin Costner<br />-&quot;America's Open Range&quot; A historical journey back in time to the real open range of the 1800s, narrated by Kevin Costner<br />-&quot;Beyond Open Range&quot; Director's Journal<br />-Deleted Scenes<br />-&quot;Storyboarding:  Open Range&quot;<br />-Music Video Montage</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>As an actor in westerns, Costner ranks up there with Clint Eastwood, slightly below the Duke, in my mind.  &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; forever earned him that title.  The acting in this film is great.  But when you boil it all down, it fits the genre of the Western so well that little is left to the imagination.  This is not a criticism.  This is not bad.  It only describes the film and predicts who will want to own it.<p>If you like westerns - add this film to your collection.<br />If you dislike westerns - skip this film.<p>If you don't care one way or the other about westerns, but do enjoy great films - rent this one.  It is certainly worth seeing, but don't run out and buy it.  It may just collect dust on your shelf.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is an outstanding film. Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall both give excellent character studies of a vanishing breed of men who seem to outlived their usefulness or so they think. This is another one of just a handful of great Westerns where good and bad, black and white cross lines. The pace of this film is slow and methodical but it builds to an outstanding climax full of bravado and emotion. I really loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This movie has alot of dream threads for me. I will just write them down so as to remember and to share. Green open range, Calgary, Happiness, stagecoaches in mud so thick you have to dig a day to get them out, cattle runs, cooking out with all the cowboy stuff, pots hanging from something over a fire, biscuits, tin plates, coffee with smoke still on it, playing cards, thunderstorms with a tarp over your head and talking, rustling up brekkie, clear streams filled with clean rocks and pebbles with horses drinking the best sparkling water in the world, like in the Talisman, old towns dusty with supplies, fun books to pick the things you want to buy, candy stores with old fashioned candy in big glass jars, bathhouses, stabling your horses with someone, tlc with someone who just loves you to pieces, cleans the wounds, listens to you, listens to your dreams, listens to your prayers, gives you warm broth and never leaves, old saloon with sassparilla, talking in the moonlite with intimate thoughts spilling out like stars, playing a fiddle and dancing a jig, flower gardens with all kinds of flowers everywhere, bees and birds and bugs, fyne china with teacups...Love</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner.

If you have the patience, however, the final rewards are many. The performances are uniformly good, with Costner, Duvall and Bening excellent as usual, and many fine supporting actor contributions, including Michael Gambon as the bad guy (Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series!)and Michael Jeter as a helpful townsman. It is fascinating to compare Costner's grizzled, disillusioned Civil War veteran here to the sparkling gunfighter he portrayed as a young man in "Silverado." The cinematography is glorious in this one, but the script wasn't quite tight enough to make this a masterpiece. The climax, however, is one of the best wild West gunfights I've ever seen, and at age 62, I've seen scores of them on screen. Give this movie's first 40 minutes the benefit of the doubt, and the final 100 minutes will reward you. As a bonus, Duvall rips off half-a-dozen hilarious lines, and a dozen wise ones, winning your heart and mind as an old cowhand who has learned life's lessons well.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Beautiful scenery - great acting -- Wonderful love story -- Commentary great for understanding the aim of the movie -- Let's have more of this kind instead of Hollywood smut!</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>This Movie review is predominantly about this 2-Disc DVD Collection Edition with a few editorial (personal observations) comments.<p>Kevin Costner's passion is truly in the American Western.

Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>The high points of this excellent film are simultaneously the stillness and simplicity of the Montana-like (Western Canada) background with again, the simplicity and strength of the dialogue. The two men, Costner as a Shane like character, traumatized by his past-trying to go 'straight' and Duvall, scarred also by a past who finds &quot;getting lost&quot; in the bigness of the late 19th century country comforting, work together like few actors can and do. Wryness, not one liners. Advice not mandates. A simple code of freedom and justice spoken in a cafe by Duvall, not Costner. <p>Costner, content to play second role to Duvall's experience in the role, and quite possibly in his skill as an actor.<p>Duvall is as good as he's ever been and Costner better than he's been in years.<p>Simple plot, right and wrong colliding a 100 years ago a 1000 miles from here. The love interest is a stabilizing factor, adding credence to what good men need, drawing out a painfully shy Charley (Costner) and the curmudgeon Boss (Duvall).<p>The best western in years, on par with The Unforgiven and Tombstone, perhaps better. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Open Range&quot; may be a fictional story, but the events that occurred within it were brutally honest depictions of what happened in the 1880's.  <p>The story moves along at a somewhat slow pace, but you have to remember that the pace is used to develop the characters and the storyline.  It also helps to enhance the believability of the story, e.g. the waiting for the killers, moving the herd across the plains, etc.  Costner's depiction of a violent man trying to shake off his past is perfect.  Once he slips his old skin back on, however, the cold-blooded intent with which he seeks out his enemies is played to perfection.  He becomes a killer.  Duvall's tough-as-nails &quot;Boss&quot; character is memorable as the older, wiser leader of the free-grazing group.  He becomes the level that keeps Costner from losing all control throughout the film.  The rest of the cast does a superb job.  Annette Bening deserves praise for the sheer looks of terror that cross her face in this film.  She surprised me in this one.<p>As it was with the characters, so it is with the action of the movie.  It's a very accurate depiction of a gunfight in the Old West.  When people shoot, they miss...often.  Even the heroes of the film miss their shots frequently.  In the late 1800's, guns still weren't up to par with today's standards.  Shooting at and missing someone from close proximity was the norm.  When a bullet did hit its mark, the target didn't always die instantly.  This is shown throughout the fight sequences in this film.  At times they are disturbing, which I believe is the whole point of such scenes in this movie.  You don't know if you should cheer for the good guys or have pity on the bad ones because of how violent the deaths in this film are.<p>Many people have called this a traditional Western.  If you mean traditional in the sense that it's just like a lot of other Western movies, you're partially right.  There are a lot of Westerns that depict the violent and psychological struggles of the late 1800's with precision, but there are many more that glamorize that time in our history.  Also, many of the stories we've heard are often based on the dimestore novels and &quot;half-truths&quot; that grew from that time.  This movie isn't like that.  It's as close to actuality as I've seen in a long time.  <p>In closing, this movie is brutally honest.  Don't watch it if you want to see one of those &quot;good guys in white hats&quot; dimestore movies.  Watch it if you want an honest, accurate depiction of events that could have happened in one of the most violent times in American history.  I higly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner has brought the simplicity of an old western movie into a new age and done a fantastic job, both as an actor and as director.<p>The storyline for this film is a bit bland and basic but the intensity of acting and the scenery make up for the lack of substance in the story. &quot;Open Range&quot; takes you into a real western setting where one could see for miles and miles only what God made and be humbled by it. The gunfight is fantastic and so much more than any found in the good old western movies. <p>Robert Duvall is perfect as Boss, an old grubby cowboy with heart. Opposite Duvall you would think Costner would pale in comparision but he fits in almost as perfectly as a man with a mystery past. Annette Bening is subtle in her role, as a doctor's sister, but no less important to the film as Costner and Duvall. But the most impressive character in this film is by far the western scenery and the reality of nature's wrath out in the open range of 1882.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>I remember an old John Wayne movie called &quot;Cowboys&quot;.  &quot;Open Range&quot; brought that same realistic approach to molding a movie around a Western format.  The movie couldn't have been titled better.  The incredible visual work in this movie alone make it a must see; not to mention the believable characters played by Duvall and Costner.<p>The only mistake this movie makes is trying to add more emotional dimensions to the main characters than is necessary to make the film flow.  This only happens towards the end of the film: Charley, suddenly concerned about Boss's real name, after riding with him for years.  Boss, suddenly concerned about good tasting chocolate and a storekeepers lack of finance to enjoy his own chocolate.<p>The action scenes are great, the acting is tight, and the storyline is well trimmed.  I think people will enjoy this film.<p>Click the &quot;buy&quot; button!

It is a tale of two very close friends one Waite (Costner) has been working for Spearman (Duvall).  The movie shows respect for your boss and the kind of trust needed when you are working closely together.<p>Duvall, a tough cowboy, also has a heart for his men and for his past.  Duvall shows his relentlessness to stand up for what is his.  He has no choice, all will be taken away from him, so he stands for his own.  Costner plays a tough cowboy with a past that comes back to help him and even haunt him at times.<p>It is a Western in the sense of the older westerns, beautiful scenery, Alberta, Canada.  The movie has the intensity of The Seekers.  It seems that the old western is back.<p>This movie does get violent and may not be for everyone, yet the gunfight scene is every bit as intense as a Clint Eastwood gunfight, yet it seems much more realistic, like the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Costner plays a much more serious and focused role.  Waite is intense in everything he does.  <p>These are two serious men with a very serious life and a very difficult job to do.  The movie is worth the watch, yet, some who dislike violence in movies may not like the gunfight, yet it is tolerable for the most part.  Open Range is a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>I'm not sure that Hollywood has a genius in the offing who can resurrect the Western from its 35 years of doldrums, but until one shows up I guess we could have a lot worse people to make do with than Kevin Costner.  He's got the feel for the genre, the interest, and perhaps he still has the pull to keep making the occasional film, though he can be a bit too enamored of the "epic" side of the genre for his own good.  With OPEN RANGE, his need for grandeur and mythologizing gets a bit in the way of what is really a pretty simple free rangers vs town cattle baron story that Anthony Mann and James Stewart would have gotten through in a nicely-paced 100 minutes, and Andre de Toth and Randolph Scott would have zipped through in 85, but Costner has to spread it out to 135 or so, mostly through lots of (admittedly pretty) landscape shots and portentous dialogue - which is mostly decent, but not always necessary. It's one of those films that doesn't really have a lot of whole scenes that you could cut, and that manages to maintain interest, but just feels in the end like too much of a good thing.<br /><br />That major caveat aside, OPEN RANGE is a pretty solid "classic" western that wouldn't have been otherwise out of place had it appeared on the marquees in 1957.  Robert Duvall and Costner star as Boss Spearman and Charlie Waite, respectively the owner in a cattle driving operation and his top hand, who have been together for a decade.  Spearman is expansive, almost garrulous, while Waite is generally quiet if not taciturn, and it won't come as any surprise to western lovers that he turns out to have something of a past - which will come into play when the two and the other members of their crew, bearish Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and teenage Mexican kid Button (Diego Luna) run afoul of the local power in the isolated town of Harmonville, an Irish rancher named Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) who owns most of the land roundabouts, the biggest saloon in town, and the local sheriff (James Russo).  Their only allies, it seems, in an oncoming fight against the might of the rancher's large crew, are the old stablemaster Percy (Michael Jeter in one of his last and best roles) and Sue (Annette Benning) the pretty assistant to the local doctor, a woman roughly Waite's age who fixes up both Mose and Button after run-ins with Baxter's men.<br /><br />There isn't anything terribly new or wildly innovative in OPEN RANGE - how many westerns made since 1920 or so can you say that about, anyway?  But it is nicely put together, and the fairly typical "end of the gunslinger" era is evoked well enough.  Waite is similar to an awful lot of ex-wildmen who are trying to make it in a new life, but find themselves drawn back to their violent days, and the film often seems to explicitly evoke Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN (especially in the mud and rain that dominate much of the middle of the film), though Waite unlike Eastwood's William Munny seems a little more likely to escape a lonely doom - and his partnership with Duvall's Boss is much more equal and lasting than Munny's was with anyone.  The tragic feeling of the Eastwood film is one element that's foreign to Costner's intentions, which are in the end at least a little bit optimistic.  The film is just as much about the different pulls of friendship, work, and love as it is about the frontier vs civilization motif, and one thing the leisurely running time does do is give it time to explore these ideas at some length.<br /><br />Duvall is just great as the grizzled and fatalistic-yet-cheerful Boss, and Costner is fine I guess though it's a little hard for me to ever buy him as a guy with a truly awful past - he just doesn't seem to carry that darkness well.  I really like the fact that Benning is roughly his own age, and she's not glamorized at all; she's an attractive, educated middle-aged woman who's just been unlucky, until Waite comes along.  That seems reasonable, in a small frontier town.  Craig Storper's excellent screenplay (based on a novel by Lauran Paine), full of quotable yet pretty realistic dialogue like the bit I used for my title, also deserves a lot of praise.  The final shootout, greatly extended though it might seem to be, is excellently done, and the coda makes sense I guess, even if it, like much of the rest of the film, seems to be reaching for some kind of grandeur that this fairly simple story can't entirely support.<br /><br />All in all, well worth seeing for western lovers.  Perhaps it doesn't hold up to the greatest films of the past, but then with so few westerns being made today, that would be an awful big weight to lay on the shoulders of the few people like Costner still interested in the genre.  Along with Ed Harris' APPALOOSA a few years later, this ought to show that there's still some life even on some of these well-trodden trails.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>i really don't like westerns that often but when i come across a good one i'll let people know about it and this is one of them.

They are cast as "open range" cattlemen.  They live outdoors and move their cattle from place to place.  They hate towns and townspeople hate them.  Naturally there is conflict.  And naturally the plot is predictable.<p> <p>Robert Duvall is the boss of the small group of men who work on the open range.  He's a fine actor and I've seen him do some incredible work in other films.  But there were moments here when his performance seemed actually wooden.  Kevin Costner does a somewhat better job.  He's a gunman who has "done some things I'm not very proud of" in the Civil war.  However, it was quite noticeable that he never mentioned what side he fought on.  Then there is Abraham Benrubi, who I recognized as playing Jerry, the large-size hospital clerk in "ER. He adds a tough of humanity and humor.  And then there is Diego Luna who plays a 16-year-old who the older men have taken under their wing.  Annette Bening is the female lead.  She looks pretty and has a gentle sophistication.  No wonder Kevin Costner falls in love.  Both of them are aging, and they make mention of it.  <p> <p>This is a film about bad guys and good guys.  There are lots of gunfights, but even though men fall down and die, the violence is of the old-fashioned movie variety and we don't see blood and guts.  Filmed in Canada, the scenery is nice and gives a feel of old west as we've seen it done over and over again.  Surprisingly, however, I wasn't bored.  Sometimes, I guess I'm just in the mood for a slow-moving predictable western.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's strange that at one point, it seemed Kevin Costner couldn't do any wrong. He was in 2 hit baseball movies with Bull Durham and Field of Dreams, one of my favorite films ever with JFK, the Academy Award-winning Dances With Wolves and a hit with Whitney Houston in the Bodyguard. But then came Waterworld and the Postman: some of the 90's most reviled movies. Now I haven't seen the Postman and what little I remember of Waterworld wasn't all that bad but the disdain people have over his career seems kind of unfair. Open Range seems like a good attempt at showing people he still has it and while it's not the greatest film he's done, it's certainly one of the better ones he's done recently.<br /><br />4 free range cattle grazers, Charley, Boss, Mose and Button find themselves the target of a greedy rancher named Baxter who is more interested in having property he can see to cattle raisers rather than letting them go as they please. Charley and Boss find one of their own dead and the other barely alive and so they find help in a doctor and his sister and a mind for vengeance. In the end, it's 2 guys against Baxter, his corrupt sheriff lackey Poole and a host of hired gunmen.<br /><br />I remember watching an older movie which was a little over 3 hours and that was just the theatrical cut. Well-known western director Sergio Leone also loved to have long films to build pacing, suspense and character development. Lately though, film goers are either ADD-influenced or they're just more used to shorter films (like me). It's not that Open Range is a dull and boring movie, it's just one where shaving off a good 15 minutes would've made it excellent. After what's probably one of the more intense and awesome showdown gunfights, the film still keeps going so while it is a nice pace from just ending the movie right there, it does drag it a bit.<br /><br />Acting-wise it's pretty straight across the board. Robert Duvall is excellent, Costner is not as bad as you think he is and what little screen time he's given, Diego Luna of Y Tu Mama Tambien fame manages to be memorable without being one of those annoying brats. Shortchanged a little bit is Annette Bening who's either given too little to do or just not enough scenes to be in. The one thing about the film is there's a weird detachment with the characters where I almost didn't quite sympathize with everything. The story was fine but it just didn't have an emotional anchor but maybe it's just me.<br /><br />Is it a good western? Sure, the cinematography's great, the final gunfight's kickass and the acting is great but will this beat new favorites like Unforgiven or oldies like Once Upon a Time in the West? Doubt it. But this is no Postman blunder but then again it's no Dances With Wolves. It's kind of in-between...a sort of Dances With the Postman if you will. Just kidding.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner got everything with his first movie as director, lost it when he made the second, and then managed to regain it with the third, 'Open Range' which is not perfect, but still very involving film.  And that's a proof that Western movies are not dead yet.<br /><br />One good and sensible choice he made is that he top-billed Robert Duvall.  This always reliable veteran plays Boss, the leader of free-grazing group that includes his partner Charlie (Kevin Costner), big and kind-hearted Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and young and untamed Button (Diedo Luna).  They lead the life of free-spirited cowboy, grazing the cattle in the open range.<br /><br />But some people don't like these 'free grazers,' and the ruthless rancher Baxter (Michael Gambon, totally different from his turn in 'Harry Potter') is one of them.  When one of the cowboys fails to come back, and is found beaten up heavily in jail, Baxter makes it clear that Boss and his men are unwanted guest in town.  His town.<br /><br />The story goes like this, involving a female Sue (Annette Benning) as possible love interest, which I found perhaps unnecessary.  Ms. Benning is good, and the love is convincing, but I think the film streaches its premise too much.  Still,  the 2h20m film goes very smoothly with few let ups, until the final gun fight sequence which is one of the virtures of the film.<br /><br />There are three good things in 'Open Range'; One, great location of Canada, which is so beautiful and at the same time awe-inspiring as the snow-capped mountains show.  And in here, the rain could kill you.  Two, great acting, unianimously, but especially Robert Duvall, who could tell you everything about the character he plays only by standing.  Three, great gun fight, which is as fierce as any in the past, and retains authentic feeling.  In this film, when you shoot, you miss a lot.  Sometimes shooting looks awfully uncool, crouching under the objects or desperately firing the gun without hitting.  And perhaps that was what happened in many gun fights in the real history.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is always successful when he does Western, from the time of 'Silverado.'  And 'Untouchables' was a kind of Western in a modern, urban setting.  Even 'Wyatt Earp' was not all bad, though all too long.  Instead of the terrible '3000 Miles to Graceland,' he should do more of this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner's 2003 western starring himself and Robert Duvall as two open range cowboys who cross paths with a closed-field town. The town's cattle baron doesn't want the land trampled by free-ranging Texas longhorns and, without surprise, uses the local sheriff to do his dirty work. A love interest also arises and our protagonists refuse to leave until all scores are settled.<br /><br />  Although decently acted and directed, the story itself is nothing more than the generic western script: good cowboys vs. bad cowboys; the corrupt town sheriff and his posse; the damsel in distress being harassed by the antagonists. Such plots and themes were antiquated even before John Wayne and 'Stagecoach'. Robert Duvall is simply replaying the role he performed so well in the mini-series 'Lonesome Dove' while Costner does a rehash of his Wyatt Earp or 'Dances with Wolves' character. The film does have a good shootout scene near the end to complete the climax of the film but that's about it.<br /><br />  A good movie to rent but not terribly original. You probably would get more of your money's worth in buying westerns such as Sergio Leone's 'spaghetti' films, Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch', or Clint Eastwood westerns such as 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>I am not a Kevin Costner fan by any means, but his good movies are really good.  He gets it right when he gets out of the way of the characters and doesn't try to show us how wonderful he is.  Dances With Wolves was great, Bull Durham was outstanding, Field of Dreams was near perfect, and I even loved American Flyers, about him as a bicycle racer.  His bad movies stink to high heaven--Waterworld, Wyatt Earp, The Postman, For Love of the Game, because they are all about him, not the story or the characters.<p>Now we have Open Range, a great story about a group of &quot;Free grazers&quot;, men who live off the land with their cattle, but don't pay for any of it, they have no ties to a town.  It is the time when the big ranchers are taking over, and free grazing is looked down upon harshly, even though it is technically still legal behavior.  While grazing in a particular area, they realize they are missing some supplies, and they send one man back to the town.  When he doesn't return, the two main men in the group, Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charly (Costner) go to the town to see what happened.<p>Their friend was provoked into a fight, defended himself, and was now in jail.  The problem?  The sherriff and a rancher hate him for being a free grazer and set him up.  This sets up the story, where the men stay in the area to fight the sherriff and the rancher and stand up for their rights.  There is even time for Charly to fall in love with the doctor's sister (Annette Bening) before the final showdown.  The final gunfight is really good, mainly because it is so realistic.  This is how you would imagine a gunfight taking place.  Nothing glamorous, just reality.<p>This movie succeeds because the story is a good one, and the characters are people we care about.  Boss and Charly are good men, simple, but they play by the rules and they expect others to do the same.  They are loyal to each other, even though they have not had the time to learn much basic information about each other, like what Boss's first name is.  (wait until you hear what it is).  This is a slow paced, enjoyable western, not action packed, but interesting and something new, which is not something you can say about many movies coming out these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>&quot;Open Range&quot; proves that there is still an audience to be found for the western. The film is a beautifully-shot, character driven film that puts less emphasis on visual effects and loads of action and focuses on a great story: that of two men forced to defend their property and their lives in a small western town! Robert Duvall is one of America's greatest actors, and proves it again in this film. Costner is highly underrated as an actor, and his performance here is of his finest. Annette Benning gives a great performance as well. The gunfight at the end of the film is one of the grittiest and most exciting sequences ever filmed! If you're ready to experience a &quot;true&quot; western epic, then saddle up for &quot;Open Range!&quot; Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Buoyed by what I had read and heard about this movie from critics, pundits, and TV talking heads, I couldn't wait to see the latest "Great Western."  The minute OPEN RANGE hit the cinema in my little corner of the prairie, I was there, waiting to soak up everything from the cow chips to the gunsmoke.<p>What a disappointment.  Instead of being entertained, I sat through 150 minutes of a cliched, tired, and ultimately boring story--a story as slow as molasses in the winter time.  Equally frustrating was the film's complete lack of originality, as it plucked plots from "Unforgiven," "High Noon," "Pale Rider," "Tombstone," and a host of other Westerns.  If this film was a dog (and it was), it would be the biggest mongrel in the pound.<p>Kevin Costner mopes and mutters through his role as an open range cowpuncher with a troubled past, while Robert Duvall more or less revives the character of Augustus McCrae from "Lonesome Dove."  The climactic "gunfight"--while impressive--is over the top, and requires a titanic suspension of disbelief.  And I'm still trying to figure out Annette Bening's role in this movie.  In fact, I'm still trying to figure out why I didn't get up and leave the theater.  Had to be the buttered popcorn.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>I can't say that I'm much of a fan of Westerns.  I always thought Clint and Sergio's "Spaghetti Westerns" were kind of boring.  But I did enjoy "Dances With Wolves" and thought I should give this other Costner-helmed western a try.  The plot: Charley (Costner) and "Boss" (Robert Duvall) lead a set of 4 free-range cattlemen (and their dog) across the Prairie.  Because it's getting late in the day for the "old west," the land-owning big ranchers are starting to take over and they see the free-rangers as stealing their pasture (or, at least, their profits).  Boss and Charley cross paths with an especially rancourous rancher, which results in the death of one of Boss's men.<br /><br />At this point, it's difficult to describe the rest of the plot because it follows so naturally from the characters of Boss and Charley.  That they vow to get "justice" (not "revenge") on the rancher goes without saying.  The rest of the film exists as a storm brewing, building up to the final confrontation between the ranchers and Boss/Charley.  Added into the mix is the local doctor and his sister (who Charley develops feelings for).  The doctor is an interesting character, as he exists above (or perhaps outside) the heirarchy of the town - the marshall and the ranchers don't dare threaten him (not with death, anyways, as they would in a lesser film) because he is vital to the community.  Similarly, Charley and Boss know they can use his services.<br /><br />Although the gunfight is fairly standard, it is well-filmed (as is the movie in general) and maintains the viewer's interest.  The key to the film is, of course, the relationship between Boss and Charley, and it is one of the most convincing "buddy" relationships on film.  Unfortunately, there is a very unsatisfying denouement to the love story, and the end of the film drags on 15 minutes longer than needed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>While Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall put on workmanlike acting jobs, OPEN RANGE is talky and too long. About an hour of this film should have been left on the cutting room floor. The action scenes are pretty good with the climatic action scene resembling the gunfight at OK Corral. But that scene, too, went on too long. The motivation of the ill-tempered cattleman villain is strained, the script not really justifying his over-the-top homicidal ways. We know he doesn't like "open grazers" but why does he have to be so murderous? And the idea of open grazing seems to be contrary to the idea of property rights, which leaves me cold rooting for Costner and Duvall who want to graze-out private land and move on to other spots with their herd. We are supposed to get all teary-eyed and hacked at the villains for shooting up a dog, and a kid and a child-like oaf who work for Costner and Duvall but that is too obvious manipulation to justify shooting men who are defending their grazing land and economic livelihood, albeit in a violent way. But, then, we know that some Hollywood elements would do away with private property. And why is it that the bad guys can hardly ever shoot straight except at dogs, kids and big oafs? Never can figure that out. However, it's good to see Duvall, the perfect cowboy actor, on screen even when the script has him asking the moody Costner about his emotional "history", a modern psychological term no cowpoke in 1889 would ever have uttered. The scenery is pretty and the costumes are good but Kevin should have taken the part of Bill in KILL BILL he was offered instead of making this indulgence. Two slow-draw stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2 Call me a contrarian, if you like, but, for some strange reason, I have always found myself more favorably disposed towards Kevin Costner's "failures" as a director (i.e. "Waterworld" and "The Postman") than towards his respectable, highly acclaimed "successes" ("Dances With Wolves" and his new film "Open Range").  Those former films may have been bloated, overlong and over-budgeted vanity productions, it's true, but at least with each of them, the director was willing to take a number of chances.  His westerns have been bloated and overlong, too, but they've lacked the kind of risk-taking spirit that allows us to forgive some of the filmmaker's trademark excesses and indulgences.<p>"Open Range," for all its high-minded seriousness, is a pretty tedious affair - undramatic, longwinded and plodding.  The screenplay by Craig Storper, based on the novel by Lauran Paine, is the oldie about the "freegrazers" who come into conflict with the settled ranchers who don't like the fact that these rootless steer drivers are trespassing on "their" land.  It's 1882 and, apparently, most of the once-unclaimed Far West territory has been parceled out to the highest bidder leaving little open range for the free-spirited cattlemen.  Costner and three of his freegrazing buddies find themselves in a deadly feud with the leaders of a nearby prairie town.<p>It's a stale story that culminates in a thunderous, but surprisingly unconvincing Main Street shootout (unconvincing not because the violence is unrealistic or poorly staged - it's quite well done in fact - but because some of the characters behave in ways that defy any credibility whatsoever).  Something decent might have been made out of this material had Storper and Costner not turned it into a soporific snorer with endless dialogue, minimal action and a crushing air of reverential self-importance.  Robert Duvall gives a finely etched performance as the grizzled old cowpoke who appears all tough and gruff on the surface but who is just a big old softie underneath all the leathery skin and bristly whiskers.  Even though the character itself is little more than a hoary clich&eacute;, Duvall makes the most of his opportunities.  Costner does well within his more limited acting range, but his character is even less well developed than Duvall's.  Annette Bening is stoic and valiant as the requisite love interest for Costner, but poor Diego Luna ("Y Tu Mama Tambien," "Frida") is wasted in a nothing role as the young sidekick who ends up spending most of the movie either unconscious or laid up in bed recovering from a gunshot wound suffered early on.<p>As a director, Costner generates a fairly impressive feel for the immensity of the plains and for the part weather plays in the lives of those who live there, but these alone are not enough to sustain our interest over the duration of a two hour and eighteen minute movie.  Even the attempts at humor ring hollow and untrue. <p>"Open Range" may be more of a "success" with critics and audiences than were "Waterworld" and "The Postman," but that, given Costner's rather strange track record, may be less of a good thing than it would appear at first sight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>I was kind of looking forward to this because I am a HUGE western fan and I loved Wyatt Earp and Silverado (other westerns featuring Kevin Costner.)  But the film is too slow...Painfully so in fact and it doesn't have much in the way of action.  The performances are all pretty weak accept for Annette Bening who is strong in everything I have seen her in.  The score is okay...I think it must have been Michael Kamen's last one 'cuz he died this past year I believe.  Gets two stars from me for a halfway decent shootout towards the end.  I don't mind slow or leisurely paced films in general; especially in the western arena but I at least want them to have a point...In my mind this one didn't at all.  It was almost like it was just there to be there...Like a low budget Steven Seagal movie ripping off Lonesome Dove.  That's kind of what this felt like.  Duvall seems to be going through the motions in this and Michael Gambon is a weak villain who never had a complete hold of his Irish accent. Costner is best in this film when he is shooting of his six shooters.  This film upsets me because it is bad movies like this one that keep good westerns from being made.  Give me an Eastwood or Sergio Leone film over this crapola any day.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>"Open Range", Kevin Costner's earnest paean to the Old West, is a movie that is so desperately crying out to be regarded as a Great Western Epic, so incessant in cinematically yelling "Look at me! Look at me!", so unwilling to trust the audience, that I was surprised Costner didn't include a little blonde kid yelling "Shane! Come back, Shane!" at the end of this indulgent, ponderous, plodding snorefest.<br /><br />Costner's heart is obviously in the right place, and it's evident that he intended "Open Range" as a salute to the great classic western movies and as a memorial to the passing of the Old West.<br /><br />But Costner should know by now that the best movie cowboys are laconic, silent, drifting types who shoot the bad guy and gallop into the sunset---not self-conscious weepy fellows who break into full-bore confession mode at the drop of a ten-gallon hat.<br /><br />Be warned: this is not your father's Western, this is Oprah's Western. Costner has used "Open Range" as an expansive pallette by which he has, subversively and possibly unwittingly, taken the traditional Old West tale and turned the entire genre on its head, with an insidious result.<br /><br />With that in mind, let's ride out, pardners:<br /><br />THE BASICS: Boss Spearman (played nicely by Robert Duvall) and his partner Charlie Waite (Kevin Costner, who, much like Woody Allen, enjoys directing himself) are cowboys who herd cattle and horses across the prairie. They are 'Open Rangers', men who let their livestock graze anywhere and don't pay for the privilege.<br /><br />This doesn't sit well with town magnate Denton Baxter (played with scene-chewing fury by Michael Gambon), who uses his toadies and henchmen to terrorize Spearman's team, killing one man, wounding another, and even shooting their dog. Someone's gotta pay!<br /><br />THE GOOD: Costner likes his Western settings, and for the most part he has a great eye for the exteriors, the landscapes: relatively new cinematographer Jimmy Muro captures some stellar long-shots of the high prairie that echoes the mindscape of its free-grazing wanderers. When "Open Range" works, it works in spades: the casual, friendly banter between the Open Rangers comes off as completely authentic, though I was sad we didn't get more of Abraham Benrubi(Mose), who reminded me of Dan Blocker's "Hoss" from 'Bonanza'.<br /><br />Robert Duvall's Boss Spearman is a fine, grizzled, well-developed character, and at this point in his career Duvall could act in his sleep. Costner is competent but, oddly, sleepwalks through his role, and talks to love-interest Annette Bening like he had just gotten off the confessional talk-show circuit. The gunfight woke me up, and was surprisingly visceral, realistic, and shocking.<br /><br />Gambon does a fine job as the Irish town boss and manages to out-Albert Finney Albert Finney. It's nice to know we'll be seeing more of him as Dumbledore in the "Harry Potter" series. And it's always nice to see more of the incomparable Michael Jeter (who plays the film's puckish hostler Percy), who died shortly after the film completed shooting.<br /><br />THE BAD: At just under three hours, the film is sleep-inducing. This is a good movie if you need to quickly excuse yourself: you can leave, go to the bathroom, get some popcorn, and come back without having missed much more than interminable dialogue. "Open Range" needed to say less, and do more.<br /><br />Annette Bening is competent and struggles with the thankless role she's given, though her character, and the ensuing romance with Costner, is completely unbelievable. Let's see---Bening's Sue Barlow has medical training, is a pretty woman, and lives in a fine house, and yet she has to apologize for being "too old" to woo Costner, a stinky drifter with violent hallucinations and no aim in life?<br /><br />THE UGLY: Apart from its snore-inducing pacing, "Open Range" manages to turn the Western on its head. When you think of good westerns (from Peckinpah to Ford to Huston to Eastwood), you get the loner, the individual whose integrity and fighting spirit propel him to avenge injustice and evil against nearly insurmountable odds.<br /><br />But "Open Range" is about four guys who graze their horses on someone else's property, which to my mind is illegal and shiftless. They get in trouble with the law, and come to town to settle a score.<br /><br />But wait---unlike Gary Cooper's lonesome sheriff in "High Noon", Costner and Duvall have plenty of allies, and have what feels like an hour to set up an ambush for the 'bad guys'---heck, they even have time to eat chocolate, chat up the townsfolk, and smoke cigars before the final confrontation!<br /><br />Worse yet, after Costner strides into the midst of the understandably panicked bad guys, sixguns blazing, the rest of the town gets in on the act (why?), chasing Gambon's henchmen around and executing them like Czarists in the 1916 Russian Revolution.<br /><br />As a result, Costner and Duvall and their allies actually *outnumber* the ostensible villains, which scuttles any suspense and is also pretty repulsive; far from being sympathetic, the fickle and vengeful townsfolk are some of the most horrifying creatures ever to appear in a western.<br /><br />MORAL OF THE STORY: If a cowboy strides up to you, gun in hand, and growls "are you the one who killed our friend", and you intend to smile and say 'yes'---well, be damned certain you have your six-shooter out.<br /><br />With a good editor and about an hour cut from the film, "Open Range" would have been a tight and fairly focused film. As it is, the movie is poorly paced and boring. Circle your wagons and spend some quality time with a classic, like "Unforgiven" or "High Plains Drifter", instead.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/AR2DE47VCY1C8.html">AR2DE47VCY1C8</a><br/><p><p><br />I come from a long line of Westerners, and for &quot;that's really the way it was,&quot; I think the Culpepper Cattle Company beats them all.  Lonesome Dove is high on my list, too.  Open Range is right up there in that company.  There were a couple others, where you got the idea that the writer might actually have been West of the Mississippi at some time in his life for a day or two.<p><p>The thing I liked about this one is that it brought back memories of many old Western towns I've been in, with dirt streets that became mud in a rain, plank sidewalks and a feeling that seemed genuine.  Of course, I'm 75 and my grandmother came West on the Oregon Trail.<p><p>There were no heroics involving fast draws, with two guys facing each other in the middle of the street, twitching their butts and waiting for the other guy to make their move and all the rest of the Hollywood nonsense.  And the firearms:  they actually showed Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) carrying a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3, instead of a Colt.<p><p>For a rundown on the plot, read Joe Haschka's review.  It's right on the money.  But, it's refreshing to me to see a somewhat reasonable portrayal of the late nineteenth century West.  I get so tired of Hollywood's version of the West, sometimes.  When they show the unending violence of the &quot;Wild West,&quot; people tend to believe it was like that.  In actual fact, the Eastern cities were far more violent than the West ever was, with their gangs of thugs like the &quot;Bowery Boys,&quot; the mixed races and nationalities hating each other, and the political corruption.  Compared to the East, the West was tame!<p><p>But, they have to have violence to make a story--at least Hollywood clearly thinks so.  How long has it been since you saw a movie without gunplay (and all the actors claim to hate guns)<br />or auto chases that appear to endanger everyone in sight?<p><p>Costner not only acted in this one, he directed it as well, and of course turned in a superlative performance, as did the old pro Duvall.  I really enjoyed this movie.<p><p>Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books<p></p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner certainly has a way with a camera, offering up some of the most memorable cinematography of the American West since his classic "Dances With Wolves" in this stirring tale of the fateful changes sweeping over the range with coming of greater population and the need to share the range with others. Indeed, one often has the sense that Costner would rather tool away all the time he has on sweeping vistas and incredible sunsets than on character development. Still, this movie reminds one very much of Steve McQueen's elegant performance in "Tom Horn" in its portrayal of men caught in changes they neither appreciate nor understand on either side of the cultural divide between warring factions in this sometimes terrific movie.  It also recalls other memorable movies such as "Pale Rider" and even "Shane" in its depiction of a reluctant bad man forced by dint of circumstance to strap on his gun just one more time. <p>The cast is all superb, from Costner, as a man with a violent past who is left with little choice but to ply his trade in murder and mayhem to protect all he values, to Robert Duvall, as his struggling trail boss, to Annette Benning as the love interest for Costner's character. Michael Gambon camps it up as the sleazy bad guy doomed to face Costner's eventual rage, and the posse of range warriors he has in tow is also quite formidable and suitably doomed for destruction. The story is quite predictable, the issues over the range war are fairly well developed, and we all know that while Costner and Duvall are battling against the future, we understand they will lose the battle and then gracefully surrender to the forces of modernity over time. This is another terrific western, along the lines of "Unforgiven" and a number of the others mentioned above, and this one is certainly worth a gander. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner knows a thing or two about westerns and he proved it early in his career in "Silverado", then later as a director in "Dances with Wolves".  In "Open Range" he makes a smart move pairing himself opposite Robert Duvall who wisely reincarnates his performance as Augustus McRae from "Lonesome Dove".  There is no one of his generation who acts as well beneath a cowboy hat, and the movie would have been weaker with any other casting choice.<br /><br />There is much made of the Western as an art form.  The "Classic American Western" has reached as far as Italy and Japan with Sergio Leone and Kurosawa making films clearly imprinted with the stamp of John Ford.  It's difficult to say why the Western is so enduring, or at least so revivable, but I have a theory. There's something about a couple of adversaries facing each other out in a dusty street where frontier justice can be dispensed with a Colt revolver.  The genre is replete with examples (High Noon, Unforgiven, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and I'll stop there since I'm using up space, but you get the idea...) Anyway, Costner understands it too, and this movie tells a good tale while staying true to the form of the genre. It trots out a good half-dozen western cliche's such as the greedy cattle baron who doesn't wan't any stinkin' free-rangers out on his prairie.  It's hard to not like a movie that pays such tribute to the giants that preceded it, and does it so well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>This is a great story about good old fashioned American Ideals of right and wrong. Of course in a western there is ultimately one way to resolve differences. While the bad guy might be kind of one dimensional, Duval and Costner's characters are as good as westerns get. If you like westerns, you will be glad you watched this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>While I was watching &quot;Open Range&quot; I was thinking back on the epic westerns of John Ford, shot in Monument Valley, Utah, where the rugged beauty of the scenery gave a sense of grandeur to the spectacle of John Wayne riding a horse.  As a director of Westerns Kevin Costner certainly proved he had an eye for visual spectacle in &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; (the buffalo hunt is the obvious example, but there are others).  However, in &quot;Open Range,&quot; the monumental spectacle is clearly Robert Duvall, who plays Boss Spearman.  The quintessential cowboy, Spearman is moving a herd of free-range cattle.  For the better part of ten years (&quot;they call it a decade&quot; Boss points out), Charley Waite (Costner) has been riding with him.  Rounding out the company are Mose (Abraham Benrubi), a gentle giant, and Button (Diego Luna), a young boy that they are trying to turn into a man.<p>Westerns are often about a clash between the past and the future, and in &quot;Open Range&quot; it is Spearman and grazing cattle on the free range that comes into conflict with men like Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) with his giant spread.  When Mose is sent into town and does not return, Boss and Charley set off in search of him and find him badly beaten up in the jail of the local sheriff (James Russo), who is in Baxter's pocket.  Baxter lays down the law of the land (his land, his law), while riles Boss, who does not like anybody telling him how to live his life.  Knowing what is coming from the hooded figures that are watching a few hills over, Boss tries to head off trouble, but with horrible success.  Now Boss wants justice and Charley wants vengeance.<p>&quot;Open Range&quot; is really about the relationship between these two men, who are no longer boss and employee, but two men who share a common set of standards that dictate what you are supposed to do in the series of escalating situations in which they find themselves as this film plays out.  Charley takes a liking to Sue Barlow (Annette Bening), the sister of the town's doctor, and while their awkward courtship has its tender moments it is secondary to what exists between Charley and Boss.  In another film the romance between Sue and Charley could have sustained an entire film; here it is only a substantial subplot.<p>This is very much Duvall's film until the shooting, which consists of what are probably the loudest gunshots in the history of Westerns, starts.  Duvall's most memorable performance was as Gus McRae in &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; but his Boss Spearman compares favorably to that epic role.  The biggest thing they have in common is their embodiment of the values by which they have lived their lives and dictate their actions.  Boss and Charley both do what a man has to do, not because of some macho notion of manhood, but because they have a frontier philosophy that clearly establishes what is right and what is wrong.<p>However, there are key differences between Boss and Charley that this gunfight brings out into the open.  Charley has been trying to bury his past and to be more like Boss, but the task at hand involves killing and it turns out Charley knows a whole lot more about that line of work than he has let on.  This is not to say that Charley is a great shot, but that he is going to shoot first and keep his head once the shooting starts (this is a Western where most of the shots fired do not hit anybody).  This film is more about character than gun fighting, which may well be why it puts off the gunfight as long as possible.  <p>Ultimately, &quot;Open Range&quot; is a notch below being a great western, but in terms of contemporary cinema that makes it pretty good.  The film does not suffer that much in comparison to &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Dances With Wolves,&quot; or &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; and it comes off a lot better than any other westerns of recent vintage you would care to name.  For that matter, Costner's performance stands up well against Duvall's, and you get the sense that as an actor Costner is moving on to the next level, with his co-star showing him how it is done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>In the same league as Red River or High Noon, Open Range ranks along with the list of all time great westerns. <p>Duvall gives an exceptional performance as a weathered cowboy and good 'ol boy who is put to the test by unscrupulous ranchers bent on crushing him, his partner (Costner) and his herd of cattle. Annette Bening gives a credible performance as nurse/assistant to her brother, the town's only Doctor whose practice has become brisk since our two heroes have arrived.<p>But the movie belongs to Costner who, above all, pulls in a notably controlled performance -- a good earthy presence in the style we have become accustomed to by now. His direction is quietly superb, the visuals stunning, and the score haunting. Gunfights are refreshingly convincing and well staged. I am pretty sure there'll be academy nominations for Duvall's supporting cast, and for Costner's direction.<p>Recommended weekend fare!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>Open Range<p>There's just something about a good old-fashioned Western.  The standard formula never really gets old:  underdog good guys vs powerful landowner bad guys, a righteous cause, and a showdown on main street.  Add a dose of rugged individualism and a lovely lady to stir things up a bit, and you have the makings of a classic American story.<p>The things about Open Range that differ from past Westerns are in the silent details.  The first thing that impressed me was the stunning cinematography of our unspoiled American landscape.  I don't know if it's because of improved moviemaking technology or not, but OR just looks much more beautiful than any other film of its type.  Perhaps the location scouts have gotten more sophisticated in recent years - or more daring.  We are treated to some views of the West that depart from the traditional deserts, canyons and prairies;  raw mountainsides, green foothills, semi-forested valleys, etc. that were common sights back in the days of the cattle runs.  Another new aspect of OR is in the way the cowboys' everyday existence is portrayed in all its gritty hardness.  Little things like how they makeshifted shelters out in a downpour, the numbing cold at night, what tasks and drudgeries made up their in-between times, and the gruff camaraderie between them lends an intimate sense of the actual times and pace of life for cowhands back in the 1800s.  Life was at once a struggle and a precious thing, and we are not spared the starkness of it all in this movie.<p>While I'm mentioning departures from tradition, I'd like to congratulate the makers of this film for choosing some leads that don't fit the cookie-cutter 20 something image of most heroes and heroines.  Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening play level-headed, mature people that have experienced enough of life to know how not to waste it.  Yes, there's a romantic subplot between Costner and Bening, neither of whom are any less sexy for being past their 30s.  Of course, Duvall is talilor-made for the role of the toughened, cynical older cowboy that has become Costner's mentor and best friend.  <p>There is some uneven pacing in this film that would put off some people who might be expecting the sort of action-packed rollercoaster rides that made up the last decade's few Western films.  See this film instead for its honesty and fascination with another century's way of life, and you will get some action as a bonus along the way.  And, if at all possible, see this movie on a very large screen for the maximum visual effect it has to offer.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>In general, when I watch a Kevin Costner film, I root for the bad guys that wish to do him ill.  Once in a while, one of the wooden actor's films temporarily changes my mind:  "The Untouchables" and "Dances with Wolves," for instance.  "Open Range" had me cheering for the Costner character, Charlie, in part because he is allied with the almost always satisfying Robert Duvall and in part because one scene in the film delighted me in a way I thought today's American movies could not.  It happens late in the film, during the obligatory exchange of unpleasantries that precedes the obligatory shootout.  I don't want to spoil things too much, but suffice it to say taciturn Charlie dispatches the local gleeful sadist with precisely correct and swift Old West justice and redeems himself from some rather boneheaded decisions earlier.  What follows is one of the better shootouts in recent years, a crackling melee whose inspiration is more "High Noon" than "Gunfight at the OK Corral."  That said, "Open Range" suffers from the typical flaws of modern filmmaking, such as a first half that confuses having people do things with having people do things that are interesting.  It's clear that Costner's understanding of the genre isn't as complete as, say, Clint Eastwood's, even if the pacing here mimics that of "Unforgiven," and he manages to get what is at best an adequate performance out of Annette Benning.  Michael Gambon, as the Irish brute who lords over the town, is sufficiently vile, if cliched; he practically froths at the mouth, his sneering brogue a constant reminder he ain't from around these parts, and despite the fact I couldn't get past Duvall calling the late Michael Jeter "Old Timer" when the latter looks 15 years younger, I found Jeter's performance as a friendly stable owner rich.  Duvall, it should be noted, seems to be playing pretty much the same character he has since "Lonesome Dove" (if not "Tender Mercies"), and it's a good thing he owns it, as it is simply delightful to see him bring to life a guy you wouldn't mind living next door to or working with.  While "Open Range" vaccilates between upholding the mythology of the Old West and skewering it, Costner's performance and direction are fairly solid, if not quite as sure-handed as in "Dances with Wolves."  There are even a few moments of clever subtlety, as in the obligatory male bonding moment, where Charlie inquires about his boss's first name; it's intimated from an earlier scene that beyond solidifying friendship, this is precisely the sort of information that might be needed on a tombstone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Two veteran free-range cattlemen (Kevin Costner and the incomparable Robert Duvall) must enter hostile territory to get medical attention for the wounded boy who works for them (Diego Luna).

This is a classic Western in which the two protagonists are compelled by their moral code to face danger instead of retreating from it.  Costner and Duvall have magnificent chemistry in this film--Duvall as the moral conscience of the pair, and Costner as the former killer who is haunted by his past and longs to be able to see himself as a good man.  Although director Costner has had a somewhat checkered career, he demonstrates here that he is a man with true talent.  The final gunfight is a real highlight and not to be missed./</p></br><a href="../users/A2U0DKQPZSD50Y.html">A2U0DKQPZSD50Y</a><br/><p>this was the first western I have ever really watched and I loved it. The gunfight was amazing. Costner and Duval are great actors and they made this movie even better. I would recomend this movie to everyone even to people who are not into westerns</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Although Open Range isn't the best western I've seen it's still a well made one. The shoot-outs are intense and the scenery is beautiful. Kevin Costner who had shots of himself in pretty much every scene of the Postman shows less ego here. In Open Range it's Robert Duvall who actually gets all the close-ups and good lines. This movie is totally his and Costner seemed to have known that from the start. I mean he pretty much just sits back and lets himself be Duvall's side-kick although he directed the film. He's still good in the movie though. He plays a guy with a dark past who's trying to be a better man. <p>  Costner hits all the right notes as playing that type character here. Some say he's a dull actor but he's just laid-back. He showed me with 3000 Miles to Graceland that he can not only give a fun performance but that he can steal the show if he to as well.  I think he's more engaging when he plays these quiet and hard to figure out guys though, yes even in WaterWorld. Although Duvall steals the show, him and Costner make a great team and Costner proves he's worthy of sharing the same screen as him at least. <p>  Annette Benning who's a fine actress isn't really at her best here though. I guess it's because he part is the least enagining. I mean when 2 friends of Costner and Duvall get wounded she's just there to patch them up. I guess that it's hard to give a women a good role in western though, even one as talented as Benning. Anyway I still liked the movie a lot. It's not up there with Unforgiven, Dances with Wolves or Tombstone but it's still very good. It's Costner's best directed movie since Dances with Wolves.</p></br></body></html>

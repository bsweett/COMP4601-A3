Following a pattern even more impressive than the recent Saw films phenomenon, there was one new Jason film every year for an entire decade, skipping only a single year between Friday the 13th Part VI (1986) and Part VII (1988). None of the ideas in the film are all that unique, the music is a laughable cross between Psycho and Jaws, and the acting and dialogue are positively pathetic. Of course, the reason for watching such a horror movie is for the suspense, violence, nudity, gore and ultimate body count (a total of 10), which is served up generously in this 80's B-movie, with outstanding blood and makeup effects by the legendary Tom Savini.<br /><br />In 1958, Camp Crystal Lake became known as "Camp Blood" to the locals after a young boy drowned and several vicious murders occurred shortly after. Present day finds a group of counselors working hard (which translates to goofing off and rolling in the hay) to re-open the rundown campgrounds for a new batch of kids. But just as soon as they start piecing the place back together, one by one the counselors are slaughtered by a machete-wielding maniac. (Look for an early role by Kevin Bacon.)<br /><br />Friday the 13th struggles with seriousness, mostly resorting to campy dialogue and poor acting to connect the string of gruesome deaths. There's humor running through the majority of the slayings, even though spurting blood isn't shied away from. And once the killings start, the tiny bits of plot are completely pointless - each scene segues from one attack to the next. It's evident by the conclusion that we weren't even meant to guess the true identity of the killer. The deaths all seem to have a bloodthirsty infatuation with throats, whether it's slashing, slitting or spearing with an arrow. First-person perspective camerawork is used frequently to put the audience in the butcher's shoes, making the reactions of the victims more startling and the actual murderer invisible.<br /><br />Notorious movie villain Jason Voorhees is most recognizable for his ghastly hockey mask, but this first film didn't even introduce that indispensable accessory. In fact, it isn't until the third part of the franchise that he finally dons the disguise. Although nothing about Friday the 13th stands out as incredibly imaginative, and the vexatious music is either a bad homage or a rip-off of Psycho versus Jaws, it isn't without a certain level of amusement; it either unmasks the deeply rooted bloodthirstiness in everyone, or it's just too much schlock to be anything but silly thrills. Through 11 more sequels, the formula never changes.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>The "Friday the 13th" franchise has proved remarkably successful. Screenwriter Victor Miller's psychotic anti-hero Jason has featured in nine sequels, spanning nearly 20 years. The films have achieved tremendous popular notoriety, and spawned a merchandising empire that includes comics, T-shirts, and action figures. All of which proves how little originality and good film-making have to do with making money.<br /><br />This first film tells the story of a group of randy teenagers who take summer jobs at Camp Crystal Lake, a run-down New Jersey summer camp. The camp has a dark past, and an even darker resident: the psycho in a hockey mask who hacks our comely teens to death. One by one, they are despatched with a variety of crude weaponry, including knives, hatchets, spears, and arrows.<br /><br />It was not the first teen 'stalk-n-slash' film and certainly not the most creative, but it was undeniably a hugely influential film that contributed to the 1980s horror boom. The film's success was in its ability to understand what made audiences tick, and then manipulate it ruthlessly. It took the shock violence of nihilistic 1970s gore-fests such as "Zombie Flesh Eaters" and "Driller Killer", added some sexually active teenagers, and achieved something approaching mass appeal in the process.<br /><br />Ultimately the film's box office success was down to exploitation. It teases the audience with an attractive cast and a smattering of nudity, and panders cynically to their fantasies and fears about power and powerlessness, voyeurism and cruelty.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>Many of us have been in those scenario's where you're watching a horror movie, and then we say "yep, I've already seen this." Well, FRIDAY THE 13TH might seem like one of those by-the-numbers slasher flicks. But in all reality, it's not. It's got a mind of its own, and director/producer Sean Cunningham had no idea he was going to make a movie that made more money than THE SHINING did, which came out that same year.<br /><br />FRIDAY THE 13TH takes place at Camp Crystal Lake, a place notorious for the drowning of a boy named Jason Voorhees. The student camp counselors are there for a weekend of fun and sex, sleaze and booze, but in all seriousness they are preparing for the kids who are due to arrive in just a few days. Little do they know there's a maniac on the loose who, one by one, dispatches with the young, hormone-driven population. But by the time the killer gets to Alice, the real killer is exposed. That's where the one fault lies...the killer explained her motives for killing off the sex-driven teens, and that gave Alice a chance to fight off Mrs. Voorhees, a mother who loved her son so much that she would lose her head for him, and she literally did. The ending of the movie is infamous, as many moviegoers and collectors alike fell for the "dream" sequence that flowed into the "real" ending of the film. Of course, that was one of the movies big strengths.<br /><br />This was one of the first movies to star Kevin Bacon, and his performance was bulletproof, even if his character's grim fate was not. Betsy Palmer originally didn't want to do this movie (she's not a movie buff by any means, and admitted that after this movie, she got more fan mail than any other film), but she did the movie to afford her car. Her performance is creepy, and she convinced me that she was out for revenge. Adrienne King was cast well as Alice, and her scenes of running and battling Mrs. Palmer were actually quite good. And of course, who can forget the dream sequence of "rain and blood"; the discordant violins that make up that all-too-chilling score by Manfriedi; and then the fact that Jason is not the killer in this movie, that's what really intrigued me about this movie. It was a smart move by Cunningham, and it really kept us in the dark until Mrs. Voorhees herself appeared on screen.<br /><br />FRIDAY THE 13TH is probably the best in the entire series, but it's not the only good one, although some of the series lacks the punch this one kick-started when it came out over 25 years ago. Grossing over $40 million dollars at the box office in America alone, FRIDAY THE 13TH is really the only entry casual moviegoers need bare witness to, unless you want to check out the sequels...but be warned...ch-ch-ch ka-ka-ka...</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It goes like this: At Camp Crystal Lake, otherwise known as Camp Blood(muhahahaha!)it is said that the camp is cursed. With sadistic, grisly death. Some really stupid people ignore the warning and go anyway. Pretty soon there is a lot of death by means of bladed weapons going on, lots of slicing, dicing, slashing, impaling, anything involving some manner of cutting instrument. When she is the only one left, a very young frightened woman named Alice finds out that the killer is who else but Pamela Voorhees. Seems she blames the camp for letting her 11 year old son Jason drown, and wants them dead. She fights with Alice, and though I won't give away the ending, I most certainly will say that if you like bloody, hideous horror films, this is for you. One can only imagine how much I'll love the sequels when Jason(who by the way is my # 1 favorite boogeyman)takes over the job of destroying Camp Crystal Lake for dear old mom. Happy Halloween, helpless victims. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! And remember, don't watch these movies-ALONE......!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Paramount's Friday the 13th series are weak and underrated,<br /><br />contemplatig the success of the original Paramount decided<br /><br />to use the franchise for all it's worth.<br /><br />One can see with a comedy like Freddy vs. Jason that the<br /><br />mystique was over a long time ago.<br /><br />Of course the original still stands on it's own.<br /><br />Featuring a cast of nobodies like Betsy Palmer, Kevin<br /><br />Bacon and others Sean S.

Way better than the rash of teen horror movies out right now. Dark woods, serial killer, gore = 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>Silly, by-the-numbers slasher flick concerning a bunch of teen counselors who are pursued by a crazed killer at camp Crystal Lake. Lots of gore and a high body count, but not an ounce of suspense or tension. It also spawned countless sequels that aren't much better than this mess. This DVD gets an extra star for its camp value and because it evokes memories of those glorious 1980s. Otherwise, this hack job (no pun intended) is totally negligible.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>It's twenty-seven years later . . . and this film remains potent.<br /><br />I have not seen the unedited version since I was ten years old and watched in a room full of screaming, slumber-party girls. And though I have seen it countless times since then, it was always on television. I just bought the DVD and was shocked at how graphic the film REALLY is!! The deaths are spectacular . . . especially that of Kevin Bacon's character, Jack . . . and, no that isn't a "spoiler" since slasher-code dictates that men die early and one woman remains ("The Final Girl"). It is a blood-fest . . . with a pretty serious twist (here, my lips are sealed!!)<br /><br />Unlike many classic slasher-films (like Prom Night and Nightmare on Elm Street) this one genuinely stands the test of time. Instead of becoming a laughable experience (like the aforementioned) it has remained genuinely engaging. The premise is simple, the horror intense, and the ending (though bizarre) is absolutely effective!!<br /><br />If you have not seen the "real-deal" in years, prepare to be surprised!! Well worth the purchase . . . even if you just want to understand what spawned ten sequels!!</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Hard to beleive this movie came out almost a quarter of a century ago.  Friday the 13th came out in 1980, the same year as The Fog, The Shining, He Knows You're Alone, Motel Hell, Mother's Day, and Prom Night.  I remember this because my friends and I would pour over various horror rags, Fangoria and such, and talk about all the movies we wanted to see, and Friday the 13th was near the top of all our lists.<p>Although this movie has lost a little of it's intensity from previous viewings, it's still a great little movie (or big movie if you look at all the sequels it spawned).  It's the story of a bunch of teenagers going to work at a summer camp that had been closed down for a number of years and dubbed 'Camp Blood' by local residents.  Like 20 years prior, there had been a couple of grisly murders, and subsequent fires and such, but no one was ever caught or charged with the crimes.  The teenagers are hired to help fix the camp up, and get it ready to open for the summer.  Throughout the beginning of the movie, the onminus threat of evil slowly rises.  One of my favorite scenes is when the local loon named Crazy Ralph warns one girl on her way to the camp.  "You're doooomed!  Doooomed!"  The local residents pass him off as crazy, but they all have reservations about the camp re-opening.<p>Well, the murders begin, one by one, but so does the mystery.  Who is doing the killing?  And why?  Watch for a young Kevin Bacon to get it in a particularly nasty way.  And as for Ned, played by Mark Nelson, I can't say I was sorry to see him go, as he was played as the 'funny' guy, but just came off as really annoying.  And it seemed odd to me that he was one of the first to get killed, but no one seemed to miss him until much later in the movie.  Oh well...  All this leads up to the climatic surpise ending where we find out who the killer is and why.  But is it the end?  What I really liked about this movie was the ending, and how it was left open.  Did Alice dream about what happened on the lake or did it really happen?  The sequels kind of spoiled this haunting question, and so I avoid them, as this is the best in the series.  By the way, I'm not a big fan of slasher movies, but I feel this one, like the original Halloween movie, had more to offer in not only horror, but mystery and suspense, unlike their respective sequels which just became all about the body count.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I don't think I've ever seen any Friday 13th movies growing up. But I did hear about them. Walmart had a sale on the Friday 13 movie in Oct. I like scare movie's so I jumped on buying the first three. I have so many dvd's that I just got around to watching the first movie today. I enjoyed it, but hate watching movies that are pitch black and all you can see is a few lights. I don't know if it was my flat scene tv or the movie. But those parts sucked.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>Friday the 13th(1980) is a classic slasher horror film. The reviews for the film have been good and bad. One of my movie books gave it a "turkey"! This first film in the series is directed by Sean S. Cunningham from a script by Victor Miller. The music score by Harry Mandredini sounds just as good as any Bernard Herrmann score. The "bad guy" in the film is Pamela Voorhees(Betsy Palmer). She goes insane after the Camp Crystal Lake counselors abuse her son Jason and let him drown in the lake. Jason Voorhees doesn't start killing people until Friday the 13th Part 2(1981). Adrienne King plays Alice, the film's heroine.<br />Robbi Morgan plays a cute, bubbly brunette who is killed off 30 minutes into the movie! Tom Savini(Dawn of the Dead) did a good job designing the make up and gore effects. Friday the 13th has a fair amount of blood and guts, but it's tame compared to the sequels, the 2009 remake, and the recent "torture-porn horror movies". Friday the 13th is full of creepiness and atmosphere. It was well-made considering its low budget. It tries to emulate films such as Psycho(1960), Carrie(1976) and Halloween(1978). Nothing supernatural happens in Friday the 13th(1980) until the climax. A young Kevin Bacon plays a camp counselor. Siskel and Ebert were big detractors of the Friday the 13th film series. They showed a clip from this film on their TV special Women in Danger. Around 1980, they were sick and tired of reviewing slasher/horror movies on a weekly basis. Friday the 13th does have some filler scenes such as Alice making a cup of coffee or someone fixing a car. The film is honest about the fact that it didn't have any "A-list movie stars" at the time. Most of the credits are saved for the end of the film.<br />Paramount Pictures distributed Friday the 13th in the U.S.A. while Warner Bros. distributed the film in foreign countries.<br />Friday the 13th(1980) is a solid horror film that spawned many sequels, a remake, and a bunch of rip offs.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>I have to admit, I was impressed with this film. Due to the fact that isn't just a horror and slasher film. This film is a very stylish thriller, cause uses the plot idea from Agatha Christie's "And then there were none" and puts a modern spin on things. Basically, the story takes place at a place called "Camp Crystal Lake". Where two young counselors are murder, when they sneak off to be alone. Of course, the camp is shut down after that and is not opened. That is until 40 years later, a new group has taken over the campsite and is going to try open it again. However, the group consists of very young, naive and inexperince people. Once the group learns about the camp's history. They are soon stalked and hunted down by an unknown assailant, who is bent on making sure that the camp is never opened. Now, the group must fight to stay alive until morning comes and they can get help. This film is truly impressive!!! Also Betsy Palmer and Adrianne King were true credits to this film. They did a remarkable job with thier roles.</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was sort of a ground breaker for new slasher gore trends - setting a new level for graphic gore and so forth. It is really well done. This movie does contain Jason but not as you will see him in the sequels. This one has Betsy Palmer as Mrs Vorhees doing the killing. It is the mother this time, which reminded me of the mother themes of Psycho. If you listen closely to the soundtrack, you will see touches of the Psycho theme, of which this movie was inspired by. Psycho is the single most influential horror movie in terms of what films it paved the way for in horror. The gore effects by Tom Savini are good, it wasnt as gory as I had thought, even in its uncut form. Kevin Bacon fans, see his early work before he was in Tremors & so forth. The transfer for this - the day scenes are fantastic, the night scenes still are a little dark but better than previous releases.<br />I recommend this to any gore fans, between this and My Bloody Valentine, horror fans can rejoice to see some uncut above horror slasher horrors..<br />The bonus features - interview with Sean Cunningham, and the Friday the 13th reunion were very insightful. The Camp Blood tale part 1 was pretty gory & creepy...<br />Highly recommended for sure !</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>FRIDAY THE 13TH<br /><br />**** ? Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- May 9th, 1980<br /><br />Running Time- 95-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Victor Miller<br /><br />Director- Sean Cunningham<br /><br />Starring- Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Kevin Bacon, Laurie Bartram, Jeannine Taylor, Mark Nelson, Walt Gorney, Robbi Morgan, Peter Brouwer, Ari Lehman and Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees<br /><br />Released in 1980 this low budget shocker would spawn what seems like a never ending amount of sequels and knockoff films. After the massive success of John Carpenter's Halloween, Sean Cunningham decided to make his own slasher flick, but calling Friday the 13th a Halloween knockoff is just wrong. While the basic structure of the movie is inspired by Halloween, Friday the 13th has more in common with the Giallo and some of the death scenes were clearly inspired by Mario Bava's Bay of Blood. Despite the reputation Friday the 13th has it actually is a very well done horror flick that takes way too much heat. I suppose the sequels and knockoff films are part of that reason and while Halloween is clearly the better picture, but if you dislike Friday the 13th for what it started you should also hate Halloween. Some people debate the status of Friday the 13th; some hail it as a classic and others don't. I'd say it's somewhere in the middle. As good as Friday the 13th is it is kind of hard to rate it as highly as say Frankenstein or Night of the Living Dead, but with that said in it's own right it is classic.<br /><br />Friday the 13th is far better than its given credit for again a lot of people say it's a Halloween knockoff and is nothing more than a body count film. While I suppose Friday the 13th did sort of start the body count movie it still has a style all of its own and is actually quite suspenseful.<br /><br />The screenplay by Victor Miller was actually fairly well written in general. Look Friday the 13th isn't Oscar worthy and when talking about the greatest of screenplays this won't get a mention, but with that said the script wasn't bad at all and has some creative moments and some fairly good characters, which is something these movies mostly lack. Each character has their own identity and while not the most developed characters they are more than just faceless victims. They are actually likeable and come across as real people. Later in the series and other slasher flicks the characters were nothing more than faceless victims, but Victor Miller gives each their own identity and does a decent job at developing them.<br /><br />Sean Cunningham does a solid job with Friday the 13th; while I haven't really liked his other movies with Friday the 13th he crafts a movie that is quite suspenseful and scary at times. From the start of the movie until the end, Cunningham manages to get this great sense of dread. He's able to create this feeling of unease and at anytime you know something bad can happen. Like the movie being better than it gets credit for the same thing can be said about Sean Cunningham's directing. Unlike the sequels Friday the 13th actually moves at a slow, but steady pace and there is a long stretch without any murders, but in these scenes Cunningham sets up a dark and eerie tone and develops the characters. After this movie I can't really say I was into Cunningham's movies, but here with Friday the 13th he does an amazing job and crafts an excellent and scary movie.<br /><br />The older I get the more of an appreciation I seem to gain for this movie. Again despite the reputation it has Friday the 13th is an excellent horror movie that is quite creepy with some good scares. The now clich&eacute;d last scare was frightening, but now it's been done so much it's so expected. Like I stated before the characters were quite interesting and likable and each has their own identity. The performances were fairly good as well. All the actors were early in their careers so any problems are easily overlooked. This series became all about Jason and many people often forget about Mrs. Voorhees played by Betsy Palmer. It's like that scene in Scream when the killer asks who the killer was in Friday the 13th and Drew Barrymore's character replies with Jason. That's a very common mistake that even some fans make by accident. But Mrs. Voorhees was an excellent killer and deserves far more recognition.<br /><br />Friday the 13th really has so much more going for it than people give it credit for and I cannot state that enough. The score by Harry Manfredini is excellent and the gore scenes by Tom Savini are some of his best and look quite real. Friday the 13th isn't the gore flick people claim it to be. Compared to movies like Zombi 2 and Maniac this movie is quite dry, but the gore scenes look real for the most part and the murders are simple, but highly effective. The sequels started the more over the top murder scenes, which were great, but in this one they were simple and by far the most effective.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>In celebration of the rebooting of Friday the 13th, Paramount has double-dipped their money-making slasher series for the ump-teenth time (as well as debuting on Blu-Ray), only this time around we finally get the Uncut version of the original Friday the 13th.  While the re-inserted scenes only really amount to nothing more than a few seconds of deleted gore effects, it's nice to finally have the original Friday the 13th in all its uncut glory.  There's a decent assortment of extras included on the DVD as well, including an interesting commentary from Sean S. Cunningham and some nice featurettes and recollections on what the film meant then and now.  Like it or not, Friday the 13th owns a place in horror history that has and will stand the test of time, and finally having it here in its uncut form makes that factoid all the more true.  If you're a horror buff and you don't already own one of the old discs or the box set, this Uncut version is definitely a worthy pick up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Friday The 13th is the film that spawned 10 sequel, a spin off series, video game and countless imiators.

A thoroughly enjoyable movie in the Friday the 13th series.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Sean S. Cunningham<br />Cast:  Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Kevin Bacon.<br />Running Time:  95 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, gore, language, and mild sexual situations.<p>One of the more influential slasher films of all time, "Friday the 13th" was one of the few in the series that was moderately scary, used specific camera positioning and foreground for its scares, and possessed a fairly intelligent script.  A group of camp counselors are looking forward to their work at Crystal Lake campsite, only to hear the warnings from townies that they are in severe danger and that they should leave immediately.  Ignoring these threats, the teenagers live life as if they are no worries.<p>Their attitudes change when a maniac killer starts to knock off all of the counselors, each in a gory fashion one-by-one.  Adrienne King is the main scream queen, running around the camp finding dead bodies all over and finally encountering the killer and learns the truth of the systematic murder spree.  Excellent special effects by master Tom Savini and a tense, dramatic musical score, yet the performances are fairly laughable and the plot gets old quickly (which obviously means they should make nine more sequels!).  The final scene is absolutely terrifying!  Not one of the best, but still important to the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>A little different than Halloween and The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th is a new take on teen horror.  It isn't as good as its predecessors, but it is original and full of thrills and chills.  The villain is utterly unexpected.  Another thing that is neat is that you are constantly in shock over which of the campers is the main character, so you never know who will live and who will die.  The death scenes are inventive and not cheesy or stupid in any way.  This is a definate must see if you are into the horror genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>After years of being closed due to the result of a bizarre unsolved double murder, a group of teenagers try to reopen Camp Crystal Lake. But, unknown to the group someone or something is slowly hunting them & like the ten little indians, one by one the counselers are quietly dispatched.<br /><br />Much like "Jaws", "Friday the 13th" taps into the primal instinct within us all. The omnious, vulnerable feeling of being alone & yet having the feeling of someone watching your every move. After almost 25 years, the film remains a jolting, jump out of your seat scare-fest that will make you think twice before going into the woods alone, or into the woods ever again for that matter!<br /><br />Cashing in on the "Halloween" craze, "Paramount Pictures" bought the rights to the film & released "Friday the 13th" back in 1980. The studio, thinking the film would flop, just wanted a quick payday & nothing more to do with the film. But the studio's plan backfired & "Friday the 13th" became a big hit (approx. 40 million dollars at the box office & becoming one of the top 20 grossers of 1980) as well as, a major embarassment for the studio (after the films release talk shows, newspapers, & activist groups attacked the film for its raw, brutal violence in the film). Thats why there are no major special features, deleted scenes, cast interviews, etc. "Paramount" is still embarassed by the success of this series (its the black sheep series of the studio). The DVD is a barebones affair with 2.0 Dolby Digital, & a trailer for a special feature. One can only hope that "Paramount" will release a special edition to "Friday the 13th" to coincide with "Friday"'s 25th anniversary. Don't hold your breathe.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>In the summer of 1957, a young boy drowned at camp Crystal Lake. One year later, two frisky camp counselors were stabbed to death. The camp has been known as &quot;Camp Blood&quot; ever since. In 1978, a man named Steve Christi decided to re-open the camp. It was the worst decision of his short life. FRIDAY THE 13TH is the classic original in what has become a monotonous stream of inferior sequels (10 to date and counting). Yes, there is a &quot;body count&quot;, but at least there's a good, creepy story to carry the carnage! Long before there was a mindless, invincible stalker and his 20+ year murder spree, there was the REASON for it all. In this first movie, we get the actual motive for all that hideous rage and it's gory result. This is a tale of vengeance fueled by insanity. Yes, we get to see WHO is killing the new arrivals at Crystal Lake. More importantly, in this one we get the answer to WHY they are dying. Yes, there is a Jason Vorhees. However, there is someone else who is equally frightening. Someone who will stop at nothing in order to exact revenge. This person is bitterness incarnate, compelled to destroy in order to feed the inner demon. To get &quot;justice&quot; for something that cannot be made right. We get a quick peak at the agony that started the bloodletting. This is rare in this type of movie! A well told campfire story, best viewed alone on a dark, rainy night. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Just released this week on DVD in Australia is Friday the 13th (after a very long wait).  It has been  distributed by Warner Bros internationally.  That is a good thing because we ended up with the full uncut version, plus a 'Making of Documentary'.  The print transfer is pristine too - in fact, it is so clear you would think it was only filmed yesterday.  Only problem is, it is quite a boring movie.  I saw it years ago, and just wanted to own it to complete my horror DVD collection.  It isn't a patch on &quot;Halloween&quot;, although the scene at the end with the girl in the boat is brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Here's where it all began. True, future Jason flicks had almost nothing to do with the original story, but this is where the legend began. Jason Voorhees, a mongoloid boy drowns in Crystal Lake during the summer of 1957. In 1958, Jason's mother kills two camp counselors just when they are about to have sex. Then we are told there were a series of fires that started around the camp, but no one knew who was responsible.<p>Fast forward to the `present day', June 13. The Camp is going to reopen, but the residents have already renamed the place Camp Blood. The camp counselors assemble and are preparing to get the camp ready for the summer's youngsters. Naturally there first night there, there is a terrible rain storm (It's gonna blow through here like a son of a gun!). One by one the counselors are killed off until only Amy remains. In the end she confronts and kills Mrs. Voorhees by decapitating her with a machete. Guess that's why the machete is Jason's favorite weapon of choice.<p>The final scene in the boat made everyone jump who saw this film for the first time and wasn't expecting it. To see young Jason leap out and grab Amy from behind is still to this day one of the most disturbing films ever shot.<p>This is not one of the goriest Jason films by far, but it had some good kills. One counselor who never even reaches the camp gets her throat slit convincingly as she leans against a tree. Kevin Bacon had the best kill with a spear coming up through his neck. His girlfriend got a nice little axe to the head too. Two deaths aren't even shown but we see the bodies later. The head counselor gets stabbed through the stomach, but we only see his facial expression. The great scene of Mrs. Voorhees getting her head cut off is great too. Not only does it look so real, but the way the slow motion starts and her hands try to reach where her head once were is very disturbing. A great film and a good history lesson for those who have no idea how the whole `Jason' thing started.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Widely renowned as being, along with John Carpenter's Halloween, the movie that spawned not only a seemingly endless franchise (check out the recent Jason X) but also popularised the horror movie during the 80's.  Of course, it's a near splatter-fest which manages to incorporate just about every clich&eacute; that the horror genre has become famous for.  Based around Camp Crystal after it's re-opened after a couple of gruesome murders a few years ago, it's not long before young attractive counsellors are being punished for having sex or going outside to 'investigate'.  Right up to the virginal survivor this is horror clich&eacute; at its peak, but admitedly enjoyable for the obvious fun the director has with it all.<p>It's perhaps strange that this of all horror movies of the 80's is still regarded as a classic piece, because there's absolutely nothing here that's new.  Even the death scenes leave a lot to the imagination rather than showing all-out gore.  Certainly it's nothing special amid the other films that are exactly like it, although the mythos built around it all will definitely keep you entertained.  The best scenes are probably towards the end when Mrs Vorhees is revealed as the real killer, whispering 'Kill her.  Kill her Mommy!' before running off after the girl who runs into the wood rather than to the nearest vehicle.  The end of Mrs Vorhees may induce laughs rather than scares (watch out for her hands still clasping and unclasping after she's been decapitated in slow-motion).  Even so, the conclusion is genuinely shocking, and there's plenty of fun to be had in this kind of film, if not only to pick out how many clich&eacute;s of the genre you can see.  Also there's a young Kevin Bacon cast as the camp's local hunk, who also is on the receiving end of the movie's most imaginative death.  There's also one particularly annoying perky girl who, once she's hitched a ride with the serial killer, will have you cheering that her end is near.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of the first three, bu by part 4 it gets old. The first three have a good atmosphere, exceptional acting for a low-budget film, and while not as scary as Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this still is a great movie, and it tries not to take itself too seriously. The rest are just entertaining, but this is the one that started it all, and I wish people would stop giving these films such a hard time. WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK, and have a wonderful time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>Schlock movie maker Sean S. Cunningham had every intention of making a buck with this gory little movie that truly launched the slasher craze of the early 80s.  That he made a cinematic legend was strictly an accident.<p>John Carpenter's Halloween had proved to be a huge hit just a year or two previous to this film and making a similar slaughter date movie to cash in on the trend seemed a good idea.  So Friday the 13th (another 'bad date' title) was born.<p>Like Halloween the movie starts with the post coital murder of two sneak away lovers, roll credits and jump forward to 'The Present'.  A well meaning camp counselor is trying to reopen Camp Crystal Lake much to the distaste of the locals, for it is there that the pre-credit murders happened.  It seems that so much bad luck has befallen camps in the area that just about everyone agrees that it must have a death curse.  Boy have they got that right.  For someone is lurking in the woods, watching and stalking the gathering counselors, and when night falls and a storm rolls in, the killer pounces.  Again and again the blood flows freely at Camp Crystal Lake.<p>Nothing more than a simplistic low budget exploitation shocker, Friday the 13th's biggest controversy wasn't its sex and graphic bloodletting, but that a major Hollywood studio (Paramount) would even buy the distribution rights and release such a sleazy item, not to mention making a mint doing so.  This might be worth viewing for those interested in seeing the birth of a cinematic trend that would take years to burn out - only to come back again and again just like the unstoppable killers that populated it.  Just remember that Friday the 13th is really nothing special, just a little exploitation flick that got very lucky.  Recommended to the curious.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>... slasher fest about a group of niave councilors being slaughtered at an abandoned summer camp. Interesting premise ruined by B-grade performances, thin story and ham-fisted direction. Still, special make-up effects wizard Savinin does show some style and colour in the mutilations (especially Kevin Bacon's arrow-through-the-throat gag).<br />The Paramount DVD edition of this movie is a disappointment to fans as far as extras go (theatrical trailer - bore), but a nice and neat 16:9 enhanced widescreen presentation and a clear and loud Dolby Mono track does make it satisfactory to the average horror buff.</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>Well, like another reviewer thought, I thought it would be cool to review "Friday the 13th" on...Friday the 13th! If you're a horror movie fan, there's a good chance you've already seen this at least once, but if you haven't, well you're in for a treat!<br />"Friday the 13th" is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The forest atmosphere, the suspense, the heart-pounding terror and multiple slasher kills! Not to mention an excellent chase scene and old-school moviegoing fun! This movie is a landmark for the slasher sub-genre. Even though the original 1978 "Halloween" was an excellent movie full of suspense and terrifying scenes, it wasn't gory. "Friday the 13th" added the gore factor and set the stage for many, many slasher films to follow. Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King and all the others set the stage for the most dreaded day of the year...Friday the 13th! Grab some popcorn and iced tea and dig this one, movie fans! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought it would be sweet to write a review on this particular horror film on this particular day! Friday the 13th is a really creepy movie! Some people may not know that Jason Voorhees is NOT the killer on this one. The setting of Camp Crystal Lake is awesome! The death scenes are kinda gory for an 80's slasher! If you love slashers, then hopefully you'll love FRIDAY THE 13TH<br /><br />p.s. I can't wait for the remake!!</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Friday The 13th (1980) rides on the coattails of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978).  Carpenter's movie inspired Friday The 13th and so many other horror movies where suddenly a holiday or special occasion is no longer safe, such as Silent Night Deadly Night, April Fools Day, New Years Evil, My Bloody Valentine, Prom Night, Happy Birthday To Me, and on and on and on.  Of course, Halloween was inspired by such movies as Psycho and Black Christmas, so credit is due there.  As much as Friday The 13th took inspiration from Halloween, it also helped inspire other movie makers to make these previously mentioned knockoffs beginning in the early 1980s.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />What else can be said about Friday The 13th?  It's a low budget slasher horror movie that features one of the iconic monsters in horror movie franchise history - Jason Voorhees (well, at least at the end of the movie).  Michael Myers was the trailblazer, of course, then Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger followed.  Camp Crystal Lake is being re-opened more than 20 years after some unsolved murders took place.  Can a bunch of horny teenagers survive the terror that unfolds?  Watch to find out.<br /><br />This movie stars Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Kevin Bacon, Ari Lehman, and Robbi Morgan.<br /><br />Overall, even though this movie borrows from Halloween, it's a good horror movie to watch and does a good job of providing some scares, and that's the bottom line.  I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>When Horror was Horror and Horror Movies were simple and fun,As violent as Jason movies are you do not have the gore for the sake of gore or the shock for the sake of shock as in Saw series or many "Modern" movies. People Grew Up on this and Freddy and Halloween, Jason and Michael Are the Kings of slasher movies that spawned many imitators,Part 1 and 2 being the best of Camp Crystal Lake and actually the cabin in this one,Although Jason still has not got his "groove" on so to speak,no Mask and well no.... but the Movie is at the top not just for being part one of course.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>In 1979 Sean S. Cunningham was looking to produce a mere potboiler to tide him over until his next serious project. His idea of a Summer Camp Killer movie seemed like a decent, low-budget, one-shot deal and he went with it. There was nothing particularly memorable or unique about it but it was bought by Paramount and released as a mainstream film, rather than a independent struggler. The response was huge and it soon became clear that Friday the 13th was not a mere paycheck but a serious cash-cow. Sequels followed. And the rest is history.<br /><br />Many, many people claim that Friday the 13th rips off Halloween. Which is not a very fair or kind statement. Sure, it's no work of art and has many similarities, but Halloween was NOT the first slasher movie as Black Christmas and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre came before it. I was actually draw more parallels between this and The Last House on the Left, which was also produced by Cunningham. Friday the 13th is a slicker, tamer film in comparison but if TLHOTL never existed then we would have the Friday the 13th franchise that we have today.<br /><br />The characters and deaths are not so imaginative. All we really get is throat slashings and impalings. But at least the fodder are not as obnoxious and annoying as they would later become in the sequels, when they truly deserved more grotesque deaths.<br /><br />At the time, the ending was surprising only because it came out of nowhere. The sudden unveiling of the killer and motives was random and unexpected. It's weird watching it now, knowing that Jason and parts 2-infinity were never planned. Jason was just a dead boy and nothing more.<br /><br />It's hard to review Friday the 13th on it's own merits rather than the movie that launched a major franchise. A low-brow slasher script made into a potboiler movie that ended up making zillions in sequels, spin-offs, TV series', toys, games and accessories seems so far-fetched.<br /><br />Paramount bungled the aspect ratio and framing on this Blu Ray btw.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.<br /><br />The first installment of the series is pretty mediocre, but it does open the door for one of the 80's best loved horror icons - Jason Voorhees.<br /><br />The series is known for creative death sequences and not much of anything else. The first film features Kevin Bacon in an early role and like most visitors of Camp Crystal Lake doesn't last too long! Overall it's a fun Halloween flick with a memorable ending.

Now in 1979, the camp is about to reopen thanks to a new owner Steve (Peter Brouwer) with counselors but suddenly a mysterious killer is murder each of them, one by bloody one until one survives to reveal who the true killer is.<br /><br />Co-starring Kevin Bacon, Adrienne King, Laurie Bartham, Mark Nelson, Robbin Morgan, Harry Crosby and Betsy Palmer. This is a unique and stylish slasher shocker that started off as an idea by Victor Miller based off campfire legends including the legend of Cropsy the killer which was later made as "The Burning" and influenced by films by "Halloween" and "Psycho", Sean S. Cunningham who produced the 1972 sleaze-feast "Last House on The Left" produced and directed the project to make it low budget. Made in 1979 then finished in 1980,it opened up on june 13th 1980 distributed by Paramount Pictures to become one of the highest grossing movies at the box-office that year despite bad reviews including Roger Ebert who declared it nothing but a "Halloween" rip-off. What makes the movie so effective is the "Psycho"-esque score by Harry Manfredini and of course the memorable gore effects by Tom Savini which shocked the daylights out of people when it first came out yet they are still effective. Although Jason isn't the true killer in this movie, even though he does appear in a couple of sequences and doesn't become the villain until the sequels, the film offers scares and shocks from beginning to end as it spawned sequels, imitators, a slew of trick or treaters with Jason costumes and a remake in the works, it even paved way for "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and other slasher movies of the 80's.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray brings us for the first time in the U.S. the uncut unrated version with more violent footage that was toned down to avoid an "X" rating originally. It offers great picture and sound quality in the best high definition possible with great extras like interviews, featurettes, a reunion at a horror convention, "Tales from Camp Blood part 1" Short film, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>It amazes me what scares some people and doesn't move others. I never found this movie to be scary, but I had the BEST Halloweens because of this movie. My brother would dress up as Jason and stomp down the street chasing all the kids on my block.  I'd be the lead one screaming and running, somehow more scared of my own brother than I was of this movie.  We even had a stuffed Jason who sat on our doorstep so when kids came to collect candy, one of us would whisper, in a deep voice, out of a side window just to watch trick or treaters fly down the stairs.  I tried watching this movie about two weeks ago on a pay per view station and it's still not too much to be scared of, but I have to thank this movie for some pretty entertaining childhood memories, especially during my five years as a girl scout.  The camping trips could not have been any better than me reminding my peers about Jason coming out to get us while we slept in our tents.  I think it's cool for easily scary people and probably even more entertaining for men because there were more women being unnecessarily undressed in this flick than I can think of for any other.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>Despite its popularity, FRIDAY THE 13TH still got a lot of flak from critics, and I must say they make a lot of good points against the movie. Okay, I won't go so far as critic Roger Ebert did when he said the film was &quot;beneath contempt&quot;---sure, compared to its superior predecessor HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13TH really is exploitation hackwork, but it isn't totally horrible as a horror flick. Director Sean S. Cunningham at the very least has a decent sense of how to create a tense atmosphere that gives the movie more class than it deserves---he isn't necessarily just interested in the next murder, like some lesser directors might be. It's too bad, though, that Cunningham knows very little about building suspense, relying instead on gruesome cheap shocks to make an effect. And he shows almost no sense of style---a stark contrast to John Carpenter, for whom style was just about everything in HALLOWEEN. In addition to all that, the film's attempt at being some kind of mystery totally fails, since the eventual solution to it is so out-of-left-field (not like it really matters anyway, right?). <p>Tom Savini's notorious gore effects in this one are admittedly kinda cool, though---and, in its own way, groundbreaking. In the film's own way, too, FRIDAY THE 13TH is groundbreaking, but for the wrong reason: it inspired a slew of imitators in the '80s that tried to make even more outrageously violent and bloody slasher flicks, where gore was everything and true horror was zero. FRIDAY THE 13TH might not have been &quot;beneath contempt,&quot; but the bloody-slasher-flick subgenre it helped popularize sure became so. Still, on its own, FRIDAY THE 13TH is a sometimes decent but generally mediocre slasher flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>A bunch of young camp counsellors get stalked by an emotionally unstable killer (Palmer). A couple of good scares but a very dragging plot. Not really for die hard horror fans, but not neally as bad or pathetic as it's  made out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Though nominated for its share of Razzies back in the day, Friday the 13th is unquestionably a significant film, for better or worse.  On the good side, Friday the 13th helped to bring horror to the forefront again.  On the bad side, Friday the 13th signaled the beginning of a shameless marketing effort based on exploitation.  It is the quintessential slasher film and I can't say whether that is a wholly bad or a wholly good thing to be.  It is an incredibly derivative film that borrows from many of the things that highlighted horror classics from the 1970s.  The obvious borrowing from Halloween and Black Christmas is there, but the way it reinforced previously established clich&eacute;s is absolutely groundbreaking due to the film's massive popularity.  Even the great scary ending with Jason leaping from the water was a formula borrowed from Brian De Palma's Carrie, and it was repeatedly used again and again thereafter...even in Friday the 13th's many sequels.<br /><br />In 1958, two sexed-up camp counselors (the standard victim in these films) are murdered.  The film forwards to 1980, the camp has a curse and we are given more than our fair share of foreshadowing.  A little boy drowned in Crystal Lake a year earlier.  That little boy is Jason and as we all know by now, the killer is his vengeful mother.  After the plot introduction phase we are introduced to a group of shallow camp counselor characters.  They are gradually murdered in many different gruesome ways by the then unknown assailant.  Kevin Bacon plays one of the counselors in an early role.  Eventually we find out that the killer is Pamela Voorhees (played by a less than enthusiastic but still professional Betsy Palmer) and the surviving counselor Alice cuts her head off.  As Alice waits in the lake in a canoe for help to arrive, the decaying body of a little boy Jason Voorhees jumps out of the lake to pull her into the water.  She is seen soon after in the hospital and asks the policeman "The boy...is he dead too?"  The policeman responds and indicates that they found no boy.<br /><br />As silly as this movie is, it certainly has a classic scary moment when Jason jumps out of the lake.  It is the scariest single moment in this long series of movies and one of the greatest jump scares of all time.  I'm too cynical to credit this movie for its success outside of its cultural impact.  It is a phenomenon and a standard setter, but it is also a very flawed movie that unfortunately set standards for many more flawed imitators that would follow.  It is hard to properly learn from a film that has nothing to teach.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>Not one of my favorite horror films, but it's still pretty enjoyable to watch and it's probably one of the greatest horror movies ever made.

The music is horrid and sounds like it was a high-school project gone bad. The dialog is not as bad as in later movies. Kevin Bacon is the only one in this movie that actually had a career after this movie and many of the people that starred in this movie are unknown today. Gotta love the killer cam and the arrowhead through the throat that kills Bacons character Jack. Even so it is amazing that this is the best in the series consider that the acting is on a high-school level and they seem to have all but Bacon and Mrs Vorhees (Betsy Palmer) gone to Hollywood upstairs acting school.

So over the years I've enjoyed delighting people by telling them I was born on Friday 13th. I've got many different reactions, one being that someone told me the bad luck was reversed. The most extreme reaction I've ever had was my history teacher at high school. I did really well in his class, he was a brilliant teacher, and he wanted me to continue taking history (we had to choose between history or geography) - until I told him I was born on Friday 13th. This is the guy who used to stay off school on Friday 13th. His phobia of anything Friday 13th was so severe that in quizzes, he used to miss out the number 13, and go straight from question 12, to question 14. Hello Mr Duncan.<br /><br />I've actually seen these films in the wrong order. I hadn't previously seen either the Friday 13th movies or the Nightmare On Elm Street movies when I saw the Freddy vs Jason movie. I know of both movies of course (and my boyfriend collects the dolls of Jason - sorry action figurines!) and he dressed up as Jason once for Halloween. But that was about it. I think I've seen Jason X, but it's a couple of years ago now.<br /><br />The first Friday 13th movie will not give you nightmares, or will make you hide behind the couch. I sat there waiting to be scared. I wasn't. My boyfriend did have nightmares that night, but I don't think it was caused by this somehow. It's very by-the-numbers horror. And it's so very eighties, it's embarrassing. But what I did like was the way you never actually saw Jason. You saw someone's feet or a hand holding a knife, but never the iconic figure. And then it seemed to be portraying Pamela Voorhees as the killer towards the end of the film - in my opinion anyway. He does appear right at the very end as a surprise for the audience, and certainly got a reaction then as you're not expecting it. Much like the finale of Freddy vs Jason I suppose.<br /><br />There's no big names in this film - or so I thought until I went on IMDB, and discovered that Kevin Bacon's lookalike in this was actually ... Kevin Bacon. Hehe. I sat throughout the film thinking "That guy really looks like Kevin Bacon", only to discover it actually was!<br /><br />There's no inventive killings in this, they come later in the franchise. I'm actually surprised the first movie spawned such a franchise, as to me, it wasn't that great. But then again, I am watching it the 21st century. I suppose it would have been scarier upon it's original release.<br /><br />Betsy Palmer is the actress who plays Pamela Voorhees and one critic was so angry at her role in the movie (which had angered many of her fans), that he published her address in his magazine, and encouraged people to write her and protest her. He published the wrong address.<br /><br />Friday 13th is an alright film, I wouldn't really call it a horror movie as such, maybe back in the day, but certainly not now. Hopefully the rest of the movies in the franchise is better.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The Crystal Lake Camp is about to be re-opened years after a double murder took place at the camp site.  The local residents believe the camp ground is haunted and possessed by a lethal curse, and they therefore avoid it at all costs.  Despite the local folklore, some young camp leaders decide to take a job there and help get the camp ready for the opening that is scheduled within two weeks.  This is a dire decision, since the local legend has some validity and the curse is about to take its course.  The audience is left with a rather gory and scary film, which creates a feeling of paranoia along with the feeling of being watched.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>Friday the 13th spawned a whole new subgenre called slasher flicks. This was not a positive development for with the new sub genre came a brand new cookie cutter formula that subsequent slasher flicks have rigidly adhered to.<br /><br />Friday the 13th has an absurd premise in that it concerns the re-opening of Camp Crystal Lake 23 years after its closure. There are members of the community who are aware of evil plottings being aimed at Camp Crystal Lake and its denizens such as a truck driver and a local lunatic named "Crazy Ralph." Camp Crystal Lake opens up and it turns out that just about everyone who shows up, both counselors and campers alike, are nothing but a bunch of perverts who apparently deserve being slaughtered at the hands of a demented maniac.<br /><br />Friday the 13th is an awful flick in almost every regard.<br /><br />Unlike almost all of the pre-1980 horror movies, Friday the 13th and the slasher flick sub-genre that it spawned is not with the victims. These poor excuses for movies are with the killers and the whole point is for the audience to anticipate the next murder or killing spree. Slasher flicks like Friday the 13th are movies to avoid like the plague.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This is a terrible, terrible film.  It's incredibly boring, lame, tedious, filled with bad acting, bad direction, etc., etc..  I know it was very popular at the time, but it still is really awful.  I had a difficult time sitting through the whole thing, and it was rather sleep inducing.  I wanted to see at least one of the Friday the 13th films, so I watched this one.  Many of the murders were ripped off from Mario Bava's superior Twitch of the Death Nerve (aka Bay of Blood), so the film wasn't even that original.  As we know, there were roughly around 1000 sequels, 500 TV shows, Jason dolls, Jason's official murder tools, Jason's hockey mask, etc., etc..  The film was one of the biggest hits of 1980, the year Hollywood started to decline.  Coincidence?  Who knows?  I just know I wasted 90 minutes of my time....</p></br><a href="../users/A2LAA9SCENXLKN.html">A2LAA9SCENXLKN</a><br/><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the special features. However, this is coming from watching the uncut version. However again, I'm not comparing the original with the uncut version. This is simply from the perspective of the uncut version.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above is possibly skewed by the ratings on this specific site. There might be a slightly different rating at the end.<br /><br />...I just had an injection of epicness, and now I went into shell shock.<br /><br />From start to finish, this movie has just about everything you would expect, and everything you wouldn't expect, out of a slasher film. Welcome to Friday the 13th A-Thon, during the whole month of Halloween. What is really great about the whole movie, is the sense of mystery. Any time there's a kill, we see it in first person, so we don't know who the he11 is the killer. Probably most of you would know, but I'm gonna not spoil in until I have to. You wanna know, yet you know it's better if you don't know. But that's the awesome part. It makes you want to keep watching the movie, that's what a good movie does!! And when you actually find out who the killer is, man, are you in shock. And they do it such an awesome fashion, which I'm gonna try to not spoil, that you are just ready to get your adrenalin pumping!!!<br /><br />But then, it does something you don't expect it to. Go Alien (1979) style, and have what 3-8 minute moments of tension building (which is extremely genius,) and then finally relieve you and make you think for just the right amount of time "it's safe..." and the BOOMZA!!! Something scary comes out. And it's not just something stupid, it's someone who's been killed most of the time. Not the killer. But sometimes it is the killer, but it's done extremely well. Not to mention, even watching the Unrated version, it's not blood soaked like people make it out to be. Rather, it is just blood dipped. Like a DQ Ice Cream Cone with Chocolate. It doesn't over-power the substance, but there's just enough to make you want it every time you go to Diary Queen. And, the creep factor. I swear to God, this movie is all in the dark. It is one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. The Chi Chi Ha Ha. Perfection! This movie is so extremely awesomely epic epic of epicaheness on so many freaking levels!!!<br /><br />It's got a great "camp" value. The characters aren't the chessyness though. No, the characters are actually extremely awesome (too bad I don't remember their names.) They're funny, they're likable, they're relatable, they're awesome. As you might of guessed, it's the dialogue. But not in the "so bad it's good" sense. More like the "so good it's bad" kinda sense. "Crocodile in the Cabinet." Such an awesome line. This movie has some of the best lines in all of cheesy horror movie history! But this isn't cheesy, this is a mysterious blood deep tension building creepy dramatic beautiful innovative significant MASTERPIECE!!!! (And not to mention it teaches you not to hitchhike.) Speaking of which, in that hitchhiking scene, it kills off the character we think is going to be the star (and I didn't spoil anything for you.) Just like A Nightmare on Elm Street (BOTH VERSIONS.) Not to mention, I never would have predicted a creepy stranger in such a campy car.<br /><br />Most people think having $3X is a natural thing for a killer to put on his "MUST KILL" list. Nope, that is not the villains motivation at all. The $3X scenes are completely useless. (Which takes .05 points off.) (Or, as you would say, .1%) It does become a part of the movie though. These are the rules that you must follow in order to live. Rule #1: Don't wash anything in the sink (to evolve into don't take a shower.) Rule #2: Never Sleep. Rule #3: Don't have $3X. And Rule #4: Don't be in any position that might piss off the killer. (Like, if the villain once got abused by a Police Officer, don't be a Police Officer.) And Rule #5: When someone says they're a messenger of God, THEY'RE A FREAKING MESSENGER OF GOD!!! Onto the next part, do you ever notice that only one of the teenagers reacts to seeing her friends die before her eyes?<br /><br />Also, would you expect a Slasher Film to have a freaking amazing score? It's two steps away from Phillip Glass standards. Just buy the soundtrack, if it's available. If it's not, screw Paramount, they didn't know what they were doing. There's a lot more I want to talk about, but I HAFT to save it for the next review if I wish not to spoil anything. So overall, this is A FREAKING MASTERPIECE. What a wonderful film, it will leave you shaken with shell shock, yet at the same time leave you with a new FREAKING PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE!!! 5.95/5!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In 1957, at Camp Crystal Lake, a young boy named Jason Voorhees drowned. In 1958, two camp counselors were murdered. In 1962, fires and bad water thwarted the camp's reopening. Now, in 1979, Steve Christy finally reopens Camp Crystal Lake with the help of a few new counselors. Ignoring the warnings from a local wacko, the murders start once again while a mysterious stalker prowls the area. This movie has everything appealing about the 80's horror genre and wraps it up neatly into this fantastic horror package. A classic in it's genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>The general consensus seems to be that it's a swindle and that Paramount is once again screwing the fans over.  I guess I half agree with that.  Some of the later films in the series have gotten decent treatments, and some are just outright hosejobs.<br />As far as this "uncut" first film goes, I'd say it depends.  If you have the first pressing that came out years ago, you might be interested in the bonus features depending on how hardcore you are about the series.  If you own the box set, I'd say not to bother.<br />First off, I don't really think it's totally uncut.  "Uncut" in this case is a few extra seconds tacked onto Kevin Bacon's death.  Not all that worth it if you ask me.  I know I've seen some cut scenes that showed a bit more of the gore effects, but I believe that was a European version of the film.  So no, I don't believe this film is truly uncut.<br />The bonus features-A short retrospective "Making Of" segment, which is interesting enough.  There's a n interview with Sean Cunningham, but he doesn't really say anything fans haven't heard before in other documentaries.  Then there's the Lost Tales From Camp Blood Part 1, which is a short segment of a fan made film that tries to mimic the style of the films.  Thankfully it's short coz it's not terribly good.  Then we have the commentary, and this is what pretty much sold me on this disc.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very good at all.  It's one of those commentaries where everyone recorded their parts separately, so there is no interaction.  Some folks might not mind this, but these kinds of commentaries really bug me.  Plus it seems as though none of the commentators are even watching the movie coz nobody ever comments on what is happening onscreen.  I would have liked to have heard more about particular scenes.  It's weird to think I watched an hour and thirty five minute commentary and really learned nothing at all.  In fact I hardly remember any of it.  The commentary is hosted by the dude who wrote Crystal Lake Memories, and he has a bad habit of continuously introducing the commentators before they speak.  You get really sick of hearing: "Adrienne King-who played Alice" before Adrienne King starts speaking.  A big letdown.<br />So, yes, I do believe that fans got the green weenie on this one.  It's really only necessary to purchase this if you don't already own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>It's been 29 years since Friday the 13th hit the screen. 29 years since people first heard the name Jason Voorhees. 29 years is a long time and this film has inspired, in that long time, several sequels, including a 2009 remake. But, does the original horror classic still hold up after 29 years? Surprisingly well actually.<br /><br />Opening at Camp Crystal Lake in 1958, two young camp counselors are brutally murdered. Now, it's Present Day, Friday the 13th of June. Steve Christy (Peter Brouwer) is in the process of fixing up Camp Crystal Lake (called Camp Blood by the locals) and a new batch of counselors have arrived. But someone is killing them one-by-one.<br /><br />It's a typical slasher-film setup with the familiar slasher-film stereotypes. There's Ralph, the town-crazy who warns everybody that crosses his path about the dangers of Camp Crystal Lake. Also, there's not a single actor in the film who went on to have a career of any sort, with the exception of a baby-faced Kevin Bacon, playing one of the potential victims.<br /><br />Friday the 13th was such an influential horror film that it's hard to see the originality in it. In the rare case you haven't actually seen it yet, I can guarantee you've seen something pretty damned close to it. Everyone can tell you the "ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma" sound that plays throughout the film.<br /><br />It was surprising to me that this film is still effective. The music, which no one ever seems to mention, is very effective and really eerie. It's a little reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PP8">Psycho (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a>, but it's not your typical, annoying '80s synthesizer score.<br /><br />Also, the idea of using the camera to frame the perspective of the killer wasn't an entirely new idea, but it's used very well here.<br /><br />Finally, despite it having the distinction of being a highly-parodied performance, Betsy Palmer is actually quite frightening in the few scenes she's in. It's not going to make your blood run cold or anything, but it works.<br /><br />Besides introducing the world to one of the most iconic horror film characters of all time, one of the reasons Friday the 13th has held on much longer than other horror films is it's relative lack of carnage. There is quite a bit of blood, certainly but director Sean S. Cunningham utilizes suspense and atmosphere as well in order to terrify his audience. Rest assured blood & gore junkies...There is still enough here to keep you satisfied.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Friday the 13th is wickedly delicious. The twist ending is definitely the sole reason to watch this '80s classic. Look for a young Kevin Bacon, let's just say he doesn't have a huge part, hint hint! The formula still works, love-sick teenagers get killed one by one at a remote camp and who exactly is the killer? You may be surprised, I highly recommend this cool purchase. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>On June 13, 2008, I celebrated Friday the 13th by watching the first Friday the 13th movie.  Over the ensuing weekend, I watched parts II through IV.  The first four, in my opinion, were the best of the series.  Together, they told an awesome story of an American icon that became a household name!<br /><br />  After watching "Friday the 13th," for what must have been at least the fifth time, I learned that Jason was actually born on June 13th.  Happy birthday Jason Voorhees!!!!  Your mom would've been proud of you if she hadn't lost her head at Crystal Lake!<br /><br />  I can understand why the Terror Trap (an excellent internet museum of classic horror) has "Friday the 13th" listed in their top ten of all time horror greats.  It revolutionized the slasher frenzy of the eighties.  Many directors were influenced by it.  "Friday the 13th" was sandwiched between "Halloween" and "Halloween II."  Because of "Friday the 13th," "Halloween II" had a much higher body count than the original.<br /><br />  What thrilled me the most about "Friday the 13th" is that the killer's face is never shown during the murders.  Only their legs and feet.  Now, after watching it again, it reminds me of the Italian gialli of the early seventies.  An Italian giallo (mystery) generally involved a black-gloved killer whose true identity is never revealed until the end of the film.  Specifically, it reminded me of Mario Bava's giallo, "Bay of Blood" (a.k.a. "Twitch of the Death Nerve") which involves a woods full of greedy relatives and associates killing one another for an inheritance.  Many of the death scenes were imitated in the Friday the 13th movies, especially the first two.  If you haven't seen "Bay of Blood," I recommend that you buy it from Anchor Bay since they have the best version.<br /><br />  "Friday the 13th" and its first three sequels are a must have for fans of slasher movies and Italian gialli.  After more than twenty-five years, it continues to scare me.<br /><br />  Like so many other fans, I can't wait for "Friday the 13th the Series" to be released on DVD.  I'm a little bit apprehensive about the remake scheduled for release on Friday, February 13, 2009, but I'll definitely see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>FRIDAY THE 13TH was the best of the series with a young Kevin Bacon, Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees.<br />I just watched part 6 the other day it is the only Movie in the series next to the first one that actually have kids come to the camp before all the camp staff gets killed.<br />Plus the first one was the most realistic out of the series until when JASON comes back to life.<br />Even though Betsy Palmer was short lived in the series (Part 1) there is no doubt this the best movie in the series.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>This movie still can scare the [....] out of me.

If you don't like this, 80's horror probably isn't the genre for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I've been a fan of this series for many years, and I still believe that this is one of the best in the franchise, even though Jason is no where to be found except at the end cameo. I fully believe that the shock of who the killer goes in the book as one of the best twists in movie history, such as what is learned in the Star Wars movies. The movie itself is really well done, but the musical score takes it to another level and adds so much more horror in it. You can't hear that song at night and not be a little scared, it is one of those songs that puts a chill on the bones when it is heard. The first person view the camera takes as it sees through the eyes of the murderer is really well done, and so are the death scenes. Overall, this is a movie that just doesn't get old not matter how many times I watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>This movie has become one of the most well-known horror movies ever made. It continues to be as popular and scary today as when it was when it was first released in 1980.<br /><br />The story goes like this. Camp Crystal Lake has been shut down for over twenty years.  In 1958, two camp counselors were brutally murdered, and the year before, a young boy drowned in the lake because the counselors were not paying any attention to him.  The boy's name was Jason Voorhies.<br /><br />Fast forward to the "present day".  Steve Christy (Peter Brower) has purchased Camp Crystal Lake with the intention of re-opening it as a campground for inner-city children to spend their summers.  Steve has hired six counselors: Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor), Annie (Robbi Morgan), Ned (Mark Nelson), Claudette (Debra hayes), and Jack (Kevin Bacon).  Their job is to clean up the camp to get it ready for a group of children who are due to be arriving.  Despite the warnings of the camp being called a curse and many of the locals calling it "camp blood", the group presses on with their work.<br /><br />Soon, however, this peaceful campground once again turns into a nightmare as the camp counselors are mercilessly killed until only Alice is left.  As she tries to escape, she is confronted by a woman who introduces herself as Mrs. Voorhies.  Initially, Alice is relieved, but her relief quickly turns to terror as she discovers that Mrs. Voorhies is the one who is responsible for the deaths of the others.  Will Alice survive, or will she meet the same fate as her friends?<br /><br />This movie and its nine highly successful sequels have become classics of the horror movie genre.  What makes this movie so scary is that the majority of the action takes place in the dark, so the fear factor is heightened by the absence of daylight.  The rolling thunderstorm also adds to the suspense.  The story of the movie is excellent, and the young boy in the lake will become legendary in the films that followed this one.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  The level of terror and suspense is quite high throughout the movie, and the story is very good.  This movie is a must-see for horror movie fans, as well as all of the successful sequels that followed.  Watch this movie and meet one of the true legends of horror films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>I have a very vivid memory of being 8 years old and sitting on the floor of my parents' living room, with the "weekend" section of the Post open in front of me. There is an advert for a movie called "Friday the 13th." It depicted a drawing of some anxious-looking teens standing in a group in front of a lonely cabin, surrounded by sinster woods, with a moon-silvered lake in the background. Superimposed over this was the silhouette of an adrogynous figure holding a knife. The caption read: "They were warned. They are doomed. And on Friday the 13th, nothing can save them."<br /><br />Of course I had no idea that this "disposable" low-budget horror flick would make a mountain of dough and be exploited mercilessly in an endless parade of increasingly formulaic and stupid sequels. Neither did star Betsy Palmer, who said of her decision to take the role as Mrs. Voorhees: "I didn't like the script, I didn't understand the movie and I thought the whole thing was crap, but I needed a new car. Plus I figured no one would ever see it." My own first experience with the series came five years later when I saw "Part V: A New Beginning", which begs the question of why the hell I ever watched the rest of them. I must say I'm glad I did, because otherwise I wouldn't have caught this immortal slasher classic.<br /><br />"Friday" is the story of a man named Steve Christie who is attempting to start up a summer camp for inner-city kids in a remote place called Crystal Lake. Christie is what you would call obsessed with this idea, and proceeds despite the evil history of the place (a double murder 20 years before and a long series of incidents since) as well as warnings from a local nutjob named Crazy Ralph, who blathers on about a "Death Curse" that hangs over the area. [this constinutes the 'THEY WERE WARNED' part of the advertisement, and Ralph should have heeded it: he gets a barbed-wire neck massage in "Part II"]<br /><br />Enter a group of nubile twentysomethings who are the camp staff. [THEY ARE DOOMED] These kids unwittingly go about camp business, which seems mainly to involve smoking pot, drinking beer, and premarital sex (can I go to this camp?) while they are stalked and viciously murdered one-by-one by an unseen killer (on second thought, never mind). Plucky actress Adrienne King stumbles on the identity of the axe, knife, & arrow-wielding psycho a bit too late to get any help from co-stars like a young Kevin Bacon, who himself discovers a might too late that the someone under his bed ain't the tooth fairy. [ON FRIDAY THE 13TH NOTHING CAN SAVE THEM]<br /><br />There was, of course, not much original (even in 1980) with this Ten Little Indians" approach. And there are a few moments of "horror-movie stupidity" which are so glaring that you aren't even sorry to see the victims get theirs. For example, towards the end of the film, the two surviving characters, not having noticed that everyone is dead, go into a friend's cabin. She is gone, and in her bed in a bloodstained axe. When they go back outside, they finally discover everyone else is missing and the car has been disabled. At this point many would be alarmed into, say, caution. The guy says: "I'm sure there's a perfectly rational explantion for all of this!" Of course there is, dumbass, it's that there's a killer on the loose! Then the power is cut, whereupon this blockhead volunteers to go to the spooky power shed by himself in the dark....and the girl lets him. (Possibly she wanted him to "distract" the killer while she got away.) Furthermore, the number of times Adrienne King beats down Betsy Palmer and has her helpless, only to then run away and let her get back up again, gave me the feel that the scriptwriter might have worked for pro wrestling before he turned his pen to horror. Honey, JUST FINISH HER OFF.<br /><br />Stuff like this could have derailed the movie. What made it work was the little things: 1) The music. Nobody who has ever heard "ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha" can ever forget it. 2) The cinematography. Especially brilliant use was made of characters emerging slowly, at a great distance, from complete darkness (and later, in the running-away scenes, of them submerging into it, as if sinking into the depths of a black lake: incredibly creepy and effective). 3) The inventiveness of the murders: in "Part VI" there is a scene, actually two scenes, where Jason simply kicks in a door and murders the woman behind it. That type of thing fortunately doesn't happen here (just ask Kevin Bacon).<br /><br />"Friday" isn't like its successors. There's no Jason (excactly), no hockey mask, and the body count is a very modest half-dozen, two of which are offscreen. The identity of the killer itself is hidden until the very end. If the whole "pot/beer/sex = death" formula seems incredibly hackneyed nonetheless, it always helps to remember that this was one of the films that wrote it.</p></br><a href="../users/AFOK05KDCHSHL.html">AFOK05KDCHSHL</a><br/><p>FRIDAY THE 13th<br /><br />(USA - 1980)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />Theatrical soundtrack: Mono<br /><br />In the wake of revisionist splatter movies like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, it may be difficult for today's audiences to imagine how much the modern horror genre owes to Sean S. Cunningham's seminal splatter movie. Borne from the success of HALLOWEEN (1978), Cunningham's film reworked the template set down by John Carpenter, placing a group of vulnerable teens in an isolated location (in this instance, a run-down summer camp plagued by a series of unexplained 'accidents') before unleasing a deadly, unstoppable force against them. Cunningham underlined the element of mystery and suspense by hiring makeup wiz Tom Savini - fresh from his groundbreaking work on DAWN OF THE DEAD - to stage a series of elaborately gruesome set-pieces. This potent combination knocked mainstream audiences sideways, and the film was a huge success, spearheading a wave of independent horror films which dominated movie screens in the early 1980s and spawned a slew of sequels and rip-offs which continue to this day, to a point where the original film has become somewhat lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />Viewed objectively, FRIDAY THE 13th is perhaps a little too slow-burning for its own good. Victor Miller's one-dimensional script allows the gory murders to punctuate a labored narrative which takes too long in setting out its meagre stall. Too much time is wasted on petty details - characters make coffee, wander in the woods, hunt for snakes in the cabins, etc. - while a ubiquitous Evil Presence lurks ominously nearby. However, once the stage has been set and the mayhem begins, this deceptively simple premise comes into its own, and Cunningham cranks up the tension for a show-stopping finale which raised terrified audiences from their seats duting the film's initial run. Production values are functional but effective, distinguished by Harry Manfredini's instantly recognizable score ("ch-ch-ch!") - a memorable variation obn PSYCHO's shrieking violins - and Barry Abrams' unobtrusive cinematography, which makes a real virtue of the woodland locations.<br /><br />The cast includes a young Kevin Bacon and Harry Crosby (Bing's grandson), and Walt Gorney parlays the cliched character of 'Crazy Ralph' (a prophet of doom) into something of a cult figure. But the show belongs to veteran Betsy Palmer as Mrs. Voorhees, an old friend of the camp's owner, whose arrival late in the film gives the proceedings a much-needed kick up the backside. Oh, and watch out for Ari Lehman, making the kind of splashy entrance that most other movie stars would kill for...<br /><br />Over the years, "Friday" has been a useful tool for critics to bash the horror genre, citing it as an example of all that's bad in modern moviemaking. Even the trailer seems to have its tongue firmly embedded in its cheek ("You may only see it once, but that will be enough!"). But for all its faults, the film has aged gracefully, and the shocks and scares still have the power to take unwary viewers by surprise.<br /><br />Followed by FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2 (1981) and what seems like several thousand other sequels...</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King star in Sean Cunningham's<br />1980 horror film.

I realize it's the original and it started the franchise, but I feel like something is missing. As much of a Jason fan that I am, I always viewed this one as the one in the franchise missing the key ingredient. That has always kinda made me overlook this film until I'm finally sitting down and watching it.  The uncut version is a bit of a tease as I think with the uncut scenes we get an extra eight to ten seconds of extended footage of a few of the kills. It's nice to see the best parts of the film the way they were meant to be seen, but it won't make me rush out and buy the new DVD at full price. I'll wait for the price to go down or find a used copy at a more reasonable price. I'm not taking anything away from this film though. It's still a lot of fun and I enjoy it. I'm just a sucker for Jason, I guess.<br /><br />Rating - 6.5/10</p></br></body></html>

Like many other film fans out there I face a struggle at times trying to justify the double-dip from the dvd or even the vhs but this release sure made it easy for me.  Firstly, I'm a big fan of digibooks and indeed anything that is as far removed from the usual dvd release as possible.  The content is usually very informative and useful and it is certainly the case here.  Secondly, to have both the Director's Cut AND the Thearetical Release versions here is joyful for the fan (George Lucas try to contain your greed and take note!).  Thirdly, this film has been restored admirably and looks excellent and hence way scarier in 1080p although for some reason the picture quality seemed a little better for the thearetical release as compared with the director's cut and I'm assuming that it's because the missing bits that were added for the latter were poorly preserved and so to fit in with the rest of the frames some extra work was needed that brought the quality down a little as compared with the former version but I'm merely guessing here.<br /><br />The sound quality for both versions though in wonderful DTS HD MA 5.1 surround is simply stunning and certainly beyond reproach.  As to the various cuts argument I personally would have done a different "Reviewer's Cut" although I have to say that the original thearetical version was pretty well done already but I do have some sympathy with Blatty.  For my "Reviewer's Cut" version, I would leave out the "spider on the staircase" scene and perhaps the extended ending with the policeman but I would keep some of the ending like when the priest tells the mother to keep Karas' medal and perhaps just end it a little after that just before the policeman shows up.  I would also keep the staircase dialogue between the exorcists as I do agree with Blatty that it is a key scene and I disagree with Friedkin that it is "understood" or "stating the obvious"; sometimes with filmgoers you need to state the obvious for emphasis and I feel that to be the case here.  I would leave out the additional scene of Karas playing the recording of Regan's normal voice as in that case I feel it was not necessary to show how normal Regan was because I think we get it already from the beginning of the film although I would keep the added footage of the mother talking with the doctors.  There you have it!  This reviewer's cut! But all in all if I had to choose between the two I'd say the Thearetical Version is good as is that is until my Reviewer's Cut is made :-)<br /><br />This film shocked me and when I first saw even the censored version of it years ago as a child I have to say it bothered me no end and led to many a sleepless night but as I grew older and hence better able to see the bigger picture I've come to realise that this is a great love story with many facets to show that Good always triumphs over Evil and that even if it may seem that Evil wreaks all kinds of calamity and havoc and has the upper hand but in the final analysis Good still wins.  In the end, the priest who lost his faith gains redemption through imitating his model Jesus Christ; in taking onto himself all of the evil inhabiting the child and dying for her salvation he does on a smaller scale what Christ did in taking on all the evils of the entire world onto himself and dying for it so that it may be redeemed and live in spiritual freedom again.  Also in the example of Karas and the entire experience I think we can safely say that Regan's mother is no longer an aetheist!  I guess there are no aetheists in foxholes and in demonic possession!  It was very touching watching this transformation of Karas' character from the start of the film to the very end.  For me the most important and most memorable scene of the entire film was the one at the bottom of the stairs after the older priest sends Karas out of the room because he was not cutting it and when the mother asks if Regan was going to die and as if in a Garden of Gethsemane moment Karas steels himself and decides no way!  I'm going to save that child no matter what and just like Jesus going from Gethsamane to his death on the cross Karas goes from the bottom of the stairs up to the room where he dies to save the child.  Beautiful!<br /><br />Next to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JNNDGA">The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] this film is a great picture to encourage Christians everywhere.  All the demon succeeded in doing was to give yet another opportunity for Self-Sacrificing Goodness to exhibit itself and bring Hope instead of the Despair that was intended as was so well put by von Sydow in the dialogue on the stairs scene that should have been kept in the original version.<br /><br />Yes, it is still the scariest film ever seen and made scarier with the 1080p and the DTS HD MA 5.1 surround treatment and yet it is among the more hopeful films that I have ever seen as well making this among the top 10 films that I've ever seen as well.<br /><br />Very disturbing if you are seeing it for the first time and I can only imagine how much more of the case that was in the 1970s but if you pay attention to the characters and all the storylines it is also among the most rewarding film experiences that you are likely to have.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I read somewhere that Martin Scorsese compiled a list of the 10 most scariest movies of all time and I wouldn't be surprised if the 1974 shocker is on his list. Director William Friedkin assembled an excellent cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn (Oscar nominated), Lee J. Cobb, Jason Miller (Oscar nominated) and Max Von Sydow for this classic thriller. The disc is close to perfection with just a few scenes there is some grain but overall one will be pleased with this transfer--just don't watch this alone at night!</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>I have always heard of this movie but never saw it until recently. A good, strong story the Exorcist is about a young girl who becomes possessed by a demon (or something!) and her mother seeks out a Catholic priest to perform an exorcism to banish it. The acting in the film is first-rate and makes the characters feel real where many movies like this would have made them 2-dimensional. The videography was also awesome. The only two weaknesses I feel is the pace of the film (which is slow at some parts but it allows for good character development) and some plot points which never seem resolved. They are minor but irritating. For instance, what was the relevency to the opening location? You never really find out but I'm sure the novel probably makes it clear. Well worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>It's really hard to name every single horror film that's ever been made. Many deal with zombies, ghosts, serial killers, classic monsters like Frankenstein, and mutated species. Some are classic, others are mediocre, and several are ridiculous and dull. Out of all of them, only a few have been recognized as the greatest in the genre. The Exorcist, Psycho, and The Shining have been rightfully praised for the terrors that they have conveyed. Dozens of others have never topped them ever since they were released. While my favorite horror film of all time is actually The Shining, I can perfectly understand why The Exorcist is considered the best. First of all, is has an unusual storyline (back in the 70's, at least). Instead of ghosts or zombies or werewolves, it's demon possession. The body of a young girl is being controlled by a spirit from Hell. With every medical analysis being inconclusive, the mother has one last chance of bringing her daughter back. She brings in Father Karras, who has a crisis of faith, and Father Merrin, who has seen this sort of prediction when he visited Iraq.<br /><br />So why is it that this is considered the scariest movie of all time. Well, the shock effects may be outdated to some, but it's the eerie atmosphere and the thought of being possessed that makes it truly horrifying. The silent, quick shots of the infamous "Captain Howdy" are also an addition to this ghoulish nightmare. You don't need loud and abrupt music or hardcore gore, all you need here is a creepy environment, a slow pace, and some fiendish dialogue from Regan/the demon. Mind you, there are some great modern horror films (such as Rec, The Evil Dead series, and the original Thai version of Shutter), but The Exorcist, The Shining, and Psycho are in top form when it comes to scaring the s*** out of you. The Exorcist, especially, is one that is truly scary because of its controversial subject matter. The finest, no doubt.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"The Exorcist" came out on Boxing Day, 1973 and immediately became a boxoffice phenomenon. Highly regarded by critics and fans as the best thriller ever made, "The Exorcist" tells of a true story in which a 12 year old girl is possessed by satan. The movie is also one of the best movies ever made, with amazing performances by all the leads, especially Ellen Burstyn who plays the mother, and Linda Blair who plays the little girl. The movie also won 2 Oscars, one for sound and the other for the screenplay. I also believe both Burstyn and Blair were robbed of Academy Awards for their roles, as some had a hard time with the posession that took place in the story. The movie is about the forces of good and evil in the world and the eventual outcome of that battle. There have also been other sequels and pre-quels to "The Exorcist", but they are all inferior to the original. The follow up "The Exorcist 2" is regarded as one of the worst films ever, although Linda Blair is in it. Ellen Burstyn refused to be a part of it as she felt the script was awful.<br /> This DVD release also features 11 minutes of extra scenes that were omitted from the original release, which also contains the horrifying "spider walk" sequence.<br /> Not appearing on this disc, unfortunately, is the amazing BBC documentary on the making of "The Exorcist", that was featured on the 1998 25th Anniversary Edition of the movie. If you can find that edition grab it as the documentary is informative and interesting.<br /> Also, Ellen Burstyn's autobiography called "Lessons In Becoming Myself" is a wonderful read and she goes into detail on how she got the role of Chris McNeil and the trouble the cast and crew found themselves in while making it.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>this movie is wicked creepy. i loved it, it paved the way for all these other excorsism movies, but this one is definitly the best. the actors were great, the story was so believable, the makeup was good, and it was truly scary. not much can do that these days, but this one still can. a young innocent girls bodies possessed, killing her off slowly, making her do all these horrible things to herself. the mother helpless what does she do. her last resource the church. the priests who give their lives to help. the oldest battle in the book: good against evil. they must do all they can to save this little girl. all the while being taunted and lured by this demonic creature. excellent story and brilliant idea. from start to finish this movie was great. don't mess with things you don't understand. the head twisting scene: WICKED.</p></br><a href="../users/A32B206L2SEXRA.html">A32B206L2SEXRA</a><br/><p>I have always loved The Exorcist.The first time I watched it,it scared the hell out of me,particulary because I watched it in the dark.The next few times weren't scary,because I knew what was coming.But it still sent chills through my spine.The film begins with the elderly Father Merrin at an archeological dig,in which he finds an ancient demonic sculpture.He then knows that he must confront a great evil.Meanwhile,in Georgetown,Washington,young Regan is about to get a not-so-pleasant surprise.In the space of a n hour,she urinates on the rug,vomites on an unsuspecting preist,and uses profanity in ways we could not have thought a 12 year old could use.But,hey,anything's possible.You'll love this chiller/thriller/horror/suspense flick that I call sensational.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>After all these years, this film still frightens me.  Something about that little girl strapped to the bed possessed by an unspeakable evil.  The exorcism itself is timeless, and still brings me nightmares.  The rest of the film shows a bit of age, but it is a well acted and produced film.  The additional scenes are good additions and enhance the film rather than take away.  For any fan of horror, this film is a must.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>A great little update of sorts for The Exorcist, featuring a half hour documentary [Very intriguing, especially if you liked the movie] on the making of the movie with interviews from the cast and crew. Now on to the movie itself, which is great of course. For any horror fan, this has to be considered as the ultimate movie. Upon seeing it again years later, I still get goosebumps and I can't imagine people laughing at it in recent screenings. It has and is no comedy.<br /><br /> The female leads are excellent, particularly Linda Blair in the infamous role as Reagan, the possessed child. Mercedes Mcambridge is excellent in the horrific role as the demon's voice, and Ellen Burstyn gives a very believeable and respectable performance as the obviously distressed mother. The priests as well, Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are also excellent. However, if you take offense to or have very strong religous beliefs, then this movie may offend you. Just a warning.<br /><br /> The famous parts of this movie are the effects [Spinning head, demonic face, flying vomit and then some], and the excellent score all around. The effects still hold up well today, although the shock value has obviously been lessened. The score itself is chilling, the best since Psycho. Jack Nitzche does an excellent job with it and should have been awarded for his work. The novel has been excellently adapted to fit the screen by Blatty, the screenplay is believeable and excellent, and the novel is another must for any fans of the horror genre.<br /><br /> Overall, the scares in this movie are frequent and the very thought alone can scare some people. I'd say rent it for any real movie fan, but don't say I didn't warn you if you think its over the top. To me however, this movie is perfect and could not have been made better, and I hope others can recognize the talent and hardwork that went into this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>I wrote a review for this once, but a lot of people hated it and even I hated it! So I'm going to write a new review for this movie.<br /><br /> "The Exorcist is about the demon, "Pazuzu" possesing 12-year old Regan McNeil. When she starts acting weird, Regan's mom takes her to get a check-up. The doctors find nothing wrong with her. Soon, she gets more possesed, saying a stream of swear words and doing supernatural things. Mom calls for some priests to drive Pazuzu out of her. There's a lot more to the story, but I want not to spoil it all.<br /><br /> The Exorcist is very spooky. One thing that chills my blood is when they find, "Help me" written on possesed Regan's chest. What chills me about that is the freaky "music" that you hear when you see it. Very chilling if you turn the volume up.<br /><br /> This movie is also filled with disturbing images. One that is disturbing is when Regan stabs herself in the v@gina with a crusfix saying, "Let Jesus $^$^ you!!!" Another disturbing image is when Regan spiderwalks down the stairs and blood pours out of her mouth.<br /><br /> During the movie, a face appears for about a few seconds. It has white skin, ugly yellow teeth, and blood-shot eyes. It appears about 4 times during the movie. Can you find them all?<br /><br /> The DVD features could have been better. Some trailers, [not for the original version] a commentary, [ all he does is tell the story. Nothing else] and some other stuff.<br /><br /> I have not seen the original version, only TVYNS. I might just see the original, though.<br /><br /> You can buy this and its sequels together at a Walmart for about 20$. So get them, NOW!</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>Well, considering it's Halloween night and this is the last of my "31 Reviews For 31 Days of October" review-fest, I figure I'll end this countdown with one of the absolute most well-known horror movies of all time, and certainly one of the most horrifying, "The Exorcist". Although many quotes, stunts and ideas from this movies have been taken and parodied ("The power of Christ compels!" comes to mind.), this movie nevertheless has the power and terror that basically defines the horror movie genre.<br /><br />Watching "The Exorcist" all the way through is more like an experience than watching a movie. For one thing, the general idea of the movie is a plausible concept, and having been to a paranormal speaker just last night, who ironically spoke of and showed a video of an exorcism for which she witnessed, this sort of thing is not entirely impossible, although it almost never happens. I don't want to dwindle on this part too much, but also regarding that I'm Roman Catholic, this movie definitely hits home with me.<br /><br />But back to the movie itself. It kicks off with a scene that takes place in Egypt if I'm not mistaken, on an excavation dig with the foreign scenery setting a mood and atmosphere that carries throughout the whole movie. Starting the movie like this is an interesting idea, and a concept that hasn't been done too much by other movies, even though it works here. The acting throughout is phenomenal, alongside the special effects, which goes without saying. The whole movie plays out like a terrifying, dark, atmospheric nightmare and never loses its intensity or interest, even in the slower moments. I must say, even though I personally sometimes find it tedious to sit through a movie that goes over two hours long, I think "The Exorcist" definitely has the hudspah (spelling?) to make it pull you in for the whole thing. As dark and terrifying as this movie is, it most certainly still packs a brilliance, alongside talented writing and directing that makes it worth the watch.<br /><br />In short, "The Exorcist" is a film that's just as horrifying as it is both groundbreaking and vastly interesting. Such a movie deserves to go down as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and considering I'm a guy who's seen countless horror movies, I agree with that statement. Well, the review's about up, but for those that haven't seen such a heart-pounding, groundbreaking, interest-stirring movie yet, this is very highly recommended. And before you sleep, say some prayers just for safety!!! Happy Halloween, everybody, I'm off to smother myself in Halloween candies, household props and going around all evening in my pajama pants. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I grew up in the 1970's and was a complete monster movie fan (I lived for Double Chiller Theatre on late-night TV every Friday!)--but I knew to wait until I got older to see THE EXORCIST. Listening to how the adults reacted to it, that creepy music, the ominous poster--I just knew to keep clear.<p>When I eventually saw it, I realized that this was the best horror film ever made.<br />That THE EXORCIST was left off the American Film Institute's "100 Greatest Films of All-Time" is an omission that casts doubt on the entire list.<p>This is one of those classic films where EVERYTHING works: the writing, the directing, the acting, etc. The extras on the DVD are extensive and fascinating (you can tell both William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty cared about every second of this film).<br />Most great horror films will have you turning on lights and peeking around corners, but THE EXORCIST will make you afraid to close your eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>The Exorcist stands in the most hallowed of halls when it comes to horror, having been voted as recently as 1999 the scariest movie of all time by fans.  I envy those who find this film so remarkably frightening, as it really doesn't strike me as particularly scary - unsettling at times, but not scary.  The addition of twelve minutes of new footage plus a remastering of the soundtrack make The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen) the definitive movie adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel of demonic possession.  The additional material brings the film much more in line with Blatty's original vision, and I find it a little strange that director William Friedkin seems to get most of the credit for this new version of the film when he was the one who cut the respective scenes in the first place and, in some cases, resisted their inclusion in this special re-release.  <p>The plot should be familiar to just about everyone.  Linda Blair, in a truly remarkable performance, plays Regan MacNeil, the sweet and innocent twelve-year-old daughter of actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) who becomes possessed by a demon.  Jason Miller is Father Karras, a Jesuit priest battling his own demons of guilt over his mother's final days on earth and starting to lose his faith at the constant scenes of misery he sees all around him.  After all medical and psychiatric tests and treatments fail to stop Regan's utter deterioration into a disturbed abomination of a child, Chris contacts Father Karras in an effort to arrange an exorcism.  Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, the pinnacle of good in this film who has battled this demon before and won; he is the exorcist in this ultimate battle of good versus evil.<p>The Exorcist truly is a powerful movie experience, filled with several of the most shocking scenes to ever appear on film.  I was surprised that so many of the more controversial aspects of the story actually made it from novel to screen, especially in the original 1973 incarnation of the film.  It's really impossible for me to say which is better, the film or the novel.  There are several subplots and very significant details in the novel that did not make it to the big screen, and a few little things in the movie are hard to interpret outside the context of the novel.  Among the most disturbing images in this film are those of the medical tests Regan undergoes after the onset of her problems.  I find it much easier to watch the most graphic scenes wherein the demon within Regan attacks her and those around her, although Regan's appearance is shockingly horrible in the later stages of her possession.  The demonic manifestations and exorcism are done extremely well in the movie; Friedkin did a much more powerful and convincing job than my own imagination in terms of showing the demonic manifestations.  The movie adds several things to the exorcism itself that do not appear in the novel and, by and large, gives the exorcism itself more prevalence than Blatty himself did, yet it also manages to capture and express quite well the inner struggle and soul-rending doubts and fears of Father Karras.  This inner struggle of good vs evil, of faith vs hopelessness strikes me as the heart of this story, and the movie communicates this surprisingly well.<p>The added scenes in this updated version of the film are crucial to the integrity of the story, though there are of course other fans who will argue that the new scenes do damage to the power and vision of the original.  The film is just too rushed without the new footage, and the original film strikes a discordant note with Blatty's authorial vision.  The most memorable scene that, until now, was not shown in the movie was the spiderwalk scene wherein Regan climbs down the stairs in an impossible and deliciously creepy position; I can't imagine for the life of me how that scene could have been left out of the original film.  I had several questions along these lines, so I made it a point to listen to the film's commentary by director William Friedkin.  Friedkin's initial discussion of the filming of the opening scene in Iraq is fascinating, but throughout the rest of the film he does little more than summarize what is happening, oftentimes quoting characters line for line.  I think he makes a couple of misstatements about what we are seeing, and much to my surprise he offers motivations for the characters that I disagree with rather strongly.  He tells us nothing about the making of the film, offers no praise for Linda Blair, says nothing about the ways in which the demonic scenes were produced, and mentions the new additions to the film only in passing if at all.  There is very little &quot;making of&quot; material among all the DVD features, which is the one disappointment I take with me from this release of what is arguably the most significant and famous horror movie ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Thirty years later and I still find &quot;The Exorcist&quot; a powerful, disturbing, and amazing work of art.  William Friedkin's direction is superb, the score including Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS still one of the best, and the whole project an exercise in terror.  Let's go beyond the obvious special effects and the frightening possession of Regan McNeil, and look at the stunning performances Friedkin elicited.<br />Ellen Burstyn is outstanding; her mother role goes from the pampered movie star trying to stay close to her daughter to the pure terror of seeing her child possessed by Satan.<br />Jason Miller in his guilt-ridden role of Father Karras is mesmerizing.  Tormented and doubting his faith, he nonetheless conquers these and propels the movie's grueling climax.<br />Max von Sydow as Father Merrin is brilliant in his subtle performance of a man near death faced with the unbelievable task of exorcising not just a demon, but the devil himself.<br />Linda Blair's performance is all the more amazing in that as everyone knows, Mercedes McCambridge mouthed the demon's voice, but Linda was there physically and her agony (especially in those awful hospital tests) demonstrates what potential she had, that was unfortunately never fully tapped in later films.<br />Kitty Winn as Burstyn's personal assistant was also very good in a supporting, almost invisible role.<br />And let's not forget Lee J. Cobb as Kinderman, a cop with a heart and soul a great pickup line.<br />THE EXORCIST has never been duplicated for its gut-wrenching horror and it's ability to creep under your skin no matter how often you've seen it.<br />A true classic in any genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>I love The Exorcist - always have.  I have purchased all the versions along the way - vhs, dvd, extended version.  But now that most films I purchase are blu rays I was thrilled at the release of The Exorcist on blu ray.  There is always a simple first question to be asked when an older film is released on blu ray.  Was it a quick hatchet job merely to make more money off the film or was it a lovingly done restoration taking advantage of the new technology of blu ray.  I can gladly 1000% say that this one is handled with loving care.  The film looks amazing.  Color and the black/white ration is amazing.  Close ups throughout will have you awestruck.  It honestly is like viewing the film for the first time.  And they so impressively left the grainy parts intact.  This is a film over 30 years old and they could have easily erased all signs of age.  But some of the graininess in dark or night footage is necessary to the telling of the story and they left it as it should be.  Audio is superb and your home theater system will have a field day with the dramatic audio here.  Dialogue is also pefectly presented and not off from the musical backdrop or extrememe sound of the violent scenes.<br /><br />Now to the effects.  Remember that this film is decades old and special effects have grown leaps and bounds.  Here we get all of the scenes with Reagan totally cleaned up and let me tell you none of the frightening aspect is gone.  The only thing I noticed was how the blood was obviously red paint.  Otherwise this film is in no way dated and the blu ray version in fact raises it to another level.  I was amazed at how my perceptioon of the film changed due to this amazing version.  I think it is a huge gift that both the original theatrical version and the later extended director's cut are presented here in blu ray glory.  I prefer the theatrical version so that is the version I am speaking of.  I think that The Exorcist often gets misconstrued being described as a pure horror film.  It is so much more than this.  It is true that film makers have been trying to duplicate the effect of this film ever since.  From Scream, Halloween and Friday the 13 directors are trying to reach the same effect.  But by doing this they are missing the whole point.<br /><br />Viewing the film this time was the first time I saw how obviously it is a film of good versus evil and each viewer will have a different perception.  The Catholic Church plays a huge part and obviously represents the good and it works so well.  The viewer must see the Church as a religious presence and the nurturing it represented before all the tragic issues that would later arise within the church.  The priests here are good men, some troubled but all wanting to do their best.  Regan is perfectly displayed as an innocent without rubbing it in the viewers face.  From the beginning scene it is obvious that evil is being shown and as it wraps itself inside Regan it is terrifying.  The special effects still work for they are used to add to the story and meaning of the film.  They are not meant to be gratuituous.  In a world with such trouble this films clearly shows that there is good and evil.  The viewer is left with much to think about after viewing this superb blu ray version.<br /><br />I know people have double and triple dipped on The Exorcist but I cannot praise the blu ray release highly enough.  And it is handsomely presented in a hardback booklet with 38 pages of history on the film inside.  And there are special effects galore.  There is a new 3 part documentary on the film's production and legacy plus a feature length 1998 documentary on the making of the film with so much more.  The Exorcist is indeed a horror film but it is so much more.  It is one of the best movies made of any genre and deserves to be in any film collectors library.  And this blu ray version does immense justice to a classic.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>Being a huge horror movie fan, I've seen hundreds of horror movies but not one of them, besides this movie, ever made me say " I will never watch this movie again!!". I give this movie 5 stars only because no other movie has ever come close to the horror The Exorcist portrays. I've seen other "possession" movies but none hold a candle to the horror of this film. I must admit that for a 1973 film, the special effects are outstanding. Linda Blair, as young as she was, actually did a wonderful job portraying Reagan, a young girl possessed by the devil. The beginning of the movie is quite boring until we see Reagan's bed start jumping all around. From that point on, we see her go through a battery of tests trying to figure out what is wrong with her. You really feel for her mother who has to witness the terrible things happening to her daughter. There are scenes from this movie that are forever sketched in my mind unfortunately! From her head spinning around, the awful devil voice she speaks in, the green eyes with the scariest face I've ever seen, spitting up pea soup in a priest's face, her levitating above her bed, her bedroom being so cold that "smoke" actually comes out of your mouth, her taunting of the priests, her throwing a priest out of her bedroom window, and the worst to me being the part where she is sitting there covering her mouth and laughing at it all. The exorcism ritual is awful to watch when the priest throws holy water on her and her flesh opens up. The language also in the film is horrific. With her speaking in different languages, it adds to the creepiness of the movie. Another awful memory is when she sits up in her bed and we see the devil behind her. Ewwwwwww.... I'm getting the creeps just writing about this. The only good thing about the movie is that the exorcism is sucessful and she has no memory of what happened to her yet she hugs a priest at the end of the movie when she and her mother leave the home. Of course there have been sequels and prequels to this movie but there will never be another movie that even comes close to scaring the "devil" out of you like this movie does. Definetly not a movie for children to watch. Talk about nightmares! For anyone who has not seen this classic horror movie, just beware!! It's not a movie for everyone and many people who have not seen this movie might be really effected.... like I was but.......never again!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Ever get sick of the "horror" movies lately? Where some guys snoops around an old house/abandoned building/graveyard etc in the dark and some guy pops out of the screen and goes "HEY!"? Well these are called jump scenes or gotcha moments where it makes the audience jump. The recent movies are just this though and that's the problem: too many scenes trying to scare you when the film itself should do so, not the combined effect of individual scenes. The Exorcist was one of those films that doesn't really have any jump moments but there was enough in it to unnerve you a bit.<br /><br />All's well in a nice house in the States except one thing: a young girl named Regan is possessed by a demon. Her odd demeanor certainly alarms her mother, an actress, as well as other housemates. Eventually Father Karras is called in as well as Priest Merrin to try and perform an exorcism to rid Regan of the demon.<br /><br />Maybe it's just my standards have gotten a bit higher, or maybe the infamous scenes and images in the film have been parodied so many times that it takes away the shock of everything. Granted the film is unnerving and of course the subject matter isn't all fluffyness but the film didn't make me go "holy crap!". In fact the only time I ever jumped was when the sound got incredibly and a bit unneccesarily loud for one moment.<br /><br />The film however shines in its acting with Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow and of course Linda Blair. Unlike Jennifer Carpenter in Emily Rose, Linda didn't supply her odd voice but someone else but it still works as well anyway. The infamous spider walk scene has been restored and it's probably one of the more well-known scenes that was not in a film.<br /><br />Disappointly are the extras which are basically 2-3 pages of text about things. No interviews? There is a commentary but not having making ofs or at least a retrospective would've helped.<br /><br />Watch this one and avoid the 2nd one but give the 3rd a try, especially to watch the nurse scene, creeeppppy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>Only a few deleted scenes have been added to this classic movie, but they truly improve upon the original!<br /><br />the "spider-walk" will give you goose-bumps.<br /><br />The added dialogue scenes are also essential. Reagan's doctor appointment depicts her initial change as subtle... from a sweet girl to a foul mouthed brat. Father Merrin gives his opinion and how... or why... God allows such horrors as demon possession. And the new conclusion featuring Father Dyer and Kinderman is more comforting than the "lone man looking down the stairs" ending.<br /><br />The version you've never seen captures the spirit of Blatty's novel, and seems less ambiguous than Freidkin's original. When one watches the original, one can't help but get the impression that Freidkin celebrates the triumph of evil over good. The subtle changes in this film let us realize that evil can occasionally win the battle, but will never win the war.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>The Exorcist succeeds on every level. This film should have swept the Oscars. The acting, and direction was beyond top rate, William Freidkin coaxed masterful performances from all of his actors. It works because we believe in Regan and her actress mom, they are real people like us, as is Father Karras and everyone else involved. We are seeing ourselves on the big screen. What happens to these people is the most terrifying thing that can happen to anyone, especially parents. What do you do when your kid is losing her sanity? You start to question yours as your world slowly falls apart, and no one can help, especially not doctors and head shrinks. But demonic possession? Is it real? Who really knows. But Regan's mother is desperate for any solution. And then the film begins to terrorize, to turn into the darkest nightmares. This film chilled audiences in the 70's to the bone, and I can see why. Freidkin uses subliminal images, and horrifying make up to tell a tale of demonic possession that strikes a raw nerve. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I have seen "The Exorcist" several tims, and picked up "the version you've never seen" when it hit the shelves last year. It's amazing how this landmark movie still holds it's power 30 years after it's initial release. I will not bother to try and do this film justice with an amateur review, and unless you have been hiding under a rock for the last 3 decades you most likely know what the story is about. But I would like to touch on two things, the added scenes in the latest version are great. As if you needed any more reason the feel sympathy for Regan, watching her go through the medical tests is just awful. Linda Blair just does such a great job in this movie, it's really a shame her career took such a nose-dive. The other aspect of the film that I really enjoyed with this new DVD package was the soundtrack. It was like watching a "new" movie with enhanced audio, and with surround sound "Tubular Bells" has never sounded better. This film may not be for everyone (my wife still refuses to watch it), but if you have the nerves to handle it...well the newest version is well worth the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>WOW...this is what a great...GREAT blu ray issue should be.  This two disc set features much to enjoy. Both the original theatrical version and extended versions are here and look ..well ridiculously good, better than they ever did and the note included from Director William Friedkin speaks to that work. The NEW bonus features are really truly the mother lode...containing not only new interviews with the main contributors in front of and behind the camera but loads of exciting behind the scenes footage showing just how all these incredible effects and make up etc were achieved. This is housed in a classy book with great photos and bios and all for about $25 ...I would say that THIS is a prime example of a 5 star movie and a 5 star DVD/Blu Ray presentation. OH...and they DID carry over the excellent British documentary and bonus interviews from the 25th anniversary edition....too  many blu rays are dropping the existing supplements and I am very happy to say if you buy this set you will be able to get rid of BOTH the previous editions.<br /><br />This was a landmark film and this is a definitive and spectacular presentation!!!  As a purchaser of thousands of DVDs and Blu Rays I can say this is in the top 10 for all categories from content, quality ,  packaging and price.</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER. EVER. Gruesome imagery with f-bombs galore is for starters. Do not ever watch this movie at night or alone. I MEAN IT. The thing that makes this even more scary(if that's possible!) is that it actually happens and is making a comeback! Rated R is an understatement! Test your faith. Prove your supernatural strength. That is what this movie was made for. Literally. Ever fight a demon-possessed person? Ever try to get rid of the demon in them? Leave it to the experts but if you want to test yourself in a somewhat safe environment, this is the movie.

In an era when many movies compete to scare the devil out of you, The Exorcist remains one of the few able to successfully scare the devil into you. This is one of the great horror movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen) (1973)- I originally saw this five star horror movie when first released in New York back in 1973. For those of you old enough to remember, I too was one of those lunatics who stood on line in the freezing cold to see this great film. Crazier still is the fact that I thought it was worth the wait at the time!<br /><br />This great DVD includes some really frightening footage that was not included in the theatrical version of the movie.  In addition, the entire film has been digitally restored at 1.85 and plays beautifully on a new HDTV system, filling the entire screen. Watching this film on a new large screen HDTV  is just like a night out at the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Having seen the original "Exorcist" about a million times, I wasn't expecting much; a few more spasms of pea soup, some more foul language from the smartass demon we all know and love, or maybe Father Merrin going to the pharmacy and getting some heart medication that ACTUALLY WORKS.<br /><br />But "The Version You've Never Seen" defied all my expectations and then some.  This is better than the original, infinitely better, and I don't say that lightly. It transforms that classic 1973 shockfest/bleak tale of an innocent young girl defiled by forces beyond science and beyond the most extreme of human assistance into a subtle masterpiece which transcends horror and most so called "religious" films in general.<br /><br />The story is the same but recounted in a manner which is somehow entirely different from Friedkin's original cut: there is a meditative silence to the quietly catastrophic events which put a girl's life in danger and bring two men who barely know each other together to help her:the scene in the doctor's office, when Regan is being given a series of medical/psychological tests, answer in no uncertain terms the question of whether she was possessed or not.  The face that appears momentarily speaks for itself.<br /><br />Father Karras' personal crisis with the insanity and death of his mother and his reaction to it is dramatically altered by the beautifully restored scenes in which he says mass: in the original, he looks from the altar and sees people weeping, broken.  In this version, Miller's character is beginning to realize that Regan is actually possessed and his faith is being strengthened by this new catastrophe, not weakened.  The spiderwalk scene is appropriately foul; it shows that the horror living inside of Regan will not be restricted to her bedroom forever.<br /><br />The images which are spliced within the film are not hoky at all but on the contrary make it more frightening: the ill-fated hypnotist with a serious case of blueballs gets a momentary glimpse of what he is dealing with before Regan chokes the chicken.  The sense of ultimate mystery--an aging Jesuit priest finding an unpleasant relic in Iraq, a tortured young priest who is ready to pack it in and leave the priesthood, the little daughter of a rich and lively actress in Georgetown, and the coagulation of these forces into a disastrous but successful final confrontation--it is all done to better effect here.<br /><br />There is something deeply, deeply disturbing about this movie; while certainly not the "scariest movie of all time", it is a visceral assault on the senses filled with a strange voodoo subliminal power that does not make for casual viewing.  Unless one is absolutely steeled to whatever one sees, and even then, this will scare the hell out of you, no pun intended.  One of the best horror movies ever made and thought provoking about the most important questions in our lives.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>OK This is not only one of the scariest movies ever made, it's also one of the best! As much as I love the spider walk segment, I prefer the original theatrical version of the movie way more than this version. This movie is scary as HELL and needs no embellishments! Please release the original version re-mastered on DVD! If you haven't seen this film and call yourself a Horror film fan, you haven't seen one of the few truly scary films in the history of film making. Try this one late night by yourself with the lights out with no one in the house!

Almost 35 years later, it will still shock you if you've never seen it. It's definitely recommended, but beware of some very gross scenes, brutal language and a sordid and genuinely frightening story.<br /><br />The special effects still hold up. They don't look dated and they are just as creepy. The story starts a bit slowly, but once in kicks in, it's tough to put this DVD on pause. This is still an intense, repulsive and scary movie filled with memorable scenes as a demon takes control over a young girl's body.<br /><br />Two things bothered me in the film that probably don't upset most people: way too much usage of the Lord's name in vain - almost all by the girl's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn. The second - and I am not Catholic - is the pitiful portrayal of yet-another Hollwood weak priest. This priest is smokes, drinks, swears, steals, etc.. etc, and is a pitiful excuse for a cleric: just the kind filmmakers love to portray. One priest - get this - says his idea of heaven is to be a nightclub performer for eternity and have everyone like him. Obviously, people who makes films have NO clue about "religion." Not a single clue. But, this was '70: the most irreverent film-making period in our history, so it's no surprise.<br /><br />However - to its credit - the film does an excellent job of convincing even the most ardent atheist that demons do exist, that there really is a devil, and that he is not to be taken lightly. It's no joke, and the shock value of this film might have gotten some people to start thinking there is something to all this "spiritual stuff."<br /><br />Whatever your theology, or lack of it, this movie is one you will never forget. It is beyond anything seen before it or since. I recommend the  above DVD  - "The Exorist: The version you've never seen." That's the best and most complete version of this terrifying film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Remember when you could not bear to eat green pea soup? And dolls were getting their heads turned around all over town? Such was the impact of this truly horrifying movie.<br /><br />But the demonic possession was not the worst part of the movie. For me, the worst was the torture the doctors put the poor kid through, knowing that this sort of thing actually does happen, while the extreme parts of the possession were clearly fiction.<br /><br />The DVD has an opening comment (you don't have to click on it, it just comes on spontaneously) by the director of the movie. He refers to "25 years ago," so the comment itself is pretty old. He says that the reason he wanted to make a film of Peter Benchley's novel was that it was "based on" a true story. That's one of those terms of contact which is just one above "suggested by." In order to believe it is realistically based upon a true story, one would have to believe that demonic possession is not psychosomatic, but literally real. That is, when supernatural things happen that are not being faked, the explanation is that there really is a devil doing it. I don't. So to me, it is entertaining fiction and no more.<br /><br />Having said that, it is entertaining. As I'm sure you know a very young, very pretty Linda Blair plays the possessed child and Ellen Burstyn plays her actress mother. They are both believable and lovable in their rolls before the demon takes over. Oddly enough, one thing that is never really explained is how the demon took possession of the child. She found a Ouija board in the basement of the house they rented in Georgetown while her mother was working on a movie there. This could function as the explanation, but no connection is really made.<br /><br />In one incident, the mother leaves the child in the care of her assistant, who in turn leaves the director of the movie on which the mother is working to look after the child while she runs out to get the child's prescription filled. When she returns, the director is at the bottom of the steep stairway leading from the house to the street, with his head turned completely around. This gets a cop (Lee J. Cobb) interested, and he wanders through the rest of the movie, apparently trying to solve that mystery and a couple of others that crop up later.<br /><br />So most of the story involves two phases: her mother's searching for a doctor to cure her really sick, sick daughter. They do all sorts of tests, find nothing organic, and suggest that it's a comparatively rare psychiatric disorder where a person behaves bizarrely because they believe they are possessed.<br /><br />The mother is not herself religious, but she goes to the local Catholic church and requests an exorcism, either because it my be a placebo cure or because it may actually be possesion: she doesn't frankly care which, so long as she gets her beautiful daughter back. When the young priest who is a psychiatrist for the Jesuits agrees to go see the child, she gives what the audience understands to be convincing proof of her possession, including the famous head turning all the way around. One interesting aspect is that he sprinkles the child with tap water from a holy water bottle, and the "demon" screams about how it burns.<br /><br />So he goes to the bishop and asks for permission to perform an exorcism. At this point we finally find out what all that rigamarole in the prologue about an archeologist priest in Iran was all about. It seems he has some experience with demons and demonic possession, and it is implied that the one possessing the child is the same one whose statue he uncovered in Iran.<br /><br />The exorcism is successful, the child is fine and remembers nothing of the possession, and she and her mother are returning to California, available for the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>The King, or should I say, Queen of horror movies. Still as potent today as when I watched it in a theater in 1973.<br /><br />Very doubtful they could make this film today as it is, & get an R rating. Not in this political correctness age. NC 17, just for the masturbation with a crucifix & then Regan pushing her mothers face to her vagina saying, "lick me!" Then there would probably be groups protesting the movie by the dozens. "The Exorcist exists the way it is because of a grandfather clause, from a time more permissive in Cinema.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks & sounds great! The movie never looking or sounding better. There is grain in the film, but that is more to how it was filmed & it's age, than anything technological of today.<br /><br />Highly recommend the upgrade!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>There have been so many reviews written on this movie that I won't give a detailed review. Read the other 800+ reviews for a more thorough analysis of this classic movie and its plot, etc. However, I just want to make a few observations and give some personal opinions.<br /><br />The Exorcist is referred to as "The Scariest Movie Of All Time" on the DVD cover. Well, perhaps it may well have been up to that time (1973), though that of course is debatable (personally, I don't think it is at all). I can think of 20 + other horror movies that I feel are scarier than The Exorcist. To me, this movie is more bizarre and twisted than it is scary. A demonically possessed 12 year old girl who demonstrates increasingly bizarre, twisted behavior certainly is scary, but I find humor in a lot of her comments and scenes in general. Every time the scene comes on where she delivers a left hook to her mother's face and spins her head around, I laugh.  That is laugh-out-loud funny.  I find her filthy language humorous. To me, the viewer shouldn't be laughing during a movie that's supposed to be scary. I'm sure these scenes were meant to be scary, but they come off as funny sometimes, to me, anyway. Another thing - she's confined to her bed most of the time, so she's only scaring people who visit her room.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie is that it has a lot of slow moving and boring scenes. Had a lot of these scenes been cut down or eliminated, the movie would retain a more consistent horror feel to it. Instead, the movie kind of meanders around at a slow pace, showing everything from boring conversation over a cup of coffee to a man jogging around a high school track. What's really bad is whenever the movie seems to be gaining some momentum, suddenly it slows down again with some of the above mentioned things.  I know that the goal of the director is to have a gradual buildup of tension/suspense, but again, this buildup is inconsistent.  One positive to the movie is the fact that it's fall and it's late October (one scene shows some kids running along the sidewalk dressed in their Halloween costumes with the Tubular Bells song playing).  That's pretty creepy.<br /><br />The Exorcist Tubular Bells theme song is one of the classic horror movie themes of all time, but it's hardly ever played in the movie. Its absence lowers the scare level. A great musical score can make a movie scarier than it normally would be without the music. It can make all the difference in the world. Think of movies like Psycho (1960), Carnival Of Souls (1962), The Haunting (1963), The Omen (1976), Halloween (1978), The Amityville Horror (1979), movies like these. Also, to me, one of the elements that a scary movie needs is a lot of darkness. A lot of nighttime footage, both indoors and outdoors. The use of shadows, dark shades, and low lighting. The Exorcist lacks this. Most of the scenes are during daylight hours. Some of the daylight scenes are pretty creepy, though. I also value suspense and psychological horror, such as in The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), and The Changeling (1980). I know that The Exorcist is a different kind of horror movie, but it lacks these two important qualities that I feel qualify a movie to be considered very scary.<br /><br />In 1973 there was another movie that was released that had to compete with The Exorcist, and that is The Legend Of Hell House. This movie is scarier than The Exorcist, in my opinion. But it got buried as a result of The Exorcist's popularity. There have been many other movies since 1973 that have been scarier than The Exorcist, such as The Omen (1976), Burnt Offerings (1976), Halloween (1978), Salem's Lot (1979), The Changeling (1980), The Shining (1980), etc. Many movies that came before The Exorcist are scarier, such as Psycho (1960), The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), etc.<br /><br />I first saw The Exorcist back in 2000 and was expecting it to be the scariest movie I've ever seen. It wasn't. Not even close. It does have its moments, though. I rank it maybe the 23rd scariest movie I've ever seen. I have an arsenal of horror movies. Whenever I want to watch a really scary movie, I never make The Exorcist my first choice.<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie?  Yes. It's a horror classic with a memorable theme song. It's a brilliant mix of horror and religion. It should be in everyone horror fan's collection. I give it 4 stars because it's a classic, well made, has a memorable score, and has good acting. But I hardly nominate it as "The Scariest Movie Of All Time".</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>I have few fonder memories of viewing a feature film in a theater than those recorded when I attended a screening of this widely promoted, extended version of The Exorcist during an unseasonably cold September evening nine years ago. Not all of my enjoyment was derived from the film itself. Now, it was a thrill to watch a film that I'd grown up with (which predated me by six years) on the big screen and to finally see numerous exciting and poignant scenes (that I'd read at least twice before in William Peter Blatty's brilliant novel) realized by the comfortably familiar cast. However, my attention was frequently split between the film and an audience around me that grew increasingly, uncomfortably tense as it progressed. In particular, a teenage boy and his mother were seated before me. It's possible that these two were Good Catholics, present to see a famous, Vatican-approved motion picture of faith and redemption; also, that the son might have pestered his mom to take him to see a bit of horror history; most likely, that the mother had seen it ages ago, had long forgotten the most explicit portions and perhaps subscribed to the idiotic popular fallacy that mainstream movies nowadays are harsher than they were thirty-odd years ago. Shoulders rose and tightened as that notion was quickly dispelled, but only when adorable Linda Blair messily introduced a crucifix to her hymen did Mother Dearest mutter, "Oh, for Christ's sake!" and slap a hand over her son's virgin eyes. Behind them, I sported an ear-to-ear grin. Veteran character actor Barton Heyman wasn't even back on his feet before three couples exited the theater. A few more followed even before the great Max von Sydow appeared to attend to the movie's ultimate confrontation.<br /><br />Not for the last time, I was reminded of the increasingly lightweight culture in which I'm living.<br /><br />Well, never mind - it's been on DVD for a good long while and watching it again evokes these memories, which are very different than those associated with my worn old VHS copy. It's easier on the eyes and ears, too: the digitally remastered picture and sound are first-rate. Of that beautiful Technicolor, hues and contrast are as striking as ever. More demanding than most, the 1979 six-channel Dolby Stereo mix is satisfactorily conveyed in two soundtracks - a Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and mono-compatible 2.0. The 5.1 track sounds fantastic on any good sound system and while the 2.0 track is slightly muddled, it's better suited to TV speakers or cheap headphones. Bold, white English and French subtitles are included, and are merely adequate; take note that the English subs were certainly not designed for the deaf or hard of hearing.<br /><br />Ever since this version was re-released to theaters, its primary selling point has been eleven minutes of footage deleted from the original theatrical cut, very little of which had ever been seen by the general public. Restored to impressive effect, this material was edited in congruity with the artful subtlety of the original feature. Scenes containing or consisting wholly of restored footage are helpfully asterisked in the comprehensive forty-eight-scene selection menu. Less than a dozen scenes were spruced up with CGI effects, but Friedkin was careful not to take the tasteless, revisionist route through which a certain bearded man-child filmmaker stupidly, contemporaneously trudged, so these touches are minor, serving only to enhance the footage in question. My single gripe concerns the excessive use of an otherwise unobjectionable cue composed especially for this release by Steve Boddacker - an ominous, minimalist drone that newly scored a number of scenes. This was such a mistake: the quiet tension during the announcement of Burke Dennings' death and especially the first conversation between Fr. Karras and Lt. Kinderman was what made them so disquieting, while this music only reminds us that it's there. It doesn't ruin these scenes - the performances are too good to permit that - but it is a persistent distraction. Attentive fans might notice that the Casablanca reference voiced by Kinderman and Dyer at the film's very end was omitted, even though the scene is available in its entirety as a special feature in the 25th Anniversary Special Edition. The exhaustive behind-the-scenes documentary, The Fear of God is also exclusive to that edition.<br /><br />If you're looking for a commentary track that provides a dramatic, insightful and slightly pretentious summary of every scene, William Friedkin's is definitely what you want. However, it really wasn't what I wanted. Friedkin has a great voice for this kind of presentation, but I don't need somebody to tell me about what I can see and hear for myself. He also explains a couple of subtle, symbolic elements that I hadn't noticed and shares a few (too few) amazing bits of trivia, most of which are related to the shoot in Sinjar, Iraq. I certainly don't expect Friedkin's memory of a film that he directed over a quarter-century before to be perfect, but I wanted more of that: details about the production, the actors, the effects and locations. If his memory is limited, why didn't Warner ask screenwriter/producer Blatty to record it with him? Lord knows, he's never at a loss for something to say about any of his projects. During Karras's dream, Friedkin explains that it wasn't in the novel and that he "added" it to the film. While he certainly added significant imagery to it, he's either lying or grossly mistaken - in the novel, that dream is mentioned in brief and significant detail.<br /><br />In lieu of the The Fear of God documentary or much revealing information in the commentary track, four text commentaries explain Blatty's inspiration for the original story, Friedkin's rejection of Blatty's first screenplay and their disputes over numerous deleted scenes, the infamous "spider walk" sequence and some other bits of trivia. This is hardly as enjoyable or revealing as the documentary, but it's better than nothing.<br /><br />Four TV spots, two radio spots and two theatrical trailers promoting the re-release are included, most of which are quite good and especially better than the leaden 1973 trailer.<br /><br />On the whole, this really is superior to the 1973 cut, but the original theatrical release is still worth seeing, and available in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEGC">The Complete Anthology box set</a>. If you just want to own one version and haven't seen both, torrent the original and rent this on Netflix; if you prefer the original, that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079073804X">25th Anniversary edition</a> is always floating around, and quite affordable besides...</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>Friedkin's scare flick still has legs--thirty-plus years later. Get it. The making-of doc is interesting.<br /><br />I thought some of the dialogue Detective Kinderman had to say (liking to go to movies and discus same) just didn't sit right. Also, the idea that Regan's mom was an actress (in a movie) didn't fly with me...but other than that, the film works--all the way. Cobb, Burstyn, Jason Miller, Linda Blair...et al...make for a solid cast.<br /><br />I think William Friedkin is one of the finest directors around, if not the best, when it comes to creating atmosphere and using extras.<br /><br />Lastly, if you're the religious type and believe in demons...you just may want to stay clear of this fright classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Director Friedkin's masterful adaptation of William Peter Blatty's best-seller is one of the most petrifying films on record. An ominous mood is established at the outset that quickly escalates to bone-chilling terror. Burstyn embodies the frantic mother, while Miller is the film's emotional heart as the tortured Karras. And young Blair would never match her outing as the possessed child. Look for a solid late-career turn by Lee J. Cobb as a curious detective.

Not done on a colossal budget, but it stands up to many films of the period VERY well ( compare this with HELL HOUSE , and you can see the difference in scare value, as well as the quality of this film).<br /><br />In terms of content, the film has Priests in it who said that the various scenes most critics rail against as Blasphemous, are perfectly legitimate in context.<br /><br />The really  chilling element that I have found bugs some people out , is that the Director uses some REAL  audio from an actual exorcism to beef up the presence of the demonic sounds.<br /><br />If you are going to do a film on this genre, general topic area, then using the right material makes a big difference. This film does not make the mistake of making up its own "occult"  material like some recent films do.<br /><br />This is a perpetual classic that shows just how a well made film will stand the test of time, small minded critics, and quality scripts ... however much the Director has to beef it up with cool ideas :-)<br /><br />Great version .... also , get the 25th Anniversary  edition for some great , and insightful  extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I prefer the 25th anniversary DVD of THE EXORCIST simply because it has much more stuff on it related to the film.<p>I saw this version in the theatres when it was released and still enjoyed it.  I thought the added images of the demon statues were distracting, but the 11 minutes of footage was interesting.<br />Remember when people smoked EVERYWHERE?  The hospital scenes where everyone, including the doctors, light up is almost funny now.<br />The &quot;spider walk&quot; scene, which I'd seen the rough footage for on the 25th DVD, still managed to make me jump when incorporated into the finished product this time around.<p>This is still the greatest horror film ever made.

I tend to agree and have always considered The Silence of the Lambs, The Shining and Psycho as psychological thrillers rather than horror. I mention those three because they represent the best that 'horror' has to offer, whether you label them as such or not.<br /><br />If you have read my other reviews, you'll know by now that I'm a movie snob. When I think of horror films, the first thing that comes to mind is excessive gore and cheesy lines. I'm simply not a fan of seeing bodies hacked to pieces and I don't find any value in cheesy horror stories. So bear that in mind if you are a fan of such movies as the Evil Dead (not that there's anything wrong with that).<br /><br />Instead, I look at how films are made, what they make me feel, the quality of the acting and the methods used by the director. In those terms, The Exorcist deserves to be rated among the best 'horror' films ever made.<br /><br />The film plays like a book with the three main sets of characters being shown individually before the threads are drawn together for the body of the story. The story begins with Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) heading an archeological expedition in Iraq. Father Karras (Jason Miller) is shown caring for his dying mother and we are shown how he lives. Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is shown being a mother to Regan (Linda Blair).<br /><br />Regan is a pretty, playful 12-year-old girl without a care in the world. We see her demeanor gradually change as she's possessed by a demon. She seeks out her mother's bed because her own is shaking, but her mother thinks she's lying. There are noises in the attic which are thought to be rats as Chris tries to label them as something familiar. Regan's sweet nature gradually erodes and we see her lose her temper more and more frequently. She's eventually referred to doctors and shouts obscenities at them. Some of the tests she has to undergo would be frightening to a child, but everything comes back negative. A psychiatrist gets a turn and also fails to solve the problem. Denial is a powerful thing in this story as doctors continually try to rationalize the things they are seeing and hearing.<br /><br />Chris is an atheist, but can see that the doctors are wrong. She eventually seeks out help from Father Karras, showing just how desperate she is to help her daughter. If you allow yourself to be drawn in to the story and consider how you would react if your own child underwent such changes, you'll feel the power of this film.<br /><br />The climax of the film sees Father Karras and Father Merrin performing an exorcism after convincing the church that it was needed. Regan's transformation is impressive. When possessed, she talks in many different voices, some of which are known to the priests and the people around her. The demon is a master liar and seeks to confuse the priests and prevent the exorcism. Regan becomes a monster, reeling off obscenities and spewing foul green bile. Her face and body become covered in scars and it's hard to see anything of the original person.<br /><br />In 1973, it was a real challenge to produce some of the effects seen in the film. Instead of CGI, everything had to be done by other means. Wires were used in two or three of the scenes were Regan levitates or runs down the stairs upside down. A model was made to enable the illusion that her head turns 360 degrees. The bile had to be made and then delivered using tubes. Although it's obvious that the spinning head is a model, it's still unsettling to see it happen.<br /><br />Will you be scared by this movie? Visually, it's nothing compared to effects achieved by modern techniques. You might be scared if the story captures you sufficiently to make you feel that you're a part of it. Imagine yourself as Regan's parent for example. We can overlook the dated effects and take them seriously because everything else about this film is deadly serious. The acting is strong throughout, with the whole cast performing well. Friedkin tells the story simply, but effectively. The final solution is extreme, but convincing.<br /><br />Like Psycho, this film was original and startling in its day. It has an important place in film history. It might not have a strong impact on people who are used to modern horror movies, but it's worth seeing for anyone who has avoided it thus far.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5:<br /><br />This package includes two discs. One shows the original theatrical version (122m) and the other shows the extended version (132m). My comments refer to the extended version, although I would expect the quality to be identical in both versions.<br /><br />The scenes in Iraq are bright and full of detail and the film would earn a 4.5 for picture quality if it were that good throughout. Unfortunately, much of the film is shot in dimly lit rooms and grain is dense in such scenes. All things considered, it's hard to imagine the image looking any better than it does though.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5:<br /><br />Friedkin mentions that the lossless audio enables him to hear effects that he had forgotten were in the film. It's certainly a strong presentation and the film benefits most of all from the audio upgrade. We can clearly hear Regan wheezing and the voices in outdoor scenes come across well in the rear speakers. Dialogue is always easy to understand and some of the louder scenes, such as furniture moving or glass breaking, carry added weight. The 6.1 version is included in the extended cut, while the original version has 5.1 audio.<br /><br />Special Features 4.5/5:<br /><br />There's plenty of background information included in the special features for anyone who is interested.<br /><br />Director's commentary<br />Raising Hell: Filming the Exorcist (30m, HD)<br />The Exorcist Locations: Georgetown Then and Now (9m, HD)<br />Faces of Evil: The Different Versions of the Exorcist (10m, HD)<br />Trailers, TV Spots and Radio Spots<br />Director's Introduction (2m, SD)<br />The Fear of God (77m, SD)<br />Filmmaker Interviews (9m, SD)<br />Sketches and Storyboards (3m, SD)<br />Original Ending (2m, SD)<br />40-page booklet with pictures, cast details and background information<br /><br />The Exorcist is an important part of cinematic history. Nominated for 10 Oscars, it won two, and that's unusual for this genre. It's a beautifully presented package complete with a high quality booklet and separate discs for each version of the film. The audio upgrade is huge, making the experience a lot more intense. The visual upgrade is probably the best that could have been managed considering the dark setting and the director's original intentions. I would strongly recommend this definitive version for any fan of the film or of cinema in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>Based on William Peter Blatty's novel, "The Exorcist", William Friedkin's 1973 classic horror movie also know as "The Exorcist" is without a doubt the most powerful horror movie ever made.  Moreover, there has never been a more controversial movie on such a grand scale and that crosses as many boundaries as "The Exorcist".  In fact, the idea of possession is as old as the Bible, and still has a basis in many religions to this very day.  Regardless of your opinion on the subject, there has also never been a movie as intricate on the subject of possession as "The Exorcist".  When it was released in 1973, "The Exorcist" literally shook the world with a very realistic take on the absolutely horrifying subject matter of demonic possession.  After thirty-four years, this movie is still being debated and talked about as the greatest and scariest horror movie of all-time.  Regardless of your position on that issue, the fact that "The Exorcist" is one of the elite horror films ever produced is just that, a fact, not an opinion.<br /><br />Having seen it many times, the power of "The Exorcist" never ceases to amaze me.  Perhaps what is so great about "The Exorcist" is that it is so multi-layered, fascinating and literally gut-wrenching to watch, but more importantly, "The Exorcist" is also a great story, a horrifying and haunting story, but a great one.  Each of the main characters turns in such powerful performances and the possession of Regan is as realistically portrayed as such a phenomenon could possibly be.  One has to wonder if Friedkin was not possessed himself in the making of this movie.  His attention to detail in this masterpiece is truly amazing.<br /><br />There are many reasons why "The Exorcist" is such a great piece of film-making.  One such reason is because it enables the viewer to suspend their disbelief and view the events in "The Exorcist" as hauntingly realistic.  However, "The Exorcist" is not just a horror movie, but, in many ways, "The Exorcist" is as much of a Christian drama about the good and evil in this world as it is a horror movie.  In some ways, "The Exorcist" is a metaphor for life, a metaphor of good versus evil, right versus wrong, life versus death and sin versus redemption.  It is full of dramatic subplots (the death of Karras' mother and his struggle with his own faith as a priest) which is most unusual for horror movies, but then again, "The Exorcist" is so much more than a horror movie.<br /><br />In my opinion, "The Exorcist" is one of the greatest movies of all-time and that goes for any and all genres.  So many people say, well, you know, "The Exorcist" is getting old, I've seen it so many times, it's really funny when you think about it.  No, it is most definitely NOT funny when you really think about it.  Those people do not get it.  Maybe to try and laugh is what makes these people feel better after watching this movie.  However, at its core, "The Exorcist" is a movie that is designed to make you think, something that I unfortunately cannot say for most horror movies.  If I had a dime for every time I heard someone say, "it really stays with you", I'd be a rich man.  It is what it is, like it or lump it, because if it's anything, "The Exorcist" is a very powerful and thought-provoking film.<br /><br />What I do find strange about the criticisms of this film are from the atheists out there.  They really have a hard time with this film.  Most of them do not like it or say they like it, but secretly they hate and fear its underlying meaning.  Of course, some Christians do not like the movie as well, probably because of the crucifix scene and the intense scenes with the demon.  In fact, if I recall correctly, Billy Graham even spoke out against this movie as well.  At any rate, to say that "The Exorcist" is a controversial movie is an understatement of epic proportions.<br /><br />Amazingly unique to "The Exorcist" is its ability to present fantastic and unbelievable phenomena to the viewer, and make it seem so real, so powerful, and so intense.  In a sense, to look at "The Exorcist" metaphorically-speaking makes it even more brilliant than taken in the literal sense.  I could go on and on philosophizing about this subject, but the fact of the matter is that "The Exorcist" is one of the only horror films that makes one think about the mysteries and the darkness in this life.<br /><br />In "The Exorcist", a priest, Father Merrin, played exceptionally well by Max von Sidow, discovers something incredibly evil while on an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.  For Father Merrin, this did not come too unexpectedly as he had an experience with this kind of evil before.  Across the world, a girl, Regan, played brilliantly by Linda Blair, becomes possessed by an incredibly evil entity, and her loving mother, played exceptionally well by Ellen Burstyn, struggles to provide her daughter with medical care to cure her of her seemingly incurable condition.  Another priest, Damien Karras, played exceptionally well by Jason Miller, (got a theme here on the acting) must deal with a terrible tragedy in his life while also struggling with his faith and, ultimately, both priests are called upon to perform an exorcism to save the girl's life, and to do battle with the evil of all evils.  Each of these characters face incredible horror in their lives and all of the subplots come together brilliantly by movie's end to create a masterpiece in "The Exorcist".  Exceptional acting is very rare for horror films, and "The Exorcist" has some of the best acting that you will ever find in a horror movie or in any movie for that matter.<br /><br />As "The Exorcist" moves along, Friedkin does an absolutely amazing job of presenting the viewer with incredibly disturbing and haunting images in different but altogether indelibly potent fashions.  A horrifying image occurs to Damien Karras during a nightmare about his mother.  Father Merrin has an omen of things to come in Iraq as he witnesses the evil of the demon which ultimately possesses Regan.  The mother witnesses the horrible atrocities committed by the demon within Regan, and the horror associated with such a possession, especially of someone she loves.  Regan experiences the ultimate in horror as she is literally overpowered by the presence of the demon.  It all comes together eloquently in "The Exorcist" in a frighteningly real and surreal yet beautifully poetic fashion.  This is yet another reason that "The Exorcist" is such a great movie.<br /><br />The powerful performances given by each actor in his/her respective role is also a credit to the director, William Friedkin, who went to incredible lengths to make this movie as atmospheric and as realistic as possible, especially given the supernatural and paranormal subject matter involved.  When dealing with the supernatural and the paranormal, one really needs to be able to sell it to the audience, and Friedkin does this exceptionally well in "The Exorcist".  So many horror movies fail in this regard, but "The Exorcist" does this as well as any movie I have ever seen.  In fact, the cinematography of this film is second to none and the effects are brilliant and light years ahead of its time.  The production values are obviously top-notch.  It is really quite amazing how great this film truly is.  Obviously, Friedkin must have been obsessed with the making of this film to have done such a brilliant job in every conceivable aspect.<br /><br />In a sense, "The Exorcist" is like one big nightmare that causes the viewer to delve into an area of incredible darkness that is most uncomfortable.  The idea of possession is horrifying in and of itself.  It should also be noted that some groups of people, including the Catholics, maintain that possession by demons is a very real phenomenon.  Imagine not being in control of your own mind or your body, yet your soul is being poisoned by some foreign entity.  Whether demonic possession exists or not, there is such a thing as not being in control of your mind and body.  In today's world, we call it split-personality, multiple personality disorder, dementia, schizophrenia, psychosis, alcoholism, drug addiction etc., but the effect is essentially the same, same principle I mean.  In a sense these are all varying forms and/or degrees of possession when you think about it.  I am not taking a stance on the issue in this review although there have been various documented accounts of exorcisms.  In fact, "The Exorcist" is supposedly based on a real life exorcism of a child, although very loosely from what I understand.  In fact, there is a movie called "The Possessed" or something like that starring Timothy Dalton which is supposedly based on a true story, but this movie was terrible in my estimation.  Please see my review on this movie for more details.  However, I believe this is the story that Blatty got the idea for "The Exorcist" from.  At any rate, a horror movie about demonic possession is about as good of an idea for a horror movie as you can possibly get because it is a very scary concept in and of itself.<br /><br />What is so truly amazing about "The Exorcist" are the many images that will literally stay with you for the rest of your life.  This is one powerful movie that you will never forget, and that makes this movie truly special.  "The Exorcist" is the epitome of what a horror movie should try to be and is the true masterpiece of its genre.  I will not go into the different scenes in the movie because the viewer should experience these scenes without any warning, in order to get the pure effect of the film, but it should be pointed out that the way in which Friedkin brings home the horror of possession is as frighteningly genuine and realistic, in a sense, as anything the horror genre has to offer.  Moreover, the supernatural elements are developed beautifully in "The Exorcist" and are done in such a dark and haunting fashion that the viewer is able to experience pure and unadulterated horror while also ascertaining and fully appreciating the evil that has taken hold of Regan.<br /><br />At the same time, the element of darkness and the unknown which is obviously so inherently rooted in supernatural evil is clearly communicated to the audience in such an awesome way which only works to make the viewing experience that much more unsettling, powerful and uncomfortable for the viewer.  The haunting score that "The Exorcist" employs to compliment its action only works to accentuate the horror that this movie is brilliantly able to produce.  Quite frankly, people are more scared of things they do not understand or are unable to make sense of or cannot put their finger on more than anything else, and that is what you get in "The Exorcist".  This is yet another reason why "The Exorcist" is one of the scariest and best horror movies of all-time.  Ideas like why do bad things happen to good people, and why does evil exist are dealt with in a subtle but poignant fashion in "The Exorcist".  Themes only too prevalent since the beginning of time that are dealt with in classic novels like "The Brothers Karamazov" by Fyodor Dosteovsky, are also addressed (although to a lesser degree and depth) in "The Exorcist".<br /><br />There are many forms of horror, shock-horror like "Last House on the Left" and "Cannibal Holocaust", etc., there is atmospheric horror dealing with the paranormal like Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining" and "The Amityville Horror" and those that deal with witchcraft like "Suspiria" and "Inferno", situational horror films like "Halloween", and then there are horror movies that confront the most basic and most powerful of all evils in a direct fashion like "The Omen" and "The Exorcist", movies that tell the story of the evil behind all evils and darkness so evident in today's world.  These are powerful films that make the viewer think about the evil they do not want to know and what they do not understand.  "The Exorcist" does this more effectively than any movie I have ever seen.  While "The Exorcist" is a very dark film, it does leave a sliver of light and hope for humanity that stirs the emotions of the viewer by movie's end, perhaps not the kind of light that makes the average viewer feel comfortable, but it is clearly there.  Of course, this is the idea of redemption from sin, deliverance from evil, faith, and the afterlife, many things people do not want to address in this day and age.  Once again, this is what makes "The Exorcist" such a powerful film, one that is very dear to my heart.<br /><br />Finally, there's been a lot of talk about "The Exorcist: The version you've never seen" versus the original and I think both are great.  I happen to love the "spider crawl" scene in the version you've never seen, but I don't like the ending compared to the original version.  Regardless of which version you like, if you think you are a horror fan and you do not have a DVD copy of "The Exorcist" on your DVD shelf, your collection is not only incomplete, but you have not even started it yet.  In order to appreciate the horror genre, "The Exorcist", "The Omen", Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining", and "Halloween" are the greatest films that the genre has to offer with the consensus being that "The Exorcist" is still the scariest movie of all-time.  After watching this movie yet again, I can certainly understand where the majority is coming from.  Five (5) stars for "The Exorcist" which does not even do the film justice to be honest with you.  Of course, "The Exorcist" receives HorrorMan's highest possible rating as one of the greatest and scariest horror movies ever produced and as the most powerful horror movie all-time.  Simply put, "The Exorcist" is cinematic horror in its purest and finest form.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>Back in 1973 when this terrifying shocker first came out, the reactions from movie audiences were all over the place. Some people came out of the movie nearly collapsing off of their feet; some people checked into therapy after seeing it; some people actually vomited in the theater; some people were so scared that they ran out of the theater and never came back. Whatever the reactions were, THE EXORCIST certainly has one of the most powerful reactions from any horror movie ever made. No one had any clue that director William Friedkin was out to make what is quite possibly the scariest film ever made of all time. After the first time you see this movie, even you will have trouble sleeping at night for at least a week.<br /><br />Linda Blair is terrific as the little girl who goes to hell and back, Regan; Max Von Sydow is terrific as Father Merrin; Jason Miller plays Father Karras to a tee; and Ellen Burstyn is perfect as Regan's mother. All of these actors convey such depth and emotion, and Blair truly is terrifying when she becomes the demon and speaks in the demon's voice. It...is...shocking.<br /><br />The story centers around a little girl named Regan, one of the nicest girls on the planet. She loves horses, plays games and jokes with her mother, and seems like the most down to earth kid. Little does she know of the terror that truly awaits her as the movie progresses. We know that Chris is an actress and quite a reputable one at that. As the movie goes on, Regan is getting a check up at the doctor's office when a most terrifying face is seen for a split second as she stares at the ceiling, and then suddenly she is quietly taken over by the demon. If you pause the movie right when the face comes up, you will get shivers down your spine. Just the way it looks at you and is smiling and the eyes, everything is just VERY scary. You won't notice it at first, but later Regan's behavior begins to change, especially after her outburst in the doctor's office. But it doesn't end there.<br /><br />As soon as Regan gets home, all the bad stuff begins to start unravelling one by one. One event that occurs where you know things are going terribly wrong is when Chris walks into the room and finds the windows all open with the chill in the air and Regan not under covers but facing down on her bed. The fact that you can see breath is chilling, but just knowing Regan is going to wreak havoc is absolutely terrifying. There are a two moments in the movie where "demon" Regan's head spins, but the first time you see it is dreadfully unsettling. According to Wes Craven, at that moment some lady got up from her seat, was screaming Spanish and ran out of the theater. The fact that director William Friedkin has no inhibitions about what he was going to show made the movie more powerful, minute by minute. Father Merrin has been made aware of the nature of Regan's "demonic" behavior by Father Karras, so they ultimately decide to perform an exorcism, and that scene between Regan, Merrin, and Karras has to be one of the most classic scenes in any horror movie. Everytime you hear the demon voice, see Regan in demon form, or see the bed shake or vomit spit, you jump back from your seat. It's a movie that's all about reaching deep down into the "chill" factor of your soul.<br /><br />Despite the sheer terror and frightening scenes depicted in this movie, there is no real gore and no real sex in the movie, despite the scene involving Regan and the crucifix. The film is actually stronger without any of those elements, it's an ultimately terrifying experience. The actors; the suspense; the demon effects and makeup; the storyline. Every element in this film works better than any other horror movie made in history.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST is at least one of the most horrifying experiences you'll ever witness in your life. Heralded as a classic by both critics and fans alike, this movie will stay in your mind for a long time. This is the most realistic and most documetary-like film about the portrayal of demonic possession. William Friedkin, you may have been genius, but this movie is pure madness...reach into the scare factor of your soul and watch THE EXORCIST...but never, I repeat, never watch it alone...and in the dark.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>William Friedkin's "The Exorcist" is a landmark.  The cultural psyche still is still reeling from its arrival on the scene over thirty years ago.  It is a masterpiece that will continue to endure long after many horror films of today are forgotten.<br /><br />Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) seeks the aid of Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) after her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave oddly.  Upon the realization that something is horribly wrong with the young girl, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) is summoned to conduct an exorcism on her.  A terrifying battle between the forces of good and evil then ensues that pushes all involved to their physical and spiritual breaking points.<br /><br />Words cannot effectively convey the power of "The Exorcist."  This is a film that relentlessly assaults the senses and makes no apologies for doing so.  Genre entries that followed it had no choice but to follow its lead because it single-handedly redefined what the public understood to be cinematic horror.  While Linda Blair deservedly receives much of the attention for her fine work, the equally powerful performance by Jason Miller as Father Karras should not be overlooked.  He gives the film an important human component that keeps it grounded.  Without Karras' arc, "The Exorcist" is just another scream-flick trying to make a quick buck by relying on cheap thrills.  Truly groundbreaking, "The Exorcist" is a stunning work that dared to test the limits of filmmaking.  No serious discussion of great cinema is complete without a mention of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>William Friedkin in my eyes has directed and made the most horrific horror film of all time. I remember it being released in 1973, people were pickiting our local theater which just caused more people to see it. I was to young, I was only 7, but did see it on HBO years later. Wish I would have waited a few more years, I had nightmares way to often, to the point where I found myself in Mom and Dads bed. Simple story of a young girl overcome by demonic possesion, and the toll it takes on the mother and the priests who are performing the exorcism. I do own this dvd but I refuse to watch it without some company, and I'm 38 now. The demonic voice of Reagan,(Linda Blair), over my eight Polk speakers in DTS sound is enough to raise the hair on your neck. How they managed to get away with the crucifix scene without a cut from the M.P.A.A. blows me away. The most disturbing scene ever, in any film. I could do without the newly added "nervous disorder" scene in the hospital, but the "spiderwalk" scene is chilling, and should have been in the original cut. And how about that score? Tubular bells just freaks me out. A wonderful directed, edited, scored, acted film. The best horror film ever. How Linda Blair can even sleep today, astonishes me. Dick Smith was the makeup artist, I believe Max Von Sydow, head priest, was only in his 40s at the time, look at him now, he looks exactley like his aged makeup, incredible. Tom Savini, fx God learned from Mr. Smith. Damn, do I love movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I read the book right after it came out and I couldn't put it down!  When the movie came out I already heard a lot of the advance publicity but I was still deeply engrossed when I watched it for the first time.  I have seen it many times since although not in its' recent remastered version.  It is a movie that will challenge you in many ways yet it is also a movie that has the potential to reassure you are well.  It is a very well-made movie complete with great writing, acting, directing, and, above all, great special effects.  Even after all of these years, they still are impressive.  <p>This movie is not for the squeemish as I can illustrate with an experience I had in Ensenada, Mexico.  The movie had been out for a year or two and a friend of mine and I were traveling in Baja Mexico.  There wasn't a lot to do at night so, when I saw that the movie was playing at the local theatre, I suggested we go see it.  When my friend said he hadn't seen it before, I insisted that we go.  The theatre was fairly full when we went in.  As the movie got progressively more intense, the show would stop and a warning notice would appear on the screen advising the viewers that the movie was going to become even more graphic.  This screen appeared three times during the movie.  At the end of the show, the lights came on and I was surprized to discover that there were only a handful of people besides my friend and I who had sat through the whole movie.  <p>I don't know that the movie will grip you quite so hard but it may.  There is a strong element of hardcore Christian good versus demonic evil and you can get caught up in this.  The actual history of exorcism is fairly scant given the number of years the scarement has been around and the hundreds of millions of Christians that were or are in this world.  I suspect most people would view this movie more as a test of their nerves rather than their faith.  However, after my experience in Mexico, I thought I should at least put my own warning notice on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>To begin with, this movie is scary.  The newest version, "The Version You've Never Seen" is even scarier.  The spiderwalk is terrifying.<br />Based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, The Exorcist is a movie that will stay with your for a lifetime.  Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), is a visiting actress in Washington, D.C. who notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior of her 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair). A young priest, Father Damien Karras, at nearby Georgetown University begins to doubt his faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness.  When all medical possibilities have been exhausted, Chris MacNeil is sent to a Fr. Karras.  He becomes convinced that Regan is possessed and he and Father Merrin, experienced in exorcism try to drive the spirit out of Regan before she dies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>This is a film that goes way beyond the horror genre for which  it has been labeled with so many other monster movie offerings.  It is an exploration of faith, a complex struggle of good versus evil that stems from the conflicts that are present in each of our lives, combined with a theology lesson and the belief in something greater than ourselves.  Ultimately, it is an exploration of the worst kind of horror, the horror that exists in the belief that for every good, there is an evil, and to that end, that even the ultimate good has an ultimate darkness lieing in its shadow.<p>This film, based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, and directed by William Friedkin, is the story of two priests and a family living in Georgetown University, just outside Washington D.C.  Blatty, who wrote the novel and screenplay, based the story of a child's possession by the devil on actual events that he had read about many years before writing the Exorcist.  <p>The story begins with an elderly priest, Father Merrin, who is working as a missionary in Iraq.  A former exorcist, Merrin is confronted by a vision of the demon and is given a premonition of events that will unfold later.<p>The story continues in counterpoint, introducing us to Father Damien Karras, a young, Italian priest whose mother is dieing of poverty.  A student at Georgetown University, and the psychiatrist on the staff of Saint Michaels, Karras's faith is shaken when his mother dies while in the custody of a sanitarium for the poor and impoverished.<p>The other half of this counterpoint is the story of Regan, daughter of movie-star Chris MacNeil, who is at Georgetown University filming a student-rights movie.  They rent a home on the campus, and while they live there, Regan begins to refer to an invisible friend who she refers to as &quot;Captain Howdy&quot;.  As the story progresses, Regans disposition begins to change.  She starts complaining of headaches, and has outbursts that are completely uncharacteristic of her, and before long, all that see her begin to believe she is either medically insane, or possessed.<p>Chris MacNeil implores the help of Father Karras to aid her in exorcising her daughter.  Uncertain what to do, Karras turns to the head of his order and seeks the assistance of Merrin, who has since returned from Iraq.<p>The story works on a number of levels.  The visual experience of the film is horrifying, as Regan is transformed from an innocent little girl into the demon that possesses her.  The film is dark, graphic and often very disturbing in its imagery.  But what makes this film far more frightening than the visual images is the psychological effect it has on its viewer.  This movie transcends the screen, and plays out like a literary work, giving incredible depth to each of its characters, making them very believable and easy to relate to.  <p>By the end of the story, the movie examines everything from the power of faith, to the power of darkness, and leave the viewer with an experience that will effect them to their very soul.<p>The DVD edition of this film contains many extras, including interviews with the director of the film and the author of the original novel (who himself was a Georgetown student).  It also contains footage that has never been seen in earlier releases of this work.  The film is controversal, and still one of the most disturbing pieces of all time.  It is an important film, and not one to be taken lightly.  <p>Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>In terms of a MOVIE this is clearly one of the best ever made.  Only the Godfather I & II compares to it, in terms of performances, (not a single bad one) Special effects and plot it is incredible.  <p>This movie doesn't rush itself.  It slowly builds up until you just can't take it anymore.  This is high art.  All the people involved in this movie should be rightly proud.  It will outlast anything else in the Genre.  I know Linda Blair's career has paid a price for this but very few great actors have ever made a movie as great as this one.  I would rank it in the top 10 of all time easy, maybe even top 5.  That being said I watched this version only once.  I will not buy this film, or rent it again yet if it is on TV I watch it, in fact I am irresistably drawn to it;  Why, becasue it scares me!<p>  You would think that at 39 years old and a life full of real things to deal with a movie 30 years old wouldn't do that:  You'dd think wrong.<p>  This movie not only scares me it is the ONLY movie that still does.  I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm a Roman Catholic and I believe this is not out of the realm of reality, but what really seems to get me is in this movie THE DEVIL WINS!<p>  What most people don't understand is that the devil even possessing the girl can't steal her soul in the act.  The attack is more directed toward the family and the Excorcist himself.  Will he have the faith to keep up, to do the rite again and again and again.  With they have what it takes to outlast the demon.  Fr Karas does not.  He willingly accepts the devil into himself and thus gives Satan the actual win he is looking for.  In that actual case the movie is loosely based on the Excorcism lasted for months until the demon was finally driven out.  The victory of evil in this movie is very visable to me.  How it is not noted by others more often is beyond me.  <p>(I have this fantasy of the final scene where Father Merrin is on the floor and all is about to be lost when the door opens and George Burns in his fishing hat walks in [Reference Oh God series] slowly to the Amazement of Fr. Karos and the Horror of the demon.  That happy ending allowed me to sleep many times in my younger days.)<br />  <p>Buy it if you dare.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG.html">A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG</a><br/><p>The Exorcist is not just the best horror movies of all time but one of the best films ever made. The story surrounding a young girl possesed by a demon is a true good vs evil story that will scare the hell out of you in the process. The actors,Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, (all recieved Oscar nominations) are at thier best. This movie is not for the weak of heart. It is a scary, powerful, movie. I saw this when it was re-released and it was just a powerful. If you have never seen this film rent, or buy it, today.</p></br><a href="../users/AZAEJB1ECT9HC.html">AZAEJB1ECT9HC</a><br/><p>I remember waiting on a long line outside the Paris theater in Manhattan to see The Exorcist during its original run in 1973.  About 6 months later it made it to my local theater in Brooklyn and I waited on an enormous line to see it again.  If you weren't around at the time, this film created quite a stir during its original release. Its all that people were talking about and everyone (including myself) were out reading the novel as a result.<br />This blu-ray edition is the best edition I've seen yet.  This 2 disc set includes the version that was released in the movies and the version with the eleven minutes of additional scenes (including Regan's infamous "spider-walk.")  The picture and sound are obviously excellent.  The disc with the extened version includes a new 3 part retrospective with director William Friedkin, Producer/Writer William Peter Blatty, Cinematographer Owen Roizman and Linda Blair.  The disc with the original version includes a 1998 BBC documentary including interviews with Friedkin, Blatty and most of the surviving (as of 1998) cast members.  It is interesting to see how young Max Von Sydow actually was when he made The Exorcist.  The make-up turning him into an old man is almost as impressive as Linda Blair's demonic make-up.)  It is interesting to note that Blatty states his objections several times to labeling The Exorcist a horror film, he prefers a religious suspense thriller. I agree with him, I've never considered The Exorcist a horror film.  A shocker perhaps, but a horror film seems wrong.  (For the record, I still think "Psycho" is  the scariest film ever made.)  There are commentaries on both discs, trailers, etc. etc.<br />If you own a blu-ray player, this blu-ray release of this all-time classic is the  one to get.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>It is simply amazing to me how well this film has held up over the years. For my money, it is still one of the most effective movies ever made. It is intense, serious, thought provoking, and hypnotic all at once. I saw this film when it was released. Some friends and I snuck into a drive-in (we were all under-age) and hid in the back in the bushes near an open speaker. It kept us all quiet, tense and staring out of the darkness at the screen, struggling to hear the faint crackling of the nearby speaker. All these years later, I bought the DVD, and it is the movie I remember, and then some. <p>In this age of computer, whiz-bang effects, this is still the top of the horror genre with no close competition, but it is far more than a genre. It has something that seems forgotten today - a great story, great writing, and great film editing. There are certain scenes of exorcism, with Max Von Sydow and the great, nearly forgotten Jason Miller, which are the most powerful in screen history. Only the "russian roulette" scene in Deer Hunter comes to mind as a comparison.<p>Lee J. Cobb (another great actor that is slipping from public memory) is memorable as Lieutenant Kinderman, and Ellen Burstyn seems to be living the movie more than acting within it. <p>So much has changed since this film was made - so many advances in the technology of filmmaking and even ways that we view or think of a movie. I think the primary secret of this film is the almost somber, deadly way it takes itself completely seriously. There is no comic relief in this picture, and no romantic interest. A human soul is possessed by the Devil. Only the Will of God can save her, a faith displayed by his representatives on earth. <p>Riveting and satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>The Exorcist is a timeless classic and obviously the best way to see it is in HD.  Still, Blu Ray releases can sometimes (very rarely, but occasionally) be less-than-impressive or not especially brilliant in comparison to similar DVD releases.<br /><br />Luckily, there's nothing to worry about. The new transfer of The Exorcist kept me awe-struck through the whole thing, a showcase of brilliant clarity and detail that no generation has ever been able to experience at home.  Every scene was deliciously glossy and had that 3D depth about it that makes Blu Ray fanatics giddy with delight.  This release is a classic example of the magic of 1080p and is absolutely worth the DVD upgrade.  Also, it's great to see that it includes both the original theatrical edition and extended director's cut.  (The original is better IMO, but I usually watch the Extended just to experience as much as possible) and crammed with a bunch of interesting extras including audio commentary and a 30 minute bit about the filming of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, if you're an Exorcist fan and are questioning whether or not this HD release is worth getting, rest assured it is.  The picture and audio quality are top notch and obviously restored with diligence and care.  If you've somehow never seen the movie before, now's the time to do it. Blu Ray gives this nearly 40 year old movie a glossy, young look that is just as stunning in appearance as any recent blockbuster.  I will say, however, that if you really want to experience the complexity and brilliance of the story in its full glory, you should look into reading William Peter Blatty's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061007226">original book</a>.  It's by far scarier and more shocking than the movie, in my opinion, and fans should definitely check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>when i first saw The Exorcist, i was scared beyond belief. i was so terrified i slept with my parents cause everytime i closed my eyes i would see the horrible things from the movie. in fact i almost have to force myself to watch it becuase its so scary. so what is it that makes The Exorcist so scary? its because of the images it shows you that disturbs you so deeply. even today, The Exorcist has been called the scariest movie ever made and one of the greatest american films ever and it lives up to that excpectation. when it was realesed in theaters back in 73, it caused mass histaria. people fainted, screamed, ran out of the theater, and some even suffered heart attacks with paramedics being rushed to the theater making it one of the most controversial films ever. the film tells of an actress who calls upon two priest to save her daughter who is possessed by the devil. every performance in this film is flawless but the true star is Linda Blair as the possessed girl, she brought so much force to a demanding role and she did it so well she has made Regan McNeal one of the biggest baddies in history. i also think she would have won the oscar had she not been competing against Tatum O'Neal and that whole controversy over the actress who did the demon voice. Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller also give some great performances to boast this film that if it wasent up against The Sting it definantly would have won the oscar for best picture. The Exorcist is one of my all time favorite films and i have recomended it to everyone who hasent seen it. so if you want to be scared out of your pants, see the film that is The Exorcist.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>By general consensus, this is the scariest of all mainstream films.  Now making its "historic Blu-ray premiere" just in time for Halloween.<br /><br />Both versions are included here.  The original 1973 theatrical release and the 2000 Extended Director's Cut.<br /><br />Exceedingly disturbing, crude, violent and blasphemous, the story unfolds like a documentary in which an increasingly frantic mother tries to get help for her sweet, innocent daughter who manifests evidence of a demon within.  The unthinkable becomes a battle in which two priests - one solid in his faith, the other doubt ridden - fight the malevolent entity.<br /><br />Extras in the two-disc set include a new 3-part making of documentary.  There are two commentaries, one with director William Friedkin and the other with writer/producer William Peter Blatty.  Also included is the feature length 1988 documentary "The Fear of God: Making the Exorcist."<br /><br />Something weird about Friedkin's original commentary.  Maybe he thought he was doing it for the visually impaired?<br /><br />The questions remain:  Can humans really be possessed by a non human entity or a demon?  And what happens when we rational human beings encounter the irrational?  That's what's horrific and even more so in hi-def.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Linda Blair, Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller star in William<br />Friedkin's 1973 horror film.

I grew up in a mixed home in that my mom was a devout Christian and my father was a devout atheist, and I dated a Jewish girl through most of my high school days.  I never knew what to believe.  My parents always wanted me to make up my own mind, but both attempted to influence me with their individual beliefs.<br /><br />I viewed The Exorcist on its re-release in 1975 (or so) when I was around 12 or 13.  It scared, forgive the pun, the hell out of me, but more importantly, it made me THINK!  I began to both read The Bible and books on the occult.  In addition, I bought many scientific books as well to see what they had to say on certain religious themes.  I am thankful for such an influential film as The Exorcist which began a five year journey for me to discover what I believe in.  There are very few films that make one think about such heavy issues as life and death, heaven and hell, science and God, and so forth.<br /><br />Some films have a way of staying influential inspite of time and some go way beyond what their genre typically entails.  While this is a movie, it much more than "just a movie".  In addition, this film is definitely NOT just another horror story.  The Exorcist belongs right up there with other influential classics such as To Kill a Mockingbird, Natural Born Killers, Roots, The Killing Fields, and Platoon, and other such thought-provoking films that either make a statement or ask us to make one.  The very fact that after 30 years this film still has the power to move us speaks volumes to its importance and influence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>It is really hard to believe that this film is over 30 years old.

The theme is interesting - possession is something that has fascinated people throughout the history of human beings - and the movie is filmed pretty well - nothing much to complain about. For some reason I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars though - maybe if I was religous I would find the film more intriguing - as it is I do not find it very frightening - but well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>its a bit slow in parts i think.a little girl gets posessed by a demon and a priest comes to try and exorcise it.it looks all low budget.theres a few versions.i think this one is best.its pretty intense,many people get scared off.the very fact that a little girl is the victim is pretty lewd i think.its supposed to be true but somehow i doubt it.its very psycologicly tormenting.theres the girls mom whose no spring chicken and a little girl,so the chick element is non-existant!the demon acts as the clerics assistants mom and really messes with his head.the important message is,dont mess with demons,but if you must,be prepared!the entire movie is extremely intense!the special effects blow.every so often they redo this movie.theres been 3 so far so maybe by 2015 0r so there will be another one.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>What is it about this 1973 film dealing with the subject of demonic possession that still has such a tight grip on our collective imaginations? Now some thirty years after its theatrical release it still warrants enough interest to generate over 700 reviews on Amazon.com.<br /><br />It certainly isn't just the special effects, which are quite good, because they can easily be outdone with today's technology. Nor can it be explained away by pointing to societies perverse fascination with grotesque images, foul language and projectile pea soup. It's not even the excellent cast, director (William Friedkin) or production values that make this one of the most gripping, unforgettable treatments of spiritual evil ever captured on film.<br /><br />I think the secret is found in something unspoken, but heard nonetheless. Something hinted at on-screen only in fleeting images that remain with us long after they've vanished into the darkness. This "Unspoken Something" I'm referring to is perfectly captured in the opening prologue of the film, that moment at the archeological dig site in Iraq.<br /><br />Prologue: As the sun sets on the far horizon Father Lankester Merrin finds himself alone. A moment later a pack of dogs begin to growl and fight amongst the ruins just as the wind picks up and swirls of red dust fill the air. Father Merrin realizes he is no longer alone. On a nearby mound stands a statue, a ancient representation of a powerful demon known to the Assyrians and Babylonians as Pazuzu. Merrin stands motionless as he looks deeply into the features of his adversary. They have met before. The essence of this film is encapsulated in this brief moment of realization.

While some horror movies become dated over time, this one retains its bite even after 25 years; the fears it plays upon are still strong, unlike movies that focus on atomic war. The plotline also is representative of a common sub-genre within religious horror--the disillusioned priest who regains his faith through extreme trials in which scholarship and science fail. The cold, clinical scientists do nothing but cause Regan enormous fear and pain, with no relief; only faith and religion can save her. It is a trial, but a trial worth struggling through, and a trial that is brought upon purely out of a desire to free Regan from the horrors that inhabit her, not scientific curiousity. An interesting commentary on science, religion, and faith, as well as a genuinely scary movie even without new-fangled sfx!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>Want some fear?

This is one of those films. Author William Peter Blatty wrote the novel after he was inspired by a story when he was attending college. It was a story of a young 13 year old boy who was apparently possessed and the exorcism that took place to rid the boy of the evil force. His book became The Exorcist, and it was given the silver screen treatment. Director William Friedkin, hot off "The French Connection", was brought on to board to make the film. Ellen Burstyn stars as Chris MacNeil, a single movie actress with a 12 year old daughter named Reagan(Linda Blair). The two live in a nice Georgetown townhouse and all seems well. It isn't long that Reagan begins exhibiting strange and odd behavior and it is without any kind of explanation. The doctors bring the idea of an exorcism to Ms. MacNeil, to rid her daughter of whatever demonic force has taken hold of her. Enter Father Damien Karras(Jason Miller), a priest with his own troublems, including the questioning of his own faith. The brilliant Max Von Sydow is Father Merrin, an elderly man of the cloth is called upon to perform the exorcism. I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. The film has an undeniable sense of fear and dread from the very beginning. It creates a disturbing feeling and image that crawls under your skin and stays there. The acting is teriffic. Sydow was only 44 when he did this, but you would really believe that he was 30 years or so older. Amazing. Linda Blair is fantastic as the put upon Reagan, and she won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar. Burstyn is really good. You really feel for her and believe that she is a woman who is quickly falling apart as her daughter is being ravaged by some force. Jason Miller brings a strong, intense presence to his role, and the camera eats him up in every scene. The film also boasts one of the finest scary soundtracks captured on film. "Tubular Bells" is chilling, haunting, and unforgettable. The make-up on little Reagan is some of the most chilling and frightening images caught on film. Her "episodes" and final exorcism are bone chilling and some of the most frightening and scariest pieces of film. Friedkin is someone who knows how to scare the crap out of people and he does it with a sure hand. There are a few scenes here that are classic and just those images will always be remembered and stand the test of time. I think a certain image of Father Merrin standing under that street light is the best. It's a shame that the film got a severe case of "Sequelitis". Part 2 is one of the worst films/sequels ever, but Part 3 was decent enough to watch. Make no mistake, nothing will ever erase the raw and powerful imagery and story of this film. Nothing. There is a reason this film is always at the top of every horror/scary movie list. It is that good, and yes, it is that downright scary.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>When America's favorite paperback of recent times, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; premiered as a movie in 1973, it was carnival time in theatre lobbys and Hollywood corporate headquarters. The film took in big profits and patrons were behaving as if they too were possessed by the devil. Long lines waited to see swirling heads, defrocked priests and a little girl who was no Shirley Temple. People freaked, ran from the theatre, got sick. The news press reported of ambulances arriving at theatres to escort ill patrons to the hospital. I remember many a cold night standing in the snow waiting to get another look at this ... show. When those lobby doors closed it was like being trapped in a cage with a ferocious animal. The chaos on the screen was only matched by the chaos in the theatre where people alternately laughed and genuinely screamed at the ridicolous horror, sometimes in the same breath uncontrolably.  As kids, we couldn't get enough of it. I must had seen it five times in it's premier week, every show a packed house of 'Rocky Horror' responses that were never planned. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was the tabloid 'catch phrase' of the day. It seems every church group in America was protesting the movie. There was talk that the story was based on the demonic possession of a Hollywood celebrity's child, we all knew who and we all believed it! We were told the real Catholic priests who played themselves in the movie were being ex-communicated from The Catholic Church, and yes, it's true, the Catholic Church rarely performs exorcisms. It was a glorious media ... circus and it retains that manipulative capitalist soul sucking spirit today. And to some of us it remains very dear. You see, the youth in 1973 could point up to the screen to a puke discharging, head spinning, foul-mouthed little girl with a fondness for crucifixes and say, &quot;You know, some days I feel like that.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>After thirty-four years, 'The Exorcist' remains nearly as shocking and horrifying as it was upon its release in 1973.  Back then, it was a movie event, and news pieces showed that 'The Exorcist' did to post-modern times what 'Dracula' did back during its debut.  Near hysteria came to some, but the masses were at least electrified by what is unabashedly called "the scariest movie of all time".<br /><br />The key element of this hallmark is that 'The Exorcist' is so convincingly real.  Reinventing horror, it relies on revealing the nature of a possessed demon inside of its innocent young host, Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair).  The way the drama unfolds is not unlike an investigation, complete with medical exams, psychiatry, and a police detective.  All of the inquiry gives the whole horror a plausible presentation.  For who would not be struck by the contrast between the skepticism of the modern world--including from Catholic priest, Damien Karras (Jason Miller)--in all its attempts to explain an irrational phenomena?  The demonic revelation sneaks up on its main players as well as the audience with a tension that only increases over time.  Needless to say, it doesn't rely a whole lot on the element of surprise with terrible malevolent beings jumping out at once.  As expertly as the sound and special effects are rendered, there is little for the audience to guess at what times terrible things will happen.  The presence of the demon inside of Regan makes its menace present to the audience as well.  We can feel the full force of the ordeal.<br /><br />'The Exorcist' takes place mainly on the Georgetown campus where Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is lead actress for a film she describes as "Walt Disney meets Ho Chi Min".  She has three helpers, including two German immigrants, and her director, Burke Dennings, provides an important part of the plot's direction.  Her loose connections with the priests at Georgetown provide some needed solidarity.  It is mostly Chris's story, and her struggle to find some solution to her daughter's developing problem, but it is also the story of two priests (including, the exorcist, Fr. Merrin [Max Von Sydow]) whose determination and struggles give more meaning to the main plot and how it remarkably develops.<br /><br />'The Exorcist' was directed skillfully by William Friedkin who has a host of classics under his directing belt, including 'The French Connection'.  Based on William Peter Blatty's modern bestseller and a screenplay adapted by him, 'The Exorcist' is still a masterpiece of modern horror meant to make one look for a reality beyond the senses.<br /><br />(The "version you've never seen before" doesn't do much to help or harm.  A couple of added scenes provide some poignancy; some of it is extraneous, but none of it really ruins the effect.)</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>In 1973, the scariest movie was released over an audience that dared to watch it. This scariest film of all time is entitled...THE EXORCIST. This film turned athiests into Catholics, it sent non-church-going Catholics to Church every Sunday, and it pretty much scared the living daylights out of every human being on this planet. Read on...if you dare.<br /><br />  In Northern Iraq, FATHER LANKESTER MERRIN (played by Max von Sydow), a priest, who is also an archeologist, is digging up artifacts of the country, when he comes across a frightening piece...the face of Pazuzu, one of Satan's diciples. As he leaves Iraq and heads back to the states, he happens to get a glimpse of the stature of Pazuzu, the full statue.<br /><br />  In Washington D.C., there lives an actress named, CHRIS MacNEIL (played by Ellen Burstyn). Living with here is her 12-year-old daughter, REGAN (played by Linda Blair). One night, while reading over a script for her next acting role, Chris begins hearing strange noises in her attic. She begins to suspect that rats are in the attic. How stupid can you be to think that rats are THAT big?<br /><br />  While walking home the next day, after a day's work of shooting a few scenes of her next movie, Chris happens to pass by the local church, where she sees FATHER DAMIEN KARRAS (played by the brilliant Jason Miller). She saw Father Karras at the shoot early in the day. Late that afternoon, Father Karras is introduced properly as he visits his mother, who is very sick. Karras wants to have her in a nice retirement home, where she'll be properly taken care of, but Mrs. Karras does not want any part of that.<br /><br />  That night, Regan and Chris are down in the basement, where Chris finds a Ouija board. Regan already knows how to work it, so she shows Chris how it's done. But for some reason, it does not want Chris to be involved. Oh, well, can't dwell over our losses...or can we? Over the course of the next two days, the noises in the attic begin getting louder and louder, Regan has been claiming that her bed has been shaking. Chris takes Regan to the doctor, where he diagnoses her with a nervous disorder.<br /><br />  As Father Karras learns that his mother has sadly passed on, Chris holds a party at her house to celebrate the ending of her next film, which is entitled, CRASH COURSE. The director of CRASH COURSE, BURKE DENNINGS (played by Jack MacGowan) leaves early because he ended up pretty trashed. Chris and SHARON SPENCER (played by Kitty Winn), the woman who home-school's Regan, who also leaves with Regan and Chris, joins the last few guests of the party around Chris' piano. Playing the piano is FATHER JOSEPH KEVIN DYER (played by Reverand William O'Malley). Father Dyer is a close friend of Chris', despite the fact that Chris and Regan are athiests. As the guests sing along, they are joined by Regan, who looks at one of the guests claims so evil that..."You're gonna die up there", and then urinates on the carpet. The other guests leave the party, as Chris' maid, WILLI (played by Gina Petrushka) tries to scrub the urine stain out of the carpet. But at that moment, Chris hears Regan scream terribly. She runs into Regan's bedroom to find Regan's bed violently shaking on it's own. Chris jumps on the bed to protect Regan as well as trying to get the bed to stop shaking.<br /><br />  The next day, Chris takes Regan back to the doctors to find out what the hell is going on, where the doctors perform an MRI and an EKG. They look at the results only to find that there is no disturbance in Regan's brain. At that moment, the doctors get a call from Chris, where they make a house call to the MacNeil house. Sharon informs the doctors that Regan is still having those A.D.H.D. episodes, but they have gotten severly violent. They enter Regan's bedroom, where growls in a deeply horrifying voice. She sits up, punches one of the doctors in the face, and says in a deep, man's voice..."Keep away, this sow is mine...", and then gets into a sexual position and simply says, "F--- me! F--- me! F--- me!", which is where the doctors heavily sedate her.<br /><br />  The next night, Chris comes back from the doctors office, where she is informed that a psychiatrist for Regan is more than neccessary. She arrives home and checks on Regan, where her bedroom window is wide open. She closes the window and heads downstairs, where Sharon arrives home. Chris scolds Sharon for leaving Regan by herself, but Sharon claims that she didn't leave Regan alone, for she called Burke Dennings over to keep an eye on Regan, while Sharon went off to get more of Regan's medication. That is when one of Chris' co-actors from her movie arrives to tell her that Burke Dennings...has been killed. He fell down the stairs outside the house and rolled down the street, where he broke his neck, to which his neck was turned completely around, making a 180, facing backward. That is when Regan comes downstairs...in her frightening spiderwalk.<br /><br />  The next morning, while going for a run, Father Karras meets LT. WILLIAM KINDERMAN (played by Lee J. Cobb). They discusss Burke Dennings murder, where the two go on about their business. The same day, Chris is discussing with the doctors about Regan's case, where the doctors inform her that Regan's condition is most likely not medical, but spiritual, which is where they tell Chris that Regan maybe under demonic possession and needs an exorcism.<br /><br />  She takes Regan home and puts her in bed, where she finds a crucifix. She confronts Willi, Sharon, and KARL (played by Rudolph Schundler), who is Chris' servant, about the crucifix, but they all claim they had nothing to do with it. That is when Lt. Kinderman arrives and discusses Regan's case, as well as Burke Dennings' murder. As he leaves, Chris hears Regan scream in horror and fright. She runs up and finds Regan in bed masturbating with the crucifix, and saying (in a deep, man's voice) something that is to sac-religious to review here. Chris tries to grab the crucifix from Regan, but Regan grabs her mother's head and shoves her face into her daughter's bloodied up privates and says, "Lick me! Lick me!" She then punches Chris' face, where Chris goes down with force, where Regan's head makes a 180, where Burke Dennings' voice takes over Regan, saying, "Do you know what she did? Your C---ing dauther?!"<br /><br />  The next day, Chris has a meeting with Father Karras. Now, as I said, Chris has no religious beliefs, but she is desperate need for religious seeking. She has Father Karras come by to see Regan, where Regan is fully under demonic possession, her face green and severly scarred, her eyes almost like a werewolf's eyes, her voice in a demon's voice. Father Karras introduces himself as who he is, where Regan introduces herself as..."and I'm the DEVIL!!!!". Apparently, Regan is not possessed by a demon, but by the Devil himself.<br /><br />  He comes back the next day to make sure that this possession is for real. Father Karras finds Regan speaking Latin, a language that Regan has never learned before. He sprinkles water on Regan, claiming that the water is Holy water. Regan reacts to it very violently. Father Karras goes to the Church and asks for the permission to perform an exorcism on Regan. He is given the approval, but he is to have help alongside of him...Father Merrin is the one to perform the exorcism with Father Karras. The reason for allowing Father Merrin perform the exorcism, despite his severe heart condition, is the fact that back in the 1940s, Father Merrin had performed an exorcism back in Africa. The exorcism supposedly last for months, but the exorcism was a complete success.<br /><br />  The two arrive at the house, to perform the ritual. They enter the room and begin the ritual. For the next 15-20 minutes, the exorcism takes place, and very horrifyingly. Father Karras and Father Merrin decide to take a little rest before it's time to start again. They enter the room, where Regan begins imitating Karras' deceased mother. Karras goes downstairs to get it together. He goes back to Regan's room to find Father Merrin...dead. He grabs Regan and begins beating her, where he shouts..."You son of a b****, come into me!!!" Father Karras finds himself possessed by the devil, where he tries to kill Regan, but Karras, with the control he needs, jumps out the window, down the stairs, and lands at the bottom of the stairs. The whole neighborhood arrives at the scene over Karras' body. Father Dyer arrives (since he and Father Karras are very close friends) and gives Father Karras a last confession.<br /><br />  The next morning, Chris and Regan prepare to leave their house, for the exorcism is overwith and a complete success, since Chris' movie is now finished. As they leave, Chris hands Father Dyer a necklace that was worn by Father Karras, but Father Dyer wants Chris to keep it, where he watches Chris and Regan drive off.<br /><br />  This, as I had stated, is the, if not one of, the scariest movie of all time. I have seen many scary movies in my day, but I have never seen a horror film that was this scary. This film will forever remaina cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7GHG2XNYO3J.html">A1I7GHG2XNYO3J</a><br/><p>The extra footage adds to an already great movie. I saw on the big screen in 1973 and still enjoy it very much today. Not much for extras but the sound and picture quality is sweet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>Why? It fulfills its goal as providing perhaps the most dreadful film of all time (emphasis on the word dreadful). There are no salvageable or redeeming qualities about this film.  All you will feel is utter dread, completely and in the most certain of ways. In that way, the film accomplishes its duty, providing, without question, one of the most hellish feelings in movie history. God's men do not prove more powerful in this tale and the film depicts the awesome idea of the sheer magnitude and might that the devil has at his disposure.  <p>We see a gentle child, a girl no less, being possessed by sheer evil.  Take note, this is not just a murderous type of evil; it is a combination of evils: perversion, anti-God vulgarities, and so on.  When you are done with this film, you will question your own faith and decide if you yourself are suitable to take on such a monsterous force like a demon - even if you are a good Christian. <p>Proceed with extreme caution, this film will provoke you to dread and make you question your faith and your own view on the spiritual world. It gets an A+ for invoking those fears.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Now, without a doubt, The Exorcist is one of the greatest horror films ever made.  This film showed that horror films could actually be &quot;good&quot; oscar-worthy, and epic.  I love schlock and B films, but Exorcist gave horror a good(or bad depending on the person you ask)name.  I find this to be one of the finest the genre has to offer, but I'm not so sure about the new version.  I think I'm in the same category of hardcore Star Wars fans who didn't care much for the special editions.  If you ask me, it's pretty ballsy to mess with a classic, coz you really run the risk of upsetting alot of people.  I didn't think it was too bad really.  In fact, most of it I could deal with okay, but there was one thing I just couldn't:  The dreaded &quot;Spider walk.&quot;  I think that really ruined it.  Not only was it totally out of place at that point in the movie, but it looked so corny.  Having Reagan come out of her room and attack was premature.  Why didn't she do it again, or any ol' time she pleased?  Why did she do it the first time?  How did they get her back to her room?  Did she voluntarily go back to her room?  Since we're dealing with an old film that we can't reshoot, there is no footage in the original film to explain that scene.  Why was it never talked about again?  Don't you think Ellen Burstyn would have brought up this rather bizarre episode to the doctors or the priest?  Well, like I said, I could deal with the extra dialogue, spooky phantom flashes and the hint of CGI, but that spider walk has just got to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>When this movie first premiered at my local hometown theaters, way back when, I recall seeing the massive lines to get in. I stayed away. In the meantime, I began to read articles on how people seeing the movie were becoming possessed themselves, by upset stomachs, fainting, and leaving.<br />When it came time for me to see the movie on the big screen, I was holding on to my seat with remorseful anticipation during the blank screen pre-movie showing, back in the day when in between movies was not bombarded by ads. I was wrong, and even surprised. As often as this movie has been punned by flicks like Repossessed, and horribly redone by movies like Beyond The Door, this movie almost needed no unduly jabs. You either found it repulsive, scary, or just plain funny. I felt the latter.<br />Unfortunitely, I was a Monster magazine devout reader, and they pretty much went into many articles concerning how scary movies are made. When I watched this movie, I kept analyzing how it was done, so much so, I forgot the terror I was supposed to feel. I enjoyed it, but its Ellen Burstyn, as the traumatized mother, that makes this movie really click.<br />She is the springboard for major concern, while the other actors play off of her situation. This movie didn't scare me, but it was well made and I like the original version best. Too much subliminal messages are incorporated in the additional scene footages, and they distract.<br />Tubular Bells score is simply awesome, even now!</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>Horror movies today fall into distinctly one of two categories: Dumb and Good. Lately we horror fans have had a sort of Garden Of Delights, with movie upon movie being released in rapid succession. The trouble with this is that the majority of these releases fall squarely into the &quot;Dumb&quot; category (Wrong Turn, 13 Ghosts, Jeepers Creepers 2, The (new) Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and while they may be relatively entertaining, it is possible to sit through them all without even breaking a mild sweat.<br /><br /> Far rarer today are those movies that hearken back to the golden era of Horror - movies like &quot;The Blair Witch project&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot; and &quot;Ringu&quot; invoking memories of such classics as &quot;Don&quot;t look Now&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; - and these movies garner critical acclaim, as their three-decades-old counterparts did upon their first release, too.<br /><br /> The reason? Substance over Style. Look closely at any of the more recent critically acclaimed Horror flicks and you'll see a common trend - no oceans of blood, no deformed humanoids wielding axes, no silvery-white transparent blue-screen ghosties. Just solid acting, excellent direction and excellent production. Real Actors with Real Characters to portray in settings that are... ...well, just real.<br /><br /> &quot;The Exorcist&quot; falls firmly into this category; it is the original triumph of Substance over Style. There are no hi-end special effects here, nor is there any Hollywood Overstatement to muck up the proceedings with. For that reason alone the excellent performances, beautifully shot direction and exquisite scoring are allowed to shine through, and the movie is today, a whopping 31 years after its original release, and every bit as compelling and powerful as it was back in 1973.<br /><br /> The plot centres on Regan MacNeill (Linda Blair), the daughter of acclaimed actress Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn). A series of out-of-character episodes and violent behaviour lead her through a maze of conventional doctors to a Jesuit priest, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Recognising that she is possessed by a demon, the Church summons experienced Exorcist Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) to rid the child of her evil occupant.<br /><br /> It is a strong testament to the superficiality of the modern Academy Awards system that Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. Here is a performance with depth, truth and believability - she is a Mother, she is on the Edge. Burstyn's remarkable talent shines through in this picture and the fear and tension she herself creates is alone worthy of praise. Blair as Regan is good, she is a perfectly sweet and innocent creature as Regan, and in the scenes where she is being taken over by Pazuzu (the Demon), she displays a rare talent in child actors - the ability to create drama without histrionics. Miller as Karras is similarly excellent as the tortured, moody priest wrestling with his faith, and the scenes between him and his elderly Mother are simultaneously tender and grim. Von Sydow does a good job with the role of Merrin, but he's somewhat peripheral to the central core of the story.<br /><br /> Direction is superior. William Friedkin has used a sharp, choppy style of camerawork to suggest violence born out of normality, and it works beautifully here. The Party and medical Examination scenes set a wonderful tone for the last half of the movie, and the floaty, unstructured quality of Karras' Dream Sequence is a beautiful, haunting piece of film. The opening scenes in Iraq and the Exorcism itself draw some interesting parallels - monochromatic and stark, they compliment each other nicely and, in and of themselves, are excellent 'ends' to the movie.<br /><br /> The score is perfect, animal voices and sharp strings (as well as Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of Pazuzu, check her out alongside Joan Crawford in spaghetti western &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;) add an aural tension that's rarely been matched, and the whole production screams of professionalism. Here are masters of their Craft, and we're thrilled to be along for the ride.<br /><br /> The special effects may look hokey in places now, but this is directly the fault of those delightful Wayans boys and Mister Leslie Nielsen, legally plagiarising the Bile and Head-Turning scenes for their own juvenile ends.<br /><br /> The extra material is good, the 'Spider-Walk' scene is particularly grim, and the picture and sound quality are excellent. The extras on the DVD are nice, but they're not the point.<br /><br /> All in all, this is one of the most well-realised horror movies of all-time. Following the novel almost to the letter, and providing deep-fear immersion, I can highly recommend &quot;The Exorcist&quot; to all that are sick of seeing old &quot;Buffy&quot; cast members having their nipples photographed by Modern Hollywood.<br /><br /> Excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Thirty years after it's release, THE EXORCIST remains the scariest film of all-time.  Adapted by William Peter Blatty from his own novel, this legendary horror flick follows the difficulties of a mother (Ellen Burstyn) whose 12-year-old girl (Linda Blair, in her biggest performance) becomes possessed by the devil, and how the mother discovers that the only way to save her daughter is an exorcism.  There is frightening directing by William Friedkin (THE FRENCH CONNECTION), a very short by haunting score by Jack Nitzsche, and great performances by Burstyn, Blair, Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb and Max von Sydow.  To add to that, there's horrifyingly realistic special effects (by Marcel Vercoutere) and eerie cinematography (by Owen Roizman).  Now we also have &quot;The Version You've Never Seen&quot; - which, hopefully you have seen, because it includes ten minutes of new, terrifying footage.  Once you've seen, the film's hundreds of ghastly images will never leave your mind.  Simply put, THE EXORCIST will live on to horrify us for generations to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Since I was a kid, I have heard people all over say time and time again that THE EXORCIST is "one of the scariest movies of all time." Well, I've never been a huge fan of horror, but in order to improve my cinematic horizons, I have been watching a lot of schlock and horror lately and finally viewed THE EXORCIST. My impression: what in the world is the big deal? Outside of superb acting and some neat special effects, THE EXORCIST isn't that great. The writing is terrible and contains loads of dialogue that when found in other movies is referred to as "cheesy" and "unimaginative." The movie moves at an incredibly slow pace, so much so that I almost fell asleep fifteen minutes into the film. The movie makes hardly any explanation of what is going on or why (I know this is a film that's supposed to make one think, but good thinking movies give a foundation from where people can begin to form their assumptions and ideas; this movie has no such foundation). The film has several major plot holes. The ending is predictable (come on, who didn't know the priests were going to die in the end?). The film paints Christianity in a negative light, picturing it to be something leftover from the Medieval Ages. And lastly, the movie really isn't that scary.<p>I guess that the reason so many people find this film so frightening is that they think something like it could happen to them. There must be a lot of people out there who are totally unsure about their salvation and the state of their eternal souls. Something like what happens in the movie would not happen to someone who is a Christian. Of course, Biblically speaking, it probably would not happen to an innocent (young child) either. Watching the movie, I got the idea that Linda Blair's character wasn't all that innocent. Even before she becomes possessed she hints at sexual promiscuity she has been involved with and some of her earlier actions with her mother and servants aren't all that innocent either.<p>I will admit that the acting is done well and some of the special effects are pretty cool. However, other than that, there really isn't any reason to see this film. I find it difficult that it is held in such high regard.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>That film was a turning point in horror films, in a way. For sure it did not concern some kind of mythical being or character. It was centered on a real person, living next door or up the street. That's the really new element, and even so, there had been some antecedents. The second new element here is the strongly Catholic context, and it is not clear at all that the Catholic Church is not used as a justification, a stamp of truth posted on the film, in other words an alibi. I find that slightly embarrassing today for the Catholic Church and all Catholics in the world. Many Catholics consider that demons, and daemons, and so on along that line, are nothing but a pagan heritage in the Christian approach of the world. The last point is not new at all. It is the close association of these demons to something found in some archaeological site in North Iraq, in other words in Moslem territory. This can be seen today as an anti-Moslem bias and it is absolutely unacceptable. On that point, like on the previous one, the film has aged tremendously. Apart from that the film was well made and still is well made. The suspense and the progression of the plot are quite clear. We understand more or less that the demon takes possession of the younger exorcist and that this priest prefers killing himself to being possessed. There are though several points that remain unanswered and difficult to accept. Why did that demon take possession of a priest? Wasn't it more comfortable to be in a young girl? And how can the priest justify his suicide in any way? If God enables a demon to take possession of one of his priests, that priest has to wait for God to liberate him, and committing suicide is not that kind of a liberation. That's why I will classify this film among the films that played an important role when they came out and even accumulated some fame because of it, but that have today aged tremendously and lost most of their appeal. The list of those is long.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Exorcist starring Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair is considered the best horror film of all-time, I have to disagree.

Tubular Bells is played for all of maybe 45 seconds the whole movie. The language is mild compared to even yesterday's pro wrestling, but the hokey gore etc. during the once horrifying demonic possession scenes are still there. The spider walk scene lasts maybe 10 seconds. The whole movie is maybe two hours long. Yes, it is Christian propaganda but it has appeared to have mellowed with age. This is abolutely nothing compared to even Night of the Demons 2, the last movie that genuinely unnerved me. As a Christian drama about demonic possession it's nearly a masterpiece, but like my pastor said, you can take a 76 Chevy, paint it, and it'll still be a 76 Chevy. Meaning here- what was scary as hell in the 70s hardly raises and eyebrow today even with a measly 11 minutes of added footage. Oh, and the prequel Dominion was bad. But still I liked it as a Christian drama. The horror isn't there any more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>I don't think that I ever saw the Exorcist fully until I saw this version in the theaters and now I wonder what's the point? I don't know what scenes were re-added, but I'm betting that the one with the mother being committed to the mental ward was there as it completely CONTRADICTS the next scene where the priest's mother is supposed to have died in her apartment and no one questions when they released her from the hospital.<p>Besides that this is a movie that's supposed to be menacing but falls flat. A 12-year old girl swears and pukes. Now I'm not a fifth grade teacher but I don't see what's so scary about that. By the time the wacky Jesuits come a-calling the movies been going on for almost 2 hours and you just want it to end. <p>That's not to say that this movie is worthless. It did inspire a really cool Angel episode. But it's dated. You can almost get out your pen and start writing an essay about working parents worried that their kids are going to turn out to be bums/hippies on a scene-by-scene basis. <p>By the way, I know I am committing horror movie blasphemy here but I really liked the sequel with George C. Scott and Brad Douriff as the demon-possessed priest. That was Exorcist III. It was just great to see Scott and Douriff face off against each other although I don't remember a thing about the plot except it had something to do with the demon-possessed priest and a serial killer and George C. Scott was way scarier than any demon from hell.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>This would have to be one of the most overrated and overhyped movies ever produced. It concerns a young girl named Reagan, played by Linda Blair who is possessed by the Devil. Linda talks pretty foul,masturbates and  vomits green stuff which is pretty typical of kids these days. Back then it was considered to be "shocking". One has to remember that this sorry excuse for a Horror movie was made back in 1973 in a much quainter Society than now.I give this movie 5 stars because I kind of like the atmosphere of the movie which is about all that it has going for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>When I first saw this film by director William Friedkin as a child in 1980, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of its plot and theme. The notion that psychiatrically deranged peoples are somehow possessed by evil spirits and need the blessings of a witch doctor to be healed seemed ridiculous even then.<br /><br />Apart from its preposterous theme, the film's plot is a nonsensical sequence of outdated shock images and little else.  First of all, Pazuzu is a Babylonian diety that has nothing to do with biblical lore other than the Christian Church demonizing it to make itself look saintly and paganism evil.  Even if Pazuzu were a demon, why did he choose to incarnate himself into Linda Blair: was she to be a new saint or the new Virgin Mary? These questions are never brought to light because William Peter Blatty  never had any competence to adapt a coherent plot to film in the first place.  As far as Blair's mechanical head twirling around on its motor, I've seen more convincing effects at Disneyland's Haunted House or in the Pirates of the Carribean tours.  As for the levitation tricks, one just needs to go to a David Copperfield show where they won't see dangling cables and the like.  On the bright side, Jason Miller and Max von Sydow played their roles well as the priests and Ellen Burstyn convincingly portrayed a skeptical but desperate mother.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing about the film is its portrayal of ignorant religious mumbo jumbo rituals as being an effective way of curing what are obviously serious psychiatric disorders. Perhaps the film should have also shown how religious entities successfully performed exorcisms in the past by drowning, burning at the stake, and simply torturing to death "possessed" peoples to chase the demons out: peoples such as Joan of Arc whom the Church apologetically cannonized almost five hundred years later. Indeed, we must remind ourselves of the very reliable scientific methods of the Church in exploring the mind as a spiritual vessel. Such methods were very effective in convincing countless peoples for centuries (through regular threats and acts of excommunication/ostracism, death, and/or torture of course)that the Earh was only 10,000 years old, flat, and at the center of our solar system. The movie should also show the success rates primitive societies have in curing medical conditions with similar rituals and the life expectancies of their inhabitants. With such an insight, the idea of exorcisms as cures will be the only thing to be seen as horrifying in horror films such as this one. If the power of Christ compels me to do anything with this film, it's to turn it off and throw it into the trash can where it properly belongs!</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>The Exorcist was the first DVD I ever bought, and I was transfixed and became a collector for two reasons,<br />The crisp image of the new digital technology enhanced the picture and sound and with it the quality of watching the film and enjoying it much more as a result,<br />and secondly, having not watched the Exorcist for a long time,  being banned in the UK until recently, I was again totally captivated by this original horror film that has aged very well.<br />Why is it still considered one the the sacriest films  of all time??<br />simple<br />1-Friedkin is a very talented director, and was at the  prime of his art when he did the Exorcist<br />2-The subject matter, dealing with the devil. It was one the the first films to tackle the supernatural in such a style, as opposed to vampires, draculas, zombies and giant tarantulas that was the staple diet of the horror genre.<br />Most crucially, using the innocence of a young girl, (played so well by Linda Blair, her first role and most important to date), as a platform for evil.<br />Though the gory scenes are outdated, and personally I find them the weakest part of the film, they do show this conflict between innocence and evil in one person.<br />The vile language and overt sexual overtones spoken by the devil through the child was the reason the film was banned in UK.<br />3-The music is an integral part of the mood of the film, and using Mike Oldfield's 'The Sentinel', added a lot to the scary atmosphere.<br />There are many disturbing scenes in the film,<br />the gradual possesion of Regan,Father Damien's spiritual conflict,and his dream scene!!!!! very disturbing!!<br />and the acting is all excellent, esp. Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, and the sadly recently  departed, the late Jason Miller.<br />The DVD has very good extras, and  though I have yet to watch the new version of the film, I still enjoy the Exorcist everytime I watch it, and am scared not by the gore..but by what's behind it all..The Devil Inside.</p></br></body></html>

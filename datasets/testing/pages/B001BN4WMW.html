I laughed out loud at Mel's Mad Max getup, and his scene with his chosen girlfriend plays like a 1980s teen flick, only set in brutish times. This is a howler. How did this ever win 5 Oscars? Oi-vey!</p></br><a href="../users/AV3JZAYAP7GHC.html">AV3JZAYAP7GHC</a><br/><p>And I'm about as Scottish (or Celtic) as Che Guevara. This film is well written, well acted, well crafted, and truly worth every award it's received. Rent it, buy it. Just watch it and enjoy.<p>It's an oft-told tale: of a quiet hero forced by circumstances to take a stand again forces that seek to destroy what he values most. Sound familiar? It should. It's been the basis of drama for, oh about 2,500 years. And why? Because it works.<p>This film takes place during a period that, unless you're Scottish or are interested in Medieval Britain, most of us know very little about. I certainly didn't know about William Wallace and I AM a history buff... The setting doesn't get in the way of the story, and I found myself more than entertained. I found myself inspired. Not by Wallace's specific struggle, but by Gibson's treatment of the ideas behind it.<p>Now, the violence and gore may turn off some viewers, but this film packs a wallop in telling its tale. There's all the elements of the epic, including romance and betrayal and, of course, war. Gibson has been justly acclaimed for faithfully reproducing the look and feel of medieval Scotland -- blood, guts, mud and all.<p>Oh and to the "not historically accurate" nay-sayers: I don't care if it's historically inaccurate. So what? If I wanted historical accuracy I'd read a dmn non-fiction book or watch PBS. Sheesh.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMOLKXVKQ06Z.html">ACMOLKXVKQ06Z</a><br/><p>It is rare that a film can be called one of the greatest love stories, war stories, epics, and so on, and so on.  Well it is.  It's basically the best  of everything and that might just be an understatement.<p>The acting is  superb and nothing less.  Mel Gibson gives the best performance of his life  so far and one of the best performances I have seen.  In this movie, the  characters really interact with each other on an emotional level,  they  fight for the things they have passions for.<p>Some say the movie is not  historically accurate.  Well I don't know if that's true, but who really  cares?  This movie is stunningly realistic.  The battle scenes really bring  the audience in.  There is no censorship here, and there is no looking  away, they are purely shocking.  The emotions that the characters go  through are realistic and moving, I dare anyone not to be affected  emotionally.<p>This movie is also beautiful visually and aurally.  The  scenery and art direction is right-on, and takes us to a different world.  The musical score by James Horner is haunting and melodic, not to mention  one of his best.<p>This movie is exceptional, it makes you part of it.  If  you haven't seen it, you have no idea what you are missing.<p>MOST HIGHLY  RECCOMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>Braveheart is 12 years old and the standard DVD is what 10,11 years old I didn't think Paramount would ever release a new Braveheart.No its not a director's cut and no its not on Blu-ray or HD-DVD but this new remasterd version has one great picture gone is the picture grain and the colors are way more vivid.So we are left with one of the best epic's of all time with one great picture and a second disc with some new extras including original cast interviews,making of braveheart,2 trailers,Tales of William Wallace,a photo montage and something called Alba gu Brath! I dont know what that last one is I havnt watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>There are five reasons why I rate this film so highly: great plot, great acting, outstanding production values, timeless themes, and indelible  images. As you probably know already, the movie focuses on William Wallace  who led the Scots to great victories before being betrayed, tortured, and  executed. Gibson combines his usual zest for physical activity with much of  the same sensitivity he revealed when portaying Hamlet. The supporting cast  members are all first-rate. Perhaps only Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan  are the film's equal in terms of production values. The battle scenes are  the most exciting I have as yet seen filmed. In sharp contrast, there are  lovely scenes of village life amidst the surrounding countryside. The  timeless themes include variations on David &amp; Goliath, the betrayal and  execution of Jesus Christ, and Odysseus' ordeals during his return to  Ithaca. There are so many vivid images it is difficlt to select a few as  examples. For me, details of the battle scenes and then the torturing of  Wallace are most memorable. Unlike so many other epics (eg El Cid, Quo  Vadis, and Cleopatra), Braveheart is one you will wish to see again and  again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>This is an Excellent Blu-Ray movie. All Blu-Rays should be this good. I have not bought Gladiator yet due to the reviews I have read. I'll wait for a re-issue on that.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Epic, grand-scale moviemaking at its best, Gibson's Oscar-winning tale of heroism and courage in 1300s Scotland marked a sensational triumph in the director's chair for the durable star. Ruggedly charismatic, Gibson plays a peaceful man reluctantly drawn into the violent drift of history, after which he becomes a ferocious leader and combatant. Sophie Marceau is alluring as Isabelle, a stunning English princess who draws Wallace's eye and heart, but the film really blazes thanks to Gibson's savage, jaw-dropping battle sequences. Even at three hours, "Braveheart" never loses its interest or intensity.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I thought the picture was fine.  Sound quality is very good and I was able to see all of the fights with blood and guts flying everywhere just fine.  I would like see a special edition though but making of's and a documentary on how a film was made, those types of special features are just getting boring.  Maybe you are looking for a blu-ray version of it but I have seen too many problems with these hi-def dvd's.  This DVD is cheap and is more than worth it.  I also found the behind the scene's and commentary from Mel Gibson very enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>&quot;Braveheart&quot; is quite simply, one of the best and most successful movies ever created and a huge part of that success comes from the efforts extended by Mel Gibson, as he wore three different hats for this masterpiece, those being producer, director and star.  The one oddity about this movie for me was that I pretty much wore out my VHS copy of it and had, a couple years ago, purchased the DVD but only just recently took the opportunity to watch it again and no matter how many times you watch this movie, it is still a stunning, compelling and extraordinarily intriguing film that draws you in to the life of William Wallace despite already knowing how it's going to end.<p>The one thing that drives this movie is the spirit that Mel Gibson puts into his character of William Wallace and it is of no surprise that &quot;Braveheart&quot; won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture of 1995 and Best Director for Mel Gibson.  The only true surprise was that he wasn't among the top five nominated for or won the Best Actor award.  <p>High praise also goes to the long list of supporting actors and actresses that starred in this superb film!  Most notable was the performance by Sophie Marceau, one of the most beautiful women on the planet.  Patrick McGoohan was absolutely incredible in the role of the villain Longshanks, King Edward I, delivering a memorable performance.<p>One of the most notable performances in this film, among the many, was the work done by James Horner who was responsible for the score.  As is normally the case when his name appears in the credits, everything about the score, from the first reel to the last, is incredibly well blended into the movie and serves extremely well in enhancing the experience of the movie.<p>The Premise:<p>As the old saying goes, is it Hollywood or History?  The truth is, of course it's a bit of history, put together Hollywood style to make one of the best films ever presented to an audience.  The truth behind it is that we'll never know as recorded history from this era is circumspect as best.  Where a huge portion of the credit for this film lays is in the hands of Randall Wallace, a descendant of William Wallace's.<p>As this historic film opens, we see a young William Wallace in Scotland as he's learning the harsh lessons of life in his era.  After his family is killed in battle he's fortunate enough to have his Uncle Argyle (played brilliantly by Brian Cox) take him under his wing!  Several years later he returns home to find that his countrymen are still suffering under the yoke of English oppression but he didn't come home for that, he came home for Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), seeking her hand in marriage.  Unfortunate events unfold from there and William loses the love of his life and goes on a rampage not only to avenge his love but to free his country...<p>What follows from there is not only one of the best films of the nineties but one of the best films of all times.  I highly recommend &quot;Braveheart&quot; to any and all who are interested in seeing what true movie making is about!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-2 Theatrical Trailers<br />-Commentary by Director Mel Gibson<br />-A Filmmaker's Passion:  The Making of Braveheart</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>On a whole number of levels, this movie shouldn't have worked for me.  It takes considerable license with historical facts, not only in order to supplement details that are not part of William Wallace's legend but actually, wherever convenient.  ("We stuck to history where we could but hyped it up where the legend let us," actor-director Mel Gibson admits on the DVD's commentary track.)  It is graphically and unabashedly violent: from throat cuttings to battle scenes that have film blood literally splashing onto the camera, beheadings, a traitor's head smashed with a<br />wrecking ball, and fully 15 minutes of Wallace's "purification by pain," it shows some of the most brutal behavior conceivable.  It also engages in some of the most blatant gay profiling in recent film history - not just in the drastic end administered on the lover of King Edward I. "Longshanks"'s son, but equally in the portrayal of both characters and their relationship as such.  Last but not least, Mel Gibson plays a man at least 10 years younger than himself, a choice often enough bordering on the ridiculous.  (Gibson insists it was the studio's wish that he not only produce and direct but also star in the title role.)<br /><br />And yet ...<br /><br />From the first notes of James Horner's hauntingly beautiful soundtrack and the first sweeping camera shots over the Scottish highlands, blending seamlessly into the pictures of the Scottish riders on their way to the alleged truce talks initiated by Longshanks, and the narrator's, Robert the Bruce's (Angus MacFadyen's) introduction - "I shall tell you about William Wallace: Historians from England will call me a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes" - there is no mistaking that this is an epic story, taking up the tradition of the likes of "Spartacus" and "Ben Hur."  Like those movies, "Braveheart" is a story of heroism and of having the courage of one's convictions; chronicling the life of its hero from first love to loss, betrayal, battles and final confrontation with his arch-enemy's powers.  Like both of them, "Braveheart" won multiple Academy Awards, not least for John Toll's outstanding cinematography.  Like "Ben Hur," it also won the coveted awards for "Best Picture" and for "Best Director."  And maybe I'm just a sucker for that kind of epos ...<br /><br />To my surprise, I found Mel Gibson to come across very believable as William Wallace; age difference, Scottish brogue and all.  Both his acting and his direction are informed by a clear sense of vision for the movie and its title character.  Moreover, although full writing credits went to would-be (?) Wallace descendant Randall W., many little details undeniably show Gibson's hand and mannerisms: to name just a few of the more obvious examples, Wallace's marriage proposal to Murron, his grinning greeting of a group of English soldiers trapped below a cliff, and his response to a doubting Scottish soldier's comment at Sterling that he can't really be Wallace because he's not tall enough.<br /><br />In addition to John Toll's award winning cinematography, the movie benefits from first-rate production design (Tom Sanders), a score which perfectly captures the mood of every single scene, and a cast of outstanding actors; first and foremost Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks, who portrays the king's utter ruthlessness so convincingly that you completely forget his earlier incarnation as the 1960s' "Danger Man," and who delivers monologues and soliloquies worthy of a Shakespearean king.  His musing "but whom shall I send" when plotting to send a messenger to Wallace with another insincere offer of truce, and his chilling announcement of the reinstitution the ius primae noctae because "the trouble with Scotland is that it is full of Scots ... If we can't get them out, we'll breed them out" could have been uttered verbatim by anyone of the Bard's most sinister kings.  (Screenwriter Randall Wallace does indeed admit to Shakespeare's direct influence on the script, particularly on Wallace's "Sons of Scotland" speech before the battle of Sterling, which is strongly based on the monologues of King Henry V. at Agincourt).<br /><br />Equally impressive is Ian Bannen in one of his last roles, starring as Robert the Bruce's leprosy-ridden father and evil spirit, whose first reaction to the tales about Wallace is to deride him ("He has courage; so does a dog"), and who expertly plays on his son's ambivalent feelings, until he finally drives Robert into hating his father for having coaxed him into his own game of  scheming and betrayal - whereupon the elder Bruce drily comments:  "At last you have learned what it means to hate.  Now you are ready to be a king."<br /><br />Then-newcomer Catherine McCormack stars as Wallace's childhood love Murron, whose scenes with Wallace provide for much-needed tenderness in the first hour of the movie - particularly touching is four year old Murron's gift of a thistle (Scotland's national flower) to orphaned William - and contrast sharply with the bloodshed that follows virtually incessantly from her death onwards.  Sophie Marceau matures from teenage party queen ("La Boum") to French Princess Isabelle; Brendan Gleeson stars as Wallace's boyhood friend Hamish, David O'Hara as his heaven-conversing, self-appointed Irish guardian Stephen - one of the movie's most colorful characters - and Brian Cox brings all his extraordinary screen presence to his brief appearance as Wallace's uncle Argyle.<br /><br />When I left the theater after having witnessed this movie's almost three hours of blood, gore and intense emotions for the first time, I felt as if somebody had given me a fist punch into my stomach.  I was so struck that I was almost unable to speak, and dragged my moviegoing companion into the next bar, to revive my spirits with a glass of whiskey. (Scotch, of course).  Having seen the film countless times since then, I no longer need that whiskey to overcome its drastic impact - but I still get gooseflesh during many of its key scenes and can't watch it without feeling emotionally drained at the end.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1841585939">William Wallace</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671522817">Braveheart</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079283366X">Rob Roy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005A8TY">Spartacus - Criterion Collection</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009UZG1O">Ben-Hur (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely wonderful, full of brutal depictions of hand-to-hand combat, tears and kisses, love and passion, freedom and strength.

Not only am I Scottish, born and bred but like all Scots I am extremely patriotic and proud of my country's heritage and its history, particularly the likes of William Wallace. I also acknowledge that Braveheart (and Rob Roy) undoubtedly gave our tourism industry a great boost, particularly with the number of American visitors and for this I am truly grateful BUT, not only is Braveheart a historically questionable account of the events surrounding William Wallace's rebellion against the English in defence of Scotland's 'Freedom!', the modern and truly cheesy dialogue totally spoilt this movie for me.<p>I could give you a very long list of historical inaccuracies to justify why I'd only give Braveheart three stars: First off, there is the fact that Mel Gibson is about a foot shorter than the great big hairy man that was William Wallace (but that doesn't actually interest me). Or the fact that the actual battle that Wallace defeated the English was called the Battle of Stirling Bridge, yet there is no sign of a bridge in Braveheart. Or, what about the fact that the `prima nocta' (legislation allowing English overlords to sleep with Scottish women on their wedding night) just did not exist. Perhaps the most ludicrous suggestion is that Princess Isobelle's child (the future Edward III) was sired by Wallace. Not very likely unless she was impregnated at about the age of four and had a twenty year long pregnancy. Actually there are so many historical inaccuracies I could go on and on BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE HISTORICAL INACCURACIES or the dodgy Scottish accents. I can even forgive the fact that Robert The Bruce (Scotland's greatest ever king and much more famous Scottish hero) is portrayed here as quite a weak, indecisive and possibly even cowardly character. I can also forgive the misguided patriotism that Braveheart has stirred in the uneducated and uncultured part of Scottish society, who didn't even know who Wallace was before Braveheart, and the fact that the councillors of Stirling have erected a horrible tacky dwarf sized statue at the foot of the Wallace monument that closely and embarrassingly resembles Mel Gibson. <p> What bothers me most, and detracts from my enjoyment of Braveheart, is the truly awful dialogue. I don't think I actually realised just how cheesy it was until I saw it second time around but it really makes me wince. Blame for this lies solely at the feet of Randall Wallace (no relation) who wrote the screenplay. This is the same man who was subsequently responsible for The Man In The Iron Mask (with Leonardo DiCaprio); its dialogue is also far too modern and also extremely corny. It's so bad it's almost on a par with Titanic.<p> Don't get me wrong BRAVEHEART IS AN ENTERTAINING MOVIE and I'm very glad Mel Gibson made it, but it just isn't culture and it just isn't brilliant. It's a good entertaining movie, better than average and it has a lot of other things going for it. For example, good supporting performances from the likes of Patrick McGoohan,  Catherine McCormack, Brian Cox, Sophie Marceau and James Cosmo). THE BATTLE SCENES ARE EXTREMELY DRAMATIC, EXCITING, WELL FILMED AND DIRECTED. The music is also excellent, the scenery is beautiful (although some of it was actually filmed in Ireland because it was cheaper). As a patriotic Scotsman, I'd truly love to say this was the greatest movie ever made and I wish I could but unfortunately I just can't get past the truly awful dialogue and personally in terms of Scottish historical movies I'd have to recommend Rob Roy.  <p>***1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Brave Heart  DVD<br /><br />Mel Gibson directed and stars in this epic biographical portrait of William Wallace, a 13th century Scottish rebel, who led an unsuccessful insurgency against oppressive British rule.<br /><br />I knew a boy, growing up whose name was William Wallace.

His Mother was a librarian, I guess she did.<br /><br />Great movie and I highly recommend it for fans of Mel Gibson and Scottish action buffs.<br /><br />Gunner  March, 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>A cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions, Mel Gibson's Braveheart easily competes with the classic historical epics of cinema including Ben-Hur and Spartacus, as well as recent blockbusters such as Gladiator. It is a film that encompasses all of the finest methods of filmmaking, and never fails to present a passionate and powerful story above its other movie-making feats. Awe-inspiring, brutal and action-packed, Braveheart makes no mistakes in its storytelling process and includes some of the most memorable and adrenaline-rushing sequences in recent memory.<br /><br />In 1280 Scotland, young William Wallace learns the hardships of life as reining King Edward the Longshanks claims the Scottish throne for himself and lays down a strict and merciless rule. When a group of noblemen go to negotiate with the local lords, they are slaughtered by order of the king, and William's father dies in the ensuing fight. Wallace (Mel Gibson) leaves for a time to study in neighboring countries and to gain skills in fighting, even though he hopes to come home to raise a family and crops. Upon his return, he secretly marries his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack); secrecy is needed due to the king's reinstatement of Prima Nocta, a law that allows the lord of the land to spend the first night with every newlywed bride. When Murron is attacked by English soldiers, Wallace assaults them, which leads to his wife being slain by the governing magistrate. In a fit of rage and revenge, he overthrows the English soldiers in his village, kills the magistrate, and begins gathering troops to take back control of Scotland.<br /><br />It comes as a shock to me that Mel Gibson wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of William Wallace, which is a fantastic role, adding elements of Mad Max and Martin Riggs peeking through the believable Scottish accent. All of the roles are well developed and enjoyable, from the miserly King Edward to madman Stephen to Angus Macfadyen's Robert the Bruce. Powerful performances all around boost the epic feel and thrilling action in this historical tale of bravery and courage.<br /><br />The scene following Murron's early death is perhaps the finest of the film, showing such passion, excitement and white-knuckle thrills like few films of our time. Filmed nearly all in slow motion, with powerful glances and violent bravado, Wallace takes his revenge on the English lord and begins the campaign to free Scotland from England's tyranny. The action sequences that follow, including the colossal battle scenes, are bloody and grand, and Braveheart quickly became known for its large-scale realistic battles. Displaying plenty of blood and gore, the elephantine battles are breathtaking and complex, and foreshadow Gibson's steadily developing bloodthirstiness for authenticity. Braveheart's torture sequence near the conclusion is also masterfully executed, careful to show audiences just enough to leave the imagination to solve the rest.<br /><br />At its heart, Braveheart is an eternal love story, for Wallace is pushed to fight for revenge, and later continues to sacrifice and struggle for the moments in his dreams that he can be momentarily reunited with his true love. "Every man dies", he tells the Princess of Wales (Sophie Marceau), who sympathizes with his cause and admires his bravery. "Not every man really lives." Betrayal, retribution, crafty counterplay and untouchable courage all abound in this winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Mel Gibson. Braveheart is a masterpiece in storytelling and visuals and one of the greatest of all historical epics.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>"Braveheart" (1995) was the second attempt of Mel Gibson as film Director and a huge box office success. It also won five Oscar awards including Best Director and Best Film.<br /><br />The story is based on Randall Wallace's book of the same title. It follows the life of legendary Scottish hero, William Wallace, from his boyhood till his death.<br />As frequently happens, Hero's life is not easy. His father is murdered by the treacherous King Edward I, the Longshanks, forcing him into exile. Wallace returns to his homeland, as grown up man and married Murron, only to loose her, murdered by the English rulers. This tragic event launches Wallace into a personal revenge that evolves into popular upraising against the foreign rulers.<br />From here on the film takes an epic tone, growing up as Wallace's ascendant grow over the Scotts, leading them from one battle to the next, from one feat to the next to attain their Freedom.<br /><br />Gibson proves his talent as film director and actor.<br />The battles shown on the movie are one of the most realistic and bloodiest ever filmed! Showing the audience what sort of carnage a confrontation on that historical period was.<br />All the cast performs remarkably well, with high points in Mel Gibson's charismatic and convincing Wallace; Catherine McCormack as the unfortunate Murron; a beautiful and expressive Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabelle; Patrick McGoohan as wicked King Edward; Brendan Gleeson as Hamish Campbell (Wallace's side kick)  and many other to long to detail here.<br />John Toll cinematography is full of subtleties and was awarded with one of the Oscar.<br /><br />A great movie for a variety of audiences: history buffs, action movie's fan, romance fans.

Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Long before The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson directed another cinematic masterpiece - Braveheart. Filmed against the backdrop of majestic mountains and rolling meadows, it tells the historically-based story of William Wallace, a common man's warrior who led the Scottish people in rebellion against King Edward I "Longshanks".<br /><br />Set in the 11th Century, Braveheart catalogues the struggle Scottish serfs faced under the brutal oppression of England. Against this backdrop, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) falls in love with Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack). Insistent that he will not share his wife (proclamation by the king gives local rulers first-night rights to new brides), Wallace secretly marries Murron in the dark of night. But when an English knight assaults her, Wallace sparks a fight. Fleeing the village, Wallace thinks that Murron has escaped and will soon meet him in their secret rendezvous point. But Murron is captured and put to death the king's emissaries.<br /><br />Angered at his wife's murder, Wallace starts a small rebellion, slaughtering all of the king's loyalists in the village. The rebellion quickly grows with more and more men joining each day. Distraught, Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) dispatches the Northern Army to destroy Wallace and his followers. Wallace delivers a stirring speech to rouse his men, and he employs an ingenious battlefield trick to defeat the king's cavalry. The Wallace rebellion continues unhindered as York is sacked and the rebels approach the heart of England.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Longshanks sends his daughter-in-law, Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) on a peace mission to meet with Wallace. On the king's behalf, she offers him gold, land, anything he wants if he will only stop the rebellion. She and her servants are greatly impressed with the sophistication displayed by Wallace, who speaks fluent French and does not resemble his barbarian myth.<br /><br />Wallace turns down the offer made by Princess Isabelle, but he knows that he can not win Scottish freedom on his own. He needs the support of the noblemen. The leader of the nobles is Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) who struggles against his own idyllic view of the world and his father's pessimistic pragmatism. After much struggle, Robert decides to work with Wallace, but remains unaware that his father has betrayed Wallace into the hands of Longshanks.<br /><br />As Longshanks lies on his deathbed, his daughter-in-law whispers in his ear that the child she is carrying belongs to William Wallace. In the courtyard outside the king's room, the executioners encircle Wallace. He is brutally tortured, but refuses to swear allegiance to Longshanks. Instead, he issues the clarion call of "Freedom!" inspiring his countrymen to fight for and win their independence...<br /><br />With a brilliant array of costumes, vivid battle scenes, and a noble hero at its center, Braveheart is more than just a movie. It's a part of history. It's call for freedom and belief that some things are worth risking life and limb for strikes a cord within every viewer. In fact, the movie led to a revival in nationalistic pride that fueled the successful Scottish independence movement of the 1990s. A thousand years later, the enduring legacy of William Wallace is still transforming the European landscape. And Mel Gibson captures the passion of Wallace with an Academy Award winning masterpiece of a film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>I saw this movie years ago when it first came out.

It isn't just a &quot;Well, let's take the prejudice and make the viewer feel terrible.&quot; William Wallace stands up to the English and decides to fight for freedom.<p>Epic from start to finish. 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>Well, started with the initial standard release, then got the Sapphire two movie release with Gladiator and now the Sapphire Blu Ray.  Not interested in summarizing the plots and acting techniques, just the quality of the DVD itself.<br /><br />The video is quite stunning.  Beautiful transfer translates to beautiful, rich and deep colors and details even in the darkest of areas.  I have no complaints at all.  Just gorgeous.<br /><br />The audio is Dolby True HD 5.1 and sounds good.  Most of the film takes place in front of the camera and therefore most of the audio is placed in the front stage of your audio system.  The actual music score is evenly spread across the sound stage very nicely. While the rear channels are used primarily for ambience, not much discreet channeling takes place here.  I would think, that for the battle scenes, especially, the rears could have had more foley effects directed to them.  Not so.  The sub gets down pretty deep in parts but overall, while good, I would not use this DVD as an audio demo.  I might use the video as a demo, just not the audio.<br /><br />This is a two disc set and the first disc(with the film) has a very interesting historical timeline with much to read as well as accompanying short documentaries .  Since this movie is not reality 100% historically accurate, this timeline is quite beneficial and interesting for those who enjoy historical aspects as I do.  The second disc contains many other extras that I also welcomed tho I am not usually enamored with DVD extras.<br /><br />I give the movie as entertainment 5 stars.  The video 5 stars and the audio 3.5 stars.  Hopefully this review has been of some help and, if so, click on the 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right path with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>A friend of mine at work gave me the VHS version of this movie soon after it first came out--in order to help entertain me while I was convalescing a home after a hospital stay.  It was indeed pretty entertaining with all the battles and so forth.  But the final part, where poor old Wallace is drawn and quartered was really too much for me--especially given the fact that what I had been subjected to in the hospital was major abdominal surgery!  To see all of those crude implements assembled and then applied to Gibson's character made me wince--especially with a few dozen surgical staples still holding my incision closed!  I really doubt that Wallace would have been able to articulate even the word "freedom" after having his guts mangled in such a way!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a stunning transfer, one of the better transitions to Blu-Ray I've seen and especially impressive since the film is 15 years old.  Detail is sharp and the colors magnificent..  Anyone fortunate to grab this when Amazon was selling it for $10 got a steal.  It's still a great bargain for under $20.<br /><br />By the time you are done watching this, you are emotionally spent with the involving story and totally satsified with the beautiful photography you've witnessed over 177-minute epic film.<br /><br />What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character: Scottish rebel leader William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story, great cinematography, excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film that looks incredible on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Scrap your old edition and get this one: you won't be sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>If I were to study about William Wallace, I wouldn't do it with Mel Gibson's classic "Braveheart"; I would go to the library to do it. The film is filled with historical inaccuracies, like Stirling Bridge and the Battle at York. But that's because this is based on the LEGEND of Wallace, and not history.<br /><br />But anyway, this is my second favorite film from director Mel Gibson, only behind the more recent Apocalypto. It's in the grand-scale epic tradition: it's more than three hours long, it has intense battle sequences, it has a cold and heartless villain, etc. What I love most about this film are the battle scenes. The skirmish at Wallace's home, and the chaotic confrontation at Stirling, York, and Falkirk are bloody and gory and ultimately brutal. I won't tell you how brutal the action is, but I can tell you that they are some of the greatest captured on film. Sure, "Gladiator" had some gore, too, but this one takes the cake for me.<br /><br />The acting may be a bit exaggerated in some scenes, but it sure fits in the epic genre. I don't think I can find a better actor who can play William Wallace than Gibson himself. His Scottish accent is almost perfect, and the way he encourages the Scottish to fight for their freedom is just amazing. Patrick McGoohan plays Edward the Longshanks, the king who would most love to hate. He's got the cold personality down perfectly. Sophie Marceau is enchanting as Princess Isabelle, a woman who is not really loved by her husband. Catherine McCormack as William's love, Murron, is also beautiful and lights up the screen when she's with Wallace. Angus McFayden as Robert the Bruce gives out a great performance as he starts to see why Wallace is fighting for freedom. The supporting cast (O'Hara as Stephen, Gleeson as Hamish, Cosmo as Campbell the Elder) play their parts splendidly.<br /><br />I can tolerate the movie "300" for its fantastic visuals, but not for its incredibly inaccurate history. But I tolerate "Braveheart" more because it's one film that I grew up with. Both films are about freedom, and both handle the main theme very well. But I prefer "Braveheart".<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>Great acting, great editing, great plot.<br /><br />Very emotional,moving, violent and exceptional.<br /><br />I dont care what kind of fan you are of movies horror, comedy etc...<br /><br />Everyone must own this a pure classic and incredibly enjoyable movie to watch.<br /><br />Worth every penny.<br /><br />As im more a fan of horror im not going to write a review but will reccomednd this movie with my highest regards.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>If you are a Mel Gibson fan of any sorts this movie is a must see. A wonderful directing job, supported by a wonderful cast. Men will appericate the attitude depicted by Mel Gibson towards his love and his country along with the added violence.

I have respect for Mel as a director.</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>This is a film that has been done justice via the DVD format .<br />For those who like to listen to commentaries , be warned that the audio quality is not that good . It sounds as if there was a blanket over the microphone whilst it was being recorded , but Mel comes across as very human and rightly gives a lot of credit to the cinematographer .<br /><br />Many people will find the battle scenes stirring , though if you would like to get an idea of where some of the influences were from , I would refer you to the Orson Welles film called CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT . The DVD is available from Ebay sellers and it is manufactured in Spain .<br /><br />BRAVEHEART is an epic film that doesn't feel like it .<br />Great escapism and period flavour .<br />Highly recommended to lovers of films like BEN HUR .</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>This is the "based on fact" story of a Scotsman who rallied some of the clans to fight a brutal english King.  The film captured the politics of the times.  The battle scenes are awesome.  The manner in which Wallace was betrayed and killed is based on fact, and the film does capture some of the brutality on his death.  The sad fact is that this kind of brutality existed then.  Many of the famous "victors" treated their enemies the same way.  Alexander the Great was known to slaughter and torture.  In our present day we have Sadam Hussien and his sons.<p>When I first saw this movie I wasn't aware that it was based on the real life of a scottish patriot named william wallace. I saw it with friends and all my friends laughed when I speculated that it had the feel of real history. One of my degrees is history, but this was in almost medieval times, not my emphasis. Ticked that my friends laughed I researched and discovered the truth. I was correct. Even the part about what drove Wallace (the murder of his wife) to be a fanatical leader is based in fact.<p>Somehow knowing that this movie was based on fact stirs the blood even more. Why? Because if it was fiction, ones reaction to events is very different.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>That dialogue has to be one of the most inspirational and moving speeches ever given on film. It speaks volumes too about the war that we have been forced to wage recently. Anyway, Braveheart is nothing short of spectacular. The battle sequences are breathtaking, epic, and completely convincing. Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing such a large scale project and Braveheart succeeds on multiple levels. The character development is excellent and the viewer comes to deeply care about the Wallace character and his motley crew. At it's core, Braveheart is a love story. The tale of a man forced to wage a war that he had no intention of fighting. Avenging the death of his slain love, William Wallace besieges the English colonizers  and liberates Scotland in the name of freedom. This film is an inspirational call to arms and is truly American down to it's very core. Funny that this would come from an Aussie, eh? I can honestly say that Braveheart is one of the best films I have ever seen, no DVD collection will be complete without it. Highest Recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>While &quot;Braveheart&quot; isn't historically accurate, it features many of the elements of previous Oscar winners for Best Picture. These include, the beautiful mountain scenery of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, the struggle for independance from England and/or the violent death of the title character featured in &quot;Gandhi&quot; and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, the rivalry between an older member of the Establishment and a younger rougue in his thirties, as well as the eventual undoing of the work of the elder character featured in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, and there is even a poignant look about the character at the moment of death in which his blue-eyed gaze falls upon the face of his wife that was also featured in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, where a cute, lop-sided grin from a beautiful mouth leaves an audience with reassurance that the character is not defeated. Gibson unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of Mozart in the latter film a decade earlier, but that he has come full circle since then, winning two Oscars with &quot;Braveheart&quot;, speaks volumes about the possibility that he just might be over that rejection. Gibson is at his energetic and vengeful best as Scottish warrior William Wallace, who has seen the English destroy everything and everyone he's held dear since childhood. In a fine, charismatic performance, he woos, wins, and loses his childhood sweetheart, played by Catherine McCormack who gives the character a sweet Scottish soul, rouses an army against the English, defeats them at Sterling, is defeated by them at Falkirk, and along the way recives a knighthood, and support from an unexpected source, Longshank's daughter-in-law, played by tall and willowy Sophie Marceau, who looks like she stepped out of a Rossetti painting. In reality, Isabella of France never met Wallace, much less had a child with him, and has nothing more in common with Wallace besides the date of her death--August 23,1358--exactly 53 years to the day of Wallace's execution. But in the film, she does a great job comforting a grieving widower, whose lonliness and lack of love in his life can, like hers, be attributed to Longshanks. Patrick MacGoohan's Longshanks is sinister to the core as he uses every evil device to bring Scotland to its knees. The film strikes a chord with me for the same reason &quot;Gandhi&quot; did. My parents, who are from Barbados, grew up under British rule, and have some familiarity with English injustices. Robert the Bruce, as played by Angus McFadyen, is a troubled nobleman with a lot of unfulfilled potential,forced to make compromises to keep order in the country he would one day rule. The late Ian Bannen as his leperous father is the mastermind behind Bruce's every decision. I could feel the cold damp climate of the British Isles from just watching this movie. But the ashen bluish light veiling Gibson's face and complimenting his trademark eyes at certain points was a masterstroke of cinematography. Mel proves he is still in fine form and as ready for action as ever, and he is aided by a childhood friend with brawn to match his brains, and a psychotic but effective fellow from Ireland. I could never say enough about the intensity of his performance or of the film in general. It's a typical Gibson film in terms of venegefulness, sensuality, and the justfication for killing his adversaries. It's a bit too graphic for young children, but could be recommended to anyone who was at least 15 or older.In the end, there are feelings of such reverance as well as elation from watching this film, for which James Horner wrote a score that fills one with a sense of both triumph and solemnity....And the tapering sound of a lone bagpipe in the distance, faintly reminiscent of those that might have been played by any of Scotland's warrior poets of that distant era.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>After the Mad Max and the Lethal Weapon series, and a very funny co-starring of Maverick with Jodie Foster, Mel Gibson brought this brilliant movie to life as director and actor. <p> The movie revolves around the epic character of William Wallace, a man who led the Scottish in their struggle against the English. Filled with love and battles, there are very few movie endings that remain so strong in my memory. <p> To top things, Gibson brought on board thousand wars veteran James Horner to put together a unique soundtrack to go with the story. <p> You can't get it wrong. This is one of history's most beautiful and heroic tales.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>For those who don't know the story behind the film, it is a simple but affective one. Mel Gibsion plays a Scottish commoner named William Wallace, who leads an uprising against the cruel and tyranic king of England named Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan)to free Scottland from English rule. <p>Very few films come close to Braveheart. It is perhaps one of the most inspiring and powerful films ever made. Mel Gibson could not have done a better job. He not only took on the difficult task of directing this film, but he also played the lead character. The passion and energy that he brought into the character of William Wallace is incredible, and watching him act out the role will amaze you. The rest of the cast was filled with talented actors who nailed their roles as well such as Angus MacFadyen ( Robert the Bruce), Patrick McGoohan ( Edward Longshanks), and Sophie Marceau ( Princess Isabelle). However, the performances given from the entire cast, is not the film's only strong point. The battle scenes are incredible. The sheer violence and authenticity of each battle scene is unreal. It is so realistic looking, that you will be made to flinch at times. The film also features a powerful soundtrack filled with beautiful bagpipe scores that really add to each scene. Last but not least is the film's ending. It is perhaps one of the best I have ever seen, and it brought the film to a thrilling and satisfying conclusion.<p>Overall, Braveheart will go down as one of the best films ever made in my opinion. There are very few films that match its intensity, authenticity, and inspiring story. Mel Gibsion should be proud because he created a masterpiece. The DVD is definately the way to go in this case. First of all, the whole film is captured on one disk, and you do not have to worry about switching tapes. Secondly, you get a behind the scenes featurette on the making of the film and commentary from Mel Gibsion. The picture and sound quality is excellent as well.<p>A solid 5 stars...</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>** A REVIEW FOR THE "BLU RAY" VERSION **<br /><br />Re-watching 1995's "Braveheart" on a 2009 BLU RAY - you're struck by several things...<br /><br />The downsides - Mel Gibson's truly awful mime of a Scottish accent (title above)...his ludicrous hair and wigs...and it just goes on for too long.<br /><br />Upsides - Mel was also the most handsome man on the planet at the time of filming, Patrick McGoohan was chillingly brilliant as Longshanks The King, it had loads of tremendous support actors throughout (Brian Cox as Wallace's Uncle, Brendan Gleeson as Hamish his friend, Angus MacFayden as the Scottish King in waiting, David O'Hara as a fighting clansman, Ian Bannen as the Leper and the mad-eyed James Cosmo). And to top it all off - you get both Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau in the same film - easily two of the most beautiful women in the world. And of course there's also James Horner's haunting musical score - a beautiful air played on the Pipes which kicks in at key moments in the story; it can still bring a tear to your eye and a quickening to the pulse...<br /><br />But most of the time you are seriously impressed with the cleaned up PRINT - because on BLU RAY - "Braveheart" is BEAUTIFUL to look at - it really is. Apart from a few lines in the opening shots of the Highlands, the transfer is almost faultless throughout and really adds to your enjoyment of the scenery, the costumes and the fantsically well-staged battle scenes. In fact, I also now remember why I liked it so much at the time - it had passion and fire - like "Gladiator" did - and still does.<br /><br />The original bonus material remains intact, there's two extra hours of added-on special features and the whole 2-Disc set now comes in a tasty outer card wrap (like the Bond titles).<br /><br />On BLU RAY "Braveheart" is a very handsome thing indeed - a sweetheart. And it has never looked this good and that's for damn sure.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />PS: for other superb restorations on BLU RAY see also my reviews for - "The Italian Job", "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning", "The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner", "Zulu", "North By Northwest", "Cool Hand Luke", "The Dambusters" and "The Prisoner - The Complete (TV) Series In High Definition", "Goldfinger", "Snatch", "The Ladykillers" and "The African Queen"</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>I'm not a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; fan and I normally don't coo and carry on about Mel Gibson, but his performance in this film blew me away.<p>When Gibson got the Oscar for best director and the movie got the Oscar for best  picture, I was thinking, &quot;what?&quot; I hadn't seen the film yet and I  thought it was just some grandiose tale w/ Gibson showing off his long hair  and rippling muscles or something. It just looked stupid to me and I wasn't  interested in seeing the film from the trailers.<p>After everyone made such  a big deal over the film, I figured I'd rent it and see what the commotion  was about.  It is a beautiful film and I wish I had seen it on the big  screen.  Gibson's performance is stellar. You easily get emotionally  involved with the characters in this film, which really helps you to forget  that this is indeed a movie you're watching and not an experience you're  having.<p>The film is based on William Wallace, one of Scottland's greatest  heros. While Wallace was a real character, I've heard commentary that this  film deviates from history on almost every account of this man.  Wallace  was almost all but forgotten until this movie came out, however, and even  historians were applauding the film for bringing more interest in William  Wallace.<p>The battle scenes are exciting and the emotional struggles in  the film ranging from first love to seeing friends and love ones being  executed runs high through out.  Even the ending, while tragic, is poignant  and beautiful... the Oscars won for this film were honorably earned.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Paramount Widescreen Collection DVD of "Braveheart".....<br /><br />Before 1995, I like many others, had not known much about William Wallace, or the very important part he played in European history. Now thanks to Mel Gibson's epic and realistic film of this 13th century Scottish hero, there are not too many of us who don't know his story.<br /><br />The film, which went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture(among many other awards)depicts Wallace's love and passion for his country, his freedom,his people, and Murron, the woman who's love he would carry with him long after her death, and who made his heart brave.From the touching romance to the bloody battle scenes, the film is filled with intense and stirring moments, and one that will inspire any one to dig down deep inside to stand up for what is right.<br /><br />There are many wonderful reviews here, delving into the storyline of "Braveheart", so I would like to talk about this fabulous DVD. If you do not own a DVD player and are looking for a reason to finally own one, this is the DVD that will get you hooked and you will never look back! I've watched "Braveheart" dozens of times on VHS(and always thought it looked pretty good), but after finally getting a view of the DVD, I felt like I was watching it for the first time. The wonderful cinematography by John Toll is magnificent. The gorgeous scenery and colors come alive. The costumes had details I never noticed before. A little sparkling jewel on the gown of the princess,the make up, even the rain looked so much more vivid.The presentation in widescreen lets you take in every detail of the battles and the castle.You have the choice of Dolby Dig 5.1 Surround or Stereo surround(choose in the set up)and is outstanding.All the sounds of the 13th century and the moving score by James Horner come through beautifully.The film may be viewed in French(stereo) and has captions in English for those who may need them.<br /><br />Special features include commentary by Mel Gibson, theatrical trailers, and a 30 minute featurette "A Filmaker's Passion: The Making of Braveheart", which is entertaining as well as informative.It's a great look at the history of the story, the technical aspects that went into the film and Gibson's own passion for it.(On the lighter side,look for Mel reading a beginners guide to making an epic film).<br /><br />At nearly three hours,I never want it to end. A wonderful love story, an epic adventure,and a piece of history on a great DVD.<br /><br />Enjoy....Laurie<br />also recommended:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EYC">Best Picture Collection - Epic Dramas (Casablanca/Gone With the Wind/Ben-Hur)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009QAIKM">Gandhi</a></p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Set in the late 13th century, 'Braveheart' is the story of one of Scotland's greatest national heroes Sir William Wallace. leader of the Scottish resistance forces during the first years of the long, ultimately successful struggle to free Scotland from English rule...<br /><br />Crucially charismatic in the title role, Gibson plays the heroic figure and emerges as a remarkable hero with wit and romantic soul, determined to rid his country of its English oppressors...<br /><br />Wallace's revolution was set in motion, with great obstacles from his countrymen... Many Scottish nobles lent him only grudging support as most of them were more concerned with wealth and titles than the freedom of the country... In fact, the Scottish leaders are in favor of revolt-or not-depending on English bribes... Wallace, by comparison, is a man of honor, incorruptible and righteous... He was knighted and proclaimed 'guardian and high protector of Scotland,' but as much as he railed against the Scottish nobles, submitted to Edward I, King of England, he was astonished and in shock to discover the treachery of the leading Scot contender for the throne--Robert, the Earl of Bruce--to whom he confided , 'The people would follow you, if you would only lead them.' Sophie Marceau is exquisite as the distressed princess Isabella of France who ends up falling in love with Wallace, warning him out of several traps...<br /><br />Catherine McCormack is a stunning beauty who ignites Wallace's revolution...<br /><br />Patrick McGoohan is chilling, brutal, and vicious as the ruthless Edward I, known by the nickname 'Longshanks.' This king remains simply the embodiment of evil...<br /><br />While Angus McFadyen moves as a nobleman torn between his conscience and political aspiration, and Brendan Gleeson brings strength and humor to his role as the robust Hamish, David O'Hara is very effective as the crazy Irishman who provides much of the film's comic relief from even the most tensed moments...<br /><br />Mel Gibson has reason to be proud of 'Braveheart.' It is a motion picture that dares to be excessive... Gibson presents passionately the most spaciously impressive battles (yet staged for films) even excessively, and it is his passion and excess that make the motion picture great... The horror and futility of massed hand-to-hand combats are exciting rather repulsive... It is epic film-making at its glorious best...<br /><br />Gibson's 'Braveheart' focuses on the human side of Wallace, a character so immense, so intelligent, and so passionate, exploring the definitions of honor and nobility, pushing us to follow the hero into his struggle against injustice and oppression...<br /><br />There is a great shot of the lovely mountains of Scotland covered in mist with beautiful bagpipe music... James Horner's beautiful score, calls up memories of his work for 'Titanic.'</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>It seems incredibly remiss of me not to have reviewed one of my favorite movies, a definite Oscar-winning `Desert Island' disc of mine.  As an early adopter of the DVD format it was a movie that I eagerly awaited on the shiny little discs, there was even a Web site launched by another fan with the sole express purpose of pressuring the studio into releasing the movie on the format. Thankfully Paramount relented in 2000 and finally released the movie and I was there the day it came out to eagerly snatch up my copy.<br /><br />The historical inaccuracies have been well documented in the past. Very little is known of the background to William Wallace, and what we do know comes mainly from an oral history originating after his death. Even what we do know is not translated accurately into the film. Perhaps the most glaring example of this is the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which is portrayed here without the bridge. This is seen as critical by historians since the bridge played a role in the Scottish victory.<br /><br />However, as screenwriter Randall Wallace (who had never heard of his famous ancestor until a fateful trip to Scotland)  said in a HISTORY channel documentary on the movie, the script holds true to the spirit of the Wallace history and technical issues finally proved prohibitive to filming the battle as it happened.<br /><br />The movie follows the story of William Wallace who led his native Scots in a revolt against the English King Edward the Longshanks  (played with wonderful villainous relish by Patrick McGoohan).  In an effort to "breed" out the Scots, Edward re-instigates an old practice whereby the English Lord blesses a marriage by taking the newly wed bride into his bed on the wedding night.<br /><br />Not willing to accept this Wallace and his bride (played by the impossibly beautiful Catherine McCormack) wed in secret. Then shortly after Wallace feels compelled to protect her from the lecherous advances of one of the Kings men, an action which leads to his bride being murdered by the  English.<br /><br />The reaction by Wallace is swift and brutal, and the Scots march down into England to wreak revenge on their occupiers.  Some of the violence is very graphic with heads getting lobbed off and severed arms spurting blood, but the graphic depiction of violence is necessary given that battles in that time were usually fought in close proximity and were violent.<br /><br />It's a story that I, as a native Scot, feel close to my heart and one that no doubt  left an impact on the voters of Scotland who finally voted  in the 1990s to partially secede from the United Kingdom to the extent that they now have their own parliament and are in control of most of their domestic policy.<br /><br />Perhaps surprising given his stature as one of Hollywood's leading men, Gibson handles his directorial duties expertly and in fact was recognized by the Academy in 1996 with a Best Director Oscar. He manages to weave together all the elements in what was a gigantic undertaking and gets fantastic performances from all involved.<br /><br />Special features on this DVD include a rather short behind-the-scenes featurette that includes shots of the Irish army dressing up as Scottish soldiers (yes, it was inexplicably filmed in Ireland and Scotland) , casting the movie (Gibson quite understandably was enchanted  by McCormack's beauty) and problems they had in the making of the movie. There is also a rather breezy commentary by Gibson that I liked with only one exception. My favorite dialogue in the movie is the stirring pep talk given to his troops by Wallace before engaging the English, however in the commentary Gibson talks right through it. Still it's great to have the commentary on the disc, which was released at a time when star commentaries were rare.<br /><br />Overall then, the movie is an inspiring tale of courage and love. It's well worth giving it a spin in your DVD player and clocking in at three-hours well worth the price.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>William Wallace is a Scottish rebel who leads an uprising against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks, who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself. When he was a young boy, William Wallace's father and brother, along with many others, lost their lives trying to free Scotland. Once he loses another of his loved ones, William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. A vastly entertaining and powerful movie. Braveheart is a truely epic film, it stands out as one of the top overall movies ever in my mind. The story is top-notch, the direction and acting/cast are equally great as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>William Wallace, a commoner, is a legend, a myth, a hero for sure in Scotland. In his thirteen century he opposed the rule of the king of England over Scotland and the ruthless colonial attitude of that king and his soldiers. Why a commoner and not a noble? Because the nobles accepted to be paid prisoners, salaried slaves of the king of England. As a commoner he only suffered the ruthless violence from these soldiers and the indifference of these nobles. He started a rebellion against the English and that rebellion actually swept the whole Scotland and climaxed in the battle of Stirling. He had managed to bring the nobles behind the commoners and he got a full victory. He was knighted at once but did not change his logic. So in order to force the king of England to grant Scotland full independence he crossed the border and attacked the English at home. He took and ransacked the city of York, and killed the duke of York, the very nephew of the king of England. But in the next confrontation the nobles betray him and he is defeated after the nobles leave the battlefield. The Bruce gets him off that battlefield in due time. But later on the nobles again will betray him again, attract him in a trap and deliver him to the king of England. He will be duly executed as a traitor. The film evokes that treatment though it remains rather far from the real stuff and the fact that he was executed on the day before the Bartholomew Fair on the Fair ground itself as a festive entertainment added to all the others by the king himself. The point is historical and the film is valuable because of that historical dimension. A commoner could easily bring commoners together and make them fight for their freedom, even their national freedom. That is the birth of popular nationalism, of nationalism as such, the only nationalism that represents some historical progress, that of the people, of simple people. That nationalism is going to develop in Europe over the coming centuries, but we can witness its birth in Scotland here. At the same time the film shows very well that nationalism is in absolute contradiction with feudalism. That nationalism is based on self-pride and individual freedom, and the protection and guarantee of that individual freedom. The right of the first night (the local esquire or noble has the right to make love to the newly wed woman, before her newly wed husband on the evening of their marriage) is one of these unbearable privileges of the nobles. Furthermore, the nobles satisfy themselves very well with the financial dependence on the king of England, as long as it does not question their local dominance in Scotland over the local Scots. They have no real national spirit, and the freedom of the people is not their problem. They have sworn allegiance to the King of England and that guarantees their privileged position and they are quite satiated with that. At the same time we must understand a different approach of feudalism that is no longer very active in our minds. The king was the very secular representative of God due to his appointment by God himself, under the only authority of the Pope who is the direct spiritual representative of God on earth. If such is the reality of feudalism, then no one can question the decisions and acts of the king, certainly not the nobles who are under allegiance towards that king. A duke can fight against a count or another duke, because they are of the level but they cannot fight against the king who is over them. But the surprising element is that the battle of Stirling took place on September 11, 1297 some 80 years after the first signing of the Magna Carta and 30 years after the final acceptance of this Magna Carta that shows how the English nobles and the English Church actually joined against the king to impose onto him some freedoms that were unheard of before. I tend to believe William Wallace was the development of this Magna Carta and that it brought the third social element into the picture, the third estate, the commoners. The defeat is all the more significant, and the execution is also all the more significant. It was more a martyrdom than anything else. We know that a poet, Blind Harry, will turn the oral legend into a myth with his epic poem written at the end of the fifteen century. This film is just the adaptation of this myth.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Val de Marne Creteil, CEGID Boulogne Billancourt</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>"Braveheart" was first released in 1995 with an onslaught of positive reviews.  The longevity of the feature, the ability to direct as well as star, as well as the historical topic developed secured Mel Gibson an Oscar win.  His trophies for Best Director as well as Best Feature proved that he was more than just a pretty boy asking top dollar to bring in the audiences - he was excited about the art of filmmaking.  While he did not quite prove it with his film outings afterwards (who can remember the disaster known as "Conspiracy Theory" or "Ransom"), it is in today's growing recycled clich&eacute; Hollywood standard that Mr. Gibson has proven himself.  With two less mainstream success stories under his belt (both "The Passion of the Christ" as well as "Apocalypto"), he has challenged a modern empire and succeeded.  Revisiting Gibson's second directing decision; one must challenge themselves to look beyond the pitfalls, the missing story elements, and the abrupt ending to see the sophomoric feature Gibson gave to us.  "Braveheart" isn't perfection, yet it doesn't strive to be - it merely wants to tell a love story set upon the backdrop of historical choices.  Worthy of its wins in 1995, "Braveheart" proved to be a bit choppy in 2008, but still a great way to spend nearly three hours.<br /><br />Gibson, to create "Braveheart", pulled from every epic imaginable.  His use of battle sequences, heroics, and individuality ring eerily close to that of "Spartacus", "Gladiator", and "Ben-Hur", yet even with these clich&eacute;s riding well within the film, Gibson creates his own style and voice.  Watching this epic, one must take it in four different slices to fully appreciate the work, and while they all may pair differently apart, it is what they do together that creates the magic.  To begin, the direction is nearly flawless.  A scene that stands out is when one of the nobles is dreaming of an attacking Wallace, only to wake and witness Wallace barge in through the door in a beautiful black stallion.  It, like many other scenes, was breathtaking and flawless.  Gibson has an eye for shots that are considered "beautifully gruesome", meaning that colors, placement, and camera angle are visionary, while the action on screen may make your stomach a bit squeamish.  His direction showed a realistic view of the battle and filth surrounding Scotland during this dark time, and it is his work behind the camera that continues to make this film rank amongst the greatest ever.  Remember, Gibson won for Best Director and Best Film - which should be kept in mind as we unwrap the other three layers to this film.<br /><br />The next element that one must slice into is the story, which in my eyes, is the weakest element to this film.  While it is emotional to watch the love story unfold, the eye-candy battle sequences, and the picture-esque view of Scotland, there seemed to be a lacking "meat" to this story.  Wallace was angered by what happened to his one true love, but we never get the chance to see his years of living with Uncle Argyle come into fruition.  He spouts Latin and French randomly, he uses original battle tactics, and there is talk of Rome at one point, but I wouldn't have found it difficult at all to see a young William Wallace take shape under Argyle.  It would have been impressive to see this hero's roots, to take his passion from more than just his father's death into a whole new realm.  Throughout this film, watching it in 2008, there wasn't much substance to Wallace.  He fought with pride, patriotism, and with his heart, but we never were able to define him as a character.  We knew he could fight - but how?  We knew he loved this girl from the village - but we needed a deeper back story!  The fight scenes were brilliant, but they did not help me see the true William Wallace.  We charged through the film making it from points A to B to C, but never gave us the appetizers in between.  More critical today of films than I was in 1995, perhaps a viewpoint from the English side would have strengthened the background.  I don't believe all English were this harsh, where were the other elements that may have helped Wallace's crusade?  These are just missing pieces that would have strengthened "Braveheart" and pushed it to a new level.<br /><br />Needless to say, the next slice is sound.  The power of the battlefield, the yell of Wallace's "FREEDOM" and the bagpipes echoing through James Horner's score engulfs the power of the film.  It is the sound that makes "Braveheart" the epic that it is.  Without the sounds of battle, without the sounds of the majestic mountains, without the sound of love - this could not have won the awards it did.  As a viewer, it is the most exciting part of this film and the flawless.  While one can argue there are directorial decisions that Gibson could have done better, stronger acting choices, and a more structured story - it is the sound that goes without question.  It is perfection.  Horner's work is mesmerizing and fantastic.  He should have won an Oscar for his sole work on this picture.<br /><br />Finally, there is the acting of "Braveheart".  Gibson wasn't nominated for an Oscar, which doesn't surprise me watching it now in 2008.  Gibson, prior to this film, was thought of as the pretty boy/bad boy persona.  Seeing it in the theaters women were swooning over the scantily clad Gibson and that in itself proves that he didn't shake the predetermined image.  There were scenes in which Gibson was smiling, or that his eyes seemed to be bluer than the sky, or that blood seemed to be splattered to an exact location on his body - he seemed to have trouble shaking the beauty of Gibson - and I fault him for that.  The others in the film were decent, but nobody stood out as exemplary.  Coupled with the less meaty story, the characters seemed clich&eacute; ridden.  There was the "best-friend", the "love-interest", the bad King, and the loyal psychopath - all of which can be seen in any other period piece film.  I don't believe the acting was up to par with the rest of the film, and the Academy noticed.  Gibson played a shaggy Scotsman - it was Mel Gibson - albeit he does a great job with the film, one cannot seem to shake the idea that it is Mel Gibson - and that is why he was awarded no win nor nomination.<br /><br />Overall, despite my best efforts to find major flaws with this film, it is still an amazing piece of cinema to watch.  "Braveheart" deserves every award that it has won and others should credit it as the launching pad that finally gave us "Last Temptation of Christ" and "Apocalypto".  Gibson has taken his fame from this film, changed the glamour of it all, and handed us some gritty portraits of the past.  I wish he could have done the same here, but I don't think 1995 was ready for it.  Gibson pushed the envelope with gore and carnage, and it continues to steal your breath away - yet "Braveheart" needed to be more than just that.  He couples it with amazing sound, but troubles it with a struggling story and weak characters.  Today, Gibson could shake our minds that he is not Mel Gibson, but in this year - he was that same female dream model.  This is an amazing film.  It deserves a memorable page in our cinematic history, but it isn't perfect.  I believe Mel saw that, and changed it for his post-"Braveheart" releases.  In a day when our own freedom is put into question, this is the type of film that will stagger your emotions and pull at your heartstrings.  Gibson is a master at his craft, don't get me wrong - this just isn't the sterling image of perfection.  Watch it - over and over.  It may be a long film, but it is worth every minute.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3KROYMQ61M7A.html">A3KROYMQ61M7A</a><br/><p>Well filmed and made (real actors<br /><br />doing real roles) but not 100%<br /><br />historically to point.

The story of William Wallace and the Scottish rebellion against the English.  The film is beautifully shot, and directed well by Gibson.  The acting is outstanding, with charisma aplenty from Gibson, and a good job by the actor portraying the foppish prince.  Along with Spartacus and the yet to be released El Cid, this is one of my favorite epics.  I would love to see an ultra special edition of this film made.  If you have recently watched Troy or Kingdom of Heaven and enjoyed those films, this one is along the same lines, only so much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>This movie stirred moe emotionaly in a way no movie besides Saving Private Ryan did.

The DVD version of this movie - long delayed,  mostly for the commentary track - isn't a bad contribution to the DVD  library.  Die-hard fans will enjoy the director's commentary, although I  felt it was a little lacking, especially in the first hour or so of the  film.  The featurette is nothing special, and either the exact same one, or  one just like it, was run on either HBO or Showtime in 1995, with the  film's release.  The sound transfer is top-notch, the voices are clear, and  the music just right.  The video transfer will leave some fans wanting; the  colors are perfect, but there are dust spots and other minute errors  assiciated with film that are absent from other digitally-mastered DVDs.  Seeing as how there probably isn't much more to ask out of a movie that  mostly speaks for itself, these distractions are minor, and this disc is  definately worth the price for a person who will watch it over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>It has been 12 years since Braveheart won the Academy Award for best picture and a release on DVD allows us to review this film in 2007 to determine its continued merit. Does it measure up?<br /><br />Yes and No.<br /><br />I gave the film 4 stars because on the whole the film remains strong after 12 years. The scenes of the Scotish landscape and weather conditions were highly realistic and beautiful. The architectural structures, whether they were peasant huts or fortress castles, were very impressive and facilitated the plot and mood of the film in a way that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy captures 7 years later after the release of Braveheart. The filth of common life in 1290 is captured well, for even the highest nobility were vermin infested and encrusted with dirt. The acting of Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was superb, the best acting job in the whole film. Catherine McCormack as Murron and Sophie Marceau as French Princess Isabella were both excellent casting choices for while both beautiful, McCormack captures the beauty of a strong healthy peasant while Marceau captures the worldly sophisticated beauty of a woman destined for power.  The cinematography was exceptional. One final strength to the film that is certainly relevant to our time, which is that battle against native insurgency is never predictable. Longshanks was extremely lucky that for the most part the Scottish insurgency was willing to fight him face to face in traditional warfare (at least for that time and place) rather than engage in underground gurilla warfare, which is often the choice of insurgent populations.<br /><br />What are the drawbacks?<br /><br />First, considerable historic license was taken to make the film more dramatic and romantic than history would indicate was the actual sequence of events. Second, the violence was a bit over-the-top with terrible scenes of torture and warfare. Third, Gibson was 20 years older than the young William Wallace who began his campaign when he was between 20 and 24 and died before he was 36. Fourth, the film is actually a bit too long. It is a 3 hour film that could have been shortened to 2 hours with little lost in terms of story or atmosphere. The fifth drawback is that by today's standards, the depiction of King Edward I could be seen as homophobic. History would imply that King Edward I was homosexual, but this film equates homosexuality with physical and emotional weakness.<br /><br />Overall, the film holds up to time and remains entertaining after 12 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>You know, this is a remarkable film not for it's historical accuracy but for its epic proportions. We used to make movies about people we knew little about. Joan d'Arc, Chanson de Roland, Arthur, El Cid. People . . . us . . . enjoyed them. Heck. We make movies about The Christ and that history is always controversial. I mean, do we really think that Christ had Stephen Hunter's blue, blue eyes?<br /><br />They were spectacular and as an art form, they were supposed to be. So Gibson, never one to shy away from putting his money where his mouth is, makes the story of William Wallace who led the Scots in a fight for independence in the 13th century. Borrowing not just a little from Shakespeare's St. Crispin Day speech, Gibson speaks in a loud booming voice to the troops at Stirling, asking them to consider the Shakesperean choice, 'lying on their death beds 60 years from now, would you not exchange all those days for the one chance to say 'you may take our lives but you'll never take our freedom!'<br /><br />Historically accurate? Probably not. Poetic license? Most certainly. Great movie? Absolutely.<br /><br />I teach a class in business leadership at a local college. It's well attended and has become popular on the campus. The first day of class I start out with William Wallace's speech to the troops at Stirling. Get's the blood flowing.<br /><br />5 Stars Mr. Gibson. You rarely miss. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson has reached an acting pinnacle, at least so far, with Braveheart. It is an epic movie that is loosely based on historic events in Scotland. All the performances were great and the cinematography was superb. And what a story, so inspirational.<p>The film covers the life of William Wallace from the time he is a small boy, when his Father dies, to his own death. Set mostly in 13th Century Scotland, the story's backdrop is the Scot's struggle against the unjust rule of the English King, Longshanks. The film gradually grows in scope from a small boy's tragedy, to a National conflict spanning generations.<p>After the death of his Father at the hands of the English, William is raised by his uncle who, being a great believer in education, takes William across the world where he learns Latin, French and the manly arts of war. Eventually, he returns to his homeland, a fully mature man, ready to settle down with his childhood sweetheart and raise a family. The concerns of his countrymen over English rule take second place to his pursuit of the beautiful Murron.<p>Due to the half-hearted opposition of Murron's Father and the English noble's rights to take a bride on her wedding night, Wallace is married in secret. The honeymoon doesn't last long before their joy is shattered by the results of an English soldier's attempted rape of Murron. While Wallace is able to beat back the soldiers from his wife, she is captured as they flee in separate directions. The local Lord then decides to bring Wallace into the open by executing his woman in a particularly brutal scene. She is tied to an upright pole and her throat is cut.<p>So starts William Wallace's life long battle against the English to free the people of Scotland. This common man is able to successfully organize the villagers to overthrow the local fort and slaughter the magistrate responsible for the death of his wife. Then, with the help of an adjacent clan, Wallace goes on to tear down the local Lord's temporary castle, and allow one of the cuckolded husbands to take his revenge.<p>Meanwhile King Longshanks is distracted by his war with France and allows his week son an opportunity to prove himself by bringing Wallace to English justice. The Son's ineptness soon leads to full scale battle. A situation that requires the support of the Scottish Lords, an infighting self interested bunch of old men. On the occasion of the first major battle, Wallace is able to maneuver three Lords into helping while stealing the hearts of their levees. Through the use of some brilliant tactics he successfully defeats the English forces and his legend grows to new heights.<p>I won't describe the film much further as it is long and richly detailed. Wallace's successes continue often hampered by betrayal from the Scottish Lords and the treachery of the English King. He finds love again, loses many good friends and eventually finds peace at the hands of the English interrogators. But despite this, Braveheart has a hopeful tone at its end. It makes you feel proud and strong even if you don't have any Scottish heritage.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Let us stipulate that this movie is romance on the book, "Braveheart" (by Randall Wallace), which is itself a romance on the very real Scotts hero, William Wallace.  In those two steps of fictionalization, loosely based on history, more than a few facts can float off into the ether.  You can easily search the web and find any number of websites that will list all the errors in the movie.  There was even a show in the History Channel discussing the reality of Wallace's life versus the movie and why certain choices were made, such as fighting the battle of Stirling Bridge on a field in the movie rather than on a bridge as it was in real life.  Never mind the fact of the real life ages of the characters making most of the interactions in the movie absolutely impossible.<br /><br />And while all comparisons of fact and fiction are interesting, two facts remain:  the movie made the name of William Wallace more popularly known than he had been in centuries, and it is a very effective and exciting movie.  Believe me, I understand the pain of those who truly love Wallace and feel that their hero has been disgraced and cheated.  It is almost always true that facts suffer greatly when compressed into the constraints of a movie and those that know the facts understand how they add to the meaning and purpose of their hero.  They resent any compromise or cheapening for simple expediency or catering to popular appetites.  This is all fair and true.  However, this movie is a fiction of a fiction of based on real figures.  In a way, it is the opposite of the old "Dragnet" show.  The events are fiction; only the names have been kept.<br /><br />Leaving history aside, the film is exciting, stirs feelings of patriotism, and allows good to triumph over evil even at death.  In the movie, Wallace has to overcome everything, including the loss of family and betrayal by those who should have been his friends.  He has real fears of what he has to face at the end and it is his faith that provides the foundation of his courage.  That kind of nobility inspires us and stirs our own resolve.<br /><br />The battle scenes, while historically inaccurate to a great degree, are amazing to behold.  There is a lot of gore and violence in these medieval battles.  It is that gore and a couple of gratuitous uses of the medieval f-word that give the movie an R rating more than the brief scene at the grove with Wallace and his new wife.<br /><br />While not one of my all time favorite films, it is very much worth viewing and contemplating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>What a fantastic movie!  The scenery in this movie was fabulous.  The battle scenes were very realistic for the time frame, even sometimes to the point of shock.  If you don't like violence you will probably have to leave the room during these scenes.  But they help set the harsh world in which William Wallace lived.  While this movie is not historically correct it is an interesting period piece.  And a wonderful love story.  For those that say a man can not love as deep as a woman, this love story seems to beg to differ.  There is something for both &quot;him and her&quot; in this movie and you can watch with your spouse or friend.  <p>The movie was long but time passed quickly.  The story surrounds you from the very beginning and never lets you out until the very end.  There are all kinds of heros and villans, damsels in distress, warriors, kings and tyrants throughout this movie.  The soundtrack was very good (I bought it on CD) and enhanced the overall effect of the movie.  The story, the excellent acting, the battle scenes, the soundtrack, the plot.  All lead to create a movie that stands head and shoulders above most recent ventures of any type.  <p>Buy it or rent it but absolutely you should see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Throughout the ages, oppression has taken many forms, rearing it's ugly head to deny the liberty and the rights of people everywhere, and the cry of "Freedom" and the inherent longing to be free of tyranny in any of it's many incarnations is universal and older than recorded history.  Man has fought on one battlefield or another and in one arena after another in an effort to rid himself of the shackles that bind him, and he has always paid a dear price for that freedom.  "Braveheart," directed by and starring Mel Gibson, is the story of one man who would not abide the despotic rule of an unworthy sovereign, and took a stand against it.  A 13th Century commoner and a patriot who loved his country, Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) burned with an unquenchable desire to be free of the British, who had murdered his father when William was just a boy.  Raised by kin, Wallace nevertheless grew up wanting only to marry, work his farm and raise a family.  But circumstances dictated otherwise, and without knowing what they had unleashed, the British rekindled that fire that burned within the boy, and Wallace soon left his mark on the Monarchy of King Edward I of England.<p> Wallace was a man of singular determination, and managed to do what no one else had ever been able to do before him:  He united the clans of Scotland.  Before Wallace, the clans stubbornly clung to their autonomy, changed loyalties whenever the mood struck them or the price was right, and endured the domination of the British because of it.  Wallace changed all that, by convincing them that by standing together as one, they could win.  And he proved it.  He amassed an army and made a stand at York, and again on the battlefields of Stirling and Falkirk.  With savage tenacity and courage, he never gave in nor gave up his relentless and heroic quest to make Scotland free.  <p> Gibson brings Wallace to life with a performance worthy of the man he portrays.  To achieve what he did, Wallace had to be larger than life, and that's exactly what Gibson brings to the screen.  But he plays him as a man, not a hero; Gibson's Wallace is very real, and someone you can believe would be able to stand before an army and lead them into battle.  In one memorable scene Wallace, mounted on a spirited horse, addresses his men-- many of whom had just joined him-- as they are about to engage the enemy at Stirling.  Someone from amongst the crowd calls out, "We heard Wallace is seven feet tall!"  To which Wallace replies, "I AM William Wallace!"  And by the time he finishes his powerful speech (which screenwriter Randall Wallace openly confesses was liberally borrowed from Shakespeare's "Henry V"), spurring them on and preparing them for the impending battle, you believe he IS seven feet tall.  It's an inspired performance through which Gibson shows you the man behind the legend, while at the same time he makes you understand just how and why the legend was born.  <p> And, as impressive as Gibson is in front of the camera, what he does behind the camera with this film is even more impressive.  The magnitude of this film is awe inspiring, and that Gibson could carry it as an actor, while directing it as well, is quite a feat, indeed.  He used the bleak weather of Scotland and Ireland to great advantage in scene after scene, creating the perfect atmosphere in which to tell his story; he experimented with different camera speeds, especially when filming Catherine McCormack (Murron), which gave her a more graceful, sensuous look; he staged some of the most compelling battle sequences ever made; and he captured the intricacies of the characters-- all with an eye for detail and the ability to integrate it all into a film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture, while deservedly landing him the Award for Best Director.  It was obviously a labor of love for Gibson, but the hard work paid off handsomely in the end, especially for the audience, for it is they who realize the real fruits of this endeavor-- a truly stirring and memorable motion picture.<p> The supporting cast includes Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), Sophie Marceau (Isabelle), Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce), Brendan Gleeson (Hamish) and Peter Hanly (Prince Edward).  A film of epic proportions, "Braveheart" is emotionally involving and inspiring, with a message about the irrepressible capacity of the human spirit.  Gibson put everything he had into this one, and it shows; this is his "Citizen Kane," a pinnacle of achievement that few actor/directors every attain.  With brilliant cinematography (by John Toll), some of the finest editing you'll ever see (by Steven Rosenblum), terrific performances and Gibson's special touch, this is an unforgettable film that demonstrates what the magic of the movies is really all about.  If you love movies, this is one you simply do not want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Say what you want about Mel, but we all say dumb offensive things from time to time. He just happens to do it more oftne than others. Okay, maybe I'm making excuses for him, but that doesn't change the most important fact that Braveheart is everything its title promises. It's brave, and it has heart. I bought this movie as a blind buy, hoping it would fill the void that Ridley Scott's Robin Hood left in my soul, or heart, or wherever people say that void is. Anyway, I also went in expecting Mel Gibson to completely butcher his accent. I'm happy to say that I was surprised on both front. Mel Gibson was amazing as William Wallace, the famous Scotsman who lead his people to fight in a bloody revolution against the King of England who unfairly took over his land around the early 13th Century. I won't pretend to know a thing about history, beyond the propaganda I was taught in school growing up. So, I went into this with a blank slate.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm quite interested in learning a bit more about Wallace and the events that the film are based on. Mel Gibson also directed Braveheart, for which I believe he won the Oscar for Best Director, along with the film winning Best Picture, Best Cinematography (and rightfully so, because it was gorgeous, especially in high def), Best Sound Editing and Best Makeup. That epic blue battle makeup will forever be burned into my memory whenever I hear Mel's name. I really enjoyed the epicness of the film. Large scale, gruesome battles always help me sleep soundly. The love story that motivated Wallace to go on his freedom "rampage", I'll call it because he basically slaughters hundreds of men for a woman. Reminds me of Wolverine, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />As far as the Blu-ray transfer goes, it's certainly a gorgeous one. The picture quality is amazingly clear, and accurate to its source. Paramount's Sapphire Series rarely delivers anything less, and when it does, they tend to respond to fan outcry (see the Gladiator reissue). Colors and textures are perfectly presented. The audio is top noth as well, very atmospheric. When I say it's atmospheric I mean that the sharp contrasts between epic battles on the hilsides and in villages, and the quiet subtle moments of dialogue is ever apparent when listening to the lostless soundtrack on this disc. Both the picture and audio quality do their parts in adding to the immersive effect this film has. Beneath its rugged masculine hetero manliness, there's a beautiful delicate tale to be heard. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>Braveheart is one of those films that I have watched every year or so since it came out on VHS. I have bought two DVD versions now as well.<br /><br />On the one hand it is such a violent and bloody movie, I would normally have had all I needed with one viewing, but on the other hand, even with the unbelievable heroism on the part of the protagonist, it is a moving tale of Honor, National Pride, and even ethnic pride (even though my family is Welsh and My wife's Irish, I still feel for the courage in the stories of the Celts of all persuasions).<br /><br />I really loved some of the speeches in the film, one of my favorites was a short rebuke to the Scottish Nobles, "You think the people exist to serve the Nobility, but the Nobility exist to serve Scotland" (or something close to that) but the message is true for politicians and leaders and managers in every land. Leadership is the serving and protection of those we lead, not vice-versa.<br /><br />But the main thing is for me is the overall message of the film, without freedom there is no living. I have to be in the right mood, but this remains one of my all time favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>This is a very good movie, however, I'd have prefered it was more well-rounded. I was wondering why they did not delve into the signifigance and source of the blue war-paint and pre-war rituals that would have further defined the culture and belief systems of the clans during that period in history.<br />Instead, I was left feeling battle-weary and glad it was over.<br /><br />Costuming and sets were authentic looking, casting was good and Mel did a passable Scottish accent.  Cinematography was very good too.  Still, it could've been better.<br /><br />**Not for children</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>What a great film!  As far as historical war/battle epics go this has surely got to be among the top 5 films ever.  At almost 3 hours long you'd be forgiven having squeaky bum syndrome but this is no ordinary film and I never even noticed the time as I was enthralled!  The sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sounded great on my system and the picture quality was good overall although it could have been better as tiny black spots remained on too many of the frames.  The special features are rather sparse as well although a decent making-of documentary is included in addition to 2 theatrical trailers.  Interesting indeed to see what the Blu-ray version will look like when it eventually comes out.<br /><br />It's hard not to like a film that allows us to root for the massive underdog as he proves that one man can make a difference and all that is needed is courage and desire that eventually overcomes treachery and wanton evil: "every man dies, not every man really lives."  Gibson is excellent as Wallace and was a deserving winner of the Best Director Oscar.<br /><br />No film library should be without this great film.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 5 Sep 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not allow me to do this separately, I'll have to append this here: the Sapphire Blu-ray release of this great film is certainly worth the upgrade from the standard dvd format that I reviewed above.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved and especially the special feature documentaries making this the definitive version of the film to view.  The only thing that would have made this perfect for me is if it was released as a digibook.  Other than that, this blu-ray release is certainly a step up over the dvd and is worthy of the double-dip.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson's epic film "Braveheart" won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture & Best Director. The film earned those Oscars because it was done so well: the mammoth scope of the events in history, as well as the historical figures (however little may be the material that we know about their lives) demanded a sprawling budget and a running time reminiscent of epic movies like "Ben-Hur," "Sparatacus," "Doctor Zhivago," etc. Like "Spartacus" and, more recently, "Valkyrie," this film has a strong message of standing up for what you believe, even in the face of certain death, but "They'll remember you." Wallace fought and died for what he believed in.On 22 July 1706 the Treaty of Union was agreed between representatives of the Scots Parliament and the Parliament of England and the following year twin Acts of Union were passed by both parliaments to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain with effect from 1 May 1707 (source:[...]). Take heed of the film's R rating, though: The violence is brutal and intense, which is absolutely neccessary for a story like this.

And the murder of his father, by the English plants the seeds of hatred for the English and their tyrannical King Edward De Long Shanks (Patrick McGoohan).<br />His attempt, when he grows up, to live the life of a peaceful farmer, quietly raising crops and a family, is shattered when the English soldiers murder his new bride, the lovely Murron McClannough, she resisted their attempts to rape her. The English have now gained a bitter enemy, who will lead the Scots to a war for freedom, culminating in the expulsion of English forces from Scotland, under Robert the Bruce (Angus McFayden), giving the Scots Freedom in their own land, but this was not before William Wallace, was captured near Glasgow, and taken to the tower of London,  where he was tortured to death.<br /><br />Mel Gibson plays the Scots hero, with panache, and real charisma, mediaeval Scotland and England are recreated magnificently, and the passions leap off the screen.<br /><br />A talented cast of powerful characters brings all the senses to life, and leads one to ponder the lessons of freedom, and of living, and dying for one's nation and people.<br /><br />The minor roles where also beautifully done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>We don't get a lot of great epics these days. Sure Titanic was great after watching the first couple times but when specials ran endlessly and that song(you know what one)was getting on your nerves, pretty soon that story of huge tragedy became a media event. Since then, we just get 2 and a half hour or movies that shouldn't be. Nothing really matches the epics of old, like Spartacus, Ben Hur or Lawrence of Arabia. This film may not match those, but it offers an alternative.<p>The film mainly set in 13th century Scotland, follows the story of William Wallace. As a boy, he had a father who fought for the freedom of Scotland, but soon, his father is killed on an apparent attack. He's taken in by his uncle who proceeds to teach him languages, history, and take him as far as Rome on pilgramages. When he gets back, fully mature, he just wants to settle down with his love, Murron. However, the King invokes the First Night law, a law where if a Scottish couple marry, one of the British officers gets to have the wife for a night. <p>Not wanting to share his love, William marrys in secret. However, an Englishman finds out and kills his wife. There he just sets off attacking forces for the freedom of Scotland.<p>Very powerful in it's message, and very brutal. Make sure kids don't see this, there's a lot of carnage images on the screen(including a briefly seen shot of a metal ball hitting a head. Let's just say his face looks...rather different.) But, if bad teen romances and gag humor films, aren't your thing and want something more extravagant, can't go wrong with Braveheart</p></br><a href="../users/A7PBI5HADJYER.html">A7PBI5HADJYER</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson stars as William Wallace, a Scotsman who leads his people in revolt against the conquering British.  Gibson's second directorial attempt is a towering achievement, with the bloody battle sequences and rousing speeches standing out.  Other outstanding accomplishments: James Horner's score is superb, Mel Gibson gives a powerful performance, and Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau are gorgeous beauties. A stirring epic that works on every level it aspires.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Freedom has always been something man has fought for since the beginning of time.  Freedom from those who would oppress us in every way, from the way we dress, to what we are allowed to believe, even where we are allowed to live, we have always wanted the freedom to choose and to live as we see fit.  In the Revolutionary War, our ancestors that settled here to form the 13 colonies chose to rebel against the oppresive forces of England that had enslaved them all their lives.  Centuries before our ancestors fought for our freedom, Scotland was fighting for theirs from England, and even to this day that fight still continues to some degree.  To bring the story of Scotland's fight for freedom to the big screen, writer Randall Wallace got the attention of Paramount Pictures and Icon Productions who liked the idea, and with Mel Gibson attached to direct and star, everything else just seemed to fall into place for the dark ages epic "Braveheart".<br /><br />"Braveheart" is the story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson), a brave Scotsman who has been lured from his quiet life, when the regional governor kills his wife (Catherine McCormack), to wage war on his country's oppressors.  Using his now famous longsword, fiery rage, and cunning intellect to rally his countrymen to fight for liberation against the King of England (Patrick McGoohan) and his vast army.  Wallace will not rest until Scotland is free or he is dead.<br /><br />This epic film is filled with gigantic battle sequences that accurately depict the brutal, up-close nature of war before there were guns or cannons, when the only way to fight was with swords and bows and arrows.  Expertly directed by Mel Gibson (at this time Mel had only directed one other film "The Man Without a Face", most recently he directed the critically acclaimed "Passion of the Christ"), with brilliant acting by the entire cast including Mel Gibson, who of course had nothing but the best to work with in terms of story, as it was carefully crafted by Randall Wallace (screenwriter of "The Man in the Iron Mask").  "Braveheart" is definitely not a film to be missed by any fan of history or movies.  As a side note, Randall Wallace just so happens to be a descendant of William Wallace, which is why he was so interested in bringing this story to the big screen.<br /><br />If this review hasn't convinced you to see "Braveheart", then you should also know that the year it was released, 1995, it received 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, though sometimes that doesn't mean a film is necessarily enjoyable to watch, I guarantee with "Braveheart", the awards and accolades it received were well founded.<br /><br />"Braveheart" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I recently saw this movie on DVD and, it took a second look to truly appreciate the wonder and scope of this awesome film. If you have seen it already like most of us and you don't own it yet, buy the DVD and see it again in WIDESCREEN! Even if you dislike black bars, a film with excellent cinematography such as this must be watched in widescreen (besides, fullscreen cuts off %50 of the movie, believe it or not. Bleh!!) If you have not seen it, get it now! It is a celebration of the human spirit, and a classic film. As William Wallace said, "It's not how you die that's important, but how you live!" So true, and you have not lived until you have seen and fully appreciated Mel Gibson's best film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>This movie works on so many levels it's difficult to know where to start.  The battle scenes get a lot of attention even though they are a relatively  small part of the film.  Yet, they are incredibly powerful.  Graphic yes,  but not excessively so.  Gibson the director shows us uncompromisingly how  ugly and horrifying war is so that we understand the sacrifices and risks  the heroes undertake.  At the same time, we see the heroism that war brings  out in good men and the glory they can achieve.  This may be the only film  I've ever seen that balances the two so perfectly.  Films like Platoon tell  you war is ugly and bad, while many older war movies show war in an almost  reverant light.<p>At its heart, though, this is a movie about a man, not a  war.  William Wallace and others come across as complex, interesting people  that we care about.  Wallace's pursuit of a quiet life as a farmer who  wants to marry his childhood love is no less interesting than his attempt  to free Scotland.  Even the villains are compelling (if unlikable)  characters.  The king of England, Edward &quot;of the long shanks,&quot; is  particularly despicable yet the viewer can still relate to his struggle to  make his son something more than a useless fop.  This type of depth ensures  that the people in this movie seem exceptionally real and vivid.<p>Despite  its length this movie doesn't feel long in any way.  It engages you almost  instantly and unfolds beautifully at a pace that varies but never drags.  The acting, script, direction, cinematography, and soundtrack all combine  seamlessly to provide a true masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>Forget the fact that William Wallace was NOT a major character in real Celtic history. He was actually a conglomeration of heroes from lore. And being such, he never really boinked the princess from England. Who the hell cares. Like Rob Roy (see the Liam Neeson movie of the same name. You'll love it) it's the MOVIE that counts. THAT's what I'm reviewing. You want true to life battle scenes. You got `em. The best you'll ever see. Not for the faint of heart. There is so much truth in the struggle of Scotland vs England. If you have ever traced your family tree back to the English Isles, you will feel the indignity forced upon Mel Gibson's Scots. If any of you have read my reviews you know I am big on cinematography and soundtrack making a movie. It does that and more. The color (everything is GREEN) is so dramatic. The backround music haunts you. The battle close-ups put you in the middle of the horribly real bloodshed. The score leads you emotionally. But the champion of all this is Mel Gibson's performance. If I didn't know he was Mad Max, I'd swear he was William Wallace incarnate. The plot takes you seemlessly from Mel as a small child whose father is killed in revolt against his land bairn, to a mature adult infuriated with the injustice of regal land owners. Tops on my list is the realistic portrayal of medieval power plays, and the way William Wallace is so naively trapped within. This is not just a Hollywood hack and slash. This is an emotional film, encompassing politics and violence in search of  freedom. Anyone who cannot feel the pain of William Wallace in this film, is emotionally dead. This movie is about impact. This is not just a guy flick. Girls watching this movie with you, will end up crying on your shoulder. And I dare you to watch this film without feeling what the director (Mel again) meant you to feel. Trust me. I am never wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>BRAVEHEART is like a gigantic, beautifully ornamented chocolate eclair, beautiful and delicious looking, but once you bite in to it, you realize how little there really is inside.<br /><br />In a recent poll of critics, BRAVEHEART was listed as one of Oscar's "embarrassments"---a film that should not have won the Best Picture Oscar.  I tend to agree, although I do not dismiss the fact that Mel Gibson has mounted a sumptuous, rousing, extremely visceral adventure about a man and his quest for freedom.  The battle scenes are some of the best of this nature ever put on film.  Gibson does overuse slomo; he does paint William Wallace as a Christ-like martyr, and as he would do years later in his controversial "Passion," Gibson subjects his hero to an extended torture scene, with his fellow soldiers hiding out ala the apostles while Wallace is tortured.  Accused of making Passion his ego piece, I would venture to say that BRAVEHEART is a far bigger ego trip than Passion.  Gibson stars, directs and commandeers the movie in his image and likeness.  Mel is a smart and shrewed showman; his performance is average.  Some of the supporting actors are outstanding:  Angus McFadyen as the self-centered, self-tortured Robert of Bruce, who both befriends and betrays Wallace; Patrick McGoohan as the evil King Edward deLongshanks, a man whose own cruelty is matched by his lack of mercy and compassion; Catherine McCormack as Mel's doomed wife, whose quiet peasant beauty belies an earthly intelligence; Sophie Marceau as Prince Edward's wife, whose longing for love is captured in the glance of her gorgeous eyes; Brendan Gleeson, always dependable, this time as Gibson's big, boisterous sidekick, and Ian Bannen as the leprosy-ridden father of Robert, whose display of unimpassioned coldness both alienates and commands his son.<br /><br />Yes, an eclair; maybe shouldn't be a Best Picture Oscar winner, but one can't deny Gibson has mounted a rousing, if vacuous, entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>"They can take our lives but they cannot take away our freedom". Something about this war cry suggests an anachronistic anomaly, but fortunately the rest of the film is so powerfully executed with such a satisfactory abundance of high-octane battle scenes that it makes up for every little guff.<br /><br />Why let minor trivia like historical accuracy detract you from a fabulous Hollywood action flick? If films were produced merely for accuracy, all of our films would look like The Passion. Braveheart, ironically, is a lot more passionate.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>This is by far one of the best medevil dramas I have ever seen.

Short on facts but long on legend, BRAVEHEART is an epic in the grand style of David Lean, possibly the best character biodrama since LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.<br /><br />This Academy-Award winning film, Gibson's directorial debut, is lavish, colorful, and long. Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is mythic, but threaded with a fine appreciation of the human frailties of Wallace, who led his countrymen in a protracted War of Independence against English rule in the early 1300s.<br /><br />Gibson's Wallace is balanced, a leader amongst men who accepts his role and the attendant lionizing that accompanies it, with bemusement and wit. The character of Wallace is nearly the perfect man, being forceful, ruthless, civilized, passionate, crafty, educated, and sensitive as the occasion demands. His slow downfall in the second half of the film (and his horrible death) are envisioned not as failures in the man but as born of a need to believe, even in the face of the treachery and self-interest of others.<br /><br />The Scottish nobles are drawn as amoral and torn between alliance with England and a fractious independence (as they historically were). Although they fail Wallace miserably, he is so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he returns time and again to them to bolster his military and political clout. The vicious betrayal of Robert The Bruce (and his ultimate redemption) is a plot within a plot, and is played beautifully by Angus McFadyen.<br /><br />Gibson's vision of the battle scenes, drawn as they are with hundreds of extras, screaming horses, and gore enough for a teenage "slaughter" movie, are singularly exciting and propel the film forward at a literal gallop. The bloody-handed Wallace is a vision in violence and determination, and ultimate passion.<br /><br />Fine performances are supplied by Patrick MacGoohan as King Edward "Longshanks" Plantagenet, Sophie Marceau as the Princess of Wales/French King's daughter, and by Catherine McCormack, who plays Wallace's wife Murron. Murron, and her memory, animate Wallace, and therefore, animate the film. McCormack is angelic and sensual by turns as need demands and carries this brief but crucial role with grace.<br /><br />BRAVEHEART is creatively fictionalized history and fine inspiration. It is a story in which, as Wallace says: "Every man dies...not every man really lives."</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>That's one way of looking at &quot;Braveheart&quot;, with Mel Gibson playing the Scottish national hero, William Wallace. Like Spartacus, Wallace was also a real-life person. Like Spartacus, he strove against a mighty oppressor nation that was destroying the liberty of others. And like Spartacus, Wallace died for his cause in a brutal fashion.<p>I saw &quot;Braveheart&quot; after I returned from a moving trip to Scotland, where I learned of the brave hero from countrymen who still love and revere him, centuries after his struggles for their liberty. I heard in advance from them where there are inaccuracies in the story (the Battle of Stirling was fought on a bridge, for instance, not a plain), but still and all, I found it a moving depiction of man's fight against injustice. Mel Gibson turned in a great performance of Wallace, and Patrick McGoohan as the evil King Edward of England was wickedly good as well.<p>If you're found of Kirk Douglas as Spartacus, then you'll be very happy with Mel Gibson's epic, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>The movie is an Academy Award winner for Best Picture, so you know the movie is quality and an epic vision of feudal England and Scotland.  Therefore I will not review the plot and story.  The quality of the DVD is good, but I don't see a significant improvement over other DVD's of the film.  There is some additional footage you don't get in the TV versions, more graphic killings, a bit more blood, and some extra love scene kind of stuff.  Other than being able to watch it whenever I want, I don't know that I gained that much in buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>Good movies like these are hard to find nowadays.

I have yet to think up of a flaw that this movie has created. Nothing important.<br /><br />The gore in this movie was great! It might seem nasty to some but it makes the movie more graphical and realistic, also shows that the directors really try to bring out the real picture when it comes to love and war.<br /><br />I'm sleepy but other than that, this movie was very good, a rare movie definately worth the 5 stars if not more.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>Slow getting going but once running, it goes like a freight train. The DVD  could have been better. The 28 min documentary is very good. How Gibson  directed and played the star is beyond me? The documentary and the  commentary really shows how hard this ran him into the ground. The  commentary wasn't too verbose, Gibson allows you to enjoy the scenes with  some extra interesting comments that don't distract from the story. In his  commentary he mentions scenes that he had a hard time cutting because they  were very good, but had to cut for time. It would have been nice to have  these included. Overall a must to have in the collection, but if a special  edition is in the planning, it may be better to wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A32DTCFBBB9WIV.html">A32DTCFBBB9WIV</a><br/><p>Although not being historically accurate, this picture is very entertaining, gripping.

Following in the footsteps of Leonard Nimoy (&quot;Star Trek III: The Search For Spock&quot;, &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,&quot; &quot;Three Men And A Baby&quot;), Clint Eastwood (&quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Space Cowboys&quot;), and Kevin Costner (the hit &quot;Dances With Wolves,&quot; and the clunker &quot;The Postman&quot;), Gibson is another actor who can direct a film that wins several Oscars (This film won 5, including Best Picture- 1995). This film deserved them all! Great acting, dramatic music from Oscar winner James Horner, and some of the most accurate, if not the most extremely graphic, battle scenes ever committed to the big screen. Gibson's first time playing a hero, instead on an anti-hero, like in the &quot;Mad Max,&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies, makes it his second best performance (&quot;The Patriot&quot; being the best). This film will be remebered as making war films popular again (this movie grossed $77 Million). Bravo, Mel!

Moreover, William Wallace was a real-life Scottish folk-hero. On the other hand, the events shown here have little relation to actual historical events and the graphic bloodiness is almost overwhelming. The end is a visual tribute to man's creativity in finding ways to inflict ghastly physical pain on his fellow man. I watched this once, found it quite interesting, and have no desire to repeat the experience. As a cinematic effort, though, it is beautifully done.

The movie however has serious historical inaccuracies as to the obscure William Wallace and the Scottish revolt of the 14th century.<br /><br /> The notion that William Wallace was a cultivated man fluent in the classics and Latin is fantasy. By all accounts, William Wallace was a crude patriotic zealot who was discarded by Robert the Bruce and other leading Scottish nobles for his banditry and lack of diplomacy. The most absurd parts of the film are the jingoistic expressions of &quot;Freeeeeedom!!!!&quot; gratuitously interspersed in various scenes to make him seem more like an American freedom fighter. Patrick McGoohan played an excellent role as Edward I although he's portrayed as an unusually cruel ruler which, compared other contemporary monarchs in Medieval Europe, he was not. Another distortion is the portrayal of Princess Isabelle as the poor innocent maiden who is saddened at not receiving the affections of her dandy Prince Edward. It's unfortunate that the film doesn't show how the &quot;innocent&quot; Isabelle had her sexually ungratifying and politically incompetent husband brutally impaled with a white-hot chimney poker shortly after he took the throne as Edward II. Another error is the inquisition-like execution of William Wallace; all historical sources recite William Wallace having been drawn and quartered: his body parts were distributed across the kingdom as an example and his head was kept fixed on a pike in London.<br /><br /> The battle scenes were quite grand but also inaccurate. A common misconception of Scots is that they all wore kilts at every possible occasion which is completely false. The kilt as a military garb was introduced much later in the 18th and 19th centuries by the English with the formation of the Highlander regiments.<br /><br /> If you can ignore the overwhelming anthropological and historical inaccuracies in the film, it is quite pleasant to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Christ knows how Mel Gibson was able to get away with playing William Wallace, much less garner an Oscar for this movie.  Gibson couldn't even hold Wallace's sword.  This has to be one of the most ridiculous attempts to take on Scottish history in Hollywood.  It made Rob Roy look good by comparison.  <p>The battle scenes look like rugby scrums, with kelt raising reducing them to parodies of the actual battles that took place. If this had been a Monty Python sketch, I would have laughed heartily throughout, but it seems Gibson was dead serious in this bloated revisionist account of Wallace's ascendency to Braveheart.  <p>I can understand how a movie like this would have fooled the general market, but is the Academy really that undiscerning? Do they have to give an Oscar to anyone who tries to make an historical epic?  It is a real mystery to me how Mel could have hoodwinked both the general public and the Academy on this one, but then it seems Scottish history is little more than fodder for Hollywood's less than fertile imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>After watching Braveheart on DVD,I decided that I was a huge fan of Mel Gibson.The DVD is so incredible that It got my attention when i was watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>William Wallace (Mel Gibson in a Strong Role, also the film`s director) is a Scottish Rebel, who returns home to fall in love with an young beautiful woman (Catherine McCormack) but when she was Killed by the English Officers.

In perhaps his most famous role, Dennis Quaid plays a rogue knight who, with the help of a very noble dragon, (Sean Connery, seen-but-never-heard as the voice of the winged reptillian), fights to overthrow a wicked king, (David Thewlis, who bears an uncanny resemblance to The Monkees' Peter Tork).  An absolute must for action fans, Braveheart is both a history lesson and a carnypark thrill-ride that will captivate all.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 1995 film, starring Mel Gibson, who also directed it, is the legendary myth of  William Wallace, a Scot commoner who united the 13th century Scots against the English.  Technically, it works well, especially the battle scenes which are frequent, bloody and violent.  They also are not confusing.  The audience always knows who the bad guy is, and what the battle strategy is. However, even though I knew this was a myth, and not based on historical fact, I found the story hard to believe.  Would an English Princess really travel to the battlefield to make love to the King's enemy?<p>Mel Gibson is a good actor, but he seemed too old for the part, especially when he weds his childhood sweetheart in the early part of the film.  The casting for the supporting roles was better:  Patrick McGoohan as the wicked king of England, Brendan Gleason as Mel Gibson's best friend, Catherine McCormack as his first love, Sophie Marceu as the princess.<p>No matter how sad the story or gruesome the violence, I didn't feel any emotional pull.  That was because it never seemed real.  It was also much too long at three hours.  I recommend this video only for those who are interested in 13th Century warfare and unremitting violence.  For Mel Gibson fans, however, check out &quot;The Patriot&quot;;  its a much better film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson as a medieval Scottish Rambo. I spent the first hour waiting for something to happen, and when it finally did I found it difficult to care. The second hour had me laughing where it was supposed to, and I learned that the great thing about kilts is you can moon the British army. Hundreds of bare white backsides, or frontsides if you prefer. The third hour was a bit long. This was a loaner, and I fast-forwarded through all the action scenes, so it wasn't so bad. Since so many of my students write about it, I guess I had to watch it. I solved some crossword puzzles at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>This is by far the greatest movie ever made, unquestionably.  If you dont like this movie, then im sorry you are just a moron, who wouldnt know entertainment if it bite them on the a$$.  The story can't be beat, its deep, dramatic, emotional, and inspiring.  The action is intense, realistic, and brutal, which matches the story perfectly.  The performances are some of the greatest in cinema history, i cannot believe Mel didnt get the best actor oscar, they need to give him one for this movie.  He did get one for directing though which i couldnt agree with more, he is one of the best directors out there.  This is definetly a 10 out of a 10, how could anyone think otherwise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson really nailed it with this big screen telling of the William Wallace legend. There are some liberties taken with historical facts, but overall the film presents all the heart, drama, and scale you'd want from a historical epic, and does it well with a three-hour running time that never feels padded or boring. The film also set a modern standard for melee brawls of combatants rushing head-on into each other, with lots of brutality, gore, and tight editing. It's the measuring stick by which all later films went up against, and the fight sequence everyone since has worked hard to outdo (see Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy).<br /><br />The dvd gives us the full three hours of the film without interruption like those old pesky VHS tapes. Picture and audio quality are good (considering the disc was released years ago), and we get two major supplements. A behind-the-scenes documentary provides some good tidbits and on-set footage, and the Mel Gibson commentary track is a laid back-yet-informative affair. There's not much in terms of quantity, but what we get covers the bases surprisingly well.<br /><br />A great movie for any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Definitely a great epic movie, Braveheart, brings to the screen the story of the Scot hero William Wallace, as he seeks revenge against the English for the killing of his wife and family, and the freedom of his country.<br /><br />Braveheart combines drama, action, adventure, even humor, making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical films after a long dormant period.<br /><br />Needless to say, Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Catherine McCormack, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!<br /><br />The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Love, Honor, Battles, and swordfights are all about.<br /><br />In short, it is a movie worth watching!</p></br></body></html>

It's too bad we should always judge Mamet by the standard of "Glengarry Glen Ross" or "House of Games," in which he really turns the klieg lights on the ugly underbelly of humanity. But since he's Mamet, it's unavoidable. He certainly makes some unlovely observations on the current state of political affairs in his tale of a coldly efficient, tough-as-nails Marine commando (Val Kilmer) sent on a mission to rescue the President's daughter from kidnappers. Mamet's script takes plenty of wild--but, in context, plausible--twists and turns, generating plenty of suspense, and the cast is impeccable. This is Kilmer's best performance since his "Tombstone" and "Doors" heyday, and it's great to see him again in a role worthy of his talents. But as good as this film is, its cynicism about the White House and the upper political echelon seems like business as usual after "The Pelican Brief" and "Clear and Present Danger." This is a very good movie, but with Mamet we've come to expect something great. It lacks his unique voice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>"Spartan" is for smart people. Lame-o's will get lost within three minutes. I made it till the end. The daughter of a powerful political figure is kidnapped and thrown into a global sex ring. Of course it's up to Scott (Val Kilmer) and his special agents to track down the fools who dared to take that girl. Scott likes to ask bad guys questions with a repeated stiffness and then roughs them up. You'll have to see it, he's great. Other stars include Derek Luke, William H. Macy, and Ed O'Neill. And there are lots of conspiracy twists in the movie, so pay attention. You'll be glad that you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>&quot;Spartan&quot; is the eighth film written and directed by playwright David Mamet. It stars Val Kilmer as a elite secret agent with paramilitary training who does dirty work for various U.S. Government agencies. He goes by the name of Mr. Scott, but we're led to believe that's not his real name. When the President's daughter disappears from her college campus, apparently kidnapped, Mr. Scott is assigned to assist the Secret Service in finding her. They have only two days to find and retrieve Laura Newton (Kristen Bell) before the news media get ahold of the story. Scott tracks her down. A rescue mission is planned. But things aren't as they appear.<p>&quot;Spartan&quot; is not an adrenaline-pumping thriller. It's more of a puzzle. It's filmed in a shadowy, brooding style. A surprising number of scenes take place at night. &quot;Spartan&quot; presents an extremely cynical view of politics and power, which might be interesting if the story made any sense. Not only does the story not make sense, the dialogue doesn't either. It's conspicuously unnatural and consistently nonsensical. I think Val Kilmer's timing is poor in a few places, but it's hard to tell, because the lines are cringe-inducing anyway. Derek Luke and Tia Texada give the most memorable performances as young rookie agents Curtis and Black. I'm giving &quot;Spartan&quot; three stars for the cinematography by Juan Ruiz Anchia. I like the way this film looks. But the writing is just plain bad.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary by Val Kilmer and a theatrical trailer. Don't watch the trailer before the movie. It's full of spoilers. The audio commentary is interesting in spots but a little frustrating because it meanders and contains a lot of long pauses. Kilmer also frequently doesn't comment on the scene that he's looking at. It's very stream-of-consciousness. It gives more insight into Val Kilmer than into the film, so I would recommend it for his fans only.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>The one thing you must understand is David Mamet is a master wordsmith.  His plays and films are about the words said.  The difficult thing is he also likes to repeat key phrases and overlay conversations - that is have two precisely timed conversations going on at the same time.  Therefore, pay close attention to what is being said.<br /><br />The president's daughter has been abducted and special ops agent Scott has been assigned to find her before anyone finds out.  He first finds her boyfriend.  The boyfriend tells him that they broke up and she is seeing a professor.  Additionally he finds out that she went to a club where college girls can make a few bucks entertaining businessmen.  This leads to a brothel and a madam who leads them to a white slavery ring.  They discover that the ring is run by an imprisoned Lebanese man.  They run an elaborate sting to find where she is being shipped from.  This runs afoul and they are going to rescue her from slavers camp.  But they receive news that her body was found drowned off the coast with the professor.<br /><br />Curtis, Scott's second, tells him that he does not believe she drowned.  The beach house where she was kept had her short sign,%-), in the window and that when he was cleaning his car he found a fragment of an earring.  She was wearing that earring in a recent photo.  They go back to the beach house and a sniper awaits them.  This means something is very a miss.  Scott finally figures out that if the truth came out, that it could cause the president great embarrassment and so the president decided to cut his losses.  Scott will not let his assignment fail and devises a rescue.<br /><br />Val Kilmer's career has been up and down mostly due to bizarre choices of roles.  This is one of his finest roles.  He is not a Mamet actor but definitely handles Mamet's tricky dialogue with great ease.  Look out for Veronica Mars star Kristen Bell as the president's daughter.<br /><br />As stated above, Mamet is very word oriented.  Sometimes his films get to be very talky and you can easily get lost. Plus this is an action film; words and action don't generally work together.  But this is not the case.  He also directed the film, so I think that he had control of all aspects and when the scenes that involve Mamet talk are on, they are scintillating.  And action sequences are tense.  This is a well made film.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: None</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Val Kilmer (The Salton Sea, The Doors) plays a man on a mission, or as the title puts it well, Spartan. The Presidents daughter is supposedly missing, either she was sold into slavery or she did it herself. Kilmer and crew set out in search and things dont seem what they appear to be. Some of this movie doesnt make as bit of sense as others but it adds up to a good performance by Kilmer as always. Along for the ride is Derek Luke (Biker Boyz, Antwone Fisher), Ed O'Neill (Tv's Married With Children, The Bone Collector), Aaron Stanford (Tadpole, X2: X-Men United), Tia Texada (Bait, Tv's Third Watch) and William H. Macy (The Cooler, Pleasantville). Both Macy and O'Neill are in small and wasted roles and it looks like they had fun shooting up Luke a lot. The end with the airport seems forced, dont you think? Directed by David Mamet (Heist)</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Mamet, master of dialogue, manages a good action flick, filled with cameos. But a bad guy's laughable exposition with news crew nearby spoils a lean, tough thriller. I wish movies would hire bad guys we don't know, so we wouldn't keep looking for the well-known talented individual to pop up,invariably they do,up to no good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>This was my first Mamet film, so I was expecting a big deal.  Well.  I did enjoy &quot;Spartan,&quot; despite gaping holes in the plot.  The film has a great look to it, and Kilmer is good as the tough &quot;mission first&quot; agent Scott.  The dialogue is tough, but in a way that has you thinking here's a (good) poet writing noir.  For example, the repetitions regarding the need to &quot;find the girl&quot; was poet-cool, and dropped at just about the moment it would of started to get annoying.  The fact she's the President's daughter is left unsaid, at least until the midway point, but you are able to make this connection with that fact unsaid. (And the unseen &quot;President&quot; in &quot;Spartan&quot; seems to be a combo of Clinton &amp; Bush: a warmongering whoremonger.) But it's also at about the midway point that Kilmer has a conversation with a female agent that had been assigned to protect the President's daughter over the years.  It has to be one of the most unintentionally funny scenes I've seen in a good movie in quite a while, and had me picking up on other &quot;moments&quot; as the movie went on.  (But not enough to wreck the film, by any means.)  On the bad side, super character actor William Macy is nearly wasted, a virtual non-entity for most of the movie. No doubt this role was as Mamet envisioned it, a character flying beneath radar, for that twist at the end.  But if that's the case, a more anonymous actor would of been a better choice. On the good side, Ed O'Neil, as the ruthless Burch, further cements his own credentials as one of Hollywood's best character actors. And watch and listen carefully, or you will miss the why of the title.  Not an exact fit, but it worked for me, in a wonderfully (and classically) understated way, and fit Kilmer's character as we'd grown to know him.  Definitely worth a watch. Just don't peek too closely under the hood of this nifty looking car.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>I like David Mamet a lot, but this one was a disappointment for me. There seemed to be two movies, the first in the U.S. to find a kidnapped girl. This is treated with intensity and action. Then, whoops, the twist and we're off to Dubai to fight kidnapping for prostitution and ruthlessness in high places, and we're again treated to intensity and action. The main guy is played by Val Kilmer as one of these humorless Hollywood heroes for whom there is no obstacle which can't be overcome and whose backstory, as they say, has hidden depths of tragedy and alienation. Mamet insures that we see the guy's back without his shirt on and it's not a pretty sight. We learn nefarious things are going on with the big man's staff (the big man is, I assume, the President and the girl's father; she's been kidnapped) and then all of a sudden William Macy takes center stage for the last ten minutes with almost no preparation. //Spoiler alert// Our hero, of course, is a loner -- which is a sure tip-off that anyone he sort of becomes close to is going to get killed. They do. Surprisingly for a Mamet film, there's not a single actor, in my opinion, who brought much interest to a part. However, one thing I liked about the movie and other Mamet films is that he doesn't explain the obvious, so you have to stay alert.<br /><br />But having said all this, some film critics I like have written good reviews of the movie.<br /><br />If you're interested in Mamet , take a look at The Spanish Prisoner and Heist.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>Many don't seem to have any real argument against this movie other than that it is &quot;bad&quot;. Well, thanks for those helpful reviews about how the movie is &quot;bad&quot; over and over, but that doesn't help people. <p>It isn't bad. Matter of fact, it is pretty good. The first few minutes are corny, but the rest of the movie is great. Basically Val Kilmer tracks this 19-year-old girl down. He shoots alot of people and the action is great. I mean, it's not like he has a futuristic blaster and blasts people in the shoulder. I love movies with guns that look real and I love seeing cool gun fights. This movie has quite a few gun fights and they are good. They are imaginable also. The guns are awesome.<p>The movie's plot is okay, but again, the gun fights and guns make it worth watching. Also, the plot has quite a few twists, including alot of things that you wouldn't exactly be prepared for.<p>This movie isn't &quot;bad&quot;. It's good, and after watching it I was pretty impressed.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2 After "First Daughter," "Chasing Liberty" and now "Spartan," it would appear that there is no task in life more challenging than being the daughter of the President of the United States.  All those secret service agents and all that media attention - what's a good, clean-cut, All-American girl to do?  Those first two movies were ostensibly comedies, but "Spartan" is a crime drama in which the President's daughter is abducted by kidnappers and sold into white slavery!  Hey, come to think of it, maybe this movie is a comedy too. Val Kilmer is the rogue secret agent who winds up going to Dubai in search of the young woman after everyone else - the First Family included! - has given her up for dead and seemingly moved onto more important things in their lives.<br /><br />As this is a David Mamet film, it takes us awhile to adjust to the movie`s pacing and style.  The plotting is complex and frequently convoluted, and, as always, the characters speak in mannered, high-falutin' riddles that often serve to diminish rather than to enhance meaning and clarity.  Still, it is this deliberate ambiguity, this heightened artificiality in the writing and acting that generally provide the major distinction and pleasure of any Mamet film.  Unfortunately, "Spartan," despite all the cleverness of its dialogue, simply can't overcome the inherent silliness of its basic premise.  The film would have us believe that the President of the United States would agree to have his daughter rubbed out by his political advisors because her rather footloose and unchaste lifestyle is becoming a drag on his reelection prospects!  Once we realize that this is where the story is headed, our patience pretty much runs out, and all we are left with is an arch, pretentious film that we find increasingly difficult to take seriously.<br /><br />Val Kilmer has no trouble getting into the Mamet spirit, modeling his highly stylized performance on film noir tough guys like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson.  I guess that "Spartan" is itself intended as some sort of homage to the film noir genre, but there have been far better ones than this in recent years.  It's true that when Mamet fails, he does so at a level much higher than most of his filmmaking contemporaries, and "Spartan" is certainly not without its assorted virtues and pleasures.  It's perhaps worth seeing if you're a viewer in search of a different kind of crime drama (and aren't we all, come to think of it?), and it might be better if you go into this thinking of it as almost a parody of the genre than a straight crime drama on its own.  Either way, however, be forewarned that this is not one of Mamet's better filmic efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>SPARTAN opens with a puzzling scene in which we are obviously viewing some kind of military training endeavor.  Just who or what is vague and only after the movie is into its crux do we understand a little what's going on.  The complex David Mamet penned plot finds Val Kilmer as a determined secret service man who is challenged to find out who has abducted the daughter of the US President.  He is paired with one of his trainees, an eager Derek Luke, who comes in and out of the movie, and once out completely, never mentioned again.  William H. Macy and Ed O'Neill are around to play high level aides to the President.  The plot is complex, and at times confusing, but the style of the movie is interesting and Kilmer offers a solid enigmatic performance.  Kristen Bell who plays the daughter is very good in her brief scenes, but the movie ends on a downer, but how else could it end?<br /><br />Not an easy movie to watch, but not as bad as some other reviewers made it out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I wish I had known that &quot;Spartan&quot; was written and directed by David Mamet before I started watching it because then I would have warmed up to the movie a lot more quickly.  Doing so was a problem for me because this film pushed a couple of my buttons.  First, it involves the kidnapping of the president's daughter.  My complain is not that this has been happening a lot (e.g., &quot;The West Wing&quot;), but that doing these stories at a time when the sitting president has daughters and there are ample reasons for terrorists to make them targets might be tempting fate too much.  Second, it also touches on the idea of Secret Service incompetence and culpability in political shenanigans.  I get the feeling that the Secret Service in most Hollywood movies has replaced what would have been psychotic Vietnam vets a generation ago (and sadistic Nazis the generation before that).  I just tend to find such portrayals rather insulting to those people whose job is to throw themselves in front of bullets.<p>But even given the hole that &quot;Spartan&quot; started out with in my eyes this is quite a compelling film.  With Mamet things are never simple and the chief attraction here is how the film's hero, an agent named Scott (Val Kilmer), tries to catch up with the events that are unraveling at warp speed involving the president's daughter (Kristen Bell), and unraveling is most decidedly the operative word in this story.  I probably should have started counting the conventions of this genre that Mamet is playing with in &quot;Spartan,&quot; especially with regards to the supporting roles of Curtis (Derek Luke), Jackie Black (Tia Texada), and Stoddard (William H. Macy), who come and go in the most interesting ways.  Scott is an interesting character because he is almost a sanctioned loose cannon, who will put on his thinking cap and do whatever it takes to get the job done (even if it means doing whatever it takes to get the job done).<p>Of course as much fun as a David Mamet plot is there is also the distinctive dialogue that he gives his characters to speak.  If you are hoping for lots of exposition to explain what is going on, then you are in the wrong movie.  Add to that the fact that just because somebody says something does not mean they mean it.  There is a lot of guesswork involved here, not just for the characters but also the audience, because of what we see and here.  But that is the road we expect to travel when Mamet is out guide and in that regard &quot;Spartan&quot; does not disappoint.  It might prove too cerebral for most aficionados of the action genre, but then there are plenty of such brain dead films out there that we should be allowed to enjoy this one in peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Spartan was a big disappointment, though I should have known something was wrong when none of the copies at the video club had been rented out (...and here I was thinking myself lucky!).<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a lousy job of portraying a secret service agent on a mission to rescue the president's daughter from slavers.<br /><br />The potential for a good movie was definitely there, but the surprisingly poor acting/casting and the full of holes plot prevented it from becoming anything more than a flop.  As other reviewers have pointed out, what were the director and producer thinking?  But more importantly, what was Val Kilmer thinking?  Was he so desperate for a role that he didn't object to this travesty?<br /><br />Do not expect anything like Top Gun, Willow, or the Saint here.<br /><br />As for the connection with glorious Sparta (title) it is rather an unfortunate parallel bordering on ludicrous.<br /><br />Overall, both Val Kilmer as well as the rest of the "cast" do a rather poor job of trying to cover up for the mediocre plot; wait `til Spartan is shown on TV.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>To say that David Mamet is an utter thumping no-talent is to gravely insult no-talents.  This movie is so bad it would be inappropriate for me to explain what is bad about it.  This would be analogous to calling the cops to a scene of mass slaughter and having them arrive and say, &quot;Sooo... what seems to be the trouble here?&quot;<br />&quot;Well, these people... they're all dead.&quot;<br />&quot;Aaaand that's... bad?&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>I like David Mamet's screenwriting a lot, and his direction is good too. While this movie isn't his absolutely top-drawer material (_House of Games_, _Spanish Prisoner_), it's still way better than the usual run of 'political thrillers'.<br /><br />If you know who Mamet is, you already know that his dialogue is lean, focused, and idiosyncratic to the point of surreality. You also know to expect a plot consisting of one mind-bending twist after another. This movie will meet your expectations.<br /><br />It probably won't exceed them; as political films go, this isn't quite up to _Wag the Dog_ (another of Mamet's best screenplays). Its plot is actually -- for Mamet -- pretty straightforward: Laura Newton, the president's daughter, has disappeared, and super-duper Black Ops guy 'Scott' (Val Kilmer) is going to get her back.<br /><br />By the time we're through we've been cycled through quite a bit of ruthlessness, cynicism, and unflattering revelations about political ambition. The direction is extraordinarily good -- and, for what it's worth, the deaths (of which there are many) are eerily realistic, not yer usual Hollywood screaming-bullets-and-exploding-cars BS. The ensemble cast is wonderful (particularly Kilmer).<br /><br />But we don't really visit any new territory. For my taste there are a few too many cliches here -- which would be somewhat more acceptable if they were at least Mamet's _own_ cliches, but some of these are Tom Clancy's.<br /><br />Nonetheless it's all handled deftly and intelligently, and it's miles above the usual run of political thrillers. I'm giving this one four stars by comparison with Mamet's other films, but compared to everything else it's a five-star movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>This oft-repeated line lies at the centre of Spartan, a political thriller from writer-director David Mamet. At the heart of this film is a mystery, one that the central character must solve and, in doing so, discover something about himself.<br /><br />When the daughter (Bell) of the President of the United States goes missing, the Secret Service brings in Robert Scott (Kilmer) to investigate. He is one of those shadowy operatives with no name (of consequence) that does all of the government?s dirty business under the veil of secrecy and plausible deniability. He is assigned a young, inexperienced partner named Curtis (Luke). They have very little time before the media gets wind of what has happened. The two men go undercover and trace the young girl?s whereabouts to an international prostitution ring.<br /><br />Scott is a typical Mamet protagonist in that he wastes few words and everything he says has meaning. Val Kilmer is a perfect fit for Mamet?s tough, no-nonsense world. He does a good job with Mamet?s tricky, distinctive dialogue. Much like Gene Hackman?s character in Heist, Kilmer?s Scott is efficient and ruthless in his methods because time is of the essence and his way gets results.<br /><br />On paper, the film?s story is a conventional one?it belongs to the action-thriller genres?but Mamet flips all of the clich?s and stereotypes on their head with his unconventional dialogue and characterization. Every bit of dialogue and every action are important. This requires the utmost level of attention from the audience because if you miss something, the film does not slow down and allow you to catch up.<br /><br />Mamet is a breath of fresh air in this politically correct climate in that he never sentimentalizes his characters or their situations. Spartan remains true to this attitude right down the line to its satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />There is a delightfully eccentric audio commentary by actor Val Kilmer. For every interesting factoid (he talks about all the training and preparation he did for the role), he drops surreal observations such as this, ?If you?re listening to this and watching the film for the first time?You?re really strange.? Imagine hearing that in Kilmer?s trademark cadences and you get an idea of what a surprising treat it is listening to this track. While, there are quite a few lulls in the actor?s commentary, there are enough bizarro gems from him to make it worth sitting through the dry spots.<br /><br />The attitude of Kilmer?s character in Spartan reflects that of the movie itself?all business. Mamet?s film is a sleek, professional political thriller that was unfairly ignored by audiences and snubbed by many critics. Perhaps it was his not so thinly-veiled critique of the Presidency or the highly stylized prose that scared off mainstream audiences. Regardless, Spartan is a top notch thriller that is exciting as it is intelligent.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Spartan-Rigorously self-disciplined or self-restrained. Simple, frugal austere. Marked by brevity of speech, laconic. Courageous in the face of pain, danger, or adversity.<br /><br />If you like Ronin then Spartan is choc-full of the same kind of cryptic dialogue with double/triple meanings and clever touches. Not surprising really since Spartan is written and directed by David Mamet who worked on the Ronin script.<br /><br />When the President's daughter is kidnapped a strict, no-nonsense Secret-Secret Service agent (Val Kilmer) follows an intriguing trail of clues and dead-ends to find out where she is, who took her and why. Hardly sounds original but Spartan dares to do what very, very few Hollywood movies are willing to try; it assumes its audience actually have brains and can figure things out by themselves.<br /><br />Spartan is the slickest, smoothest and smartest thriller for a good while. Kilmer has his critics and is constantly given a hard time. But here he proves what an actor he can be given the right material. Ed O'Neill also pops up and adds some post-Married With Children credibility to his resume.<br /><br />Like Ronin, the action is stern and serious. There's nothing far-fetched or unbelievable about this. It may lack the epic feel of Ronin but Spartan is by no means a small movie. I strongly recommend this if you are tired of idiotic action movies and need a fix of something with some class.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and a commentary by Val Kilmer (should be interesting).</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Wow! &lt;---- I should probably end my review with that one word and encourage you to watch this fabulous thriller for yourself. What a truly satisfying thriller with nebulous intrigue and some delectable espionage. <p>Don't you just love movies where the theme story counts on your ability to think for yourself and draw your own conclusions about evidence trails, incidents, alibis, motives and intentions -- then pulls those conclusions out from under you more than once with substantial surprises that make you think even harder.

Scott (Val Kilmer) is a marine who doesn't wince at taking out a man's eye for not spilling the beans. As usual David Mamet's direction and screenplay leave the viewer's head spinning after the first three minutes with questions like, "how come a marine is shooting up the local police force?" Many tough as nails moments force the viewer to confront these cold case facts of a military underbelly that needs the guts to get the job done at any cost, especially when the President's daughter (implied as the President's daughter but never officially stated by the movie) has been kidnapped by a Middle Eastern prostitution ring that does not know what it has done. Queue various international espionage scenes including some cinematography work in Dubai and mix it with homeland security conspiracy and you have got yourself a drama that plants itself right on in there along side classics like "Marathon Man" and "3 Days of the Condor" and is not a distant cry from Clancy movies like "Clear and Present Danger".<br /><br />As a special ops squad leader, Scott does not plan missions; he executes them, with an iron fist conviction that expects complete obedience from his subordinates. In one scene he takes an old age pensioner madam and places her in a chokehold to get the information out of her. Knowing that the girl will be killed when the abductors figure out what they have, it is a race against the clock. Scott dawns a detective mind that is not afraid to whip out a blade when the going gets tough. A double cross sees Scott eventually planning his own mission in order to do the right thing. There is plenty of thinking, plot twists and characters to make it deeper than most thrillers, with still lots to do. This is ace entertainment through and through. If you like any of the movies mentioned in this review and know who Mamet is and appreciate Kilmer in comeback mode - then what are you waiting for? This could well be one of the best DVDs you could hook up with in 2005. It is certainly the best post 911 thriller that does a good spin on homeland security. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a movie that I completely missed when it was briefly in theaters.  I am not sure why it didn't do well because I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Maybe it was when it came out and what it was competing against.  Maybe it was marketed badly.  I don't know, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a great job as Scott or whatever the hero's name really is.  Scott is a nameless man of action who works for the government in some undefined role doing things that can't legally be done, but need to get done.  In this story it is to get back the daughter of the President - although they never come right out and say it.  The girl's kidnappers may or may not know who she really is, but if it hits the papers it is unlikely to end well for her.  Things move fast.<br /><br />Scott also trains new special ops folks and a couple ends up with him in this assignment in various ways.  Derek Luke (from Antwone Fisher) does a fine job as Curtis who is doing his best at whatever Scott wants him to do, but his newness shows.  At times Scott should take him more seriously than he does.  Tia Texada is also fine as the earnest and capable Jackie Black.<br /><br />William H. Macy and Ed O'Neill are government types who will move heaven and earth to support the man they work for (the unstated President).  Their actions and the resources they have at their disposal all add to the behind the curtain suspicions the movie tries to raise in us regarding our government.<br /><br />David Mamet's writing style is unique and personal to him.  I appreciated that the F word quotient is way down here, but there are still more than are really needed for effect.  Some people say that the word adds realism.  Maybe in some circles, but it isn't common where I live and work.<br /><br />The commentary track by Kilmer adds some interesting insights, but wanders a bit too much and seems like a bit of a tossed off assignment rather than wanting to actually share anything much with the viewer, but he does politely thank us for watching the movie at the end.<br /><br />All in all this disk was a pretty good experience and much better than I had anticipated for something that I didn't even know existed.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>Not too long ago, I managed to check out "Spartan" at the theater. And, to me, I thought that the film was nothing short of amazing. "Spartan" had a great storyline, a powerful plot, and masterful direction by David Mamet ("Heist", "The Spanish Prisoner"). The performances of Val Kilmer ("Red Planet", "Top Gun"), Derek Luke ("Antwone Fisher", "Biker Boyz"), William H. Macy ("Jurassic Park III", "Magnolia"), Ed O'Neill ("Dutch", TV's "Married with Children"), and Kristen Bell ("Pootie Tang") were top-notch and flawless!<p>"Spartan" puts the focus on Robert Scott (Kilmer), a career military officer working in a highly secretive special operations force. Scott is a man hardened by years of brutal service, but is respected by his peers and elders in the world of espionage. When Scott is recruited to find Laura Newton (Bell), the daughter of a high-ranking official (more than likely, the daughter of the President of the United States), he is paired with novice Curtis (Luke), who becomes his protege. Working with a special task force comprised of presidential advisors, the Secret Service, FBI and CIA, Scott and Curtis stumble upon a sex slavery ring, which may have some connection to Laura's disappearance. As the story unfolds, the straightforward search-and-rescue mission becomes complicated by the political ambitions of those in high places. Like Stoddard (Macy), a political operative who may know more than he's telling about the clandestine circumstances surrounding the abduction of Laura. Scott and Curtis are on the brink of tracking Laura's whereabouts when the mission comes to an abrupt conclusion, with the media issuing reports of the girl's death. Scott returns to the quiet life of landowner in a rural location and awaits his next assignment in relative peace. But Curtis can't rest. In his naivete, he seeks out Scott to confide his belief that Laura is in fact alive. If she is, their continued unofficial investigation will put them, as well as Laura, at the center of a dangerous conspiracy that reaches the highest levels, even past the doors of the White House itself!<p>In conclusion, "Spartan" is a fine, superb, underrated thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as to keep you guessing from heart-pounding beginning to breathtaking finish! With powerful performances by a stellar cast and masterful direction by David Mamet, "Spartan" is nothing short of a DVD must-own when it's released!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>David Mamet has a true gift for dialogue. I've noticed his brillance in other films before such as "Heist", "The Spanish Prisoner" and "House of Games" but for some reason there's something about "Spartan" that made me pay even more attention to his words than I normally do. There's a scene when we first meet Ed O' Neill's character listen very carefully to the exchange betweem Val Kilmer and him. Pay attention to the rhythm of the dialogue. Sometimes it's as if they talk, but they don't say anything. Other times it's as if they understand each other, but the viewer don't know what's going on.<p> "Spartan" starts off exactly like that. We don't clearly know what's going on. That is of course considering you have not seen the trailers or read the film's reviews. I hadn't. I prefer to walk into a movie cold. I want to be completely surprised. I don't want to know one bit of information. And if you go into this movie that way "Spartan" starts to unravel like a puzzle. We don't know what is going on, but we know what ever it is, it's bad. Now this may bother some viewers. There is no personal involvement. We are constantly on the outside looking in, but if your familiar with Mamet's work, this is the way he operates. This should not come as a shock to you.<p> "Spartan" for the most part is an entertaining film. It has as I mentioned the usual fascinating dialogue, the clever characters, Mamet never looks down upon his audience. It has plenty of twist and turns but there is a problem with it. As much as I enjoy Mamet's work, I'm not a push over for him. I'll call it like I see it. And the final act of the film is slightly disappointing. It's hard to describe without spoiling the film, so my statements may seem vague, but after you've seen the movie you'll unerstand. The resolution to the movie is not handled in the manner I felt it should be. Here we have a film that deals with complex problems and has equally complex characters and yet the final moments seem all too simple. How could a movie that seems as "tricky" as this be solved so easily? It doesn't add up. As we watch it we think to ourselves "what! This is it?" We are almost expecting something more. We are waiting for one more final twist. Besides that though the film works.<p> "Spartan" is not about cons and con men. It deals with what seems to be the CIA or FBI. If anything its closer to "Homicide" then say "Heist".<p> Val Kilmer leads the cast and does some impressive work. Sadly he has kind of dropped out of the loop and is no longer a major Hollywood player. But now he seems to be doing some of his best work. Check him out in "The Salton Sea" as well. William H. Macy, a Mamet regular is quite good in this film, but has a brief part. To be honest, the whole cast works well together.<p> Bottom-line: Above anything else it's Mamet dialogue that steals the show. Doesn't rely on the plot twist so much this time as it does the people. Has some good performances headed by Kilmer. Has some great moments but slows down near the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Marine operative Scott (Kilmer) is selected to help find the kidnapped daughter of a politician.  He is given 48 hours to do this before the media gets wind of the story and runs with it.  Aided by Curtis (Luke), he dives into an investigation that takes new twists and turns with each new bit of data they recover.  It seems that the reason for the kidnapping might not be what everyone thinks, but that doesn't mean the the girl is not in danger.  And as he draws closer to finding her, other forces begin to work against him to actively prevent him from succeeding.  Director David Mamet has constructed an interesting tale with motivations that are sadly believeable in today's age.  Spartan is an interesting film that is not afraid to slam the politics of today's world.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>An absolute tour de force by writer/director David Mamet, SPARTAN has a kind of bubbling undercurrent that pulls the viewer back into the story just when you think it's starting to slow down.  Val Kilmer does an extraordinary turn as a former Marine turned Secret Service performing his country's highest service -- recovering the President's kidnapped daughter -- in an abduction scheme that takes several surprising turns before it's all over.  Along for the ride are William H. Macy (terribly underused but nonetheless effective) and Ed O'Neill in a terrifically understated performance as the head of the Secret Service.<p>The plot will keep you guessing, right up until the very end, but SPARTAN proves to be a warrior worthy of its name.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I just rented this movie and really enjoyed it. It's a movie that I strongly recommend to everyone, whether it be a rental or a buy. This is the best Val Kilmer movie in my opinion. Kilmer is a talented actor but most of the movies that he is in are average. He was good as Batman, but the movie sucked. This movie is a good drama movie that is a thriller. It has suspensful moments, shocking moments and puzzling moments. This is one movie that requires the viewer's complete attention. If you don't, you'll be confused probably.<br /><br />This movie is about a kidnapping of a very important girl. Val Kilmer plays a special ops guy who is assigned to help search for her. But, this case is complicated with betrayals and lots more. The movie is compelling and exciting and a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />I see mixed reviews on Amazon but don't understand them at all. Ignore them as this is one excellent movie that got a rave review by Roger Ebert. And rightfully so!!!!!! Check this one out as it is a surprisingly good movie that is one of the better ones of the past 5 years.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for William H. Macy who delivers a strong performance in a small role! Rent this, buy it, do what ever you want. But just make sure you watch it!</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Under the fine direction of David Mamet "Spatan" meanders forward in somewhat baffling fashion to establish that a young woman with high government connections has been abducted.  Lethal and obedient covert government operative Val Kilmer leads the investigation into the kidnapping.  Together with inexperienced partner Derek Luke they follow a series of clues to learn that the girl has been kidnapped by a white slavery operation.  North American girls are seized and funneled to Dubai where they are sold.<p>We later find out that that young woman abducted was none other than the daughter of the president.  This brings a stern, no nonsense Ed O'Neil, head of the Secret Service into command of the investigation.  Aided by a smarmy William H. Macy, O'Neil orders the investigation terminated when the body of the president's daughter washes ashore in Martha's Vineyard, the apparent victim of a boating accident.<p>Failing to believe the girl is really dead Kilmer and Luke continue their probing which unearths an unexpected deep government conspiracy.<p>Mamet is a talented director and Spartan is an excellent example of his skill. All the actors are very convincing in their roles with special kudos to Kilmer and O'Neil.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>It's a David Mamet movie. Enough said.<br /><br />Well I'll ramble on for a moment here because I do like this movie.<br /><br />If this flick was supposed to be based on real events -or "real events", or had a message, or was popular with rightwingers, or--God spare us--moronically depicted torture as a vital and reliable way to gather informationa and save countless lives from immanent doom--then it would suck in my book. I have very mixed feelings, you might say, on movies depicting the military and spies and lots of the stuff that goes with that like murdering people. But just like any red blooded male and American the dark and  unsurprising truth is I love watching violence with guns and explosions and bad a** alpha-males doing the impossible. (I don't remember explosions in this one though.)<br /><br />Basically SPARTAN can be viewed as a kind of cinematic version of the TV series "24".<br /><br />Val Kilmer is excellent in this role as a sort of Delta Force type commando or super-elite agent. It has the guy who was in TV's "Married with Children" playing head of the FBI or something and he is fantastic. You wouldn't believe how real he is as a take charge alpha-male head of a huge and powerful governmental agency. Everybody is good.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, basically the president's daughter is missing and it ain't clear where she is because she is missing and of course you don't know who has her or why. And you also don't know what some people that you'd think don't know anything actually do or who is up to what or why. A web of decite and misinformation and so on. Who's playin' and who's getting played? Bottom line, what's special about this stylish David Mamet tale is, of course, the dialog. It can be over-the-top at times as is sometimes the case with his stuff, but it's still great and I like how it's laid on thick. And Val Kilmer is the man.<br /><br />I highly recommend SPARTAN and all David Mamet movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>This is tightly written and edited down to the final shot. It is flab-free, and if your belief must be suspended here and there, the entertainment quotient makes it worth it. Val Kilmer kills as the super SS agent, searching for the daughter of, the president? We are never told outright. That's one of the charms here. A great way to spend two hours. Watch this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>It's hard to figure the film audiences of today. That this slick political thriller would go pear shaped at the box office seems more than a little unfair, considering that far less accomplished films have cut better figures.<br /><br />Sure, the setting may seem a little musty with all the big tykes from the FBI, the Secret Service, Special Ops and the CIA making an appearance in a criss-cross of motives (kidnap of the President's daughter). But there are still con-tricks and plot twists aplenty, all punctuated by Mamet's signature dialogue, which is as clipped as the mannerisms of the actors. The plot twists are not the usual cerebral kind that we have come to expect from him. They're more action oriented.<br /><br />Spartan almost plays in real-time, with us, the audience unraveling the meandering plot along with the characters in the film. It whisks us in a dizzy rush of events. We are not given time to think, we are not supposed to think; this is not a reflective film. There is nothing beneath the surface, nothing new. Stop and think, and all sorts of huge implausibilities immediately become apparent.<br /><br />But to its credit it chugs along with commendable pace and purpose. If I were to be particularly fastidious, I'd say that in the last half an hour Mamet appears to have given in to pandering his audience with what they want in a spy thriller: excitement and melodrama.<br /><br />Fortunately, Spartan stays clear of the scatter-shot editing and wall-to-wall pounding musical scores that plague most modern action thrillers. Val Kilmer is more than adequate as the effaced warrior. Baby-face Kristen Bell's guest appearance hangs in one's memory.<br /><br />It's a well-crafted and satisfying film, undeserving of its low rating, and certainly a very worthy rental at the very least.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>SPARTAN is unlike other spy/thriller/intrigue/manhunt movie out there.  Instead of focusing on powerful explosions and screaming background 'music' and visual tricks, David Mamet, who wrote and directed this tense expose' of the government and its brutal intelligence tactics, opts for terse dialogue and rapid sequence encounters to lead the viewer down a very twisted, convoluted, but fascinating path.  Val Kilmer is superb as Scott, the ex-military, seemingly amoral Secret Service agent (funny how we use "SS" letters in our own way...) assigned the complex job of finding the President's daughter (Kristen Bell).  He is assisted by new recruit Curtis (Derek Luke of 'Antoine Fisher' and 'Pieces of April' fame, finding himself very at ease in this type of role!). The endlessly surprising but highly orchestrated search uncovers rings of white slavery in Dubai and other Arab cities, prostitution rings, pockets of quasi-terrorist gents - the list goes on.  The filming technique is one closely associated with Mamet: scenes are shot from obtuse angles and collaged together to heighten tension (if confusing the viewer a bit too often).  Yes, the plot is frequently confusing and at times requires backup and rewind to unravel some of the important dialogue, but the end result is one of intense intrigue  and if you don't mind feeling a bit lost at times, the journey is eventually worth it.  Definitely not for the viewer who needs strictly linear scripting!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>Val Kilmer does a very good job of making a realistic character. Not so bullet-proof as most competing movies. Just the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction enough that you believe this really could happen and probably has (with slight changes). The ending is a little unnerving, but in a mild way. Both rekindles and dims hopes about the motives of others. Good flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>Val Kilmer is perfect for the military role he plays in Spartan; focused, contained, unwaivering, with cold-blooded ruthlessness.  His cool-headed character dances in perfect unison with the intricate planning and choreographed coordination "the Unit" demands, setting aside all personal concerns.  There is no wasted communication or speculation between the characters, just focused repetition to find the answer required to progress to the next step in the mission.<br /><br />The plot unfolds at a measured place, easily pulling the viewer along into the minefield of twists and turns.  Why this movie did not get better play and promotion in 2004 is a bit of a mystery but don't let that stop you from enjoying a first rate thriller, especially at the current Amazon price.  My only criticism of the movie is a plot and character gap concerning the kidnapped girl.  Her actions before and during the night of the abduction are implied but leave a lot room for further development.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The plot of Spartan has some nice twists in it. The acting is adequate. Kilmer is good as always. The characters are interesting. The dialog is terse and very good. There is a shorthand in the communication between the characters that makes me feel that I am only seeing  a small glimpse of very different world from which I live. It is a dark, cold world where every one has motivations for their actions that no one else can guess. The characters are cold, but engaging.<br /><br />There are small plot holes and the denouement is wrapped up a little too smoothly, but I recommend the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I am a Val Kilmer fan. When I saw this movie in the video store I first thought, "why haven't I heard of this movie? Its in the new releases and I have never heard of it." That is usually not good. I must say that the first time I saw it I thought it stunk. I thought the dialogue was just bad and I just couldn't get into it. But for some reason I got it at a good price on DVD and I gave it another shot. As I watched it the second, third, fourth and other times I came to find that I liked it more and more. I began appreciating the strange cadence of the dialogue in that it wasn't like anything else that I had heard. Also things that I thought would happen if it was a typical hollywood movie...didn't. Val Kilmer was very good at this strange kind of clunky, hard to ride style and script. William H. Macy and 'Al Bundy' were also in the cast. Ah, who knows, maybe I just like Val Kilmer cause with dialogue like, "why weren't you prepared?", "Where IS the girl" (repeated for what seemed like 20 times in the exact same way by different characters... "Where IS the girl", and " You don't want to go in the desert" and some pretty stupid immplausible concepts like the roadhouse/convict/deathrow inmate/cop killing scam and some plot holes... I don't know, maybe I just like Val Kilmer or maybe I convinced myself that I liked it. It just had a wierd different strange style.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>A fine film by David Mamet, who is producing one of the best bodies of work of his generation.  He has his own stylistic way<br /><br />of writing, which some people may not like, because it is very direct, vulgar/curt, and sometimes macho or seemlingly chauvinistic.  I'm not a person who normally enjoys such dialogue, but Mamet creates his own genre, which gains merit<br /><br />because of it's underlying intelligence and drama.  This movie is a fast paced, intelligent thriller, that is tied together well, and that has soul.  As any conspiracy thriller, one maybe has to indulge the plot a little, but saying it has holes is an overstatement.  Kilmer and many of the interesting side characters give firm performances, and the movie is filled with edgy one-liners.  This is not a family movie, but under the tough veneer is a message about honor and dignity... and probably redemption.  As a footnote, the commentary by Kilmer (I listened to the last half hour only) is trippy and humorous.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>David Mamet is a  master of smoke and mirrors. He has demonstrated this time and time again through both his plays and films. In his films, he has demonstrated an uncanny ability to create a world where nothing is as it seems. Your friends are your enemies, your lovers are your killers, and vice versa. He also has a knack for dialogue, whichi is kind of like saying Michelangelo had a knack for ceiling painting. In &quot;Spartan&quot;, he displays a heretofore-unseen ability to make a very visual as well as a very well-written film. His other films, like &quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;Heist&quot;, and &quot;Homicide&quot;, while being good (&quot;Heist&quot;) to great (&quot;House of Games&quot;, &quot;Homicide&quot;) have never displayed a strong visual language. But here he combines the best of all the film worlds with great acting, writing and directing. Kilmer, who almost always does brilliant work, does it again here with the portrayal of Scott, an extraordinary black ops agent for the US government who is brought in to assist in the safe retrieval of the kidnapped daughter of a politician who rates VERY HIGH on the food chain. -SPOILERS AHEAD- Scott is a singularly driven man who will do whatever he needs to to get the job done. In one shocking instance, he must kill a police officer and another man in order to gain the confidence of someone who may know where the girl is. He threatens to gouge out eyes, but with Scott, you know it's not just a threat. Sometimes he must mistreat the very people he's trying to protect in order to get the job done right. Of course, you have to remember this IS a David Mamet film, and the first rule of his films is that NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS. Even Scott, who as ruthless and task-oriented as he is, becomes a morally-challenged man when he is left out to dry by the people he serves. This film is a great companion piece to John Frankenheimer's &quot;Ronin&quot;, who Mamet co-wrote under a psudeonym, but if you watch &quot;Ronin&quot; again, you can hear and feel Mamet's influence, particularly in the dialogue. Anyway, both of these films are about the world of the covert operation, whether it's for a government or a pack of mercenaries, and neither of them have those spy-movie moments where the colloquialisms and slang of black-bag ops are not explained by a character to another character just so the audience knows what it means. Films rarely get more interesting, exciting, or exhilarating to watch as &quot;Spartan&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>When Laura Newton (Kristen Bell), the daughter of a high ranking government official and a student at Harvard, goes missing Bobby Scott's (Val Kilmer) services are enlisted in Boston to help find the missing girl. Joined by a former recruit fresh out of training named Curtis (Derek Luke), Scott investigates the disappearance, but as he goes further down the rabbit hole looking for Laura he learns that there may be more to the disappearance than initially expected.<br /><br />There are very few writers who know their way around a line of dialogue quite like David Mamet. As a playwright he received the Pulitzer for his brilliant play Glengarry Glen Ross (which he later adapted for the screen), and as a screenwriter he's been nominated for Oscars for both Wag the Dog and The Verdict. But you won't have to look very far to see movies based on his work from The Untouchables to Hannibal and back to The Postman Always Rings Twice, not to mention he created the TV show The Unit. For his tenth feature film as a director, Mamet decided to create a film inspired in part by Eric L. Haney, one of the founding members of the elite Delta Force, who also served as one the technical advisers on the film.<br /><br />One of David Mamet's greatest abilities as a writer is to take a screenplay and a film that could easily become cliche, and turn it on it's ear and make it fresh. With Spartan, he takes a film that in a lesser filmmakers hands would have been over the top and grounds it in reality through dialogue and giving the plot situations that don't seem too far off from real life. Often, we don't think of men in situations like Bobby Scott's in Spartan as being something that could be real, but Mamet treats it like this is something that could, and does happen, and makes the audience believe it.<br /><br />But there's only so much one man can do when working with a cast of actors, and it's really the job of the actors to sell us the characters, and each actor truly sells it. Val Kilmer, who I personally think is very underrated, is Bobby Scott. When you watch him on the screen in this movie, you have no doubt that this man will recover Laura Newton, you know he has the training and the experience to get it done. The performance that really caught me by surprise though was Kristen Bell as the aforementioned Laura. If all you know her from is Forgetting Sarah Marshall, she will completely surprise you here.<br /><br />Spartan is a movie that's almost perfect, where it nearly falls apart is in one of the final scenes of the movie. It's understandable that Mamet had to throw in one last confrontation in, but unfortunately what he does throw in doesn't feel completely organic. I don't want to give anything away, mostly due to the fact that I'm not one to spoil things for everyone, but also because you might not feel the same way I do concerning this ending.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie. While not completely based on a true story, there are elements that have basis in real experiences, and we often don't realize the covert operations that are taken on in an effort to keep us from worrying about some of the darker things that happen throughout the world around us. Mamet did an amazing job of conveying that real world sentiment to film while also making a highly entertaining film.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I don't usually let good movies like this slip by, but somehow I didn't catch Spartan when it first released.

You will feel you are with Val Kilmer training special forces recruits and then trailing the disappearance of a young girl. Interviews with suspects quickly lead them to a slave trade and then preparation for an overseas flight to take down the gang. News of her death while yachting doesn't ring true when his partner indicates he saw signs of her at the entry point of the slave trade. You best sit tight and pause if you have to leave the room because you will not want to miss a minute of this action thriller.

Kilmer is very good in here, one of his best performances ever and the film is nicely photographed. The only warning I would give viewers is the language, which contains about 25 f-words.<br /><br />The best plug I can give this film is that it was very entertaining, start to finish, and that's what most of us are looking for - entertainment. It keeps your attention the full 100-plus minutes. Make no mistake: Kilmer is the show. Everything in the story really revolves around him.<br /><br />There was anything that struck a sour note with me, it would be the story with the kidnapped girl's father.

While Spartan is, once again, not that film, it does come closer than any other Mamet movie I've seen. (Except, of course, for House of Games.)<br /><br />Laura Newton (Veronica Mars' Kristen Bell) is a Senator's daughter who has a reputation for being somewhat wild. She disappears one night, and a team of Rangers headed by Scott (Val Kilmer) are brought in to try and find her. It's a simple plot, but this is David Mamet-- there's nothing simple about the details. Double-crosses, cover-ups, spin, incompetent government officials, red herrings, white slavery rings, ex-boyfriends, lecherous professors, the smell of American tobacco carrying in the desert...<br /><br />First off, because it has to be said: what's a David Mamet film without Ricky Jay? Okay, now that I've got that off my chest, it's a technically competent film, and the acting is credible (Kilmer, whose career has become notoriously inconsistent in the past ten years or so, gives one of his good performances here. Not great-- not Wonderland, certainly-- but good.), but it feels like there's a lot missing from this movie. The shallowness of Stoddard (William H. Macy, wasted in the role) has been pointed out more than enough that I can just mention it and move on. It's synecdochic, though; it feels as if there was a lot more of Stoddard in the first couple of drafts of the script (or perhaps in the film before it went to the editing room) and we ended up just getting the edges of the character. I got that feeling with a bunch of other stuff in this movie, too. Some things (can't say what without spoilers) seemed a bit too convenient, as if pieces around them had been trimmed off by editing when they should have been left in. That sort of thing. There's no specific thing I can point to and say 'this is what caused the movie to go downhill' for me; it's a bunch of little stuff that worked, but didn't work quite as well as it should have. That said, it's certainly a credible way to kill an hour and forty-five minutes; you just may end up feeling like you've had some empty calories on your plate after you're done. ***</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Val Kilmer is back to top form here as the secret service agent at the top of his game who finds himself involved in a kidnap of a VIP politician - of course, this is David Mamet, so the plot has a way of going into blind alleys and left turns that you never quite see coming.  In fact, do yourself a favour, and find out as little as you can about the plot, you'll enjoy the movie all the more!  Having said that, the loose ends dont quite all tie up, and the ending does not live up to the build up, but this is only a minor quiblle when the acting and script are of this quality.<br /><br />The music is minimal, and the directing is not flashy, but all serves to further the story - a quality so lacking in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />The pace never lets up, and the script of course is sharp and real.  William H Macy plays a small but pivotal role in a rare serious role, and the rest of the cast exude realism in all the roles, not least Ed Reilly who casts off his Married with Children tag with this one.<br /><br />This is not one to see just because you want action, but for an intelligent thriller that engages the brain, thumbs up.</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>David Mamet is one of the most interesting screen writers out there. The dialouge in his films are always somewhat mechanical, yet poetic. If you've seen the brilliant Spanish Prisoner, then you should have an idea of what I'm talking about. Spartan delivers that same layered, hand-crafted dialouge again.<br /><br />The story is interesting, as are the characters. The president's daughter is missing, and so Kilmer, who is a sort of Rouge government agent, who does as he is told, no more or no less, is hired along with a partner who has a knack for questioning everything. A very Mamet-like plot then unfolds with all of the conspiracies that you'd expect from a Mamet film.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film immensly. The acting, while not excellent, is appropriate, and as I said before, the script is to be savored by all fans of conspiracy/mystery thriller films.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>No matter what the posters or previews promise, writer-director David Mamet's movies, such as "Spartan," neither look nor sound like anybody else's movies.<br /><br />Mamet began his career as a playwright and honed a peculiar style of dialogue, intentionally scripting lines full of repetition, stammers, pauses and profanity that feel both natural and artificial.<br /><br />He later shifted to movies, mostly fables about cops, con artists, gamblers and gangsters, and he cranks out one twisty, idiosyncratic brainteaser after another. In his films, such as "The Spanish Prisoner," "Homicide" and "Heist," everything means something but very little means what it appears, and this complexity, coupled with his dialogue, will understandably drive some people right up the wall.<br /><br />In "Spartan," Val Kilmer plays a mysterious "spec ops" agent working with the Secret Service to recover a kidnap victim. The captive is a young woman whose identity and significance only come into focus for the viewer as Kilmer's character follows her trail, using bluffs and beatings to leap from one clue to the next.<br /><br />No attempt has been made to spoon-feed the complicated plot to the viewer; the story has almost no exposition and characters don't get much introduction, but the film moves so fast and so confidently that the viewer doesn't really have time to worry about it. In fact, I motored along with "Spartan" for nearly an hour before it suddenly occurred to me that the story itself was completely ridiculous, but by that time I had already been pulled in and didn't mind a bit.<br /><br />Overall, the movie feels like a cinematic crossword puzzle rather than an actual story, but the twists and turns are satisfying. "Spartan" also gets a lot of mileage out of Kilmer, who seems to be bucking for a comeback and turns in a strong, plausible performance; fans of DVD extras may also enjoy Kilmer's solo commentary, which is spacey and tongue-in-cheek but which is surprisingly interesting and pretty hilarious to boot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>a highly original, dynamic and intriguing story that keeps you gripped til the end.<p>Mamet's style is not palatable to everyone; but I find it original and powerful. It deftly keeps you guessing what will happen next while being immersed in the intricasies of every scene. The suspense is constant and the camera work is expert.<p>Mamet is capable of doing the seemingly impossible: creating a film that is visually appealing and possessing a great story with superb acting.<p>Yes, there is some cheesy dialogue here and there, but overall this film delivers the goods in almost every way.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>A woman in a camouflage uniform dashes through a dense forest somewhere in the United States as a camouflaged man is pursuing her.  All of a sudden they are both stopped by a third camouflaged dressed man who asks the man who is pursuing the girl if he wants to quit by handing in his number.  The audience will be slightly bewildered at this set up as the audience is simply tossed into the story.  However, this is the mysterious magic that David Mamet brings to the audience as he depicts an intense military jargoned kidnapping drama.<br /><br />It is revealed for the audience that the third man who asked if the pursuing man in a camouflage uniform wanted to quit is named Scott (Val Kilmer) and he is a special operative for the CIA and United States military.  Scott is known to them as a methodical problem solver who always solves his problems.  This is essential as Scott is being called upon to recover a missing person who appears to have been kidnapped.  The missing person's identity is never fully revealed as they only refer to her as "the girl", but it is obvious that she is an important person as the CIA is willing to recover her at any cost.<br /><br />The Spartan is a journey into a world where decisions are made under gun point and a wrong decision could get one killed.  These decisions have to be made on a rapid succession as each decision has a consequence that will influence all parties involved.  The audience is lead into highly suspenseful cinematic experience through the meticulously written script by Mamet that depicts this intense atmosphere.  The cinematography combined with the careful direction of Mamet boosts the anticipation for what is to come, which enhances the suspense of the cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>One would not have to see the credits to know that this is a David Mamet movie. After one or two rhythmic, staccato exchanges of dialogue, Mamet's script writing fingerprints all but glow of the screen. When Mamet has his mojo working, his dialogue is lean and concise as haiku written in cool code (Glengarry Glen Ross, Things Change), but beware when he misses (Heist). Then it's like listening to a rejected radio play from the thirties. I was happy that he hit the mark with Spartan. There are only one are two times when his dialogue bordered on macho-embarrassing, but the movie has such tremendous forward momentum that it become part of the fun. <p>Briefly, the film tells the tale of a secret agent (Val Kilmer) from one of those Government organizations that have no name (do they really exist or was it just too convenient a construct for Hollywood not to invent?). The agent, who is called Scott, must retrieve the president's missing daughter. Of course, all is not what it seems. <p>Several things make this DVD worthy of purchase and re-watching:<p>First, as I have said, the movie has tremendous speed. I found myself not being bored for a single second. Every frame of film time has value, and the action scenes are expertly done and believable. It seems to have been Mamet's goal in this movie to really hammer down the film's editing and dialogue to the naked essentials. The men (and one woman) move in this film with a horrible efficiency toward a single goal. In Val Kilmer's commentary track in the special features, he said the characters reminded him of &quot;hunting dogs,&quot; and that is a perfect analogy. Kilmer's character and his co-workers move like a one-minded pack scenting blood. <p>Also, the film is beautiful to look at. The camera work is very creative and manages to convey a tight, claustrophobic world of tremendous pressure. Shadows loom and stretch across the ground, up the sides of buildings, across faces. The palate is one of hard blue steel and shiny black where rich, primary colors are often reflected on polished surfaces. Everything, including the faces, captures the light of chrome. <p>Lastly, the performances:<p>I will say up front I am a Val Kilmer fan (it is a great shame that Kilmer's current reputation in Hollywood seems to require that one admit that &quot;up front&quot;). For whatever reason, he seems to have been struggling a bit lately. Hollywood gossip has it that he is nearly impossible to work with, and that the big boys are calling him less just to avoid his ego. Whatever. I find him watchable in nearly everything he's ever done. He has an odd poise as an actor - the ability to take his time with a line or a character, never rushing or histrionic. He has a certain control that really conveys confidence without the need for extravagance. I find this quality very unique today (is anybody else getting tired of Sean Penn, as gifted as he is, blubbering and flailing through every role?)<p>As a special treat, the much underused Ed O'Neil makes an appearance as &quot;Burch,&quot; clearly the leader of these nameless men of a nameless organization. Watch O'Neil's eyes during his first scenes. This is one hunting dog whose brain has filled with the scent of the wounded.  -Mykal Banta</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Spartan hits the deck running and never lets up.  This nifty little thriller from David Mamet doesn't stop to explain everything to the audience but just takes off and unfolds, filling in the blanks as it zips along.<p>Val Kilmer is restrained and contained, playing an icy specialist in the netherworld of &quot;Special Ops&quot;:the nexus between the military and intelligence, political and pragmatic, public and covert arenas.  It is one of his better performances.<p>This self-described &quot;worker bee&quot; finds himself drawn into a situation that demands he go &quot;off the reservation&quot; to question his orders and those giving them for perhaps the first time in his life.  There are many twists and turns along the way, and Mamet keeps it moving along with his trademark cryptic dialogue and his fascination with the competence and ultimate grace of the &quot;professional&quot;.<p>Noting some of the critical reviews, I would agree that he does not break startling new ground here.  I don't think that was Mamet's intent.  I think he wanted to make a crisp thriller and explore again the world of men and women who, as mentioned before, are skilled and adept in their chosen fields, whatever they might be (thieves or spies or salesmen).  He did so, in a film that didn't waste time and kept me entertained from beginning to end.  Worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>The second half of any film is supposed to be better than the first. Hollywood got this one wrong.<br /><br />Val Kilmer plays Scott, a Secret Service operative assigned to do the dirty tasks that would otherwise not be countenanced by squeamish bleeding hearts. For instance, in order to get crucial information from a suspect, Scott is not above breaking the scumbag's arm. In the defense of Mom, flag and apple pie, a Hard Man is good to find.<br /><br />In SPARTAN, a VIP's daughter, Laura (Kristen Bell), is kidnapped from her college dorm after her Secret Service protection is temporarily withdrawn to supplement that of Ol' Dad's when he comes to town to visit his mistress during a re-election campaign. The script never specifically says so, but the viewer presumes we're talking about the President here. In any case, the girl is apparently destined to be sent to a country bordering the Arabian Gulf where she'll become the sex slave of a rich sheikh. At this point in the plot, the kidnappers don't know whom they've got, and Scott must retrieve Laura before the story breaks in the press.<br /><br />Mind you, Kilmer gives a taut performance as the Service's Rambo. And the supporting cast includes the ever-watchable William H. Macy as the VIP's political Machiavelli, and Ed O'Neill as the agent in charge of the rescue. (I can never see O'Neill without hearing MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Peggy whine "Aaaa-lll!") However, when the audience finally meets Laura, she turns out to be such an unappealing brat that the viewer perhaps wonders why all the bother. Finally, Laura's deliverance from the Middle East is by such a successful, albeit fortuitously unexpected, route, that one questions why Scott didn't plan something similar - such as marching into the local BBC office with the girl in tow - from the very beginning instead of trying to be cute about it.<br /><br />The title "Spartan" makes reference to the proud habit of the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, when asked by a neighboring city to send military aid, of sending just one of its super warriors to get the job done.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This thriller was written and directed by David Mamet which makes it rise above the genre in respect to dialog and plot.  It's tightly written and well acted with constant twists and turns.  There's violence too.  But this is a good story, well told.  Val Kilmer stars and all the actors do well. Of course it's not believable but it did hold my interest.  And the plot is as fresh as today's headlines involving the FBI, CIA, Secret Service and the White House.  There are also some Middle Eastern kidnappers and a satisfying positive conclusion.  It's put together in a tight package and will appeal to action/adventure fans or anyone else just needing a fast paced film for a bit of escape.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I have long been a fan of the films of David Mamet, except perhaps the one he is most noted for, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. While that film explored a number of ideas and concerns, focusing on the lives of its characters, I just could never get involved in it properly. Rather, I found his film HOUSE OF GAMES to be one of the most surprising films I had seen in years, holding my in it's grip until the end.<br /><br />That being said, Mamet's film SPARTAN offers no major surprises and many have claimed that it is clich&eacute; ridden, riding on the backs of spy films past and present. I found this not to be true. While some scenarios might seem that way, the whole plot beneath what is really going on for one, I found that movie fresh and interesting, in no minor part due to the work of Val Kilmer.<br /><br />Kilmer plays Scott, a career special forces Ranger who has worked covert ops and is now helping in training a new set of recruits. On his way home after completing this mission, he is called in to help with a delicate situation. It seems that the President's daughter Laura (Kristin Bell) has been kidnapped due to the bumbling of her Secret Service protection. Scott is one of those do anything no matter what kind of action heroes. He does not feel compromised when torturing a suspect nor taking out anyone deemed necessary by his commanders.<br /><br />Bringing in the latest recruit Curtis (Derek Luke) to help him, Scott sets out to find just who is responsible. The trail leads him to a group of foreigners who are part of a group trafficking human beings. The pair raid a house where Curtis sees the sign that Laura draws to sign her name. A situation arises where the suspects draw weapons and are killed before they can offer any information.<br /><br />Several leads direct Scott and Curtis to a Middle Eastern country where the traffickers are based. A Special Forces team is about to raid the location she has been taken to. As they are about to go in, the call comes for them to hold off as the girl's body has apparently been washed ashore back home.<br /><br />This leaves one problem. Curtis tracks down Scott and tells him he saw the sign. He knows that the girl WAS in that location. So who was the body that washed ashore and where is the REAL Laura?<br /><br />As the pair investigate, shots are fired and Scott finds himself on the outside, running for his life and the life of the President's daughter. Calling in old favors, he relocates to the house where the raid was to take place to rescue Laura. But there is more at stake than the life of this girl. A conspiracy to leave her behind is in play and no one save Scott seems to want her found. Can he save her and his own hide in the process?<br /><br />Toss in the fact that those trying to get Scott are in the employ of the President and you have an odd situation. It seems that those Secret Service men who were responsible for watching Laura were taken off that detail to watch out for the President who was visiting his mistress at the time. Being an election year, there is no way that they can allow any of this to become know.<br /><br />The action scenes are played well, complimented by the fact that there is some heavy duty acting going on in their set ups. Kilmer is fantastic as the cold killer who begins to have pieces of his armor chipped away showing the real man beneath. And Mamet, known for his dialogues, backs off of the over the top wordage in favor of a more direct approach to the conversations among these characters.<br /><br />The film looks clean, well cut and tells a story that absorbs the viewer from beginning to end. Some may not have been particularly fond of this film, but my guess is they were expecting the same old Mamet. Instead look for a story that keeps you waiting for the final revelation.</p></br></body></html>

Based on the book Vengeance, an Israeli Body Guard to Golda Meir is engaged to assassinate conspirators in the kidnapping and murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  The main character uses many different aliases and travels throughout Europe to kill his targets.  It's an intriguing story and one that was never discredited as the truth.  I found the movie quite interesting but also confusing.  It is difficult to completely understand what is going on but I suspect that the main character and the other Israeli agents also felt that way.  The story is ambiguous in whether the mission helped Israel or harmed the country's long term peace goals.  It also highlights the intractable problem these two groups - israelis and Palestinians have with each other.  A very good movie to watch and learn from which can be entertaining at times, but very confusing and without a real ending - like real life.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>No matter how justified the intentions, no matter how a group of people was hurt or victimized, the inescapable truth remains that revenge doesn't correct a wrong.<br />The human message in this movie, the great acting, the conversations between enemies make it one of the best movies by Steven Speilberg.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a fine movie, one of the Steven Spielberg's best efforts. Yes, he gets a little preachy in the end but overall, this is enjoyable and top-notch film-making.<br /><br />Even though this had some violent moments, what impressed me was the restraint not to overdo the violence. I thought there was just the right amount. Being a long movie at two hours, 45 minutes, too much action would have worn out the viewer and too little would bore he/she.<br /><br /> It also was fascinating to me as almost a travelogue, seeing a lot of different cities around the world, following this team of Israelis as they track down and kill many of the men responsible for murdering hostages in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.<br /><br />That's the story of this film: not what happened at the Olympics, but how the Israelis tracked down the killers/terrorists afterward.<br /><br />Some of the violence is room-shaking if you have good speakers as a few of the explosions felt like it made my room shake when they went off! However much of the film deals not with that but with the men involved and how this mission affected them. In the end, Spielberg gives us a chance to reflect on a big question: how do you respond to terrorist attacks?  Basically, it is his view vs. how Israel responds. (Israel wasn't real pleased with this film, and I understand that. I think they are right, but I still love the film.)<br /><br />The movie is well-acted and has a story that will keep most people very involved while watching it. We plunk our dollars down to get entertained....and this movie delivers. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This is not the easiest film to watch, mainly because you know it's based on real events.  I appreciated how Spielberg was even handed in presenting the story, he showed the horror of the events in Munich in 1972, but also showed you that everything is not always black and white, this film deals in very gray areas.  I thought the acting was top notch, especially the lady who played Golda Meir and the lady that played Bana's mother, she was very powerful; she was only in a few scenes, but I was mesmerized by her.  This movie is quite long, but does not feel that way, frankly their is alot of things that have to be explained.  Bana makes his character very human, he makes mistakes and he is conflicted in the end over what he is doing, this eats at him like a cancer and his paranoia is very believable at the end.  I thought the last scene where, Bana asked Rush if he will come break bread with him, and old jewish custom, and Rush declines; and he does this right after speaking to what Israel means and what it means to be a Jew; I think that sums up to Bana what he has given up and for what.  Good film, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Munich deals with the aftermath of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Germany (hence the film's name). Once the Israeli state learns the full magnitude of the killings, political and defense leaders assemble a team of men to track down and assassinate those responsible. The movie is about that team of men, what they do, and how it affects them.<br /><br />While all the performeers were excellent, Eric Bana (the protagonist) was particularly fantastic. Bana plays Avner, the leader of the Israeli team. He is a force to be reckoned with in this film, spinning on a dime from nonchalant about his deeds to wracked with guilt, coarsely brutal to meltingly tender. I have not seen Bana in many films (although he was the best part of the too-epic Troy), but he was amazing in Munich. Bana captured the two sides of conflict: a man who feels a duty to avenge his countrymen as well as a man who sees the humanity in his enemy. Just great, great work.<br /><br />The message you come away with in this film - everyone loses. The terrorists killed innocent athletes. The Israeli team is sent to take out the terrorists. But as they track down the men, they realize that even terrorists have their own dreams of a homeland. They have wives, children. And when they kill the men responsible for the Munich murders, new men take their places within the terrorist organization. And the men of the Israeli team are left broken and haunted by what they have done. There is no end, just a violent rabbit hole that keeps on wending its way through the Middle East. I think that anyone who has followed world events would agree that this seems to be an accurate assessment.<br /><br />This film is definitely worth watching, but it's not popcorn cinema. This film is a great example of how film can be riveting (if not exactly entertaining) and teach you something, make you think, and perhaps even change you.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>For those of you who don't know, Munich is the story of the covert group assigned to hunt down and kill the terrorists that murdered the 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  This is a brilliant movie.  In my opinion, the best of 2005.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg tackles this tough subject ever so perfectly.  It's quite a wonderful movie to watch as well.  It's so refreshing to see cinema being used as a way to teach more than just one to entertain.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone.  It's a definite must see, one that will give you a new perspective on life.<br /><br />The DVD itself features an introduction by Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Must See.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>It is not so frequent to find a film that is intriguing Spielberg's "Munich" is beyond intrigue to the point to do ruinous damage... It's a dramatic thriller that disarms you and leaves you shocked... It really makes you question the nature of national retaliation, and gives you something to think about and discuss...<br /><br />Spielberg tries to remain in equilibrium on a very sensitive issue... He draws our attention to the consciousness of the Israeli assassins by showing their attempts to prevent injury to an innocent girl but, oddly enough, refuses to demonstrate the deplorable suffering of the Palestinians or their inalienable right of self-determination to return to their homeland...<br /><br />Everyone who knows the story seems to have a different opinion about how it should be told... "Munich" is about Israel's response to the murder, at the 1972 Olympics, of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian militants... Spielberg's disputable film follows Israel's retaliation by presenting an Israeli commando led by a Mossad agent who is about to become a father, and he is asked to lead an assassination squad to track down and eliminate, by any means possible, the masterminds who had organized the Munich attack...<br /><br />Spielberg shows a former Israeli prime minister--dressed as a woman--sneaking into Lebanon and assassinating targets...<br /><br />The killings are carried out in Rome, Paris, Cyprus, Beirut and Athens...</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>For me, this was a necessary reminder that the world has been dealing with terror tactics a long, long time. I faintly recalled the events with the athletes and the sad story that unfolded, though I was young at the time. We often forget that this is an on-going tragedy around the world and many are at a loss as to how to obtain a solution without becoming just like the terrorists. The film is a good fictional adaptation that was inspired by true events. Though some factual areas had to be a guessing game, it was very well put together.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>I thought this was a good film when I saw it in the theatre & was pleased to find a used DVD copy in the budget bin.  The DVD doesn't offer much extra in the one disc version other than brief comments by Steven Spielberg about the film's relation to the history.  To me, the film was a psychological thriller more than an action picture.<br /><br />Australian actor Eric Bana who started out in comedy & became known for pictures like "Black Hawk Down" & "Troy" does a good job as Avner, the Mossad agent who is given the task of eliminating those who planned the Munich Olympic games massacre.  His breakdown into near madness and paranoia as the film progresses is well done, but seems to occur suddenly without really seeing him unravel.  I guess the discovery of Carl's nude corpse in the hotel room was supposed to send him over the edge.  It'll be interesting to see him as a gambler in "Lucky You" with Drew Barrymore & Robert Duval.<br /><br />Australian actor Geoffrey Rush won his Oscar for "Shine" in 1996 and was twice more nominated for "Shakespeare in Love" & "Quills."  As Ephraim, he's the counter-intelligence mastermind who coordinates all these activities.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, after numerous films like "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," "The Jacket," & "Layer Cake," finally became known as Double-O-7 James Bond in "Casino Royale," for which he received a Best Actor nomination from the British Academy Awards.  As Steve, he does a good job of making it all the way through the movie, flying into action mode when required.  His blue eyes exude an intensity and focus that lifts the film.<br /><br />Mathieu Kossovitz plays Robert the bomb maker who can never quite get the charges right.  First they're not strong enough; next too strong.  He won a Best Supporting Actor award for "Munich" from the National Association of Film Critics.  He is also known as a director.  He directed "Gothika" with Halle Berry and won the Cannes Best Director Award for "La haine" (Hate).  As an actor, he's played in films like "Amelie" and "Birthday Girl" with Nicole Kidman.  He does a nice job as the klutzy often-berated toy maker who has been tapped to be the bomber.<br /><br />Irish Actor Ciran Hinds has a diverse number of films under his belt from "The Weight of Water" (which I reviewed as "The Weight of Editing") to "Oscar & Lucinda" & "Miami Vice."  He also played in "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" with Daniel Craig.  As Carl, he wears glasses and voices skepticism about the project and the authenticity of the intelligence on which they are acting.  His demise is a turning point in the film as we learn that the hunters are now also the hunted.<br /><br />Other roles are also nicely done.  Hanns Ziscler appears as Hans in his 69th film.  Ayelet Zurer as Avner's wife Daphna does a nice job of being the brave mother & spouse.  Lynn Cohen, whose first film was Woody Allen's "Manhattan Murder Mystery," does a convincing and controlled portrayal of Golda Meir.  Israeli actress Gila Almazor who won the Silver Bear Best Actress Award from the Berlin International Film Festival for "The Summer of Avia" in 1989 & does a good job as Avner's mother who urges him to avenge the villains for all of their ancestors.  French actors Michael Lonsdale who was in the first "Day of the Jackal" (1973) & another film I like very much, "Ronin," does a good job as the wise Papa who trades information to feed his family.  Mathieu Amalric plays his son Louis who acts as the go-between with Avner.<br /><br />"Munich" won the Best Picture Award from the American Film Institute.  It was nominated for 5 Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director & Best Editing.  While it is a long film, it is one that pulls me in and keeps me glued to the screen.  It was a moving cinematic adventure.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>baby daughter...mazel-tov. We've killed another  terrorist...mazel-tov. So it goes. On the surface it's all so simple. The 11 Israeli atheletes to the Munich Olympics in 1972 were murdered by Black September. Israel will seek out & kill individuals who knew or were responsible. They have a list of leaders. The  Massad recruits agent Avner played by Eric Bana & a team of specialist to find them. There are rules. The Massad & Prime Minister Golda Meir, who is sitting right there, must have credible deniability. The team is stripped of their identity. They are not well known, anyway. The must do the killing only in Europe & must not kill any innocent bystanders. Expolsions are the preferred method of assassination. They seem to have  unlimited funds from $$$ stashed in Swiss safety deposit boxes. They are sucessful but not as they planned. They must kill point blank with guns. They travel unauthorized to Lebanon & many innocents are killed. They make a side trip to Amsterdam simply to kill a female assassin very graphically in cold blood for killing a team member. She had come on first to Avner who thought of his sweet wife & turned down a vist to her room. So it becomes apparent while he is seeking out & killing terrorist he is in turn being hunted also. He fears for his family & has them moved to from Israel to Brooklyn. It is very hard to believe in the beginning, that Avnar is a stone cold agent. He is a handsome, young, modest family man that any mother (except his own) could love. But Speilberg hasn't made a mistake in the casting. The killing does take it toll, emotionally on Avnar. Speilberg hasn't drawn the terrorist as evil, villians deserving to be killed. They are somtimes gentle, urbane, respected family men. They are even likeable. They must die. Avnar quits & joins his family in Brooklyn. His sanity is in doubt.<br /><br />  In any case it doesn't matter. As soon as you kill a leader somone immediately rises to take their place. The more terrorist you kill, the more that sprout, like weeds. This is an above average thriller with little technical whiz bang. It has the additional virtue that some of it at least, is true.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>When I go to see a movie, I either go to be entertained, or to learn something.  I don't want to sit and analise a movie through and through, so I'm not going to write about the direction or the score or stuff like that.<br /><br />I believe this to be very close to the truth (there were a few differences from what I can remember about what I learnt of this topic in history).  Several teams were sent within Europe for revenge killings, but anyway ... Eric Bana was excellent in this.  His accent was down perfectly, and you could see he was a conflicted guy.  He was glad to get revenge, but yet he did things he thought were beyond him as a human being and he worried for his family.  The determination in his eyes was obvious but there was sadness too.  When he heard his baby on the phone for the first time and he broke down, that was heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic movie that doesn't go into major depth about the actual Munich games themselves, but the aftermath of Israel making those responsable pay.  From the real footage of coverage on news tv (with Peter Jennings voice) to the final scene, I really enjoyed this great movie and I barely noticed that it was in fact 2 hours and 40 something minutes.  I highly recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Steven Spielberg<br /><br />Cast:  Eric Bana, Daniel Craig, Ciaran Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz, Hanns Zischler, Ayelet Zurer, Geoffrey Rush, Gila Almagor, Michael Lonsdale, Mathieu Amalric.<br /><br />Running Time:  164 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for Rated R for strong graphic violence, some sexual content, nudity and language.<br /><br />"Munich" is, on the whole, a straight forward hit-man movie. The assignments are handed out; the team is assembled, each with their own specialty; and they travel about Europe plotting and carrying out their hits. We have the inevitable paranoia, the double agents and suspicious loyalties. So far, so familiar. Only "Munich" is wrapped in the thin veneer of 'history' and 'fact', and mob bosses and corporate espionage is replaced with Middle Eastern politics and Israeli-Arab relations. I mention this because the politics of "Munich" are really nothing more than a topical plot devise, used the same way as cold-war relations and soviet villainy was used thirty years ago.<br /><br />What should have been an uneventful Olympics in Munich, 1972, became the bloodshed that unfolded like a Moebius strip and unleashed even more blood unto the world. On September 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists killed two Israeli athletes, kidnapped nine more, and asked for safe passage out of Germany and the subsequent liberation of Arab prisoners in Israeli and German prisons. Once at the airport they encountered resistance from the German authorities, and in a scuffle, all of the other nine hostages were killed.  This led to the Israeli government to have the Mossad -- Israel's intelligence agency -- track down and kill every terrorist responsible for the killings. For this they hired one of Golda Meir's bodyguards, known as Avner (Eric Bana), put him in a special ops team, and gave them minimal information about these terrorists. Avner on his own is able to strike back at the "supposed" terrorists via the appearance of a shady Parisian named Louie (Mathieu Almaric), but as the assignments become more and more difficult, he wonders if it is all worth it, and once his own team gets decimated by counter-agents, he wonders if behind every terrorist there is a even more dangerous one just waiting in the wings with ways to get back at him and his family.<br /><br />What prevents 'Munich' becoming just a generic updated-cold-war thriller is the sheer quality of the production. From the flawless recreation of European capitals in the early seventies to the impeccable costume design to the beautiful cinematography - "Munich" is a visually fascinating movie. The performances are universally outstanding, with Bana in particular bringing a sense of tough nobility that seems to be his forte. The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, and it is screenwriter Tony Kushner's focus on the emotional and psychological landscape of his characters rather than the details of political contract killing, that ultimately lifts the movie above the generic. The kind of self-consciously poetic prose for which he is known, so often seeming unrealistically erudite, is kept to a minimum, and when it does appear, is so beautifully written and performed that all reservations are forgotten.  Ultimately, the greatest praise must be reserved for Spielberg, who has, with "Munich", created perhaps the second truly adult movie of his career (the first being the incredible "Schindler's List"). We see no signs of his trademark sentimentality, his descents into fantasy, his childish simplification of motivation. With this film, he embraces ambiguity and complexity, and as a result, has invited criticism from those who prefer their drama simplistically black and white. Above all, one can't help but wonder what the Spielberg oeuvre would look had he not dedicated his career to kid's movies, fantasies and feel-good sci-fi. "Munich" is an intelligent and gripping thriller that was a major contender for award recognition, and deservedly so.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I won't go into the plot since other reviews already describe it accurately, but this movie is emotionally draining in the same tone as Saving Private Ryan.  Eric Bana's best work.  Despite it not winning any of the Oscars it was nominated for, it was definitely a worthy contender for Best Picture.<br /><br />This film gives a very insightful look into the Palestinian/Israeli conflict from the level of the people involved, without the news angle.<br /><br />Not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>When I rented this movie, I thought that it would be about the murders of the Israeli Olympic athletes, an event which I remember with great sadness.  This event does occur in the DVD, but it is right at the beginning and the rest of the movie concerns the attempt on the part of Israel to avenge the murders and to kill those responsible.  The narrative is often confusing, and the movie is full of bloody scenes of murder and mayhem, none of which was very appealing to me.  The point of the movie seems to be that revenge never really works and it only becomes dehumanizing to those who engage in it.  I wish I had not sat through almost three hours of this movie in order to come to that conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's latest movie "Munich" is not to be missed. Based on the book by George Jonas, VENGENCE: THE TRUE STORY OF AN ISRAELI COUNTER-TERRORIST TEAM, it wrestles with the age-old question-- certainly one that U. S. leaders faced after 9/11-- of whether or not nations and individuals, for that matter, have the right to take an eye for an eye or take what they perceive as justice in their own hands without the benefit of a fact-finding tribunal. (The actor who plays Golda Meir says early in the film that "every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.") And what happens if you get the wrong eye, or if the eye is not guilty of this crime but of another just as heinous. And doesn't revenge breed more revenge and where does it all end? These are obviously hard questions. The film looks at both perspectives.<br /><br />Six members of the Israeli secret police set out to hunt down eleven Palestinians who allegedly were responsible for the kidnapping and killing of Israeli athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. (I still remember the sheer horror of watching the events on television and the sad but beautiful funeral music-- I believe it was something by Beethoven -- when the outrageous events occurred.) All the actors give superb performances. Eric Bana as Avner, the leader of the Israeli group is outstanding. He grapples with the morality question as what he is doing as a killer is contrasted with tender scenes with him and his wife and new baby whom he moves to Brooklyn. Daniel Craig and the other actors as just as good so Bana is just first among equals. The plot moves quickly and is convoluted although not impossible to follow. The sheer number of actors is rather staggering.  Tony Kushner of ANGELS IN AMERICA fame was involved in writing the screenplay. This has to be as good as anything Spielberg has ever done.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>I remember this timeline faintly as a wee lad. So for that reason, along with the fact that most of Steven Spielberg's films are good, I decided to see this film.<br /><br />Other than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, one of my all-time favorite war films, MUNICH didn't seem like the typical Spielberg film. No WAR OF THE WORLDS nor dinos here. But an assembly of assassins that one won't soon forget. Set in the early 70's, MUNICH takes one back to when terrorists first started making their appearance on American TV's.<br /><br />Highly political, with intrigues and mysteries of various dark organizations, MUNICH takes you through a labyrinth of dark corridors throughout Europe and stains each one with blood.<br /><br />With a rich ensemble cast, MUNICH is tightly well written, although some may be somewhat lost in the various long histories of the several peoples involved. But the main character, the leader of the assassins, played by The HULK's and TROY's Eric Bana, does a great acting performance here.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in this film. Lots of action and intrigue. But most of all, it makes one look at the heart, perhaps the very root of the problems at several warring factions. If you have nearly 3 hours to kill, then this film is for you.<br /><br />It is an important film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>This film was "inspired by real events" which suggests more fiction than "based on true events". Young men climb over a fence to get to the Olympic village; are they up to no good? Yes, they are the terrorists who captured Israeli athletes as hostages during the 1972 Olympics in Munich. All eleven athletes were murdered. Will the Israeli government act in revenge? The precedent was the Eichmann abduction. The decision is made. A team will be formed to implement the decision. Will they use experienced agents or new men who won't be known? This is the story about the reprisals taken against the "Black September" leaders for the eleven dead.<br /><br />The dinner introduces the men on the team. Avner wants t find the location of some men. [James Madison's picture was on the $5,000 bill, the largest in circulation then.] The first target is a man who does translations. The operation had costs. The TV shows the news. Another target is selected. What did they do to that telephone? The next time they plan a new method for night-time. Will this team go to Beirut? What kind of disguise will they use to attack their new target? There is a strange meeting in the country. [This pads the film.] They find a safe house in Athens with mattresses on the floor. Was there a mix-up? Or a dramatic device? There is a foul-up. The next target is in London. Will there be a mistake?<br /><br />Did Carl trust the wrong person? Is it time for them to move out? They visit a houseboat. Those who were eliminated are just replaced by worse men. One of their team was found on a park bench. They must be more careful now. One man wasn't. There is another failure. Avner returns as if nothing happened. "What did you learn?" Was there a betrayal? What will he do next? Is he being hunted? Was the ending meant to be ironic? Does killing affect the killers psychologically? No therapy mentioned in this story.<br /><br />I remember a scandal when a Palestinian waiter in Sweden was assassinated because he resembled someone who was on the Israeli target list. This is an example of the problem of sanctioned killing: there is no attempt at any trial to determine if the suspect is actually the perpetrator! This film subtly criticizes this operation by showing how the alleged guilty were people whose names were given out for money. This same criticism was made about George W. Bush's policy of abducting people and putting them in prison at Guantanamo Bay.<br />Some of the scenes in this film lack classic good taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>When Tony Kushner sticks to actual events, he's got a fast, thrilling script for Spielberg to work. The trouble is, a fine action movie is saddled with philosophical meanderings. The obviously contrived debate between the Mossad assassin and the PLO guy, the same old hackneyed arguments about what is essentially a land dispute, well, come on, why didn't the PLO guy realize Eric Bana really was a Jew? All the PLO fighters tell you how much they love their Palestine and Allah is their leader. Of course, the barbarity that meets their aims, all praised in heaven. Jews prefer a settled life on Earth be as it may, but there's little peace in the Middle East.<br /><br />I must tell you, The Soprano's or Godfather movies were suggested by the Munich revenge assassinations. The Mossad is so careful not to knock off civilians, too careful perhaps as their foes could care less. Good versus evil, makes for a better story, but not if you're political liberal.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>Munich is a rather interesting film based on the book "Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team," which was written by George Jonas. The author is a Hungarian born, Canadian writer.<br /><br />Out of 14 books he has written, Vengeance is the story of an Israeli operation to assassinate the terrorists responsible for the massacre that took place during the 1972 Olympic games.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg directs the film and the DVD provides a rare interview in which Mr. Spielberg discusses that his movie is not anti-Israel and or pro-Palestinian. This got me curious... and as I researched the background, the interview is intended to dispel the protests of the author, who complained that Munich was a distorted interpretation of his original work.<br /><br />In essence, Jonas said that scriptwriter Tony Kushner, a Jew who has referred to the formation of Israel as a mistake, failed to make a moral distinction between terrorism and legitimate military action.<br /><br />Critics of the book said that Jonas's source for the book; New York security consultant Jubal Aviv had fabricated the story. Reading all these details got us rather curious about the film, which we obtained and finally watched.<br /><br />The production is a thrilling recount of details that were unknown to us. The revenge plot puts forward the fact that when we set out to pay back for sins of the past, innocent people sometimes pay the price. The movie therefore, delves into complex issues of guilt, violence, murder, love, family... honor, and the defense of the right of the people of Israel to have a place they can call home.<br /><br />The reliving of the events that lead and transpired during the kidnapping and murder of the athletes is... horrifying to say the least. Golda Meir is represented in this movie and she has a monologue where she weighs the actions and consequences of what they are about to do that is simply priceless soul-searching view of what any leader must go through as they guide a people or a nation towards survival.<br /><br />The technology used to eliminate those responsible is interesting, the methods are at times careless and dangerous, the people that reveal the whereabouts of those to be killed are interesting, but mercenary and it is with great horror that we realize they provide information to both sides... at a high price, of course, gaining great wealth from all the violence that ensues.<br /><br />From beginning to end, we found ourselves riveted on the screen, learning a lot and feeling that hindsight provides 20-20 vision on rather complex issues that while we are living them... leaves us all blind due to lack of total awareness of the powers at play. Don't miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>As Steven Spielberg states in the opening discussion, only a few things are known for sure.  The Israel Olympians in Munich were killed by terrorists.  People associated with Black September were later killed.<br /><br />How this was done, who did it, and where everything happened was something Steven Spielberg tried to establish for the viewer.  Remember JFK?<br /><br />This is another of those movies that grays the area between fact and fiction, reality and speculation.  I doubt that the team leader of the Israel assassins was so obsessed with the victims at Munich.  In reality, he would probably have been more focused on those he killed, and the families he destroyed.  This is the nature of war, and post-traumatic shock.<br /><br />This was a movie on a gruesome and troubling topic: terrorism and retaliation.  It is sad through and through.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's "Munich" certainly polarized filmgoers; many found Spielberg's film to be anti-Israeli and many others felt it was anti-Arabic. In truth Spielberg didn't take sides and neither did writers Tony Kushner ("Angels in America") and Eric Roth; Spielberg's film is a complex look at the cost of violence and murder. Avener (Eric Bana)and his team of former Mosad members (Daniel Craig the new James Bond, Hans Zischler, Ciaran Hinds and Matheu Kassovitz)discover that the cost of violence is the loss of your soul as they try and track down members of the terrorist group Black September that planned the kidnapping and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Over the course of a year Avner and his men hunt down these men while becoming the hunted as well. It's a riveting thriller with strong performances from the entire cast. Brilliantly directed by Spielberg "Munich" may run about 15 minutes too long but this powerful suspense film never wavers or loses its momentum as it thunders towards its conclusion. For those who claim that "Munich" ripped off its plot from the TV movie "Sword of Gideon" it should be noted that both are based on the same book and the scenes that have the most similarity are those that are drawn from the book.<br /><br />The transfer looks terrific with the subdued colors and fine detail captured in perfectly on disc. While occasional digital flaws come up (such as edge enhancement) they are minor and only crop up on occasion. I'm at a loss as to why Universal and Dreamworks have elected to release this in the same configuration as the "War of the Worlds" DVD late last year. More than likely it's due to reduce the cost of the discs since many retailers offer these big blockbusters as loss leaders to get people into stores and this would allow the studio to create economical versions that won't eat into their profit margins too much.<br /><br />The single disc edition has only a introduction by Steven Spielberg and some trailers as the only extras. The two disc edition although it lacks a commentary track from Spielberg (to date he hasn't done any)does feature a number of interesting featurettes. They don't make up for the lack of a comprehensive documentary on the real event (the best documentary on the Munich assassinations is "One Day in September")or a commentary track by Spielberg and/or the writers who worked on the film but are pretty good overall.<br /><br />"Memories of an Event" presents Spielberg and Kushner recalling their reactions when they heard about what occurred. "Portrait of an Era" provides insight and information about recreating the early 70's for the film. "The On-Set Experience" gives us onset footage of the shooting of the film. "The International Cast", "Editing, Sound and Music" gives us insight into both the casting for the film and why Spielberg went with the choices he did (for example Spielberg had been thinking about Bana after seeing "Hulk") and "Editing, Sound and Music" takes us into the post-production of the film. It was done on an extremely tight schedule because of the predetermined release date and post-production of "War of the Worlds". "The Mission, The Team" focuses on the genesis of the script, Spielberg's interest through production. We also get a collectable booklet with photos and rave review quotes from critics.<br /><br />While the 2 disc edition isn't essential it will be a nice catch for fans of the film and those into the film process. The single disc edition should be fine for most folks. "Munich" isn't an easy film to watch nor does it take political sides. Spielberg recognizes that the killing for any political reason has its consequences and tolls on the human soul.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>After the average SFX thriller, War of the Worlds, Munich is another notch in Steven Spielberg's impressive career. The acting is great all around, especially Eric Bana in a break out role, and the direction is top of the line. The pacing was a little slower than expected and it did drag at times (hence the 4 stars), but overall Munich was an important movie that shows the pros and cons of revenge. I would wait for DVD, but if you have already seen everything out there (like me), this one is worth catching if you got the 3 hours to spare.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Munich is the story about a secret Israeli squad sent out to track down and asassinate 11 targets who were believed responsible for the 1972 killing spree of 11 Israeli athletes during the Olympics by Palestinian terrorists, a group known as Black September.<br /><br /> The Israeli government hires a man named Avner [Eric Bana] to lead a team of 4 away from their families for months, maybe even years till their mission is complete. They will have to sacrifice their own well being as they venture into hostile territory as they track down their targets. At first Avner and his men are relaxed as they think it will be done in a couple of months, however the stress of tracking down their targets start to take a toll on themselves.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush co-stars as Ephraim, the team handler. He sort of just hung around to check on the team's progress and also supplied them the money they needed to bribe people into helping them with their mission. Also in the movie is a paid French informant who supplies the names of the targets but also does not earn the trust of the full team as some question whether he is really helping them or not.<br /><br />The plot takes the team all over the Middle East, even areas such as France and London. There is also a lot of violent images such as brutal execution by the team members on their targets. They also show in flashbacks during the movie how the Israeli athletes were killed by the terrorists which aren't easy to see.<br /><br />However Avner shows a lot of compasion as he sees his new daughter and wife for the first time after being separated for such a long time. I did find some scenes in the movie to drag a bit, but a lot of suspense as the team members prepare to eliminate their next target brought the level up a lot.<br /><br />There aren't many extras on the DVD at all, although you do have the option of choosing to start the movie with a small introduction by Steven Spielberg himself as he talks about the story and how hard a subject it was to touch and make into a movie.<br /><br />Even though the extras section is lacking this is a great movie to see. A lot of suspense and even some sentimental scenes in between make this well worth checking out.<br /><br />Recommended</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>We're a long way from E.T. now. Stephen Spielberg takes a dramatic look at the revenge that (could have?) taken place following the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. While "inspired by actual events," we don't know how much of what we are watching is true and how much is made up - a common problem with today's cinema, as well as today's news media. At the beginning of the film, in the optional intro by Spielberg, he says that certain facts (three to be exact) are indisputable. When a filmmaker or writer starts talking about "indisputable facts," watch out. Regardless of what Spielberg says in his intro, and regardless of the facts, MUNICH is about the vanity of revenge: how there is no end to it because it only spawns more revenge, and reeks havoc on the souls of those involved in it. No wonder God said, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay," and "Turn the other cheek."<br /><br />Eric Bana (Troy) is superb as Avner, who must learn these lessons the hard way. He gives up life with his wife and new baby to travel the world, tracking down the 11 men that he has been led to believe were responsible for the massacres in Munich. He has four others with him, none of which have had any experience as assassins. He has a neutral contact man who sells him leads and equipment, ammo, etc. Together the team rigs telephones, TV's, beds, etc. with bombs, in order to take out their victims. Eventually, the hunters become the hunted, so that Avner, on the brink of despair, ends up sleeping in his closet, afraid that someone may have rigged his own phone, his own TV, his own bed.<br /><br />At one point, Avner has a conversation with a Palestinian who, not realizing that Avner is Jewish, tells him that having a homeland is everything, and that if he understood that, he would have sympathies for the Palestinians rather than for the Israelis. Later, Avner's mother tells him how proud she is of him, because he has helped secure a place on earth for Israel. The irony is overwhelming. Avner himself has no home, no place on earth, because he's a man on the run.<br /><br />In another conversation, Robert protests against all the blood they're spilling for Israel, and tells him, "We're Jews, Avner. We're supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. That's Jewish. That's what I knew, that's what I was taught." God promised Israel a place in heaven if they would follow His Law. Yet, in this movie, they are selling their souls, their "righteousness," for a place on earth: more great irony. There are many spoken and unspoken truths in this film that warrant ferreting out.<br /><br />The imagery in MUNICH is powerful. Avner loves cooking and often finds himself standing in front of a kitchen store, dreaming of the kitchen he may one day have. His contact man has a "pappa" who wants to meet with him, so Avner allows himself to be blindfolded and taken somewhere in the Italian countryside. Although it starts out ominously, it turns out to be a kind of holiday, full of children and sunshine, family and cooking - a stark contrast to the rest of the film. It turns out that Pappa is also a gourmet cook, and together they prepare a meal and develop a type of relationship. Pappa tells him that he and Avner are very much alike, "tragic men, with butcher's hands but gentle souls." As Avner is leaving, Pappa tells him, "You could have been my son...but you're not. Remember that. We'll do business, but you aren't family." Avner realizes that Pappa could just as easily sell his information to the other side as to him, since he has no loyalties. That's when he understands how little his life is worth, and how it can only end badly if he continues with his "mission."<br /><br />There is some wonderful filmmaking in MUNICH. The cinematography is beautiful as well as gritty, John Williams score is powerful, and the script is taut. Across the board, the acting is superb, with Daniel Craig (Steve), Ciaran Hinds (Carl), Mathieu Kassovitz (Robert), Hanns Zischler (Hans) and Moritz Bleibtreu (Andreas) as standouts. Many of the images are disturbing, as this is very much an adult drama, with extreme violence as well as nudity - thus the R rating. It is not a feel good movie, but it is a think deep one.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I remember some of the controversy over Steven Spielberg's newest film entitled "Munich" when it was quietly released to theatres. After finally getting to see it recently, I have to honestly say that "Munich" is an incredibly well-done but ultimately thought-provoking movie and ranks among the most `out of the blue' films of Spielberg's career and yet another home run from him and his crew.<br /><br /> It is the 1972 Summer Olympics in the city of Munich in southeastern Germany. The games go smoothly and joyously until on September 9, a vicious band of terrorists who call themselves the Black September, take eleven Israeli athletes hostage.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Steven Spielburgh's "Munich" is a fearless classic.  He takes the 1972 Olympic slayings of innocent Israeli athletes and recreates the ordeal in all its horrifying detail.  We get some of the footage from ABC's "Wide World of Sports" to create authenticity, but the reinactment has all the immediacy and horror of "Schindler's List" and more.  After the outrage, one of Golda Meier's trusted bodyguards (Eric Bana) is summoned to join a team of assassins meant to seek vengeance on the perpetrators.  The vast majority of the movie focuses on the complexity, the obsession, and the miscalculations that come from this type of counter-terrorism.  The missteps are harrowing.  The most touching scene is when they are set to bomb an assassin at his residence, but they immediately need to stop it when his adorable little daughter unexpectedly reappears.<br /><br />There has been much commentary made about the agenda of this movie.  Despite any stance, Spielburgh has made a relevant movie, a true movie, at a crucial time.  The movie questions the premise of festering violence and its consequences.  It does so through the dialogue without preaching, but mainly through the action which is often horrifying and brimming with suspense.  There are two matching scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end, where the maverick protagonist has an intimate scene with his wife.  It doesn't really give away too much of the movie, but it frames the theme of the film.  He has become a hero to his people for requiting the crimes of the extremists, but it illustrates that he has done so at a high personal price.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>I think movies that delve into modern history to remind us what has happened and why events such as these shouldn't ever be lost to memory have to be my favorite. Munich is this type of film. Though named for the events that happened in 1972 Olympic Games, Munich follows not only what happened to the Israeli athletes but the reciprocation as well. Essentially, it turns into one man's story to fight for a country he believes in as a Jew and an Israeli, yet finds himself horrified by what he and his comrades have done and what they had done to them.<br /><br />What hit me immediately about this film was the attempt Steven Spielberg made to try and keep his film culturally neutral. Though I think he failed, he did make an effort, which I have to appreciate as someone who has very little tolerance for racism. Movies such as this can create a stir, especially when they are as successful as Munich was, and creating a deeper sense of hatred between the two opposing cultures in this movie is something that definitely would have ruined the experience for me. So, though at times he slipped a little, Steven Spielberg did a great job at putting a human in all the roles, and not making monsters out of a culture we don't understand.<br /><br />That leads me to the film itself, which was done to perfection. Steven Spielberg still is the greatest director out there, and shows that yet again with Munich. This is one tense film, starting early and only occasionally giving us breathers. Spielberg also did a lot to make the characters likable, despite the fact that they were political assassins. This movie plays out in stages, starting of course with the actual taking of the hostages in Munich, moving into the political battles of how best to get revenge for the massacre, and finally the undertaking of that revenge. The first two steps pass by rather quickly, and the action and suspense take over in the third step. Here is where the story of Avner begins to unfold, as he leads a group of five assassins--including Avner--who are charged by Golda Mier, the Israeli Prime Minister, to take out the eleven Palestinians who planned the Munich massacre. But as the group begins killing, and they become more and more accustomed to it, things begin to turn bad. Avner must find a way to deal with the hardships of being a family man and an assassin, while also keeping his team together.<br /><br />Though I didn't give this a perfect rating, I still highly recommend this movie to everyone. Steven Spielberg takes his liberties, but all directors do in the end, and this movie never really attempts to be completely truthful. What it does attempt is a possible explanation of closely guarded historical events. And even if you aren't interested in learning, this is still a great action movie filled with lots of suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>This movie was gut wrenching, I had to hold my friends hand a few times. The 1972 Olympics were marked by the assassination of 12 Israeli athletes while the world watched on TV. Munich is what Israel did in response to the trauma. As the film goes on it become more unclear who is right in the struggle. In the end it leaves a question ... hate only begets hate, only love can quash hate. Is that what Spielberg is saying?</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`Munich' starts with a gripping and hauntingly realistic opening sequence about the terrorists attack. The atmospheric film has also some effective moments as thriller, that easily testifies to the fact that Spielberg is one of the greatest storytellers in the world, if not the greatest film director. Still, `Munich' is a failure as thought-provoking drama that it clearly attempts to be.<br /><br />Ethically questionable, but Hollywood (or any other filmmakers) are certainly entitled to making a thriller out of the real-life tragedy, this case about the shocking deaths of the Israeli athletes. However, you cannot make a film which claims `inspired by the real events' with a clich&eacute;d plot device like a mysterious French guy `Louis' who sells information like in a spy novel. The assassination team has virtually no trouble in finding out the targets, which is quite unlikely, and though each set-piece is well-constructed, the discerning eye would spot the hackneyed ideas here and there, which are all insult to the intelligence of the audience.<br /><br />Yes, I know. The film is based on George Jonas book "Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team." As I haven't read the book, I can make no comment on the original source, but judging from the film Spielberg directed, the clandestine team consists of familiar `types' of the characters -- Newly-appointed leader (Eric Bana), trigger happy young male (Daniel Craig), cool and determined veteran (Ciaran Hinds), slightly geeky bomb maker (Mathieu Kassovitz), etc. Luckily the superb acting from the supports (not the lead) such as Ciaran Hinds and Hanns Zischler saves the film's main characters from stereotypes.<br /><br />As to Eric Bana, though he is no doubt a very talented actor, he was disappointing. Eric Bana plays Avner the leader of the team, who has a pregnant wife at home. I would choose a single, unmarried male for doing such a very dangerous job like assassination, but Spielberg must have thought otherwise. Anyway, Bana's Avner is only a boring presence beside the more authentic and nuanced acting from Hines and Geoffrey Rush, and Avner's changing attitudes to the cause of the mission and his identity are barely credible but predictable.<br /><br />I know some people (who noticed the WTC in the film's New York scenes) argue that the subject matter of terrorism and revenge is very immediate to us. I agree. But still I firmly believe that it is hard for that immediacy to co-exist with the film's entertainment value as thriller which is considerable. Now I come back to the film's great opening and three flashbacks showing what happened to the victims, of which effects are just terrifying because we know the terrible accounts are true. However, for all the insistence to the realism of Spielberg, the following story about the counter-terrorism team lacks the authentic voice of them.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>It was much to bear to watch the eleven Israeli athletes of the 1972 Olympic Games slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, just as they had primed their young bodies and minds to a state of physical strength and endurance in Stephen Spielberg's, "Munich", but the carnage doesn't stop there, and if you brace yourself for the awful scenes of the athlete's assassinations, you still have to endure the slow death walk and gurgling bleed of a half naked enemy spy prostitute, and other agonizing deaths which possess a morbid fascination, the kind teenagers in the horror flick audience would find, "cool", and "awesome". It's often a Night of The Very Nearly Living Dead, as gunshot victims momentarily carry out their final acts, as if unaware of bullet holes through their foreheads and chests, until blood protrudes from them like ketchup released from a stuck bottle. Why this fascination with gore, is beyond me. Maybe it serves as companion to the horrific details of the film's inspiration, suggesting the expectations and perpetual motion of the Istraeli athletes were snuffed like a spent Olympian torch.<br /><br />It's a difficult film, given it's "inspired by true events" lead-in. With a free hand to examine the Munich execututions, Spielberg delivers an assured sense of actuality in depicting the State of Israel, seeking revenge against, as opposed to overwhelming, terrorism, and in finding the revenge seeking, justice fighters greatly outclassed in the world of high end spies and assassins. Their secret mission is exposed a number of times due to emotion level tactics, they fall prey to an obvious, seductive counter-assassin, they harbor a mole, and offer outragous sums of money to contacts for information. They mostly 'get their man', so to speak, but we could have told them the cost of terrorism is more terrorism.<br /><br />Without the historic events, "Munich" would make a fantastic espionage thriller. In detailing the history with a flair for the sensational, Spielberg has given us a cloudy, but forceful impression of the Munich assassinatiions, leaving us with the suggestion that all is not well in the course of history. As The World Trade Center towers in the New York City skyline via trick photography near film's end, Spielberg tells us, history will repeat itself. His film's main objective is the conclusion that America did not do enough to support Israel's sense of justice regarding the Munich assassinations.<br /><br />Anyway you look at it, it's a film that shouldn't be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I was aware of the plot of this ambitious Steven Spielberg film.  It's based on the real drama of the assassination of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  What followed was revenge killings secretly supported by the Israeli government of the 11 known Palestinian assassins.  This aftermath is what this film is about.<br /><br />And so there is international intrigue and bloodshed and lots of money being changed hands for information.  What's never clear, however, is how the informants got the information.  Lots of other important details were never clear either.  And as we are watching the bumbling of the assassinations, the compromise the assassins had to make and the possibility of some of the wrong people being murdered, the whole film played out as a discourse on the morality of it all.  This took almost three hours and I must say that I found myself glancing at my watch.<br /><br />Eric Bana was cast as the team leader of the five Israelis sent on this mission.  He's a good actor and did a fine job as did most of the cast.  But with the exception of the actor cast as the bomb maker, none of them looked Jewish, leading to a loss of authenticity.  Also, as far as authenticity goes, if a film is set in an international venue, I expect the languages spoken to reflect that.  Yes, there were a few subtitles here and there, but mostly all the actors spoke English.  Some of this made me wince.  I was also surprised to see that not one scene was shot in Israel.<br /><br />I understood the moral choices early on.  After that it was just scene after scene of one kind of compromise after another.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I think there is a time and a place and a reason to debate the consequences of violence begetting violence.  This is the stuff of Talmudic discourses.  However, I'm not sure if this film succeeded in this mission.  We saw a lot of bombs exploding, gunshot wounds, and people being hurt.  And at the end of the film we knew that the hero would never be free of fear of reprisals.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile film.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  And yet it lacks so much that I hesitate to recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>In the years after the terrorist attack on Israeli team members during the 1972 Munich Olympics, Avner (Eric Bana) leads a crew of Mossad agents as they attempt to hunt down and assassinate eleven of the Palestinians allegedly responsible... This should have been wonderful: a great historical story and a master director and his usual crew to tell it. Apart from making achingly obvious points about the pointlessness of tit-for-tat retaliation between Israelis and Palestinians, the screenplay helpfully eschews most of the politics and instead makes this a human story: it's an exploration of the immense personal cost of the politics of revenge for those ordered to exact it. At least, it tries to be that. As the story of a man who comes to question the morality of politically-justified murder, it should have been incredibly moving. As it turns out, it's incredibly dull. It's too long, too sprawling, too unfocused. It felt like a rough cut with 45 minutes still to come out. The all-important interpersonal scenes are badly written, and only one or two of the action sequences are up to Spielberg's standard. Janusz Kaminski's usually wonderful cinematography aims for realism but verges on ugly and banal. John Williams' music is, for the first time ever, utterly forgettable. Also, for once in their collective career, Spielberg and Michael Kahn have made a complete mess of the editing. Lapses in continuity abound. Intercutting the events from Munich with the story-proper probably looked good on paper, but in the viewing it feels discontinuous, pointless and even a little gratuitous - never more so than when the violent climax of the terrorist raid is intercut with a sex scene, presumably as a way of showing the psychological impact of the events on Avner's relationship with his wife. Pity he never witnessed them. The horrific nature of what happened might have been more usefully deployed at the start of the film as a way of encouraging the audience to share the Israelis' outrage. The casting didn't work for me - Geoffrey Rush, especially. What is it with Oscar-winners and bit parts? Does Spielberg really need a marquee name other than his own to open a movie? Is there no Jewish actor who could've more capably played Ephraim? I found Bana quite empathetic but only intermittently convincing. Perhaps it's my inability, as an Australian, finally to divorce Eric Bana the aspiring A-list Hollywood actor from Eric Bana the A-list local stand-up comic. Or perhaps it's just that he was a little better at the latter: as a movie star, he occasionally suffers from the same kind of woodenness that afflicts Spielberg's favourite leading man, Harrison Ford. But I guess there are worse comparisons. I wanted to like this film, but ultimately found it incredibly disappointing. The inner battle between the emotional impulse for violent justice and the rational desire to break the cycle of violence is the crux of the film, but it simply doesn't sustain intellectual interest on that level. The issue is explored in a far too obvious and superficial manner for it ever to really work.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"Munich," Steven Spielberg's depiction of the 1972 Olympic massacre and its aftermath, is as perfect as a movie gets. Intelligent, realistic, engaging, well-acted, well-directed and well-written (by Eric Roth and "Angels in America" playwright Tony Kushner), it has "Oscar" written all over it.<br /><br />The movie centers on the work of a secret Mossad assassination squad, tasked with killing the architects of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the '72 Olympic Games. The team is a varied lot - young and old, hot and cold-blooded, who share the common task of saving Israel by striking back at its enemies. Along the way, the team must negotiate with others' whose identities and loyalties are questionable at best. Can even the Mossad be trusted to give the team accurate information? Can information merchants Louis and his "Papa," who supply the team with leads, be trusted? Or are they playing the team against it other "clients" - playing both ends against the middle?<br /><br />"Munich" is realistically and appropriately gory, if that makes any sense. Explosives blow people to pieces. Guns of various caliber do their killing work in a variety of believable ways. Gunfights are messy, loud and confusing. And unlike some of Spielberg's other work, the special effects don't get in the way of the story. Thankfully!<br /><br />"Munich" also delves into the personal lives and motivations of the team. Defending one's country takes a psychic toll, which is presented here with pathos. Team leader Avram (sensitively played by Eric Bana), himself the son of a soul-wounded hero, wrestles not only with life and death decisions, but about their morality. When is it right to kill? Is vengeance a good enough motive? What if morally-defensible killing achieves no worthwhile end? And what if one's enemies have good reasons of their own for fighting? The scene in which Avram confronts a PLO commando underlines the moral complexity of fighting a war in which both sides have legitimate grievances and both want the same end: peace for their children. These questions are a sub-current to the action that gives it extra depth.<br /><br />Along with millions of others, I watched the 1972 Munich massacre unfold on ABC television, between footraces, javelin throws and pole vaulting. Archival footage is combined with movie footage, helping the viewer understand what transpired both before the cameras and out of sight. Some of the old familiar faces and voices- Jim Mackay and Peter Jennings-give the film historical resonance for those old enough to have watched it first hand. Probably because of a lack of film footage, the outcome and aftermath of the massacre have never received the attention that the hostage story did. While this film doesn't dwell on the death of the Israeli athletes in great detail, the story it does tell provides another compelling cinematic layer.<br /><br />"Munich" is an incredible film, and it deserves every award it will receive.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Munich is almost boring.  This movie drags and is far too long.  Steven Spielberg allowed his left wing ideology get in the way of the story.  He seemingly wanted to make sure that we left the theater believing that both sides are equally guilty in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  Radical leftist Tony Kushner, who believes that Israel should have never came into existence, wrote the screen play.  Both gentlemen obviously perceive the Palestinians as alleged victims of Israeli imperialism.  The murders which took place during the Olympic games in 1972 are therefore somewhat understandable.<br /><br />The very first thing you must remember about Munich is that it is not even remotely true.  Israel did indeed send assassins to kill the Palestinians responsible for the massacre---but they were not existentially guilt tripped.  None of those who actually participated in this pursuit of justified vengeance resemble the fictional Avner (Eric Bana) and his group of misfits.  We follow the latter throughout Europe and Beirut as they one by one assassinate those on the hit list provided by the Mossad.  There is one peculiar scene when the Israelis and a group of Palestinians spend the night together.  They do not sing Kumbaya.  Still, their interactions supposedly suggest that the world would be a wonderful place if only we learned to communicate better with each other.  Terrorists only need a little love and understanding.  Moreover,  employing violent methods to eradicate terrorism will make things far worse.  The cycle of violence must stop.  Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth.  Violence often accomplishes some wonderful things.  If nothing else, it's how we ended WW II.  Also, please note that regular police officers do not stop arresting criminals merely because crime does not totally disappear.  Is Munich a pacifist film?  No, it's far worse than that: it is an indulgence in nihilism.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>I can see why Mossad broke cover and took part in two post-Munich documentaries, the second of which I watched the night before seeing 'Munich'. Professional pride was at stake after the angst ridden, Keystone Cops portrayal given here. Not saying Mossad's rebuttal should be taken as gospel and Spielberg 'trusts his sources' apparently. However, I'm not convinced by his film.<br /><br />In the documentary, the elevator assassins ask their target for his name and shoot him quickly using silencers. In 'Munich', they come across as bumbling amateurs. Another agent shows up after they've departed to look for shell casings, inexplicably exposing himself to possible arrest through his enigmatically slow lingering. But hey, doesn't enigmatically slow lingering look cinematic? The team doesn't hire an explosives expert, that would be too vulgar a display of professional competence. They take his word for it instead. No checking of backgrounds in Mossad it appears. This elite team will foolishly run back into a building to salvage a botched job rather than walk away. Curiously, the writer chooses to ignores facts about the Beruit raid concerning the loss of the element of surprise. Instead, he prefers to make up no end of far fetched mistakes.<br /><br />'Munich' smacks of a writer constantly puting his own sentiments into the mouths of people least likely to have expressed such reservations. The most a real life Mossad assassin would admit to in the documentary is deliberatly avoiding sentimentality by not seeing his gun-downed target as a family man. Instead, he concentrated on his orders and trusted his bosses judgement implicitly. In a scene of stunning crassness in 'Munich', the paranoid lead agent strips his room looking for Israeli type assassination tactics and then goes to hide in his closet just as he had been told his enemy had been driven to. But why does he think tactics unique to Israeli intelligence would be used against him? Do I smell agenda? But to make sure we really get it, team Spielberg has the agent look like an x-ray during debriefing back in Israel. He's a ghost, get it. Haunting himself because of what the state has made him do. No wonder the real life Israeli intelligence community is feeling more than a little miffed.<br /><br />The Americans don't come out of the picture smelling of roses either, surprise, surprise. In the documentary I saw, the CIA opperative who handled a key PLO leader Mossad wanted to assassinate over Munich at least expressed sentiments sympathetic to the Israeli position. In the film, the CIA are portrayed as positely anti-Semitic, giving the Mossad team the proverbial one fingered salute.<br /><br />I noticed that the writer had the Munich atheletes fight back against the terrorists, one even bravely climbing back into the window to tackle the bad guys single handedly with a knife versus assault rifles. Wishful thinking as an answer to events in World War Two? Or is the writer suggesting that the individual is entitled to fight back, but state sponsored assassination is a no-no? The message I took from the final scene was that Israel is a false construct that will turn Jew against Jew, a scurrilous piece of anti-Zionist muck raking that no doubt will find its constituency.<br /><br />Why not keep to the facts? The real life botched killing of an innocent man that ended with the incarceration of a Mossad hit squad should have said plenty about the evils of violating international law. Instead we are offered indigestible hand ringing platitudes unconvincingly delivered by all and sundry.<br /><br />Technically, I wish Spielberg would dump this cinematographer he seems to be using of late. Gloomy bluey grey washed out vistas with ghosting, especially against light sources. Enough.<br /><br />Sorry, Steve. I went to bat for you over War of the Worlds, but I can't defend this clunker. Even Oliver Stone might blanche at this revionist claptrap.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>MUNICH is a powder keg.  It is a film that is so steeped in controversy not because of its content, but because of who made it.  The most famous director in Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, has crafted a film that is so brave not because of its content but because of its point of view.  This film is about Israel and it's ongoing conflict with the people of Palestine, and it doesn't paint a pretty picture of anyone involved.<br /><br />In 1972 thousands of athletes and spectators poured into Munich to celebrate and compete in another Olympics.  All was well until 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by a terrorist faction called Black September.  All 11 men were killed.  In its aftermath the Israeli government hired five Mosad agents to go undercover and kill the 11 men who were responsible.<br /><br />The film follows Avner (Eric Banner) the leader of this group on his mission to get revenge for the Munich Olympics. Avner is a regular guy placed in a position that at first seems justifiable.  But as the body count gets higher and he finds himself justifying more and more killings, we the audience are left wondering if the ends really do justify the means.  Were the Black September terrorists really evil and uncaring or were they men without voices trying to make somebody listen?  Is revenge really the best weapon?  Does killing those responsible end the real violence? MUNICH poses questions and leaves the audience to sort out the answers.<br /><br />MUNICH is not a film about the battle between good and evil.  It's a film about evil fighting an  even worse evil.  It's about human futility and about how vengeance doesn't solve a problem it only makes it worse.  It's about corrupt Nationalism and corrupt ideals  that turn good people into monsters and the corrupt governments that penalize the monsters they've created.  But at the heart its about the regular guys who are fighting turf wars with regular guys and how given the right circumstances we all have the potential to do evil masquerading as good.<br /><br />And yet trying to nail down the intentions of Munich is quite difficult.  You certainly can't cheer Avner.  He's no hero, but you also can't fault him for his outrage.  His countrymen were killed senselessly, why shouldn't his people retaliate?  Why shouldn't the terrorists pay for their sins?<br /><br />The major flaw and yet its strongest attribute it that it fails to take a side.  It fails to define just what evil is.  It allows the audience to watch from a distance and doesn't attempt to drown the audience in political correctness.  But can these warring factions both be right?  Is there ever an end?  Where does America fit into the story?  Does America's support of the state of Israel make us culpable?  The film shies away from those answers (except in the final shot that speaks far more than any in this film).  Is that a good thing? I don't really know, what I do know is that this is the kind of film that will put people on both sides of the Israel/Palestine conflict on the defensive.  If you think strongly one way or the other MUNICH will anger you.<br /><br />I applaud Spielberg for the brave choice of choosing an Israeli as the focal point of the story.  If this had been about the Palestinians it would have been so easy (at least for me) to accept the Arab people as the villain and the Jewish people as victims.  But at the end aren't both sides Victim's of each others misguided Nationalism? It's easy to paint terrorists as the evil party.  But good and evil are never black and white and sometimes bad things happen on both sides.  But revenge never gets us anywhere, and Munich shows us characters that are so normal becoming Monsters.  They may be justified in their anger but are not helping the situation.  This is a bold position to take.<br /><br />MUNICH is not a black and white film and it should be dissected.  IT should be discussed and it should be a lesson to those who see the issues of Israel's right to exist, not as a black and white thing but as a problem that will only go away when both parties wake up and take responsibility for their hate and anger.  The ongoing tensions in the middle east will not be solved by American guns but by the people of the middle east putting down the guns and asking for forgiveness from each other.  Would that ever happen?  Will the fighting ever end?  Not until someone can fix the darkness in every human heart.<br /><br />Post-script: After writing this review I must say that the film MUNICH is inspired by actual events and that my comment are not meant to be skewed either right or left.  The current problems in the Middle East are numerous and complicated and I myself only know very little.  The above review are my thoughts after viewing the film MUNICH and not on the people of ISRAEL and/or PALESTINE.  I believe they both have a right to exist and be defended, and I pray for peace in that region.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"Munich" is a thoroughly engrossing film.  It is a thoughtful production with great performances by Eric Bana in the lead role as Avner, Geoffrey Rush as his handler, Efraim, and Lynne Cohen as Golda Meir.  Bana's effort alone is worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />Yet what distinguishes this film from the usual thriller is its ambiguities.  Killing the bad guy is more than just a few gun shots and the matter is solved.  Avner leads a team killers seeking retribution from the brains of the Munich tragedy.  He is determined to fulfil his task but this doesn't stop him from having doubts.  In short, the man has scruples.<br /><br />In the US, many have criticised this ambiguity.  However, rather than seeing it as a weakness, I regard it as part of the film's strength.  All killings must involve doubt.  It is a particularly ruthless person who could behave otherwise.  Steven Spielberg has done the world a service by showing that events are rarely black and white.  Shades of grey are inevitable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I missed "Munich" when it was originally released but I recall the reviews at the time.  As I understood it, "Munich" was criticized for being too "soft" on the Palistinians.  After watching it last night, I understand that criticism somewhat but that isn't my criticism of the film.<br /><br />I was 20 at the time of the horrible event at the Munich Olympics and I am surprized as to how little I knew about the details.  I discovered how limited my knowledge was when I watched the excellent documentary "One Day in September".  That film was electrifying and it was the unanticipated standard that emerged as I was watching "Munich".  I was put on guard with the opening note "Based on an actual event" (or words to that effect).  What could be more rivitting than the actual events?  Well, not "Munich" as it turned out.  I did not play Spielburg's introduction to the film so maybe there was something in that which could have assuaged my concerns.  Nonetheless, I took heart in realizing that this movie would be about the ruthless and systematic search and destruction of the group that plotted the outrageous act.  That went well until I started questioning who, what and WHY was there a family that, for a price, did all the search and location of the enemy participants.  I realized right away that this had to be a fictionalized short cut that denied us the greater appreciation as to how the "good guys" were able to locate the "bad guys".  I assumed, with disappointment, that it was an effort to save time on the already lengthy script.  It bothered me and I couldn't let it go.  It may have served in a symbolic way although I didn't get a point worthy of its' inclusion.  It did give us a perspective, in time, of the hunters becoming the hunted.<br /><br />Ultimately, the message I got from "Munich" was that violence is its' own reward.  The individual in charge of the actual search and destruction metamorphs into a very troubled individual.  The overall theme that I found is that hate met with revenge reproduces itself endlessly until a new dirrection is introduced.  Tell that to the Israeli's who don't have many options to safely experiment with.  There were elements of world-wide politics that were introduced to the movies and many might have caught some conspiritorial meaning in those allusions.  However, I was immune to that since that French family of missing person brokers convinced me it was all fiction anyway.  If you thought that "Munich" was interesting from an historical perspective, be sure and get the better (and more dramatic) reality from "One Day in September".</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A movie that captures perhaps better than any other the weariness of being an assassin far from home, Munich sometimes feels too long (especially during the scenes in America) and ends inconclusively, but supplies so much good material that I can recommend it without reluctance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>The subject is so heavy and Speilberg does nothing to make it lighter. Did this really happen this way? Evidently, reality was pretty close, though we don't know for sure because the Israeli hit squad has never been acknowledged, has it? A docudrama about an episode that's still hard to believe happened so many years ago.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>...at least, that's the premise of Spielberg's latest film, Munich.<br /><br />I went with with a friend to see the movie yesterday afternoon, in Palo Alto.<br /><br />The film opens with the terrorist attack upon the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. Palestinean terrorists seize a number of Israeli athletes, some of whom are killed in the initial attack, others who are killed at the airport at the attempted getaway.<br /><br />It's the aftermath that the movie portrays. Israeli leadership calls itself to action, and sends an off-the-books assassination squad after those responsible for the attack. Their activities are restricted to terrorists located in Europe.<br /><br />  Ephraim: We have 11 Palestinian names, each one of them had a hand in planning Munich. We want them all dead.<br /><br />Eric Bana plays the leader of the squad (Avner). He and his team proceed down the path of righteous retribution, with the best of intentions. But, they question their way down the path more and more as time goes along.<br /><br />  Carl: It's strange, to think of oneself as an assassin.<br /><br />  Avner: Think of yourself as something else then.<br /><br />The men are to only hit the men responsible for the attacks, and avoid collateral damage, and they take this seriously, panicking when children or newlyweds stumble into the line of fire. They can also sense that, mostly off-screen, the terrorist organization they hunt is retaliating.<br /><br />In the end, when their hunt is called off, Bana finds himself a changed man. A family man, even more important to him than being an Israeli, he comes home to his wife and child, and cannot shake the sense of paranoia that has become a part of him, due to the task he'd had, and he questions the success his handlers tell him he's achieved. Terrorism has continued, actually gotten worse, with new leaders springing up in place of the fallen.<br /><br />It's an ambivalent ending...no answers are given. Why should there be? We, out here in the real world clearly don't have them.<br /><br />It's a well-executed film. Spielberg's brought his A-game to this project. In many ways, the film feels minimalist, but that's because of the squad's single-minded purpose. The film was shot on location in Paris (near the Bir-Hakeim Bridge), Hungary, Malta, and New York City, with a good effort put into making the scenery have the feel of the mid-1970s. The cast is superb, with Eric Bana leading the way. The violence is graphic, brutal, and believable.<br /><br />It's a film designed to make you think. I'd recommend y'all go see it, and think about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Attempting to understand what drives people to kill other people for any reason is, in the pit of the soul, a challenging enigma.  Whether that 'reason' is war between countries at odds, protecting one's self when endangered, revenge or vengeance for deeds perpetrated by 'the other', for panic in the moment of survival - each of these feels wrong despite the fundamental belief to the contrary at the moment of killing.  MUNICH is about killing, about vengeance, about protection of 'home', about existence in a world so bifurcated by age-old schisms, and about us.  And while absorbing all of the 2 1/2 hour plus visual and philosophical information put forth in this epic film, the viewer is so paralyzed by the story that blinking for a second seems irreverent.<br /><br />The tragedy of the 1972 Olympics - the brutal kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes by masked Arab/Palestinian marauders - is brought to the screen with brave and gutsy realism by a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth based on George Jonas' book Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, directed with straightforward, no-nonsense sensitivity to all participants by Steven Spielberg, and brought to life by a cast that simply could not be finer.  From the opening of the film sans credits with the Black September act of breaking into the Olympic games in Munich, the film moves swiftly through the formation of an anti-terrorist league of Israeli assassins whose job it is to hunt down the killers and murder them, to the final painfully unsettled end.  This is all under the instruction and guidance of Golda Meir (brilliantly played by Lynn Cohen) and her advisors.<br /><br />The team of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler), and Mossad Accountant (Oded Teomi) are instructed by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) and stripped of their identities to enter this mission.  They roam the world based on information purchased from a secret group led by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and Papa (Michael Lonsdale).  Gradually growing into the roles of assassins the group begins to murder each of the perpetrators until their success is noticed by all manner of secret agencies (including the American CIA) and the tables are turned: the lives of the Israeli assassins are as endangered as those of the Arab murderers.  In a particularly touching moment in the dark, Avner and a Palestinian soldier debate the need for the state of Israel and the opposite need for holding onto home by the Palestinian: it is a moment of writing that sums up the entire Israeli conflict.<br /><br />The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and the music score by the always fine John Williams add dimensions of atmosphere to this dark film, but it is Spielberg doing what he does best in directing attention to moments in history that will never be buried that makes this phenomenal movie an emotional experience for everyone, no matter their political or religious beliefs.  It is simply a brilliant film about the need for Home - that sacred place whether internal or external that maintains the reason to live and even to die for it.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, May 06</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Munich" is a fictionalized account of a secret Israeli mission to assassinate key leaders of the Palestinian Black September faction that was responsible for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany. The film is based on the 1984 book "Vengeance" by George Jonas in which a former Israeli Mossad agent claiming to have been the leader of a squad that killed 7 Black September targets told his story. Mossad has never confirmed the story, and Jonas admits that it is impossible to know how much his source may have exaggerated, but director Steven Spielberg tracked the ex-Mossad agent down and was apparently satisfied that the gist of the story is true. The dialogue and characterizations are fictionalized for the movie, however, which makes me wonder why Spielberg cared so much about veracity.  "Munich" claims only to have been "inspired by real events", and that should be taken literally. Though these assassinations did take place, "Munich" alters motives and personalities so thoroughly to suit its themes that the film is essentially fiction.<br /><br />After the world watches in horror as 11 Israeli hostages die at the hands of a group of Palestinians who had tried to use them to win the freedom of 200 imprisoned compatriots, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) decides that Israel should show its strength and avenge the deaths of its citizens. A Mossad security officer named Avner (Eric Bana) is assigned a team of 4 men, provided with a clandestine method of receiving funds, and given a list of 11 Palestinians living in Europe who are targets for assassination. The team is set adrift to carry out its mission, officially unacknowledged by Mossad. They move from nation to nation tracking down the targets, killing them, preferably with bombs, frequently turning to a mysterious information dealer (Mathieu Amalric) to locate the men on their list. But the violent deaths of prominent Palestinians in Europe doesn't go unnoticed. Anti-Israeli violence escalates, and the hunters become the hunted.<br /><br />George Jonas hates "Munich", because he feels that Spielberg fails to distinguish between terrorism and counterterrorism. Palestinians may object to the implication that Mossad meted out justice to those who planned the Munich debacle, when actually the targets were prominent members of Black September who may or may not have had anything to do with Munich. The assassinations were intended to serve as a deterrent to future violence against Israelis. Steven Spielberg has said that his intention in "Munich" is to highlight the dilemmas and issues incumbent in fighting violence with violence, not to oppose that approach, but to caution that it is easy to get a bad result. He has invented conversations and radically altered personalities to that end which, unfortunately, leave Avner and his comrades without a shred of credibility. Avner is portrayed as a man nearly paralyzed by a crisis of conscience. His team members are contrived to represent different aspects of his conflicted psyche. But assassins do not have crises of conscience. They believe unfailing in what they do. The conversations that these men have reflect the internal dialogues of the filmmakers. But Mossad agents are not liberal Hollywood intellectuals. They don't think like that.<br /><br />The characters aren't credible, and therefore the film isn't either. Avner's behavior doesn't even make sense within the context of the plot. He is the flakiest assassin ever. "Munich" is not so much morally ambiguous, even-handed, or provocative as it is simply muddy. It's so ineffective that Spielberg needed to explain his ideas in an introduction on the DVD. As to the film's relevance to anti-American terrorism today, it doesn't have any. Black September was a secular organization in a land dispute, much like the IRA, FLN, or Chechen separatists. Its leadership were educated, liberal, and pro-Western. Al-Qaeda are religious fanatics with no specific grievance and nothing to lose. Palestinians will think "Munich" gives the Israelis too much credit for scruples. Israelis will think that it posits a moral dilemma where none existed. The fact that "Munich" doesn't please either party doesn't make it a good film. Speilberg's ideas may be worth considering. But putting equivocation and moral anguish into the mouths of professional assassins is a lazy, unconvincing way to convey those ideas.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): There is an optional introduction by director Steven Spielberg (4 1/2 min) in which he talks about developing the film from the book "Vengeance", what parts of the story are indisputable, and his intentions with the film. Subtitles are available in English, SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French. German and Arabic dialogue is subtitled by default, but the white subtitles are difficult to read. DVS (Descriptive Video Service) is available to describe the film's visual elements for the visually impaired.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>What could you expect from a two and a half-hour picture based on actual events and telling about Israeli government avenging their olympic team members killed by palestinian terrorists during Munich Olympic Games of 1972? Well, not a breathtaking, action-packed thriller, that's for sure. I thought it would be long, boring, didactic and over the top pompous. Even the presence of Steven Spielberg's name in the credits couldn't inspire me. Now I'm glad I was wrong on all counts. Yes, it was long, but of that kind when you wish a film had never ended. It's neither boring nor didactic nor pretentious.<br /><br />Young Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) is given a task to eliminate the members of "Black September" terrorist organization with the help of a group of fellow agents. And that's what they do during two hours and a half of the screen time - locating and killing Palestinian terrorists one by one. "Munich" could become one of the many political thrillers about confrontation of different countries' intelligence services. It could raise some serious questions of historical importance and be overly-political. But Spielberg did an amazing thing with this global story - he transferred it to the personal level. So this story turned out to be not about countries, governments and intelligence services but about ordinary men. A country's vengeance was laid upon one man's shoulders, and that's how we see it - through his eyes. Along with him we will question the righteousness of his task, we will doubt, we'll see how a revenge appears to be ineffective and reasonless (as it always happens) especially if it's a revenge in a global scale: terrorism is like hydra - you cut one head off and two more emerge in it's place. We see how Avner who dedicated his work and his life to the country he loved ends up feeling useless and knowing that from now on his life is in danger. Furthermore he understands that for the sake of some illusive goal he put at risk the lives of his loved ones - his wife and child. "Munich" is the story of another zealous man who was grinded by the millstones of big politics and governmental interests. And finally this story leads to an eternal conclusion that you can't beat violence with more violence. You can deteriorate everything, unleash something you couldn't imagine in your worst nightmares, but you can't defeat violence doing the killings yourself.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg demonstrated his immense talent again taking this epic and well-known story, drawing some ordinary people out of it and still making grand and philosophical conclusions.<br /><br />Great film - awesome acting performances, brilliant cinematography (as always by Janusz Kaminski), interesting subject, entertaining yet thoughtful story-line, clear message which is at the same time not obsessive or annoying - prime Spielberg I'd say. Definately one of the best pictires of the last year undeservingly unmarked by the Academy award.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>I have to give the director, producers, actors, and screen writers credit for taking on an ambitious project that is destined not to please everyone. There are both strengths and weaknesses to the film.<br /><br />First, the strengths, of which there are many. The film does a relatively admirable job of portraying historic events, while maintaining the pace of an action thriller, while integrating thoughtful dialogue regarding the cyclic nature of revenge. The events at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich were shocking and stunned the world. The Black Sunday group, associated with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, conduct a kidnapping and mass murder in front of the entire world. The film does an exceptional job of capturing this horrific series of events. The film also does an admirable job of capturing the political dialogue between Golda Meir and her cabinet after the events. The cast is exceptional with Eric Bana playing Avner, the assassin, with considerable depth and skill. Bana's performance was superb. Avner is joined by a team of collegues who help him track down 9 of the 11 terrorists or those who planned the event. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Ephraim, the team's only contact with the Israelis. Daniel Craig as Steve and Ciaran Hinds as Carl are outstanding. The French informant, Louis, played by the French actor Mathieu Amalric, is great. The dialogue is excellent, much of it written by the very talented Tony Kushner. It is the dialogue that is interwoven with the action sequences that pushes the film to a higher motive. The scene where Eric Bana, acting as if he is a German, dialogues with a young Palestinian about the claiming of Israel by both the Jews and the Palestinians. Of course this is no James Bond thriller where everything goes as planned. In fact, nothing really goes as planned  and it is the unexpected that gives the film tension. However the most outstanding change in plot occurs when the team realizes that they may be the hunters but someone is hunting them!<br /><br />There were two issues that kept me from giving the film 5 stars. First, the writers decided not to get into a messy group of hundreds of informers and contacts and instead decided to write the story as if some French underground family supplied the team the names, addresses, and iteneraries of all the major PLO terrorist leadership. Whereas this certainly simplified the story, it certainly seems beyond belief. It appeared to be a literary license the screen writers took to cover up hundreds of persons who were involved in this series of revenge killings across Europe. My second criticism is the flashbacks that Avner has throughout the film of the actual events in Munich. Whereas this worked well to continually remind the viewer of the reasons this team is hunting down the PLO planners, leaders, and soldiers; it reached the point of overkill when Avner flashes back to the final minutes where the athletes were killed in the two  helicopters. Avner has this flashback while having intercourse with his wife so that the moment of death for the Israeli athletes corresponds with Avner's orgasm. What is the point here? I interpreted this that despite the murder of Jews, they will continue to thrive, defend themselves, and will successfully survive on this earth despite the hatred and prejudice.<br /><br />At 2 hours and 44 minutes, it is a long film, but will keep you engaged every second!</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg could have made a film about the vengeance sought and claimed by Israel for the kidnapping/murder of 11 of their Olympic athletes wherein the avengers are implacable, remorseless, stalwart and unaffected by their actions, and their quarry could have been one dimensional comic book villains with scarves and snarls, and each killing a glorified and audience- pleasing vicarious thrill.  In short, he could have made a Chuck Norris movie.<br /><br />But Spielberg was after something different, a film that is not only a tense thriller, but also explores more fully dimensional characters and what the effects of this type of violence has on the participants. Going beyond a simple revenge plot shoot-em-up required courage and I applaud that.  But delving deeper has the result of making more obvious the strengths and weaknesses of such an exercise.<br /><br />Surely it is no stretch of the imagination to believe that the men carrying out such a mission, which by its nature must be cold-blooded, would be affected by their actions over time.  They are being good soldiers, true, but this is off the battlefield, and by definition does not allow passion and fervor to rule.  Believing or even knowing your actions are righteous, to carry out executions in the form of calculated murder would wear on any men, lest they be monsters.<br /><br />The greatest strength of the film is in depicting the difficulty faced by some of the team in doing close-up, face-to-face killing.  Spielberg shows us the nasty, brutal horror of violent death, even when "deserved".  There are no Rambo-like happy explosions or shootings.  Human beings are being killed, and even if they are bad and guilty of their own heinous crimes, their deaths aren't pretty.  Even when the act seems justified, neither his characters nor we, the audience, are allowed to bask in self-righteousness about the sordid death of another bad player.  It just isn't that simple.<br /><br />But having raised the question about the consequences of setting out on a path of well-motivated vengeance and the cycle of violence it may engender, Spielberg runs into trouble providing any alternatives or answers.  What else could Israel have done?  Ignore the murder of their athletes?  How do you successfully counter implacable and unremitting hatred directed at you?  Can you afford the luxury of trying to "understand" someone who wants to kill you? Or is the cycle of violence and revenge inevitable until both sides exhaust themselves?  These are questions that face this nation today, and I don't know the answer and neither does Steven.<br /><br />In the end when Avner says to Ephraim "Why not arrest them, like Eichmann?" It is a pathetic answer to these disturbing questions. The Eichmann kidnapping to Israel was a one-of-a-kind operation, and possible because he thought he was safe and hidden. Against Black September, it would have been nearly impossible, and even possibly more violent. Having watched the Germans casually release the 3 Olympic terrorists they held to end another hijacking, I doubt trust in jail terms would be high on the agenda. Hell, the Olympic athletes were taken hostage and eventually murdered over the demand for release of Palestinian prisoners already in Israeli jails!<br /><br />At any rate, I find this film admirable for its depiction of the soul-numbing result of violence, even violence you can justify.  That Spielberg and Tony Kushner get a bit lost in trying to achieve an over-arching theme or resolution to this dilemma is not surprising, as this is the problem of our age and every age that went before us.  If the only answer to a violent act is an even more violent response, and it may well be, than the human race has a long and sorrowful future ahead of us.  This is not a political opinion, this is a cry from the heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>It's thought provoking, it's balanced and director Stephen Spielberg doesn't waste anytime getting to the heart of the issues or the action. Munich works on a number of levels as an audacious political statement, a tense thriller, and an inspiringly brutal look at two peoples forever caught up in a cycle of violence, constantly drowning in a sea of their own blood.<br /><br />It's a bleak vision and Spielberg carries it off beautifully, providing us with a clipped and tight back-story, where the Palestinian terrorists invade the Olympic village in Munich, killing two members of the Israeli team and taking another nine as hostages.<br /><br />The Israeli response is swift and fast with Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) authorizing a top-secret assassination campaign which will carried out by the security agency Mossad, aimed at wiping out those who had planned the attack. It is left to the hunky Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) to emotionally and strategically shoulder most of the burden.<br /><br />The team is a seemingly innocuous and innocent mix. Daniel Craig's Steve is the group's impulsive hard-liner, a strapping Israeli itching for reprisal, often clashing with Ciaran Hinds' Carl, the cleanup man. There's a sweet-faced bomb expert named Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and a thoughtful muscleman (Hanns Zischler).<br /><br />As Avner cooks dinner, they all get to know one another, hashing out the fine details and the boarder implications for themselves and for the Jewish state. And so the methodological killing begins, yet as Munich progresses, what remains of certainty vanishes, replaced by a thousand conflicting agendas.<br /><br />This is a world where the rule of the law is superfluous and where allegiances are none, the only constants are mistrust, paranoia, and the need to find more names, which inevitably comes at a price. No one is ever who they are, a drunk on the corner may be CIA, or KGB or the seductress at the hotel bar might be a hit woman.<br /><br />Spielberg wisely avoids any soapbox speeches, but he does allow his characters to present both sides of the argument: At a safe house in Athens, Avner is confronted with a young Arab who tells him if the desperate need for a Palestinian homeland, a place they can call their own. And back in Israel, Avner's mother tells him that Israel is their land, finally they have a home and they will fight to keep it.<br /><br />In Munich the themes are universal - the moral imperatives of violence, and in what circumstances can one justify such senseless murder. As Avner and his colleagues continue their operation, they become psychologically immune to it all.<br /><br />Yes - the operation may be successfully carried out, but how long will it be before righteous anger - the anger of the Israelis - can be continued before stumbling into bloody-mindedness? The irony is that in demonizing these Palestinian terrorists, they are themselves acquiring similar gruesome aspects.<br /><br />It's all about the cycle of violence, a common problem that has plagued the Middle East for generations and will probably continue to do so.  Munich deftly shows that everyone has their reasons for hating the other side - whether it is religious intolerance, or the fight over land rights - everyone ultimately thinks they're right, but such a stalemate can never be broken by killing people whatever side of the fence you are on.

The repetitive and non-productive cycle of revenge that is present in all of society is the enemy that Speilberg sought to expose.<br /><br />Acknowledgement is made that both the Islamic extremists who perpetrated the terrorist plot at the Munich games and the Israeli assassin squad ordered to kill them are all products of the environment that reared them.<br /><br />This movie is often hard to watch and it spotlights the idiocy of issues like blind patriotism, murder, and religious zeal, when those issues are not counterbalanced with reason and intelligence.<br /><br />While I think Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are both better movies I believe Spielberg took greater risk by investing a heckuva lot of his personal beliefs into this film.  Obviously controversy would emerge with any film dealing with this subject matter, the fact that no sides are overtly taken is a true testament to Speilberg's genius.<br /><br />The only advocacy clearly nurtured in this film is for a worldwide push for peace, to set aside the differences that are more traditional than tangible, for nations to adhere to reason in diplomacy, rather than naked emotion.<br /><br />If you really want to know what Munich is ultimately about you'll have to wait until the very last shot in the film.  In the background there are two buildings that are no longer there.<br /><br />All things considered Munich is gutsy filmmaking by a filmmaker who certainly doesn't need to take risks, the result is heartbreaking and thought provoking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Munich is the story of the aftermath of the tragic 1972 murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. The story is well told, but full of detail that quite simply makes the movie way too long (2 hours 45 minutes).<br /><br />Munich follows how five men led by Eric Bana are put together to eliminate the Black September terrorists responsible for the massacre. The dialogue is good; the action is good when it's there; there is suspense and overall the movie is morbidly entertaining....Nothing like seeing terrorists get their just desserts.<br /><br />But Steven Spielberg has gone a bit overboard with unnecessary detail creating wide gaps in the action that makes an epic out of a story that could easily have been told in a much shorter amount of time.<br /><br />So if you've got almost 3 hours to kill, and you're looking for a realistic, detailed depiction of the events that occurred after the 1972 Munich massacre...this movie is a bullseye. If slow moving movies put you to sleep...nighty night.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Since my typical approach is to talk about some cheap little movie that no one takes seriously and discuss it at length I believe here I shall discuss a well-known, controversial film and consider it in a very shallow, brief manner.  So here I go:  'Munich' is an extremely sharp, well-done thriller.  So many people are solely interested in considering this film from a political standpoint, I can't help but point out that this is still a movie, a frequently exciting and tense movie at that.  Though I've always  assumed that such covert operations exist even in so-called 'civilized' nations, notions of government funded assassinations and the like have never really seemed real to me, which makes this movie all the more fascinating, turning it into a glimpse into a hidden, but apparently real world. (And it goes beyond this, giving us glimpses of amoral, anti-government, mafia-esque groups in europe and lone seductress-assassins, the latter of which I hadn't assumed actually existed in reality, but perhaps they do...)  Of course, I have no way of knowing how closely the team here resembles the real squads sent out to off Black September, but I've somewhat arbitrarily determined that this is probably pretty close to the truth.  More to the point, film itself makes it very easy to do this, as it simply feels utterly real.  Or, I should say, utterly real at least in terms of how the characters act and their general motivations and whatnot-- The film itself is very stylishly, often expressionistically made, not generally gritty or documentary like or whatever.  It stradles the line, managing to be cinematic but not over the top or anything like that.  Performances are all top-notch, with particular note going to Eric Bana as Avner, leader of the team.  He is the most, well, normal guy in the team, so naturally he is the one who gradually becomes the most affected by their operations.<br /><br />Still, I can't help but discuss the political aspects of the movie to some degree.  Suffice to say, I think it's best to take this film most purely at face value, as an exploration of how violence is bound to effect those who inflict it on others, even if the violence is just and the target deserving.  Killing is neither simple nor pleasant, and gunning people down unarmed men in hallways and bombing others is likely going to have a pretty adverse affect on you regardless of any other details.  This is, perhaps, a fairly obvious point, but like all films that actually work on a thematic level, 'Munich' makes you actually *believe* it with your gut rather than just be consciously aware of the concept in an abstract way.<br /><br />The film isn't w/o a few problems.  Firstly, it takes a bit too long to wind down after the operations are over.  Some of this is necessary, yes, but not all of it.  We're made plenty aware of Avner's deteriorating mental state during the later portions of the operation, we don't need to have it pointed out to us so much after the fact.  Also, the juxtaposition of Avner and his wife having sex and the bloodbath on the runway is pretty damn heavy handed and over the top.  The slow-motion shots of Avner, umm, thrusting with droplets of sweat spraying everywhere as he screams and screams are just a bit much for my taste, thank you.  But that's about it as far as problems are concerned.  This is simply a very good, very believable and intense thriller.  Check it out.<br /><br />Lastly, I've only got the single disc DVD.  It looks very nice, though the artwork itself does make me laugh.  Makes it look like it's a video game.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>Well, you can't argue with success.  I saw "Munich" a couple weeks ago and thought it was such a powerful film that I instantly declared it to be both the best movie of the year and Steven Spielberg's best movie since "Saving Private Ryan."  Alas, the opinion of a lowly history-studying college student means little.  As of today, "Munich" has only grossed $40 million and is shaping up to be one of the biggest commercial flops of Spielberg's career.  By contrast, "Big Momma's House 2"- the wretched sequel to the already unfunny original- grossed nearly as much in its first three days of release.  Hence why I continue to comment on Americans' love of mediocrity.<br /><br />Why has "Munich" debuted to such a mixed reaction?  It is admittedly a difficult film to watch.  So was "Schindler's List," but "Munich" is admittedly less of a milestone, and hence is lacking the publicity it would need to still pull people in.  However, this is still a fast-paced, well-acted, and powerful piece of cinema, and for those reasons alone is a good way to spend two and a half hours (that just breeze by).  However, it is also a frighteningly timely warning about the dangers and moral ambiguities that inevitably accompany a war on terrorism, and how quickly simple vengeance can devolve into borderline murder.<br /><br />Spielberg has not been this focused in a long time- none of his 00's work approaches the quality seen here (with the exception of "Catch Me if You Can," which was much lighter fare).  Eric Bana gives the best performance of his career as a man who is friendly and righteous at first but who is quickly consumed by paranoia and the guilt of ignoring his conscience (and this is coming from someone who also loved him in "Hulk" and "Troy").  Daniel Craig seethes fury beneath a calm exterior.  Geoffrey Rush proves that, in spite of his familiarity now, he can still blend into any role with ease.  The rest of Bana's team are given compelling back stories, and all struggle to conform their moral compasses with the assassin work they're given.  There are scenes here I will never forget- a desparate attempt to save the life of a child suddenly caught in the way of an assassination attempt, the brutal revenge murder of a woman, the scenes of a man making love to his wife while also being unable to stop thinking about the murder of the Israeli athletes at Munich.  From the opening scenes, "Munich" grabs you and never lets go (if you'll forgive that cliched expression, it's appropriate here).<br /><br />More than any other movie this year, "Munich" made an impression psyche that no amount of box office indifference in the world can change.  It aspires to be something more than entertainment, and it succeeds on nearly every level.  Here's hoping that it has a "Fight Club"-like fate and finds its audience on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>There is a quote by Martin Luther King Jr. about an "eye for an eye", and I'm not going to transcribe it on here as part of my review.  But if you do come across the quote, it completely cancels out the entire premise of what the film "Munich" is all about.  Not knowing much about the events of the Munich Olympic massacre, I wanted to see a drama that depicted the horrible tragedy and inform me of the reason it happened and what led up to it and thereafter.  It seems to me this movie made somewhat of a revenge spectacle of the tragedy.  The actors appeared "James Bond-esqe" and went about thier keystone cop theatrics with avengance.  Thier bloodlusting glory came easy with with no abandon and it made me feel like they were just as bad as the assasins that killed the Isreali athletes.  My oppinions are not to trivialize what happened.  I don't think the filmmakers intended to portray the "heroes" in this kind of light but the film ended up coming across like 007 meets Moses.  In my oppinion, I would have actors with a little more subtance and weight under thier belt.  Daniel Craig did not belong in this movie by the way.  He's not that great of an actor and I'm sure he did not resemble in the slightest what really happened, but then again what do I know?  NOT that great of a movie is what I know.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Eric Bana (Troy, Chopper) in a dynamic performance stars as Avner,a man who is assembled to a team of agents who are sent to eliminated 11 people who were involved in the kidnapping of athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Bana's team consists of Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Enduring Love), Ciaran Hinds (Rome, Veronica Guerin) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Birthday Girl, The 5th Element), plus others. Their information is giving by the guy who started it all played by the always great Geoffrey Rush (Finding Nemo, Lantana). Soon Bana and his team are off to eliminate them all and also Bana's family could be in danger in the process. It's a powerful film with superb performances all around. Spielberg shows the horror and the chaos of what happened with bloody, brutal results. It's one of the best films that came last year and all I gotta say is bravo. Not for all tastes but I think if someone went threw what happened it would of been a horrible experience to go threw. Also starring Yvan Attal (The Interpreter, At Dawning) and Ayelet Zurerl (Maktub, A Night Without Lola).</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>This film is splendid in its format and sometimes thrilling environments, but it seemed to me the ending (once again for SS) fell flat on its face under the weight of his trying to make a stupendously enlightening ending. While his attempt is admirable, I still cannot dismiss how banal and unsatisfying the ending is. The revelation to the proctagonist is much to be desired, and rather distasteful in that the moment of clarity of the absolute unfolding of events of Munich swam in the same filthy waters as him reaching the climax of his sexual encounter with his dispassioned wife. It was agonizing watching him pound away at his wife while the spiritual revelation was at once occuring to him, sending shocks down his neck in obvious pain, yet not deterring him from his animalistic passions. the Hit list in all of its method was tediously boring towards the end. I watched with pleading eyes for the movie to finish with its hit list, as every single one was, admittedly expertly, delivered, nonetheless overtly dramatic! This film, to me, recieved a polite nod for its attempt. It is an impossible feat of a script to settle on, and the topic is Hotter than sizzling grease! So I admire this historic team for getting their hands into it and showing the world an important film, though disatisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"You could be my son..., but you are not. We will continue to do business. But, you are not family."<br /><br />- "Papa" lets Avril know that he is no rolling stone in "Munich"<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's latest is one of his best dramatic films with only "Schindler's List" & "Saving Private Ryan" out distancing it.<br /><br />On September 5, 1972, the XXth Olympiad being held in Munich, West Germany, was interupted by the Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September, taking Israeli Olympians hostage that would result in a hauntingly historic & horrorific tragic outcome.<br /><br />ABC Sportscaster, Jim McKays' words still chill the bone to this day.<br /><br />"I've just gotten the final word. When I was a kid, my father used to say that are greatest hopes & worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears were realized tonight. They have said that there were 11 hostages. 2 killed in their rooms this mor- yesterday morning. 9 killed at the airport tonight. They're all gone."<br /><br />With this tragic & senseless loss, the country of Isreal secretly retaliates with Prime Minister, Golda Meare recruiting a young field operative who Meare has known in the past, named Avril, to put together a five man operation consisting of ex-Mousad soldiers to avenge the deaths of the fallen atheletes of Munich & killing the 11 conspirators that were responsible for their deaths.<br /><br />Avril accepts the mission with unflinching trust in his country & patriotic pride. Working undercover (he signs a contract stating that he doesn't exist), & with the help of his secret ops. commander, Ephraim, Avril is given bank accounts with unlimited financial resources to recruit the best agents for the job & do whatever it takes to get the job done. Traveling to & around Europe, the group slowly starts to gain notice with each death, in the dark confines of the underworld. Avril's underground contact, Louis, is a perfect piece of 70's Euro-trash (even his father, known only as "Papa" would gladly trade him for Avril) & slowly becomes untrustworthy. Soon, the hunters become the hunted. When he slowly starts to lose members of his team, Avril starts to get paranoid, checking his hotel phone, his bed, & his T.V. for explosive devices. Adding to the stress is his family, who he misses dearly.<br /><br />When he does finally return home, he slowly realizes that the country he once believed in, never truly believed in him. Feeling used & betrayed, Avril returns to his family, but, still living the feeling of being trapped in the paranoid crosshairs of terrorism.<br /><br />"Munich" is one of the best films of 2005. Spielberg's direction is top notch (he just may get another Oscar for this). The flashback scenes are a bit gruesome, but, factually acurate.<br /><br />Using the ABC footage of the Olympics and incorporating into the filmed footage gave "Munich" a very spooky edge. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is very much in the style of  70's cinematography (this may get a well deserved Oscar, also).<br /><br />The cast is great. Eric Bana as Avril is his best role to date. Daniel Craig & Geoffrey Rush with the rest of the cast help elevate the film's greatness. I would expect Oscar nods for Bana for best actor & supporting role nods for Rush & Craig.<br /><br />Since I'm a die-hard fan of Spielberg's work I couldn't help, but, notice one drawback.<br /><br />The origin of "Indiana Jones" is legendary. In the late 70's Spielberg & George Lucas were discussing future film projects. Spielberg told Lucas he had always wanted to direct a Bond movie, but, Lucas led Spielberg down a different path with "Raiders Of The Lost Ark". 24 years after the release of "Raiders", & as I watching "Munich" it finally hit me, Spielberg finally got to make his spy movie.<br /><br />Don't believe me?<br /><br />"Munich" has a small group of secret agents sent out to avenge the deaths of the Isreali Olympiads. The 1989 Bond film, "License To Kill" has 007 getting his license to kill revoked as he avenges the attemted death of a close friend.<br /><br />Daniel Craig who is one of the secret ops working for Bana in "Munich" is the new James Bond in the upcoming "Casino Royale".<br /><br />Michael Lonsdale who portrays the dangerous "Papa" in "Munich" also portrayed the even more villanous Hugo Drax in the 1979 Bond film "Moonraker".<br /><br />A lot of the different locales were a bit reminiscent of locales from all sorts of spy movies of the past. "Munich" has a scene where Avril meets Louis, in France, to talk about business in a market with the Eiffel Tower looming in the background. In the 1985 Bond film "A View To A Kill", Bond meets his contact in a restaurant atop the Eifell Tower.<br /><br />So, did Mr. Spielberg direct a dramatic film based on true events?<br /><br />Or, did he direct a dramatic film that happened to be a spy film with a twist (a Jewish James Bond?).<br /><br />Only Steven Spielberg knows for sure.<br /><br />I also highly, highly recommend the 1999 documentary "One Day In September" narrated by Michael Douglas. This Oscar winner is an extremely powerful look at 9/5/72, that chronicals the entire day from start to finish with a look at what would become "Munich". This should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>The movie Munich is based on an incident that took place during the 1972 in Munich Germany.

Especially when the TRUE STORY is out there in so many other venues. Like the novels: Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team & Massacre in Munich: The Manhunt for the Killers Behind the 1972 Olympics Massacre.<br /><br />In my opinion, there is no excuse for someone with such power, influence and experience in filmmaking like Spielberg has, to make a film that DISTORTS HISTORY, intent and emotion like MUNICH does. Those who don't have the gumption to look further into the issue will assume that the MOVIE is TRUTH. They will be misinformed.<br /><br />The film IS EXCELLENT, as long as you look at it as FICTION.<br /><br />The events are violent and unapologetic. The brutal nature of the events that unfolded are captured tremendously. Eric Bana's performance is OSCAR WORTHY. The story does get draggy at points, but the overall movie is a solid and worthy piece.<br /><br />So, you come to the point where you have to decide STARS???  Do not be mistaken... this is a 4 or 5 star movie... but how many stars do you take away from a film and a Director that should have known better than to pass off FICTION as FACT. How incredibly ARROGANT and LAZY is it of Spielberg and UNIVERSAL to not have pursued more truth in their film. Included the REAL HITMEN's 2cents?<br /><br />Or is it that UNIVERSAL and SPIELBERG were more concerned about getting across another hollywood skewed message to the current administration about revenge and war making things worse, that they weren't concerned about truth?<br /><br />I THINK IT WAS THIS. With a little arrogance thrown in too. So... I give it a 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Despite the compelling subject matter: Israel avenging the murder of her athletes by the Palestinians at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Steven Spielberg's" Munich" generally lacks the forward propulsion to make it as interesting and important as its subject matter.<br />Though, without a doubt there are several thrilling scenes and terrific performances: for one, Eric Bana as Avner the man to whom Golda Meir (a powerful Lynne Cohen) hands over the power, the money and the right to avenge her fallen athletes and for another Geoffrey Rush as Efraim, Avner's handler.<br />Bana's Avner is a solid, upright man, a minor field agent used to minor assignments but whose unwavering allegiance to Israel and for all that it stands as well as being the son of a hero and a powerful, forthright mother (a thoughtful, conflicted Gila Almagor) who tells him: "We (Jews) finally have a place to call our own...We must not let anyone take it away" (paraphrase).<br /> Bana is very powerful particularly in scenes that require that he perform deeds that would make most of us shudder and falter...his Avner moves ahead without hesitation. Bana's thoughtful face and resolute demeanor make his Avner a man that many would and do follow into battle. Though he is often racked with soul and spirit numbing guilt and later in life with heart-stopping paranoia, Avner never wavers, never tires, never lets down his guard: his pursuit of revenge is indestructable.<br />The scenes involving the murder of the athletes are the most gruesome, the most shocking and the best choreographed and edited: these scenes  make their point through the accumulation of  precise, exact and focused detail...there's not an inch of film in these scenes that is wasted....masterful. If only Spielberg had used the same discretion with the film as a whole: "Munich" is too long by about 20 minutes, the editing is often flaccid and this is a tragic shame, to be honest for the subject matter is rife with all the things that make for suspenseful, exciting drama.<br />"Munich" is graced with several exciting scenes and some magical performances but ultimately it is not a great film though it is a very good one. All the chess pieces were on Spielberg's board, he just chose the wrong moves.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Other reviewers have found Spielberg's interpretation of events surrounding the aftermath of the '72 Olympic murders of the Israeli athletes as being "politically correct" and "safe."  Well, I, for one, beg to differ in that the director has taken a controversial story and given us a film that doesn't show either side as being the "hero" or the "villain."<br /><br />Though much of the world condemned the actions of Black September on that dark day in Munich, the "speculation" of the retaliatory actions of Israel could equally have been criticized.  As depicted here, the pursuit of the assassins is relentless with a cast of wonderful actors displaying the various personas of a "hit squad."<br /><br />Eric Bana deserved an Oscar nomination as the assassin with a concious while co-star Daniel Craig is memorable as Bana's partner-in-arms with a penchant for R & B music.  Craig shows a menacing air that might do him well as he takes on the role of "James Bond" in the forthcoming "Casino Royale."<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush gives another outstanding performance as the man that sends Bana and company on their mission.  Ciaran Hinds, Mathier Kassovitz, and Hanns Zischler are equally impressive as the remaining three members of the quintet.  Michael Lonsdale and Mathier Amalric shine as the father-son team that provides information for the Israelis at a very expensive cost.<br /><br />Spielberg's direction has never been tighter and the location filming and cinematography is flawless.  Tense moments abound with realistic situations, especially when the "best laid plans" go awry.<br /><br />Spielberg stalwart John Williams provides an extremely subdued score, never overshadowing the on-screen events.<br /><br />There is no wonder that the film received five Oscar nods.<br /><br />Though it's too bad that it didn't win any of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>I still get a lump in my throat and my eyes well up when I hear the words of Jim McKay: "They're all gone." If we are to believe in a global look then we must be wary of all hate and prejudice, whether in Africa or Eastern Europe, because this is the malignant plant that it breeds.<br /><br />So these 11 runners and hurdlers and wrestlers come to Munich for the Olympiad in 1972, and are murdered. What to do?<br /><br />Golda Meir didn't coin the phrase, but as contrasted with negotiation and talk, she enacts the (what is now) unconventional attitude of 'hunt them, find them, kill them'<br /><br />And so a team led by Eric Bana begins just that, seeking the men responsible for the atrocity. The murderers were PLO, the infamous Black September group, and as history tells us eventually 9 of 11 were assassinated.<br /><br />What Spielberg does is clearly avoided by revenge and retribution authors and directors from "Shane" onward. In those tales the hero is left lonely but victorious over evil. Here, we get to reflect upon the terrible toll of retribution.<br /><br />To kill someone, even under the aegis of right, costs a lot. Just read the bio of Dick Winters in "Beyond Band of Brothers" to feel the palpable injury still shouldered by the remaining men of Easy Company, 60 years later.<br /><br />This picture is brilliant. It may not be your cup of tea. But the amazing thing about it is how different people have different reactions. The very actions of Madame Meir may be an affront to you. But I submit that it is not a choice so much between killing and living. It becomes a choice between decision and indecision. She decides to act in a certain way. Avner (Bana) accepts the offer reluctantly, grows into it, finds himself double and triple teamed by it, and eventually suffers the consequences of his decisions.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Avner's team's handler, manipulative as management, seeing different goals, embracing different agendas. You have the feeling that for all of their cunning and intellect, the Israelis are as riddled with conflict between the government, the Mossad and purpose as we are in the United States. This is clearly a keeper and along with Ryan, Schindler, and BOB, Spielberg remains one of the top 3 or 4 directors in America unafraid of embracing the hot potato.<br /><br />After navigating the catacombs of ethical issues, one of the film's characters utters "there is no peace at the end of this." True. Is it brilliant? I think so. You may not but you ought to see it.

He is called to undertake a special "task" outlined by prime minister Golda Meir and her cabinet, in the wake of the killings to "let the World know" the consequence of the Palestinians actions, by setting off to Europe with a list of assassination targets. I won't go into too much further detail, as I don't wish to spoil the movie. I actually have vague memories of the Israeli Hostage debacle at Munich myself, and went on to study the (then termed) Arab/Israeli Conflict in more detail several years later. As an impartial, it is perhaps easier to see through the passionate elements of the story, and draw conclusions on a wider, human level, and it is here that the power of the story lies. Regardless of your political, or religious affiliations, the story is much deeper than the apparent two sides on display, and yet becomes paradoxically more basic in its message (at least in my humble opinion as to the message Spielberg seems to be trying to get across). This is not about "highly trained" assassins paying dues, but rather, well intended, deeply motivated and passionate men following orders for what they think is right, and juggling with their own morality later. The question it seems is an age old one, "does the end justifying the means" and as the story deepens and unfolds, the main characters all begin to battle with moral demons, and paranoid soul searching. There is a wealth of talent on display here, Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds (HBO Rome's Caesar), Daniel Craig (the new 007 by the way) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Jakob the Liar) and several others, who glean the benefits of a tight script and masterful direction by Spielberg throughout. There are some terrific moments of high tension, some very graphic violence, and also unfortunately, some stale plodding periods along the way. I marveled at the attention to detail in re creating 1973, from the models of European cars, and clothing, to even correct movie posters outside theatres, appearing in no more than a walk across scene. On the down side, this movie is a tad on the long side at 2hrs and 44 mins, and could have arguably been shaved by about 20 minutes. Others have suggested that more could have been done with the material, although I thought it was well handled (with the exception of juxtaposing a sex scene with hostage murders). It is certainly well deserving of the `R' rating, and doesn't (in the usual Spielberg fashion) shy away from the grittiest of details, especially in the bombing and murder scenes. On the whole I rated it 4 Stars, which is probably a little generous, but the polished feel to the whole picture, and excellent acting all round is well worthy of merit. An Oscar contender? I doubt it, and it's hardly Stevens's best work to date, but it IS well worth seeing.

Inspired in part by true events that occurred after the tragic terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich olympics, the movie offers the difficult question of just when does revenge become simply murder?  As in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg has some deeply disturbing and realistic scenes that are uncomfortable to watch in the sanctity of your home.  But the film is powerful indeed.  Eric Bana is marvelous in the role of Avner, giving us an honest portrait of a man who questions his ethics; Geoffrey Rush is great as his deceptive boss; and the underappreciated Ciaran Hinds glows in his role as the team's "worrier."  Surprisingly, future James Bond Daniel Craig's role is the least developed, but he does an okay job. John Williams does one of his best scores, and the movie is certainly a cinematic achievement, if not totally an entertaining one.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg again strikes a raw nerve in his somber tribute to his Jewish heritage in "Munich". He recounts the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Palestinian terror group Black September.  Using archived film clips from news reports of the terrorist attack he creates a graphic portrait of the horror generated by this event.  Using a clever cinematographic technique his color film appears to be more a colorized black and white, a washed out, toned down version of the vibrant color schemes seen in todays films.<br /><br />Eric Bana, previously seen playing Hector in "Troy" gives a career defining performance as low level Israeli Mossad agent Avner Kaufman.  Bana is recruited through the highest channels of Israeli government including prime minister Golda Meir to administer revenge for the Olympic attacks.  Bana is separated from his family and made head of a five man assassination team to execute 11 Palestinians identified as being responsible for the attacks.  He is officially made a non entity in Israel so that his actions can have deniability.<br /><br />Included in his team among others is Daniel Craig playing British accented Steve.  Bana is handled by his Mossad contact Ephraim played nicely by Geoffrey Rush.<br /><br />The plot lead us through the machinations Bana and his team have to go through to accomplish their mission.  They are assisted by a family of Frenchmen lead by the distinguished Michael Lonsdale who provide information for exorbitant fees as to the whereabouts for their targets.<br /><br />Spielberg presents a fairly unbiased view of these events also evoking sympathy for the Palestinian cause.  Bana's character in the film, Avner goes through a metamorphosis. his psyche ultimately in turmoil due to guilt and the paranoia of his position. He and his family leave Israel to settle in the U.S..  We realize that although he is beseeched by Rush to return to his homeland, things can never be the same for him there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>In 1972, the world was shocked at an act of terrorism played out on the world stage of the Munich Olympics, when a group of Arab terrorists, known as Black September, kidnapped the Israeli Olympic team from their rooms in the Olympic village, and ultimately killed them all.<br /><br />Faced with this act, and after their defeat of their enemies in the 1967-1969 struggle for their homeland against Arab foes, the country of Israel decides to seek retribution against the 11 men who were involved in the planning of the killings. They struggle with the decision, and the principal of seeking vengeance, but decide they must. They choose, as their instrument, a young Sabra, born in Israel to a hero of Israeli independence. Avram (played by Eric Bana), the young Israeli, was once a bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir. He is impeccably well trained and trustworthy. He absorbs with aplomb the news that he is to be an assassin, to lead an assassination team for the Mossad, and that he will be disavowed by his government if he is caught. His team, four men, is provided to him, along with copious amounts of money to complete his task. His handler, Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush in another brilliant performance) is imperious and demanding.<br /><br />The story is absorbing, the nature of the events shocking, the performances supporting Bana's are very well done. Bana himself is a revelation, and this film should make him a household word.  He is marvelous in his role.  Spielberg ultimately elects NOT to present the film as a justification for what Israel did, but a message about the consequences of seeking an eye for an eye.  He plants seeds of doubt throughout the film, and it is obvious that he has either struggled with his belief that what was done was necessary, OR, he may support what was done, but just want to be more politically correct in delivering his message...that violence to cure violence never works.<br /><br />I think Spielberg has produced a fine film, and perhaps one worthy of four stars and a whole lot of heated conversation about the outcomes.  The violence is shocking, the message is somewhat unclear...the film runs long, but it is ultimately a thriller of the highest standing, with an ending that leaves the filmgoer unsatisfied.<br /><br />But I'm giving the film three stars, and that is reflective of the overall effort, less the absolutely appalling scene where the final film of what happened to the Israeli Olympics team is interspersed with Avram's reunion with his wife in their bed.  I found the juxtaposition of these film slices to be the most shameless and ridiculous film stunt I've seen in a long, long time.  Spielberg should be ashamed of this contrivance.  And this single episode far and away detracts from what should have been an important film.<br /><br />While dodging the bullets of his detractors who will cry false at the "violence never works" precept, Spielberg did the unthinkable; allowed himself to edit and present in a way that absolutely cheapened the overall effort.  Disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>It's thought provoking, it's balanced and director Stephen Spielberg doesn't waste anytime getting to the heart of the issues or the action. Munich works on a number of levels as an audacious political statement, a tense thriller, and an inspiringly brutal look at two peoples forever caught up in a cycle of violence, constantly drowning in a sea of their own blood.<br /><br />It's a bleak vision and Spielberg carries it off beautifully, providing us with a clipped and tight back-story, where the Palestinian terrorists invade the Olympic village in Munich, killing two members of the Israeli team and taking another nine as hostages.<br /><br />The Israeli response is swift and fast with Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) authorizing a top-secret assassination campaign which will carried out by the security agency Mossad, aimed at wiping out those who had planned the attack. It is left to the hunky Mossad agent Avner (Eric Bana) to emotionally and strategically shoulder most of the burden.<br /><br />The team is a seemingly innocuous and innocent mix. Daniel Craig's Steve is the group's impulsive hard-liner, a strapping Israeli itching for reprisal, often clashing with Ciaran Hinds' Carl, the cleanup man. There's a sweet-faced bomb expert named Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and a thoughtful muscleman (Hanns Zischler).<br /><br />As Avner cooks dinner, they all get to know one another, hashing out the fine details and the boarder implications for themselves and for the Jewish state. And so the methodological killing begins, yet as Munich progresses, what remains of certainty vanishes, replaced by a thousand conflicting agendas.<br /><br />This is a world where the rule of the law is superfluous and where allegiances are none, the only constants are mistrust, paranoia, and the need to find more names, which inevitably comes at a price. No one is ever who they are, a drunk on the corner may be CIA, or KGB or the seductress at the hotel bar might be a hit woman.<br /><br />Spielberg wisely avoids any soapbox speeches, but he does allow his characters to present both sides of the argument: At a safe house in Athens, Avner is confronted with a young Arab who tells him if the desperate need for a Palestinian homeland, a place they can call their own. And back in Israel, Avner's mother tells him that Israel is their land, finally they have a home and they will fight to keep it.<br /><br />In Munich the themes are universal - the moral imperatives of violence, and in what circumstances can one justify such senseless murder. As Avner and his colleagues continue their operation, they become psychologically immune to it all. Yes - the operation may be successfully carried out, but how long will it be before righteous anger - the anger of the Israelis - can be continued before stumbling into bloody-mindedness? The irony is that in demonizing these Palestinian terrorists, they are themselves acquiring similar gruesome aspects.<br /><br />It's all about the cycle of violence, a common problem that has plagued the Middle East for generations and will probably continue to do so. Munich deftly shows that everyone has their reasons for hating the other side - whether it is religious intolerance, or the fight over land rights - everyone ultimately thinks they're right, but such a stalemate can never be broken by killing people whatever side of the fence you are on.

It certainly wasn't a "safe" subject for Spielberg to tackle, especially in the extremely sensitive post-9/11 world in which we live, but Spielberg has never been a filmmaker content to rest on his laurels and he certainly isn't doing so here.<br /><br />Based on the book, "Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team"<br /><br />by George Jonas, the film uses as its starting point the tragic killing of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games.  To get revenge for the murders, the Israeli government secretly hires a handful of assassins whose job it is to hunt down and kill those responsible for the act.  Avner, the man chosen to be the leader of the operation, is forced to abandon his pregnant wife and later their newborn baby to perform his mission.  As the body count begins to pile up, Avner is forced to question his actions, becoming more and more morally confused, guilt-ridden and paranoid as the story develops.<br /><br />Spielberg has been harshly criticized for being too egalitarian and non-judgmental in his approach, for implying a kind of moral equivalence between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  I don't really feel qualified to answer those charges, but from an artistic standpoint, I believe the director has taken the right approach, for in art, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating and challenging than moral certainty.  Spielberg certainly generates sympathy for the Israeli athletes who are the first in the movie to fall victim to the bloodshed, and the Jewish individuals called on to exact the nation's revenge are shown as generally righteous men motivated by a desire for justice and concerned that innocent victims not fall prey to their violence.  It's true that the Israeli government doesn't fare nearly as well here, and it is in this area that Spielberg opens himself up to the most criticism.  However, this is something for the more politically inclined to deal with. Those of us interested in fine filmmaking will have less trouble with this aspect.<br /><br />For as a movie, "Munich" is a powerhouse of a drama, thanks to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's thought provoking, intelligent screenplay and Spielberg's incisive, tightly disciplined direction.  The movie doesn't wander off into side alleys or irrelevancies but stays intimately focused on the characters as they go through the grim business of hunting down suspects, detonating explosives and even engaging in challenging moral discussions from time to time.  Spielberg makes every moment count, whether it be showing us the intricate step-by-step process through which these men eliminate their targets or capturing a man's moment of joy and anguish as he talks on the phone to the little daughter he's never met.<br /><br />As a humanist, Spielberg seems less concerned with heroes and villains than with the devastating toll escalating violence takes on both the individual psyche and society as a whole.  He seems to be saying that we're in all this together, and until we begin to acknowledge our common humanity, the peaceful world we all long for will never come to pass.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the one by Eric Bana, who, as Avner, manages to make a complex and morally ambiguous character both believable and touching.<br /><br />"Munich" is not an easy film for many in the audience to warm up to or sit through.  It demands concentration and a willingness to look at some of the harsh realities of the world we live in with an open mind and unaverted eyes.  But for those willing and courageous enough to do so, "Munich" is a provocative and richly rewarding experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>"Munich" is a mishandled, self-important, shallow glossing of every party involved in the horrendous brutality of terrorism; the nadir for Stephen Spielberg in his futile quest to be treated as a legitimate intellectual.<br /><br />Let's begin with the genre to which Munich is wed: the 1970s-era political thriller. To deny that this is the vernacular in which the film should have been presented is a major mistake. Unfortunately, instead of learning the lessons of these often haunting films, Spielberg, in his confusion, has opted for shakey-cam verisimilitude woefully married to his usual pretentious directoral "god-like" sentimentality. Worse still are the flashback sequences to the Munich Olympics themselves: akin to something one would see on the History Channel, ersatz-journalistic drama that falls flat on its face.<br /><br />But the real problem with Munich: a painful, juvenile, laughable script by the most overrated writer in America (though many could challenge this throne), Tony Kushner. I knew we were in trouble from the first scene with Golda Meir -- the preposterous drivel spilling from her mouth, the "smoke-filled" situation room, oh please please please. The dialogue throughout the film has all of the subtley of a rock hammer, bringing into glaring relief the core ineptitude of the film: the world seen through the dangerous lens of sequestered, infantile humanism. Kushner is no historian, and even less of a political insider. He writes like a 15-year-old, and since Spielberg's highest grade of formal education is high school, this is a perfect marriage of ignorami.<br /><br />Yet Munich is worse than just a pointless film, it is a failure on every level. Each character an agenda, every plot point a shakey timber. It is offensive in the extreme; built around an untenable central thesis regarding the failure of retributon.  It is not just callow and despicable, but exists in a realm totally divorced from reality. The terrorists who perpetrated the atrocities in Munich are the lowest form of scum on the planet, and eradication of their likes is a necessary evil. This last statement is 180 degrees from the stand Munich takes. 180. A film like Munich is an affront to the people who have sacrificed their lives to protect civilization from these barbarians.<br /><br />The Olympics themselves are a peaceful congregation of antipathetic governments meeting in the most civilized arena. That is what made the murders so heinous, so incredibly despicable. Spielberg and Kushner even fail at conveying this with any resonance; their weak set-up to the film evinces a total lack of understanding of the emotion that surrounded the incomprehensibly depressing and tragic events that initiated the Mossad assignment.<br /><br />If you want to understand the massacre in Munich, watch "One Day In September", a masterfully-produced documentary that transcends this dramatization in every way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Realism at its most haunting, Munich is a multi-layered film addressing many issues. Although revenge is its central theme, an eye for an eye, the story is about nationalism, loyalty, the value of family and that thin line between killing in war and plain murder outside the so-called war arena.<br /><br />The film begins in Munich during the Olympic games. As is well known to those who were living at the time, Palestinians stormed the Olympic village and took the Israeli team hostage. As the world watched the tragedy unfold on their television sets, most were hopeful that the outcome would be without bloodshed and death. As a child I remember distinctly staring at the television in a kind of shock, and after the hostages had been murdered, experiencing terrible nightmares for some time. To be sure, I was not alone with these feelings - this was not a movie but real death.<br /><br />The film does an excellent job of representing this tragedy.<br /><br />The scene changes and the Israeli Prime Minister is confronted with a difficult decision. Although bombing Palestinian villages in retaliation, somehow this was not enough, thus she gives the order to assassinate, one by one, the perpetrators directly responsible.<br /><br />The Australian actor, Eric Bana, portrays the young Israeli solider who must disconnect from his home, his family and his government, acting as a rogue killer, however financed by the government. In other words, if he is caught, no country or government will take responsibility - like many undercover operatives one reads about, he is on his own. The reason for the covert operation is that it is illegal, against many international laws. The story moves on and he has a team of unusual characters, all loyal to the Israeli cause, to hunt down those responsible for Munich.<br /><br />The settings are many - Rome, London, France, Athens and New York - all beautifully photographed.<br /><br />What I found most astounding was the realism of the film; the killings felt too real, the fear, trepidation, guilt and sadness of all the characters felt palpable. The film's end is a wonderful piece of acting and writing.<br /><br />Generally not a big fan of Spielberg films, this one was a visceral experience, lasting because of its realism and the important issues it raises. The central issue, the occupied territories, the never-ending murder and mayhem, leaves the viewer, not directly involved in that war, wondering when or if a reconciliation will ever occur.<br /><br />A thinking film and superb in all respects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Munich asks many questions about the difference between right and wrong.  It asks the veiwer to decide whats so different between what happened at the 1972 Israli Olympics and what the Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team did in responce.  In 1972 Palestinian terrorists held Israli athletes hostage, eleven of them, and then murdered them all.  This group of terrorists went by the name of Black September.  After the aftermath a group of Jewish nobodies was formed for the soul purpose of killing the men resposible for planning the murders.  This movie follows their story.  The team leader is Avner (Eric Bana), a married man expecting child and within moments his life is put on hold and put in danger.  As the movie progresses you can see that Avner battles moral issues, trying to decide whether what he's doing is worth all that he could be giving up.  There's a scene where he's talking to his child on the phone and he breaks down because he's missing so much, and for all he knows he could miss everything.  As we learn more about the conflict between these two people, the Jewish and Arab people, we begin to see there may not me much difference between them at all.  Is their revenge that much different then their reason for such?  "Thousands of years of hatred doesn't make you decent."  Besides asking such moral questions, that aside, this film offers a thrilling story, a thrilling, fast past and engaging film that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Through flashbacks we see what exactly happened on that fateful day at the Olympics.  The morality really plays key here as each and every man on the mission battles feelings of guilt and a lack of morality as they carry out this mission for their country, for their people.  It's a story for all to see, about revenge and the act of and how it affects us as a people but also as individuals.  Acting on all fronts is brilliant, Bana especially.  Spielberg is genius.  Remember...  "All this blood comes back on our heads."</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Well made movie, but not a classic movie.  A nice score and beautiful shots go a long way in this movie about the slaughter of the Israeli athletes and the response to that action.  The scting is top notch, and the story based on true events is riveting.  The movie does go a bit long at 2 hours and 40 minutes.  I think Spielberg could have been a bit less self indulgent and made some trims to move the story along better.<br /><br />The action is very bloody.  Some sexual situations with one scene of nudity.  Cursing is fairly light, but overall this is certainly an adults only movie.  One thing I was surprised at was the balance view Spielberg gave between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Being Jewish I would have thought that he would make them more the heroes.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>Formed in 1948, the modern state of Israel has survived in the midst of her enemies by divine Providence and the support of the United States and Great Britain. Otherwise, she surely would have been overwhelmed by the forces of evil which threaten her even today.<br /><br />Members of the youngest generation may not realize that terrorism is not new, it has been with us for decades and nowhere more painfully than in the Middle East.<br /><br />"Munich" is about terrorism, hatred, revenge, and survival. Having withstood the slaughter of eleven athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Israel retaliates by mounting clandestine operations to punish the twelve complicit Arabs. Israeli leadership is intent upon extracting justice by punishing her foes; an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.<br /><br />Spielberg gets it right. The film is dark, threatening, thrilling, and suspenseful. Politics and war make for unlikely bedfellows and there are surprises and plot twists which add to the suspense. In Munich, nothing is certain but death.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>In 1972 I was twenty-one when I heard on the news that the Olympic Israeli quarters had been assaulted by terrorist. The world held it's breath and waited. When all the hostages were killed there was little sympathy then for the PLO plight. After all what country wanted terrorist to come to a neutral place that was about peaceful competition and kill their athletes? However; revenge is a double-edged sword as well. The price paid to have it is often to steep. Those Israelis that set out to have revenge on the terrorist paid a high price. I am sure Spielberg did everything possible to tell most of the story about how the Munich terrorist where tracked and assasinated. You can argue politics and religion all you like about who is treated unfairly, the movie is done superbly. Spielberg is a fine director that knows what needs to be told and how to keep the story from being to complex and muddled. He doesn't go into all the minutiae as some directors have done of late. Although the movie is long I was never bored or tired. It kept my interest throughout and I found the revelations of what occurred during and after the 1972 Olympic Games attack fascinating. If you enjoyed his dramas like "Schindler's List" and "Empire of the Sun" you will probably enjoy this as well. Even people who have never seen his movies should like this account of how Israel dealt with the attack on their people at the Olympic Games. An excellent job of showing the length, the cost, and the personal sacrifices made to accomplish their goals.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>A disconcerting look to the movie, makes for some uncomfortable viewing.

A mark of powerful filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Director Steven Spielberg has brought to life the tragic events of September, 1972, when Palestinian terrorists abducted and eventually killed the members of the Israeli Olympic team who were competing at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich, Germany.<br /><br />Infuriated by the murders and seeking revenge, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) approved the development of a special team of assassins who's job it would be to track down the Palestinians who were responsible for the killings and assassinate them. The team consisted of Avner (Eric Bana), Steve (Daniel Craig), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), Hans (Hanns Zischler) and Carl (Ciaran Hinds).  These men were stripped of their identities, and, if caught, they were on their own.  Israel did not know them.  Their job was to track down the Palestinians throughout the world, excluding Arab countries, and eliminate them.<br /><br />Working with a secret agency run by Louis (Mathieu Amalric) and his father, the team is provided with pictures and the whereabouts of the Palestinians.  Soon, the group springs into action and the killings begin.  However, it does not come without cost to the Israelis.  Avner, who left his pregnant wife in Israel, is beginning to wonder about the true purpose of his mission, while the others, including Hans and Carl, meet their own demise.  In the end, Avner begins to suspect that Louis' agency may have been providing information on him and his group to the Palestinians, although this was never revealed to be true.  Avner's team succeeded in eliminated six of the eleven Palestinians, along with a female Dutch assassin who was suspected to be working with the Palestinians. Eventually, nine of the eleven Palestinians were elimated.  Two survived.<br /><br />As for Avner, he and his family moved to Brooklyn, but he still had constant nightmares about his part in the assassinations.<br /><br />This is a spectacular film.  The historical authenticity is perfect, and I especially thought the original ABC Sports broadcasts from the 1972 Olympics covering the kidnappings were one of the highlights of the movie.  Jack McKay and his co-anchors did a yeoman job of keeping the world informed about the crisis.  I can remember as a young child watching these events unfold on television, and I'm glad Steven Spielberg chose to incorporate them into the film.  The kidnapping scenes are especially shocking, while the scenes with Golda Meir and her advisors show her true resolve to avenge the athletes' deaths.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The story of Avner's team is brought to life, and, although there were actually several Israeli teams looking for the Palestinians, the viewer gets a first-hand account of what it was like for these determined men to avenge their countrymen's deaths.  The acting is excellent, and, of course, the directing and production is top-notch.  Its easy to see why this movie was nominated for five Academy Awards.  Watch this masterpiece of a film and experience what it was like for those few tense days in September of 1972.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>The best thing about Munich is that it is believeable.  Even knowing that it's based on a true story -- built from accounts, according to Spielberg, which could not be discredited -- I half-expected a James Bond over-the-top action/adventure.  I should have known that Spielberg would not stoop to cheap gimmicks and corny action cliches.<br /><br />More than the action is the drama.  The characters have to confront the evil that was done in Munich in 1972.  The are forced to reflect on whether they're right in their response to that evil.  Without melodrama, Spielberg brings these issues to the surface, plays them out through credible interaction between the various characters.<br /><br />The lone drawback of this movie is that it tends to drag at the end. It never gets boring, but it seems like some fat could possibly have been trimmed out somewhere.  This is a minor point as there's nothing in the movie that obviously does not fit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This was not a boxoffice smash as people just don't wish to be reminded of such calamity as happened at the 20th Olymiad in Germany in 1972.  Howard Cosell was there for ABC Sports and wrote a book about his involvement and the truth of the matter.  It all seemed like a bad dream.  There was terrible despair as it was kept out of the press as much as possible.  It was an echo of things past which sometime could be a precursor of things to come.<br /><br />Sometimes instinct compels you to say certain things to a certain limit.  Is it Joe Allen or Carl Hampton to blame for those awful, awful selections.  Who has the temerity to take responsibility for such a continuing campaign.  I simply can't give either the benefit of a doubt as both are cruel and mean grudge holders.  They continue to harass because of the power or ability, but it will backfire on both, whoever the culprit is.  The epitome of the flaws in today's society and radio in general.  It is a petty feud with jabs by Hampton against Allen.  It's a big sport to them.  It's sad they or the engineer (whoever hs may be) continue this charade of aggravation.<br /><br />Television is here to stay; it is the single most important medium of communication in the contemporary civilization.  Movies today exaggerate a situation or disaster, so that it is hard to know the truth or actual facts.  Cosell wasn't afraid to tell it like it is.  The movie, however, has much to be desired.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>When one considers the plight of Jews portrayed on film, nothing compares to Mr. Spielberg's "Schindler's List." And though this was a story that needed to be told, I can think of other Spielberg films that were somehow, more rewarding. "Jaws" "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" "E.T." "The Color Purple" "Saving Private Ryan" and even "Amistad."<br /><br />I can remember quite vividly, the tragic events that destroyed the whole meaning of World Unity, that were supposed to be the 1972 Olympic Games. I was 17, and trying to find meaning to life at the time. But rather than concentrating on the acts of revenge, I would rather have seen more character development, especially of the members of the Israeli Olympic team, and their life stories leading up to Munich. In some ways, I think the fascination with vengeance could be counterproductive to the future peace of Israel. Sad as that may sound. The impact and effect of viewing "Munich" still rates 4 stars though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Munich" is brilliant! One of last year's best!

No, this is not due in part to the announcement that the Daily Show's Jon Stewart will host the program. This is just another clear sign that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has truly lost touch with its core audience and have reverted to catering to the whims of sniveling television executives eager to lure younger adults, albeit for a few short moments, to contribute to their key demo-rating. It is instead the potential motion picture nominees themselves that will have everyone talking. There is director Ang Lee's controversial gay-cowboy picture, Brokeback Mountain, a film likely to arouse (no sexual pun intended) the pro-gay marriage advocates of California's certifiable liberal base. Here's a puzzler - how does Ang Lee go from directing The Hulk to a romantic-drama about homosexual cowboys in Wyoming? George Clooney, perennial poster boy for the Hollywood left, has two politically controversial pictures up his sleeve - the anti-Joseph McCarthy diatribe, Good Night and Good Luck, and director Stephen Gaghan's `blood for oil' leftist pamphlet piece, Syriana. If you can't recall who Stephen Gaghan is, he directed the Oscar nominated film, Traffic. Can't recall Traffic either? Don't worry, more then likely no one else can either. And what would the Academy Awards be without a tribute to the false-state of Palestine? This year the spineless Europeans honor Palestinian suicide bombers with their foreign-language contribution, Paradise Now. Yes, the same homicidal maniacs who have made the Middle East region the certifiable blood bath it is today. There is no word at this time as to whether film distributor Warner Independent Pictures has chosen to follow former-Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's lead and compensate families of suicide bombers. However, it appears that the most controversial of them all is director Steven Spielberg's `semi-historical' drama, Munich, a portrayal of the events following the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Pro-Israeli advocates, not to mention the Israeli population in general, have come down hard on the Academy Award-winning director of Schindler's List, a tribute to the innocent victims of the Holocaust during World War II, going so far as to claim publicly that he is no longer a `friend of Israel'. My, how times have changed.<br /><br />Saying the least about it, the story for Munich is perfect. Perfect that is in the sense that is nothing short of a flawless piece of revisionist history drawn from the pulpit of self-loathing Jews, Palestinian terrorists, and the liberal rhetoric of Hollywood elitists. Steven Spielberg's Munich has two fundamental flaws going against it in terms of the film's claim of historical accuracy and legitimacy. First, the George Jonas novel, Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, on which the script is primarily based upon, has been widely discredited leaving most historical and literary critics to regard its contents as a work of complete fiction. Jonas fails to support claims by Yuval Aviv that he was the inspiration for Avner and that he participated in Mossad operations to retaliate against Palestinian terrorists involved with the Munich massacre with either interviews or public statements. Ha'aretz journalist Yossi Melman revealed that Aviv, through investigative reports, "had a special fondness for conspiracy theories, and it turned out that he was willing to hire out his services to anyone who was willing to pay". The other tragic flaw of this film is playwright Tony Kushner, an openly gay and admittedly self-loathing Jew, who was brought in personally by director Steven Spielberg to rewrite the script originally penned by Eric Roth. Kushner has stated that the creation of the Jewish state of Israel in 1948 was a "historical, moral, political calamity" for the Jewish people and believes adamantly that the sole intent of the Israeli government is to "systematic attempt to destroy the identity of the Palestinian people".<br /><br />Lest it be forgotten, let us make one thing perfectly clear - there never was nor will there ever be a nation called Palestine. The term `Palestine' is a modern word used to define the Middle East legion which prior to World War I was a loose association of Arab tribes which would eventually be placed under the yoke of Nazi imperialism during World War II. The British in 1917 promised the Jews the formation of their own nation, Israel, with the signing of the Balfour Declaration, a promise which was eventually upheld in 1948. There exists no Palestinian `refugee problem' today because refugees can not exist if there is no land from which they happen to be displaced from to begin with. The disdainful Arab nations which encircle the entire nation-state of Israel refuse to take in their own so that they may be used as a prominent example of the `atrocities' the Jews have committed and that Israel may forever be used as a scapegoat for their cruelty and malice.<br /><br />Overall, Munich, albeit skillfully choreographed, suitably acted out, and brilliantly scored by long-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams, lacks the sufficient credibility in its anti-Israel/pro-Palestinian rhetoric driven storyline to make it a truly riveting historical drama. Munich's most glaring weakness, Kushner's screenplay, is so extreme in its revisionist interpretation of historical events it is likely to maker even pseudo-`documentarian' Michael Moore blush. Frankly the film is not all bad. Spielberg went to extraordinary lengths in the short few months of its production (filming began in July 2005, days after his two-hundred million dollar blockbuster, War of the Worlds, opened in theatres) to have nearly every scene in Munich reflect the styles, the culture, and the atmospheric feel of the 1970s.<br /><br />First off, much to the embarrassment of Judaism in general, Spielberg and Kushner establish a level of confusion with their own twisted sense of moral relativism when it comes to the interpretation of the specific values and principles on which the Jewish religion is founded upon, an action which is hardly surprising given their fall out from their homeland. After an all too brief scene in which the Israeli athletes in Munich are taken hostage by terrorist agents of Black September, Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir is seen meeting with Israeli officials to construct a plan of retaliation against the Palestinians for the massacre. In this meeting she states, "Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values", which of course is in reference to Israel's plans to assassinate suspected members of the terrorist organization, Black September. Although Spielberg and Kushner would like it to appear as though the Jews are doing exactly that in responding to the blatant act of terrorism in Munich, this is in fact far from the truth. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an entertainment reporter for Belief.net, in his assessment of the Spielberg picture clarifies on this issue, "The Talmud [a record of rabbinic discussions on Jewish law, ethics, customs, legends and stories] clearly establishes that one who comes to murder you must first be killed themselves. Those who have devoted their lives to killing innocent people have erased the image of God from their countenances and have therefore erased their right to life". It is rather Christianity which advocates the concept of `turning the other cheek' against your enemies and even then it does no such thing in suggesting that total submission be taken whenever a force seeks to commit harm against you or your loved ones.<br /><br />The false Golda Meir, a woman who in her historical context was the Margaret Thatcher of the newly founded Jewish state, offers further words of wisdom. When an Israeli official questions how this action of retaliation against the Palestinians will corrupt efforts for peace in the region, she argues, "forget peace for now, we have to be strong". Peace and strength, while distinctly different entities, are in no way incompatible with each other contrary to popular liberal mythology. Strength would hardly be an option had Al Gore been elected president when September 11th occurred, nor would there be peace. Terrorists, particularly al Qaeda, prey upon the indecisive, the timid, the weak and exploit peace deals and negotiation efforts to their utmost advantage as President Jimmy Carter can clearly vouch for. Any time in which Israel or the United States of America have flexed their muscles and stood up to those who seek to destroy our very way of life, only then have we gained the respect of the world. They may not like us for it, but we have garnered to respect.<br /><br />In his screenplay Kushner then proceeds to scold Israel for the bombing of Palestinian `refugee camps' in Syria and Lebanon four days following the Munich massacre which killed two-hundred people. And yet he fails to mention that two years earlier Jordan slaughtered ten-thousand Palestinians with the surviving refugees fleeing to the West Bank in Israel. This act was the true inspiration for the terrorist organization behind the Munich massacre, Black September.<br /><br />The tragic events of the Munich massacre which took place on September 5th, 1972, are never shown in their entirety together. Rather they are spread throughout the two hour and twenty minute motion picture. Most distressing and disturbing of all, the actual slaughter of the nine remaining Israeli athletes in the midst of a failed rescue attempt by German authorities is spliced with scenes of Avner having sex with his wife. The actual climax of the massacre is Avner literally climaxing. It is here that Spielberg as a filmmaker makes his most egregious error. Rather then memorialize the unmitigated slaughter of these eleven Israeli athletes with a proper theatrical tribute he instead chooses to trivialize their deaths, shaping events to his liking so they suit his agenda. The separation of the actual massacre of the Israeli athletes from the beginning of the film drives home Spielberg's point that `violence begets violence, blood begets blood' and that the Munich massacre was merely a response to a response. Spielberg in his Judaist backpedaling fails to acknowledge what exactly the Palestinian kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes was in response to but, as with most leftist revisionist history, facts and the truth are merely an afterthought.<br /><br />Furthermore, Spielberg in his depiction of historical events which soon followed the Munich massacre conspicuously leave out important details and significantly alter audience's perceptions of the state of Israel. This includes the Arab nations at the Munich Olympics who refused to lower their flags to half-staff in light of the tragedy, essentially endorsing Black September and the terrorist attack which took place there. And let's not forget the International Olympic Committee's refusal to construct a permanent memorial to the eleven slain Israeli athletes out of fear of `offending' those hostile to Israel. More importantly however Spielberg chooses to depict the response to the Munich massacre, in this case the assassination of eleven individuals in connection to Black September, as immediate and unrelenting when in fact it was never initialized until after October 29th, 1972, when Germany released the three surviving Black September kidnappers after a German jet carrying them was hijacked. The Germans suspiciously did this so that the three survivors would not face trial and implicate the German government, still reeling from fall out of the Holocaust during World War II, for the haphazard response.<br /><br />Although it is Spielberg's intention to place the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team agents on the same moral footing as the Palestinian terrorists of Black September and the PLO, each group's portrayal in the film is significantly different. Only one of the three targets the Mossad agents pursue is shown committing the loathsome acts of terrorism for which they are accused. Instead they are portrayed as either kindly old men or inoperative political activists with adorable children. The Mossad agents are not given such a luxury. They are seen basking in the deaths of those they target. They scrutinize over every dollar spent in pursuit of their objectives. And one agent's tilted argument, "The only blood that matter to me is Jewish blood", in response to another agent questioning the amount of collateral damage their bombs meant for their targets may cause shows them to be fideists. They are everything short of complete and utter monsters.<br /><br />True, Spielberg falls short of portraying the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team as total miscreations. For example, Avner and a fellow agent risk blowing their cover when they realize that a call received by the phone built with a remote detonator explosive placed in the target's apartment has been answered by the target's young daughter and alert their other team members waiting in a nearby car to abort the mission. In spite of evidence in the film to suggest that the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team avoided as much collateral damage as physically possible, risking their lives just to confirm the identity of their target via matching photos with the suspects' faces before they are killed, Spielberg in the end argues that these assassinations were all for naught. Since so few of the targets who were killed had direct links to the Munich massacre, though they were undoubtedly in some form or another associated with the PLO, the only contribution their deaths made was in the creation of more terrorists who were even worse then the ones Mossad eliminated in the first place. This is the same demented, twisted logic the rhetorical left uses in opposing U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their suggestion that going after terrorists for the slaughter of innocent civilians will only lead to more aggressive attacks on our own soil is laughably preposterous. They would rather have our head buried in the ground with our butts high in the air just waiting for the other shoe of Islamic fascism to come down on us rather then respond to it. Let's get something straight here - killing terrorists does not create more terrorists. Did killing Nazis during World War II create more Nazis? Did arresting Klu Klux Klan members create more Klansmen? No, so why would it be any different in this situation? It is a tragically flawed logic; one sadly the radical left in this country seems intent on sticking to. In that case, let us no longer try and prevent murder, rape, underage sex, substance abuse, child molestation, or any crime whatsoever because apparently any effort we make to prevent such activities will only create more rapists, murderers, drug users, and terrorists, so it is best just to let it sort itself out.<br /><br />This brings us to what is unquestionably the most insulting image in Munich. In the final scene of the film Avner, played by Troy's Eric Bana, meets with Ephraim, his Mossad handler, in a park and tells him he can no longer return to Israel because it is not the moral haven it once was. As the two depart, the camera slowly pans over a 1970s New York City skyline and remains transfixed for a time on the haunting image of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. It does not take a genius to figure out what Spielberg and Kushner mean to suggest here. September 11th is our Munich. A response to a response - nothing more. They mean to suggest that the tragic deaths of both the eleven Israeli athletes in Munich and the nearly three thousand American citizens in NYC, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania were brought upon ourselves. Their lives should be honored, yes, but not in response against those who committed these acts of treachery. Heaven knows, why bother battling cancer if a cure has yet to be found. Better to succumb to despair and die with `dignity' then fight to the bitter end and only make a dent in it. What honor is there in that? For those on the left who like the five year old children they mirror with their petty partisan squabbling who have yet to grasp the concept of sarcasm, everything!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Coming off the huge-budget success of his remake of War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg is back with another of his "issue" movies in Munich, and the result is not only one of his best movies yet but easily one of the best of the decade so far.  Concerning the Israeli response to the infamous terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics that resulted in the deaths of 11 Israeli competitors, Munich largely follows the Israeli contingent charged with killing the Black September planners behind the assault.  Obviously it has extra significance in the here and now, when fears of terrorism are so rampant, but Munich makes for a great watch anyway simply because it's so effective in its portrayal of the forces that drive people to devote so much time, energy, and resources to kill each other when they could be engaged in more constructive activities.  The technical abilities of Spielberg and his sidemen are of course on full display, but more than Spielberg's other serious movies (Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, most notably), the chief source of Munich's success lies in its nuanced portrayal of such complicated and touchy subject matter.<br /><br />Easily manipulated automatons, er, I mean patriots of any stripe may not find Munich to their liking, but it contains more than enough subtle shadings and moral ambiguity to please thinking viewers.  With ample room to operate given its considerable running time, Munich eventually develops into three movies: a taut political thriller, a complex examination of vengeance, and a harrowing look into the recesses of one man's mind.  Its blunt depictions of violence, emotional intensity, and frequent gallows humor may be unpleasant, but much like in The Pianist, discomfort is the name of the game here.  And much as the Pianist's tale of simple, brute survival could be applied to situations other than the Holocaust, Munich's (admittedly somewhat fictionalized) revenge story has a resonance well beyond the Middle East, which I'm sure is what Spielberg intended.<br /><br />Although it's told almost entirely from a Jewish point of view, the brilliance of Munich lies mainly in the fact that it doesn't ask the viewer to take sides (in spite of some of the rather shallow criticisms I've seen on this site and elsewhere), but instead examines the endless cycle of retaliation in a way that makes each side's case look both equally sensible and equally insane.  While it's mercifully short on long-winded oratory, the dialogue still frequently touches on the fact that each side thinks its claim to Israel is perfectly legitimate, and that there's plenty of guilt in the conflict to around.  Spielberg doesn't attempt to cover up the brutality of the Palestinian assualt in Munich, but as one member of the Israeli hit team notes, Arabs weren't the inventors of bloodshed.  Granted, we only hear second-hand about the Israeli government's less-than-warm-and-fuzzy treatment of its Palestinian population, but there's enough discussion of it to pierce any veneer of righteousness in Isreal's actions. Violence against civilians is a double-edged sword, the movie seems to be saying, one that people only notice when their own are the victims.<br /><br />Since the story is mostly told through the eyes of one man, it's a good thing Eric Bana is so chillingly convincing as Avner, a low-level Mossad agent and quiet family man given the task of leading the Israeli hit team.  Despite his lack of experience, Avner actually makes the perfect man for his job, as the nature of his work may give him pause, but in the end he compartmentalizes, accepts the justifications he's given, and kills whom he's told to kill.  As the movie makes clear, it's essential to any war or war-type conflict that we get by the fact that our enemies are every bit as human as we are, much as we might like to pretend otherwise.  Avner isn't one to stop and think carefully about what he's doing (at least until he's done, anyway), so it takes on added weight at the end of the movie when he does finally realize how little he's accomplished.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as we all know by now, this story doesn't have a happy ending, and the events of the past thirty years weigh heavily on Munich.  Of course, if everyone had made up back in the '70's, the subject matter wouldn't seem quite as important.  In the end, this movie supports a conclusion I reached a while back: the world would be a much better place if humankind declared a mulligan on all of history up till now, admitted every group has done some naughty things, and started over.  Of course, since the odds of that happening are about the same as the chances of the Red Sox winning the next Super Bowl, I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Most people over the age of 40 remember the terrible events surrounding the killing of the 1972 eleven-member Israeli Olympic team by a group of Palestinian extremists. Their abduction from Munich and ultimate death pulled a shroud over the games. Because of this horrific event, security at subsequent Olympic games has been ratcheted up significantly. But that's not why we're here discussing Steven Spielberg's film. We're here to see why I didn't give it a resounding "Thumbs Up".<br /><br />Historically MUNICH is interesting. Not only does it show the horrors mankind can inflict upon one another, but it also shows the repercussions of reacting in an equal measure of violence to such an event. When Israel decides to form a death squad and send them out to eliminate the terrorists who dealt the deadly blows to the Israeli Olympians, a message we've heard a million times comes a-smackin' us in the face: evil begets evil.<br /><br />The acting is fairly blas&eacute; with the exception of the main character, Avner (Eric Bana TROY.) In fact, I can't recall a single other memorable person in the film. I remember that there's a bomb-maker, a clean-up man, and a couple of shooters, but that's all I remember of them.<br /><br />The length of the film is extreme. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, nodding off was almost inevitable. Mr. Spielberg is, perhaps, spoiled in that he can do whatever he wants in Hollywood and for as long as he wants (the remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS being a prime example.)<br /><br />I don't mean to belittle the atrocious circumstances surrounding this true story, nor do I mean to invalidate the message Steven Spielberg so desperately wants to get across to us. It's a vital and unfortunate part of human history. But I felt the story lagged and was forced upon the viewer rather than coming across in a fluid manner.<br /><br />Although I watched and enjoyed the Oscars this year, MUNICH stood out as the "stinker" in the Best Film category. I would've much preferred to see HUSTLE AND FLOW in the mix instead of this flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>All I remember is that 11 innocent guys who are half naked get shot for no reason at all.

This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe. But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing "struggle" for "order." Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time. This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of "liberty" and "property," but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well. In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.<br /><br />The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the core of Steven Spielberg's "Munich." The massacre of the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing. Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded. There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village. Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that "they're all gone" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing. But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he has to do and later for what he has done.<br /><br />Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich. Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them. His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done. Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.<br /><br />We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed. But the first has translated "The Arabian Nights" into Italian. The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich. They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics. But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist? Avner gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avner knows. Meanwhile, as Avner and his men cross more names off of their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.<br /><br />"Munich" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre. What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich. The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book "Vengeance" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable. While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible. But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members. Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home. Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.<br /><br />I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God. Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God. The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better. It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight. The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing. What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel "Munich" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>Scary movie.

But that doesn't matter, for three reasons: (a) perhaps no one outside the world of espionage knows what really happened, (b) the movie is self-described as only "inspired by" real events, and (c) what matters is the broader message, not the details.<br /><br />And that broader message is quite obvious, indeed commonplace, if you can rise above a strongly partisan viewpoint.  The message is that when two distinct and clannish groups desperately want the same piece of land as their home, and neither group can eliminate the other, conflict and violence will tend to be perpetuated, resulting in a lose-lose outcome.  At the same time, there's some hope of compromise and peace if each group comes to recognize the faults in its own ideology and actions, appreciates that the other side isn't entirely wrong, and recognizes a shared humanity.  So there are two tensions operating in parallel: (a) between the two groups, and (b) within each group, between making concessions in order to compromise versus continuing to fight (at whatever mutual cost) until the other group has been utterly defeated.  At a more specific level, a related message is that assassinations and terrorism may keep pressure on the other side, but they ultimately only contribute to perpetuating the conflict rather than resolving it.<br /><br />The movie depicts all of this quite clearly, and thereby does a service in helping us better understand the problem.  At nearly 3 hours, it's quite long, but it kept my attention, so I didn't mind.  As some reviewers have noted (ignore the extremists), it isn't a perfect movie (hence my 4-star rating), but I still recommend it to people who want to better understand why these types of conflicts are so difficult to resolve.<br /><br />Finally, here's my proposed solution to the problem.  Forget about the current Palestinian territories and instead give the northmost third of Israel to the Palestinians.  Provide the Palestinians with quality infrastructure, fully cover their relocation costs, and provide them with plenty of seed money, all of this paid for by Israel and international aid.  Help the Palestinians establish a credible democratic government with adequate military backing.  Last but not least, place Jerusalem under UN control, with everyone having guaranteed safe access to it, including a dedicated highway from the new Palestine to Jerusalem.  That's all it takes: allow each group to continue to exist, physically seperate the two groups, allow each group to have quality land within the current territory, and throw some money at the problem where needed.  Can we please implement this solution soon, so that everyone can move on to other issues?</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>Stephen Spielberg is one of our time's greatest directors.  The fact that he can balance out a real artistic vision while remaining unashamedly mainstream is truly remarkable.  Still, in movie after movie there is a groan-point.  A character will make a speech, or a scene dripping with sentimentality intrudes into what up that point has been a nearly perfect film (Schindler's List is a prime example, Saving Private Ryan also has its moments).  After so many years of watching Spielberg efforts however, I'm throwing in the towel.  Spielberg, I'm convinced, doesn't do this out of calculation; it's who he is:  an American director who loves nostalgia and sentiment.  And to be honest, to see the alternative is easy enough to do.  Spielberg is not David Lynch - a great, but weird, director.  No, he's Main Street without the teeming dark corners.  Oh, there's darkness with Spielberg, but light as well, and Hope.<br /><br />So where does that leave Munich?  I think in a pretty good place.  The only "speech" that I heard, the kind that Spielberg cannot resist, popped up at the two hour mark, and it was pretty brief.  Something about revenge being endless.  (Still, I confess I'm mystified by those critics who have damned this movie because of its ambiguity.)  As usual, with Spielberg, great actors and performances, and a pretty fast moving movie for being close to three hours.  It grabs you from the first moment. My only real criticism is the way Spielberg chose to unveil the Munich massacre.  Dramatically it didn't seem to serve much purpose, since the event is unveiled in bits and pieces, with the climax (no pun intended) revealed while the chief Israeli assassin makes anguished love with his wife.  That just seemed weird - and not in a good David Lynch sort of way.  Just clunky.  I think a straightforward telling of the Munich attack would of worked just as well.  But it doesn't sink the movie, or irritate in the way past Spielberg moments have.  Definitely worth a watch, though I'm not sure it's the resonating piece on our times that Spielberg intended.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>How many more classic films can Spielberg make? I expected this to be good, but a running time of 2hrs 37mins was a black mark in my book before I'd seen a frame. However it is another classic, not as great a film as Schindlers List, but in many ways as moral a tale, but on a smaller scale.<br /><br />How accurate the film is I have no idea, however the opening credits say "inspired by true events" and the killing of 11 Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village in 1972 did happen and I don't think there is any doubt that revenge in one form or another was sort. In some ways the filmmaking style harks back to the 1970's as well. There is a gritty realism reminisent of the French Connection films here and you won't find a modern "high octane" thriller here (usually film advertised with that phrase are awful).<br /><br />Eric Bana plays Avner, one of five chosen to find and kill the people who planned the attack. As the film progresses we see the doubts creep into Avner's mind about what he's doing. In fact in essence the message of this movie is "killing people f**ks you up". The only reason it won't is if you are either already a religious extremist or a complete psychotic. The performances are all good and the rest of the cast is very strong. As well as Bana there is Daniel Craig and Geoffery Rush.<br /><br />This is an intelligent film that asks some serious questions about an eye for an eye etc, but don't let that put you off. It is still a cracking good thriller and Spielberg once again shows why he is the most successful director in the history of cinema, as well as being one the most talented as well (success and talent do not always go together!).</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>If Munich was just a Hollywood movie about a group of guys out to kill every member of a group of terrorists responsible for killing their friends, then this movie of revenge would had had so much more potential.  As it is, it is based on the true story of Islamic terrorists from a group Black September that take the Israeli Olympic team hostage at the 1972 Olympic games and kill 9 of them in a resulting rescue attempt. The Israeli Mossad creates a covert team to kill in secrecy every single person responsible from Black September responsible for that attack.<br /><br />When Stephen Spielberg decided to make a movie based on the events of Munich, that instantly created a lot of expectations. I expect that a majority of Americans, regardless of political affiliation, see that what the Mossad did as justified. To make a movie about the Munich events and turn it into a celebration of what the Mossad did, a revenge flick, might have been the popular thing to do. I personally believe Israel had every right to retalliate the way it did, and believe the Palestinians deserved the fate they got in this movie. But I'm not naive to believe the Palestinians don't have a complaint about how they've been treated at times.<br /><br />So, I went into this movie knowing it had received bad reviews and some cited it as revisionist history or basically saying what the Mossad did was just as bad as what Black September did. First of all, the movie is long but extremely well made. The story moves swifly and the violence is brutal.  Eric Bana plays Avner, the Mossad agent assigned the task of killing the Black September members one by one. Avner accepts the task and begins working with his team, which includes future Bond Daniel Craig. They buy information and carry out the executions. There are problems at times and the group must deal with faulty equipment and collateral damage.  But the ultimate villian they must face is the fact that just as they are hunting, they are now being hunted. Soon, they realize they must be on the lookout for attacks against them. At the same time, the weight of what they are doing begins to eat away at Avner's core. The killings are changing him, and they are keeping him away from his wife and newborn child.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the true events of the Munich retalliation to comment on whether or not this movie got the historical facts correct. I do know many commented that the movie was a statement on the USA's current war on terror. Maybe that is correct, but Israel's been fighting the war on terror for years. I think Munich made points not for the benefit of today's Iraq war, but to show that what people assume is true now, was also true then. For one example, the point is made that when a member of Black September is killed, he is just replaced by someone else. So, what good does it do to kill one if a new one will take its place. This is a point to consider, but the movie never really takes a side. This is a movie really about a man, Avner, played excellently by Eric Bana. He eagerly fulfills his duty to his country, but the weight of his actions ultimately are too much for him to handle.<br /><br />In conclusion, you won't be able to watch this movie without giving at least some thought the the history behind it as well as the current situation in Iraq.  That being said, I think you'll be able to enjoy this movie regardless of your political beliefs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>"Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values... Forget peace now. We have to show them we're strong." Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister, September 1972.<br /><br />This movie is not a factual recount of 1972 slayings of Israeli Olympic athletes by the members of Palestinian terrorist group "Black September" in Munich, Germany even though it is based on the real events. After the murders, a group of Mossad agents are sent to Europe to track down and assassinate the Black September members responsible. What the movie explores is how in doing so with burning desire to find and punish the murderers, in following the ancient law of an eye for an eye, the searchers for justice nearly become terrorists themselves. You can't just look into abyss and stay the same because, "When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you."<br /><br />In his new, easily one of the best films he ever made (in the same line as "Shindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan"), Spielberg looks at terrorism from many different angles. He does not justify killings, and there are many, many terrifying killings in his film and behind every death there is a human character and every character is a real person, not cartoonish villain or a super-hero. Devastating, powerful, and controversial this film will split the audiences and will have as many admirers as haters.<br /><br />4.5/5 or 9/10</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Months after the hype and debate, Munich stands up well to re-examination. The London sequences still look like they were shot in Hungary and the film's avoidance of the Lillehammer incident, and indeed the fact that its protagonists never truly cross the line in any of their actions tends to make it far more partisan than its makers believe. But the strengths far outweigh the flaws. Easily the best of this year's Best Picture nominees, it goes to great lengths to humanize its targets, and does so without the kind of speechifying that constantly stopped Black Sunday in its tracks. Despite the effort, it still ends up less about the moral quagmire of the Arab-Israeli conflict and more a film about the dehumanising effect on the film's righteous killers as skirted issues of moral doubt give way to the very paranoia they earlier joked about. Not that the politics aren't raised - Black September retaliation for the killings leads one of the squad to comment "We're in dialogue" while the much-criticized staircase scene does at least remain true to the characters by having THEIR dialogue limited to their own equally narrow perceptions - but the film's real ambiguity is more psychological than political or even moral. Even when the hunters become the hunted and the possibility that they're informers are also informing on them, the film avoids black and white answers: while two Israelis are definitely killed by a team hunting the assassination squad, a third is much more doubtful.<br /><br />It's a fine piece of filmmaking, too, despite the odd mis-step, never feeling its 164-minute length and throwing in some excellent moments of tension as the inexperienced killers botch their way through their hit list. The period reconstruction is generally excellent (it has the look of Frankenheimer's French Connection II had it been shot in Scope, and makes equally good use of French actors), there's the Devil in the details (beds catching fire after being machine-gunned, the ever-changing kitchens in the showroom window that Avner looks longingly at as his home life becomes a faded memory, the glimpse of the twin towers in the final scene) and the characters genuinely look like they inhabit that era - indeed, Mathieu Almaric's murky underworld figure even looks like a younger Roman Polanski circa The Tenant.<br /><br />It also showcases the perfect choice for the new James Bond - though since Eric Bana wasn't interested, Daniel Craig turned out to be an excellent alternative, here giving delivering a convincingly blokeish 70s Afrikaaner. But despite mostly strong ensemble performances, it's really Bana's show, and he responds with an impressively intelligently physical performance - first seen clenching and unclenching his fist as he watches TV coverage of the massacre, desperate to do something, posture ramrod straight when he accepts the mission but ultimately shrinking within himself as it takes its psychological toll. Spielberg's best in years, and his first film with a decent ending in more than a decade, it deserved a better reception than it found. It also deserved a better DVDrelease than the current single-disc edition that replaced the extremely limited 2-disc pressing.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg scores again.  One might initially look at this film as an advocacy for revenge.  It isn't.<br /><br />The story takes place after "Black September" in which Israeli hostages were killed during the Munich Olympic games.  It is about an elite team of Israeli assassins who are charged with finding the masterminds behind Black September and eliminating them.  It is a story about revenge.<br /><br />Eric Bana delivers a powerful performance as Avner, an Israeli man who appears to be enjoying the life he is living with his young wife who is pregnant with their child.  Avner is recruited and asked to perform a difficult task for the sake of the country of Israel.<br /><br />Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush) is the Israeli who is in charge of making sure that Avner is able to carry out his duty as well as providing him with four other men as well as unlimited funds to acquire the necessary intelligence concerning the whereabouts of the men they're supposed to kill.<br /><br />Avner finds, initially, that the first couple of targets are difficult to carry out for him, especially emotionally.  He all but panics when he realizes that the young daughter of one of his targets has gone back inside the apartment (since they've agreed not to kill civilians).<br /><br />At first it seems that Avner and his team are having no trouble finding and eliminating their targets thanks to the help of Louis (Mathieu Almaric) and his father (Michael Lonsdale).  But then, one of the members of his own team is found dead in the bed of a woman who has obviously been hired to kill him.  Avner quickly realizes that the hunters have quickly become the hunted.  One by one members of his team are killed.  At first this compells him to kill those responsible as well as the men responsible for Black Sunday.<br /><br />Avner soon reaches a state of paranoia and distrust.  He doesn't know if Louis and his father have sold him out.  He doesn't know if the Israeli government may be behind it as well.  He soon finds himself sleeping the closet of his hotel room and longing to return to his wife and daughter who are living in New York.<br /><br />Avner concludes that the killing can never stop.  He finally understands that he, himself, will never be rid of the fear that he might be killed some day as well.  He realizes that vengeance only begets more vengeance.  Ephraim all but acknowledges this, even though he tries to reassure Avner of the "great work" he's done for his country.  Avner can no longer view it in these terms, as he doesn't even feel it is safe to return to Israel.<br /><br />One of the most compelling shots in this film is at the very end.  As I stated earlier, this film is about the dangers and sickness of "vengeance."  Spielberg ends the film with a shot of the two towers of the World Trade Center.  In his own way, he is stating that no amount of vengeance is justifiable.  Because, where does it end?  Avner realizes that for every person he's killed, more have risen to take their places.  In his heart, he understands that it causes only pain, and mostly to himself.<br /><br />Munich is a powerful, important film, which says a lot about the world we live in...because it doesn't have to be that way.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>At the 1972 Olympics in Munich, the terrorist group Black September kidnapped and murdered some Israeli atheletes.  This is the story of Isreal's response to this horrific event.  Avner (Bana) is chosen to lead a five-man team of ex-Mossad agents that are to track down and assassinate the 11 Palestinians responsible for the attack.  They are working unofficially for the government, through their handler, Ephraim (Rush), who provides them money and information.  For Avner, this is patriotism, and a chance to serve his country.<br /><br />The team travels the world locating and eliminating their targets.  He becomes focused and begins to lose himself with each passing murder.  Also, the hunters become the hunted, and soon they are guarding their own lives as well as trying to finish the job.  Plus, Black September begins retaliating, forcing Avner to question their actions and if those actions are actually making things better or worse.<br /><br />"Munich" is an excellent movie, showing a story that is very relevant today.  It is thought provoking and engaging.  Eric Bana is amazing as the conscience-tortured Avner who just wants to do the right thing.  His team (especially the new James Bond, Daniel Craig) are all excellent in their roles.  The story is fast paced, and full of action.  Director Stephen Speilberg has crafted another masterpiece.  "Munich" is an important film that I highly recommend be seen by all.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>My wife and I saw Munich without knowing very much about the story.  In fact, we thought the story would center on the tragic events of the Olympics rather than the search for the organizers of the massacre of the Israeli athletes.  We found the film to be a little long but with powerful performances, particularly by Eric Bana.  The story centers on Eric Bana's character Avner, who is given the assignment of leading one of the teams to assassinate the leaders of Black September.  The teams are made up of people who are not members of the Mossad since they can be easily recognized.  Avner is selected because having been born in Germany he can better pose as a European and with his background as Golda Meir's bodyguard his commitment is unquestionable.  Avner must cut himself off from all that he knows, including his pregnant wife.  He is working on his own with money placed in safety deposit boxes.  The members of his team are also non-Mossad members and without field experience.  They are motivated by their desire to avenge the murders of the athletes. Geoffrey Rush has an interesting role as Avner's coolly detached Mossad contact and Daniel Craig (the new James Bond) is one of the team members.<br /><br />Initially, one wonders how the inexperienced Avner can hope to assassinate all 11 members of Black September.  His information is supplied to him by a shadowy French group header by Michael Lonsdale (who was interesting to see again and was well-cast for the part) who is simply known as Papa. This unnamed group offers information to anyone who is willing to pay but as part of the conditions they will not deal with anyone representing a government.  The condition seemed rather academic since someone like Avner, acting on behalf of a government, can easily work with Papa's group as long as he can reasonably claim his non-association.<br /><br />At first, I was found the planning and execution of the assassinations fascinating as they groped to find a way to carry out their plans.  Their first target is simply shot on his way home then bombs become the weapon of choice used with unpredictable effect.  Stephen Spielberg given us an unbiased view of these events and presents the Palestinian side particularly through the character Ali, who explains to Avner his cause to take back the land that once belonged to Palestine will eventually succeed but only perhaps in 100 years. Avner believes, at first, that he can simply kill the 11 Black September members age stop killing.  But when others replace those who have been killed he questions what he is doing, particularly as members of his team are killed. This is the question that Stephen Spielberg has posed to all of us: How can the killing go on?  What does it solve?<br /><br />Munich has been criticized by all sides as being pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian; instead it is a mirror of events that are still played out today.  The conclusion of Munich shows that intractable ideas perpetuate themselves and that those who question why so much bloodshed has to be are left out in the cold, much like Geoffrey Rush's Mossad boss refuses to "break bread" with Avner.  The greatest flaw of the film is that it is too long. My wife and I were wondering how many assassinations were going to be shown before the story would take a different twist.  One also does not have much empathy with the characters as we ourselves begin the question if they are correct in killing their target or are they merely dupes of the Israeli government.  The film does awaken us to the realities behind the newspaper headlines of the moves and countermoves of people like Avner who can never feel safe and cannot leave behind the killings they have committed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>I wrestled with this one for a while. I should start by saying I have no strong opinions for or against either side here. But that probably won't stop some people from accusing me of bias this way or that. I also don't care if and whether Spielberg took some liberties with history to forge an allegory. Artists have been doing this since the beginning of time. You want a documentary on the events of Munich, go rent a documentary.<br /><br />I moderately enjoyed much of the film, even though I found the second half too long and too plodding. The opening is kinetic, the scenes of how the "gang" is formed is very engaging, and the first couple bombing sequences well done. In one of the most literal applications of a famous director's mantra I've ever seen applied to the screen, Spielberg has a bomb *nearly* go off with an innocent--a little girl--inside the apartment. The fact that it *doesn't* explode, at least right then, is the embodiment of Hitchcock's famous lesson about thrillers: "There's a bomb in the room and it goes off--that is shock; there's a bomb in the room and it doesn't go off--that is suspense."<br /><br />Yet, at the same time, that scene subliminally pricked in me a realization of exactly what is wrong with Munich. Hitch has a similar bomb scene--similar not in terms of plot but technique--in his Saboteur (1942), and here it is more effective. Why? Maybe it's because with Hitch we eat our cake and have it too. His bomb does go off, yet not in the way intended, and the result is even more shocking because of this. Spielberg treats his moment far more literally, and to me it consequently falls flat.<br /><br />And that, I realize more and more, was my biggest problem with Munich. Spielberg is too cautious, too earnest. This movie has that "I-Am-Aware-I-Am-Telling-An-Important-Story" quality to it. It's not a *bad* film, but it's not what it could have been. It's also, to me, not worth 2 hours and 45 minutes. A lot of incidents in the central section could have been cut or combined. There are some brilliant scenes--an assassin on a balcony sharing pleasantries with his victim moments before the kill, a mix-up where the Israeli commandoes and PLO hit men wind up book into the same safe-haven, a trip to a French country estate to meet the once-patriotic and now-disillusioned profiteers of the conflict--but mixed with these are moments that would be too banal to be in any routine caper: too many scenes explaining how bombs are made and planted, too many scenes of the main character wringing his moral hands, an uber-predictable change of heart after his wife gives birth to their child. (In any movie where the main character's wife gives birth while her husband is on a morally-challenging mission, you can bet either he's not coming back alive or he'll come back, but with a change of heart as he stares into the kid's eyes. Since this is a Spielberg movie I knew the former wasn't going to happen.)<br /><br />Maybe if the main character had started out hesitant in his task but had grown into a ruthless killer, or vice versa, or his wife and he were thinking of having a baby and in the end decided not to because of the horror, or decided they must because of the horror, to make a brighter tomorrow. Maybe he could have been an idealist thrown into a group of cold immoral killers and changed his mind through his relationship with his peers. Maybe he could have befriended one of the PLO guys they bumped into in the safe home and seen the other side...in short, anything except the conventional procession of events we got. It was rather pat, pretending to ask profound questions and settling for stock answers.<br /><br />Also, I think Spielberg (and other people, for that matter) are suggesting the cure for the wrong disease. Being reasonable and rational won't work with terrorists. Terrorism by definition is not reasonable and rational, nor do terrorists want to be reasoned with--they'd prefer death. That's their "thing. "  Maybe the film could have dealt with that realization--started the main character where he is at the end of the film--can't we all just get along?--and then had him realize terrorists don't WANT to. Any of these, I feel, would have been a better movie than what we got.<br /><br />But because of the conventional journey we get here, I'm afraid I arrived at the ending before our protagonist did. Not much of a catharsis for me, but rather a feeling of "I knew this is where we were headed--what took you so long?"<br /><br />Transfer to DVD is excellent, as would be expected, since Spiels is in total control. There is a second disk of featurettes on the making of the movie. It's interesting viewing, but not essential--again we get just what we'd expect, with EP Kathleen Kennedy praising her boss to the skies and all the actors talking about what a joy it is to work with Spielberg. The most interesting part was when the Jewish actors discussed how it was both difficult and cathartic to work with the Arab actors playing Palestinians, and how they bonded in real life.  That touched me more than anything in the movie itself.</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>It is poignantly fitting that the man who directed Schindler's List should book-end that tale of Jewish pain with MUNICH, a film that tells another side of this people's struggle to survive in a period when the Jews have a state and the ability to answer with something more than simple suffering.<br /><br />Spielberg claims that the good storyteller exercises 'empathy in every single direction', a project that raises howls whenever it is applied to the Israel-Arab conflict. Or, as this film styles it with historical accuracy, the Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the same dry grove of the fathers' olive trees.<br /><br />Supported by star turns  from Eric Bana, Moshe Ivgy, and Michael Lonsdale and a haunting sequence in which Lynn Cohen plays an anguished Golda Meir - forced to the conclusion that 'every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values' - Spielberg's MUNICH manages to focus on the human drama played out by the soul of avengers everywhere. In the wake of the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, Bana's Avner is drafted as the unlikely lead agent of Meir's decision to prove that Israel must 'forget peace for now ... we have to show them that we are strong.'<br /><br />Avner carries out his role with taciturn determination, yet his eyes go moister and home calls the more compellingly as he scratches names off the list of eleven Palestinians who must be eliminated in order to show just how costly it is to mess with Israel.<br /><br />That 'family matters' is an affirmation of relative priorities kept by all parties in this film is a theme that Spielberg returns to at measured intervals. In the meantime, Avner and his team of avengers find themselves increasingly struggling with 'the mice inside your skull'. Resolution comes in the end through family itself. But it is a resolution that leaves stained, limping men, not the 'neat, durable men' whom Prime Minister Meir confesses to admiring in the film's early minutes.<br /><br />This is a film that must be seen by those who care about those conflicts that are fought in memory of the fathers, not least the one that still rages and promises to rage on in a small slice of land just to the east of the Mediterranean Sea.<br /><br />Spielberg has told the tale with astonishing evenness, though it is possible that this conclusion can only be reached from the more or less comfortable distance of this reviewer.  Empathy - even that which the director claims to have exercised 'from ever single angle' - hardly seems a virtue to the true-to-life antagonists of this particular conflict. For some considerable time more, blood will continue to flow in the name of the fathers. Avengers who rise up to even the score will themselves come to know the salt of their own tears, and trudge home to find comfort in family.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg has often been the focus of a lot of criticism throughout a career of blockbusters and Oscar-winning films like SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but I don't think the criticism has been as intense towards him as it has been to MUNICH.  Here he is, taking on the subjects of terrorism and vengeance--and there are all these people, condemning him not only for doing it, but for the very way he's doing it.  Why is this?<br /><br />Well, for one thing, he takes as his starting point the murder of eleven Israeli athletes by Black September terrorists at the Olympic Games in Munich on September 5, 1972, and how Israel responded to it.  The Israeli agents, led by a devout Jew (Eric Bana), are assigned to go after the eleven Palestinian masterminds behind the Munich massacre and kill them.  But the more these agents kill, the more they realize that their actions are not only leading to more bloodshed, they themselves are not just the hunters but also, in many respects, the hunted.  For every terrorist, whether actual or supposed, that they assassinate, one more pops up somewhere around the world.<br /><br />This last point is the point that Spielberg is the most intent on making clear--vengeance is only so good up to a point, and then one must ask, at what price?  It is the kind of ambiguity that is rife in the real world, and a lot of people with very fanatical views don't want to be confronted with that kind of reality, and particularly not in America after the 9/11 attacks.  Contrary to what its detractors would say, Spielberg never condemns Israel for its post-Munich actions--NOT ONCE.  But he is asking some straightforward questions about what the costs are for mere vengeance, not only in human lives, but also, and most especially, in human souls, be they Jewish or Arab.  The film's final shot, across the Hudson River to the twin towers of the World Trade Center is Spielberg's way of saying that now the issue of the cost of vengeance applies to his own country as well.<br /><br />Although a very long film at close to two hours and 45 minutes, MUNICH still moves with lightning precision, tension, and documentary-like camerawork, utilizing television footage from the actual events at Munich, and describing how the operations of Bana's team are often carried out on the fly and with always bloody, and sometimes imperfect results.  This is definitely NOT the kind of us-versus-them film that the American far-right likes, but it's the way the real world often works, and it's the way Spielberg sees it.  All of his skills as a director are put to the fullest possible use to make MUNICH yet another feather in his cap as Hollywood's premiere prestige filmmaker.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`Munich' (2006) is a powerful, intense, sobering and complex examination into the unseen world of international espionage and political revenge. If you enter into viewing this film with a pre-conceived worldview or mindset that is wired to accept only clearly defined categories such as black and white, right and wrong, good and evil and them and us, fasten your seatbelt and prepare for a paradigm shift.<br /><br />The film begins with the massacre of the Israeli athletic squad at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany by the PLO and moves on from that heart wrenching historical event to weave a fictional tale of Israel's response through a convert scheme to hunt down and assassinate those responsible. At first it seems self evident as to which side is justified in their endeavor and which side deserve no reprieve from their impending punishment.<br /><br />However as the web of intrigue deepens, ethics tested and unavoidable compromises made the line between the righteous and the unrighteous slowly begins to blur and ultimately disappear. Matters are further complicated by the discovery of other covert groups, political and non political, with agendas that may hamper the Israeli game plan.<br /><br />The viewer will have much to consider by the end of the film. All the traditional questions such as "those who live by the sword, die by the sword', or "violence begets violence" come to mind as well as new ones that maybe you haven't considered. Emotionally and mentally drained by the time the credits roll by one is ultimately one is left to wonder if there is any answer to the eternal cycle of hatred and violence at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>If no one noticed, Spielberg's movie is NOT the first filmed version of the Jonas book (and before that headlines in a series of articles by Jack Anderson).  That honor belongs to director Michael Anderson's (AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, LOGAN'S RUN) THE SWORD OF GIDEON.  It ran on HBO about 20 years earlier.  The cast included Steven Bauer, Michael York, Collen Dewhearst (as Golda Meair) and Rod Steiger in the role of the Mossad chief.  Search this one out and you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Many talented people invested a great deal of effort in the making of Munich, and this passion shows. (The actor playing the role of a Palestinian gunman pacing onto the balcony of the Israeli compound in exact sequence with the infamous real life footage was utterly chilling.) My lack of total and complete admiration for this film comes from the fact that the quality of the plot was drastically uneven, there was not enough story to match its long run-time, and I could not escape the suspicion that much of what I was watching onscreen was simply a fiction, not based on actual events as claimed. Munich ran out of gas too early and never quite found its message, so it tried unsuccessfully to be about many things. What Munich did nicely was raise the question of when justice mutates into revenge, and when preventative counter-attacks to prevent future terrorism themselves become terrorism. As a movie it was better than most of what gets made in American cinema today but it was also disappointing given what it could have been with so much talent behind it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>The opening sequence of "Munich" relies heavily on ABC news footage about the murders of Israeli Olympic athletes in 1972. They are the most frightening and harrowing things about this movie, if only because we know that this particular nightmare really did happen. What came after, as documented in the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743291646">Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team</a>," was that the Israeli government decided to covertly kill the men they had identified as having a hand in the Black September assassinations.<br /><br />From there, "Munich" plods and meanders, striking a poor balance between the dreadful acts of Black September with the emotional/psychological state of Avner (Eric Bana, excellent here) and his cohorts. The dramatizations of the revenge killing do overstate what really happened - according to the book - and a very important endpoint is omitted. Avner is unceremoniously dumped by his employers once he backs away from this assignment; no money, no identity and no proof about what he did. It makes the final blathering about "The Cycle of Violence" ring a little false as Steven Spielberg pulls away from Avner and Ephrain (Geoffrey Rush, also well done in a creepy way) to expose the World Trade Center. "Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values," intones Golda Mier as she issues the order to send assassins after the murders. Yet the questions begin to creep in over and over as the Black September organizers fall and are replaced...and Avner discovers that he and maybe his family have become the hunted...where does it end? Avner begins to pull away, bemoaning "Every man we've killed has been replaced by worse!"<br /><br />Other than the politics of the movie and the personal conflicts - there is a lot of talk about what it means to be a Jew and losing/keeping your soul - "Munich" is supposed to come off as a suspenseful spy flick. The passages between events are too long, the transitions too uncertain, however to maintain that suspense. The drawn out ending adds nothing to the movie, either. Reportedly edited on the fly with shots finalized within two days of shooting in some cases, one wonders what a little more time spent on a judicious edit might have accomplished. Tony Kushner's script is a stilted mess of pretensions and really could have been trimmed back.<br /><br />It leaves "Munich" as a movie with such potential to tell a story and offer a moral lesson trapped in a moribund film. Speilberg's breif explaining his motivations for "Munich" and wanting not to make a statement about Israel's morality but about the "unintended consequences" of violence at the begining of the DVD actually say more about the movie than the movie does! The horrors of Munich 1972 should not be forgotten, but this isn't the movie that captures why.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>We have gotten awfully used to the defense of inaction in this country. From Kindergarten on, we are told to turn the other cheek, tell the teacher, sticks and stones... blah, blah, blah. Here, however, is another take on this dilemma, one terribly relevant, it would seem, in this time of arbitrary killings, defended by grinning thugs. We can wring our collective hands or we can act. This film takes on this subject in a time when America's revenge genre, the Western, has gone out of fashion. "Munich" really is "The Unforgiven" set in Europe. The killers are hunted down and killed in return. It's more or less as simple as that, but here one is asked to identify with the assassins and to ask oneself if it would be as easy as it may have seemed, in so many movies where the good guys catch up with the bad guys. It's a film built around an ethical issue, a real issue, it seems to me. The film is not fully satisfying, but it is hard to say why. The acting is fantastic. I came away thinking the ending was weak. The entire sequence is New York seemed soft and sentimental suddenly and out of keeping with the film. The screen play by Kushner has other weaknesses. For example, I had trouble accepting that these guys would be so amateurish. Each killing is botched, which, were the assassins American, would seem believable but, given that they are Israeli, the finest intelligence units the world, it seemed somehow contrived. The setting is great, the subject matter thankfully adult, and it is finally a political film, which is a rare and fine thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Of all of Spielberg's serious films, the ones that get the most attention are Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. The former was a masterpiece, a true testament that he's more than a blockbuster director responsible for directing Jaws and Jurassic Park. The latter was an unflinching look into war during World War II but I preferred Schindler's List better. That is until Munich where sure it didn't have the impact of the other 2 but as overall film, I find myself wanting to watch this again which is rare since the other 2 didn't even do that. While it does have its problems, the story and the filmmaking talent on hand prove to me Munich should've won Best Picture.<br /><br />The story is based on one of those "it could've happened/might not have happened" stories so it's purely speculative and dramatized. During the 1972 Olympic Games, terrorists held athletes of the Israeli Olympic team hostage. Eventually all 11 were killed so the government wanted those responsible brought to justice. They get Avner, the Prime Minister's former bodyguard, to lead the way with a team of 4 to track down those responsible. What they find though is that this is not a battle easily won and there's more on the line than just casualties.<br /><br />After shooting the cool-but-immensely-flawed War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg jumped right in and shot Munich incredibly quickly. The result was an incredibly captivating look into how we try to fix the world's heavy problems but finding it too difficult to know when it'll end. The fact it's not an incoherent mess is one thing, but the fact it's to me one of his best films is quite a feat. You can always count on him to have memorable images and certain scenes, such as a scene entirely in silence is riveting while a transition from a bullet-riddled wall to rain against a window is just as great.<br /><br />The casting is quite dead-on too with the standout being Eric Bana. He had the right idea with Hulk but it was probably just the direction for that movie but here he seems quite tortured but then you see someone get back some of that humanity he feels he's losing when his daughter calls him "daddy". We also have the current Bond Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz (the boyfriend in Amelie) as well as Geoffrey Rush who plays Avner's "handler" in a way. Also some attention to little-known Ayelet Zorer playing Avner's wife.<br /><br />One thing that's been increasingly in popularity is the dual releases where we have just the bare-bones version, usually with awful cover art while we have the 2-disc special/collector/ultimate edition but oddly Munich was barely made available. While I can still find Lemony Snickett or War of the Worlds, Munich didn't seem like a lot of copies were sent out, in fact most stores hadn't even heard of them here. So if this one is what you want, either hunt like mad or just order online since it's a worthwhile one to get, unless they forgot to put something and they'll be a super edition later on.<br /><br />Probably won't have the massive acclaim and staying power of Schindler and Private Ryan in public's eye but this is one film that I wouldn't pass up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Eleven Israeli athletes are kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany. The situation does not end well and all of the athletes are killed. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier discusses a response, a solution, with her closest advisors. Ultimately, they decide to use force, to show Israel is not weak. They contact Avner (Eric Bana), a former Mossad agent, and ask him to lead a team of men to kill the eleven Palestinians responsible for Munich. His team includes: Steve (Daniel Craig), an Afrikaner adept with cars, Carl (Ciaran Hinds), the `cleaner', Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), a toymaker who works with explosives, and Hans (Hanns Zischler), a documents expert. As they fulfill their missions, their doubts grow and the level of danger increases.<br /><br />"Munich" directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner, is a powerful, challenging film.<br /><br />Ostensibly a thriller, the film devotes a significant amount of time addressing the moral issues of "an eye for an eye". As the death toll rises, Avner's team has thoughtful discussions about the goals and consequences of their missions. Each target is an individual mission, some are easier than others, but as they set about their jobs, Avner's team works very hard to ensure there is little collateral damage. One target lives with his wife and daughter in Paris and the team quickly aborts the mission when they realize the daughter has returned home unexpectedly. Much of their discussion centers on the moral issues at stake.<br /><br />Initially, the people who planned Munich, stay in the open, living their normal lives, because they are viewed as heroes within their community. This raises the ire of the team of Israeli assassins. After they take out their first target, receiving no mention in the news, Avner and his team realize they will have to use different methods, methods designed to attract attention and send a message to the community. But these will also be more dangerous, making it more difficult to prevent collateral damage. Their actions begin to form a circle of problems and solutions, solutions and problems.<br /><br />This circle is also a topic of discussion. As their missions become successful, the Palestinians retaliate. When will the cycle end? Can it ever end if they are successful with all eleven targets? For each target they remove, another takes their place. At one point, they are even dispatched to take out the replacement. The Palestinians also attack new targets, killing innocent people. All of this begins to weigh heavily on the team, affecting them in different ways.<br /><br />Spielberg does an excellent job of presenting arguments for both sides without forsaking the tenants of a motion picture. The episodic nature of the film aids in this process, allowing the director to present thriller like elements book ended with segments of discussion, introspection, guilt. After each target, there is a natural period of less activity as they wait for the next target, plan for the next mission. As they sit. And wait. And wait. Their minds naturally begin to wander and focus on other things. And they talk. Allowing the characters, and the filmmakers, to discuss the various aspects of their missions. Each member of the team is committed to the cause to varying degrees. All agree that a response is necessary, but Steve (Craig) seems to be the only one who doesn't have any objections to their current task.<br /><br />As they progress in their missions, work further up the food chain, each of the team members deals with their problems in a different way. Some become depressed, some argue and fight, some shut down. Ultimately, it rips some of them apart.<br /><br />Avner (Eric Bana) has deep misgivings about it. Bana turns in his best performance as the leader of the group. On the one hand, he has nightmares about the deaths of the athletes, on the other he has moral problems with their mission to assassinate others. He spends a lot of time reflecting, but those nightmares ultimately help him continue, to move forward. As the team leader, he is unable to show much of the doubt he has to his team, he must show them he is strong. One of the methods he uses to vent his frustration is to cook large meals for the team, during their periods of inactivity. As the danger level mounts, he also becomes more and more paranoid, suspecting at one point that the government he works for may have targeted his family. His performance portrays the majority of these emotions without words, allowing his actions to speak for or thinly disguise his emotions.<br /><br />The rest of the team is also very good. Geoffrey Rush plays Avner's government contact or handler, his contact with a government who claims he doesn't exist. Mathieu Kassovitz ("Amelie"'s boyfriend), Ciaran Hinds and Hanns Zischler are all good, showing their character's moral objections in their own ways. At first, I had some problems with Daniel Craig's ("Layer Cake", the new James Bond) portrayal of Steve. I just didn't get what he was trying to do, his accent was just plain strange. Then, someone refers to his character as "Afrikaner" and it all made sense. His character works, but it is the least interesting because Steve is the least conflicted about their goals.<br /><br />What Spielberg does is very interesting. He has created a film with suspenseful elements, in an international setting, along the lines of "The Bourne Identity" or "Three Days of the Condor". Then he blends in political elements, discussions of ideology, morality and more. It shouldn't work. You would think it might be boring. But it does work. And I was never bored for the 165 minutes the film ran. It is a bit of a conundrum that the film should work.<br /><br />Much like the conundrum Avner and his team face every day of their mission.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Munich is about a group of good people that have to kill the bad people.  11 bad people, in fact.

I don't remember the last time a film grabbed me and wouldn't let go like Munich did. Eric Bana plays Avner, who is hand picked by the Israeli government to track down and kill the Palestinian leaders of the terrorist group who organized the 1972 Munich hostage killings of eleven Israeli olympic athletes. Avner is a family man, he loves his wife and cannot wait for her to give birth to their baby daughter. He is then taken away from his family to fulfill this mission. He is the head of a group of five men, all with different specialties, and they must one by one track down and kill the Palestinian terrorist leaders. The film is a deep dark look into the nature of man, and you will be deeply moved by the actions taken and the journey that Avner completes. Spielberg gives the audience a lot to chew on, there are many different viewpoints expressed, but it's not solely a political film. Avner is a real character that people can identify with. His moral descisions and actions all paint his character for the audience to connect with. Geoffrey Rush turns in another brilliant performance as the man who secretly employs these men, and he represents the government's viewpoint in the film. All he wants is for revenge to be had. Avner enters this game with a similar viewpoint, he wants justice to be had for these brutal executions, but his character grows throughout the film and he comes to realize that violence as a tool is futile in the war to stop violence. We see two opposites in character with Eric Bana and Geoffrey Rush, two people who will never see anything in the same light, and this gives way for the brilliant ending to the film. The film itself is made as if Spielberg spent months and months planning it, however they started filming in July of 2005 and had a December 23rd release date. That is simply amazing that a team of filmmakers were able to make a film this good in that amount of time. The scene structure is absolutely amazing. Spielberg will build tension within the scene by using a continuing shot and will not cut away. The camera tracking is unbelievable. Instead of having three or four cameras for one scene, he will use one. The camera will dolly, zoom, pan, and tilt to show the scene, but never cut away. The camera style is almost Hitchcockian, and it works to perfection. Every assassination that is carried out is intensly thrilling, and you will be coiled up in your seat for the entire film. It is gripping, emotional, intelligent, and raises enough questions for the audience to ponder. This is a master filmmaker at his best, the film is visually breathtaking and emotionally stunning.<br /><br />ACTING: Who knew Eric Bana would hold a leading role in a film like this, and pull it off with perfection? I don't see how he cannot get a nomination for this role, he was simply captivating. He handled this huge role and made it seem real, you feel every emotion that Avner is going through and that really helps the film's overall impact on the audience. The rest of the cast turn in great ensamble performances, and Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as always. The cast is perfect, no possible way it could have been better.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg knows exactly what's needed to create the perfect tone, and he can switch from heartwarming to disturbing in a blink of an eye and make it seamless. This film is gritty, violent, emotional, and will make you ask serious questions about the state of global conflict and the nature of man. This 2 hour 45 minute film will seem like an hour because there is not one dry spot in the entire movie, the audience is involved from the very opening to the closing credits. The film doesn't feel like a history lesson, it is an intense thriller made masterfully by Spielberg. It will stay in your mind long after you see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>One of the greatest ironies of international politics in the wake of World War II is that you can make an argument that the most fascist nation on the face of the planet is the state of Israel.  This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe.  But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing "struggle" for "order."  Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time.  This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of "liberty" and "property," but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well.  In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.<br /><br />The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the heart of Steven Spielberg's "Munich."  The massacre of the Israeli athletes as the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing.  Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded.  There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village.  Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that "they're all gone" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing.  But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he had to do and later for what he has done.<br /><br />Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich.  Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them.  His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done.  Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.<br /><br />We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed.  The first has translated "The Arabian Nights" into Italian.  The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich.  They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics.  But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist?  Avren gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avren knows.  Meanwhile, as Avren and his men cross more names off of the their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.<br /><br />"Munich" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre.  What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich.  The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book "Vengeance" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable.  While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible.  But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members.  Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home.  Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.<br /><br />I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God.  Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God.  The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better.  It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight.  The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing.  What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel "Munich" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The violence is part of the human nature. Gaston Bouthoul' s impressive  essay published in the early seventies brings us forth interesting information; the major interval of peace along the mankind's history has been of two hundred years and along the 5000 years of history there just have been 400 years of absolute peace. The conclusion is more than obvious. The peace is a nostalgic idea, a marvelous product of the syncretism, conceived as the final sum of fragmented hopes, and has nothing to do with the human race. And Voltaire's acidic statement: "The civilization doesn't suppress the incivility, it just improves it."<br /><br />If you expected just an incendiary movie, take your time and make a pause on the road. Spielberg' s approach turns around the slow and progressively psychological fragmentation of every one of the components of the apparently epic team that were hired to exterminate one by one the eleven intellectual leaders hat planned the unforgettable massacre in Munich 1972.<br /><br />So, under the perspective of more than thirty four years, the movie is a very zealous examination - told in documental style, through dramatic narrative ellipsis - around the dreadful events which took place with all the possible crudeness.<br /><br />According these established premises this handful of men will be hired in order to search and eliminate around every corner of Europe one by one the eleven terrorists. Despite certain inconsistencies in the script, we will witness how every one of the members of the Quintet simply will give up with such violence amount.<br /><br />Our main hero - Avner Kauffman - is happily married and his Jewish ancestors impede him to understand the huge challenge that this operation means. At the end he refuses to continue in this operation and he has realized the shed blood will not redeem the fallen victims; and on the other hand the violence is endless, that's why he simply decides to stop and initiate a new life with his wife and beautiful daughter in the Bronx. Ironically, in the final shot the fixed camera shows us the World Trade Center.<br /><br />No terrorism has philosophical justification. On the other hand the violence has no face, walks with velvet steps in order to select randomly some place in the world to make his designs come true. So under these coordinates, you fight against an invisible enemy, masked and hidden under the most unexpected conditions and keeping this paranoid state in the most people.<br /><br />Maybe this pacific statement in the final dialogue, advocating for the irrationality of this bloody revenge, was very brief leaving in the spectator's taste an unfinished anguish and a lot of unanswered questions. Perhaps this was the final intention; to make us understand the no sense of the revenge, but this is simply the edge of the iceberg.

Avner gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avner knows. Meanwhile, as Avner and his men cross more names off of their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.<br /><br />"Munich" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre. What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich. The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book "Vengeance" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable. While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible. But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members. Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home. Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.<br /><br />I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God. Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God. The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better. It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight. The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing. What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel "Munich" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>Steven Speilberg's Munich tells the story of how the Israeli government struck back at the Palestinian terrorist organization Black September who was responsible for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic of 1972.<br /><br />Eric Bana lead the Israeli counterstrike team (made up of odd assorted characters) that goes after the terrorist organization, using any means possible to terminate their existence. Overall, the movie proves to be well directed and superbly acted by the entire cast. I have my doubts however on the script. It almost tries too hard to be fair to both sides of the fence. The movie uses Eric Bana's character, Avram as the moral compass of what the Israeli was trying to accomplished. Speilberg seem to be asking if the nation could compromised its morals and ethics standards to defend itself against her enemies. It would be nice if Spielberg actually answer that question but he does not. Funny how the man who directed one of the greatest movies on the Holocaust forget the past so easily.<br /><br />The movie proves to be well made, it could used little bit tighter editing if you asked me, the movie dragged from point to point thanks to Avram's moral self-doubts and interlude with his family. Inspired by a true story, I found the movie to be suspenseful, entertaining and overall, well crafted. Its flaws shouldn't bother most people who enjoyed this type of movie and the movie will leave you much to think about since the United States seem to be in the same position after 9/11 as Israel was after Munich Olympics.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Carl: It's strange, to think of oneself as an assassin.<br />Avner: Think of yourself as something else then.<br />Ephraim: We have 11 Palestinian names; each one of them had a hand in planning Munich. We want them all dead. "<br /><br />Steven Spielberg has directed and produced a grappling and intelligent thriller "based on true events".  A movie that is firm in its depiction and surreal in the flow from the real events of Munich in 1972 to the latter day events of the hunt for the "Black September" responsible for the murder of 11 Israelis. The movie is based on George Jones book "Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team" and the book was adapted to the screen by Eric Roth and Tony Kushner of "Forrest Gump" and Angels In America" team. The film is based on five Israeli agents who are recruited by Golda Meir (Prime Minister of Israel) and other top ranked Israeli government officials. Their job, if they decide to accept it, is to hunt down and kill the eleven Black September agents.<br /><br />The movie centers around these five former Mossad agents and the skill of the movie is the human motivation and their innate feelings of moral uncertainty in these killings.  Eric Bana who plays Avner, the leader of this group show us his uncertainty with the wavering of his voice and trembling of his hands as he forces his gun on one of the first Black September assassins. He leaves Israel, his family and unborn child to perform these duties and in the end becomes a hunted man. Daniel Craig plays the South African; Ciaran Hinds, (most recently seen as Julius Caesar in the HBO production of Rome) as Carl, the worrier who cleans up after the others; Hans, Hans Zischler, the German document forger; and the Belgian toy and bomb maker, Robert Mathieu Kassovitz. They move from country to country to hunt down their prey. This takes years and begins to wear on each of them.<br /><br />This movie was taken from a "true story" and the real story is as thrilling and devastating as the movie. Wikipedia gives us the facts as known:<br /><br />"It is known that Mossad agent Michael Harari led the creation and direction of the teams, known as the "Operation Wrath of God" although some may not have always been under government responsibility. Simon Reeve explains that the Mossad team consisted of group of fifteen people divided into five squads: 'Aleph," two trained killers; "Bet," two guards who would shadow the Alephs; "Heth," two agents who would establish cover for the rest of the team by renting hotel rooms, apartments, cars, and so on; "Ayin," comprising between six and eight agents who formed the backbone of the operation, shadowing targets and establishing an escape route for the Aleph and Bet squads; and "Qoph," two agents specializing in communications. (squad names are letters of the Hebrew alphabet)" Wikipedia.<br /><br />This line of work takes its toll on the five Israelis and in the end they are shot at and barely escape with their lives. This group is disbanded and we see Aver at home with his family in the US, being asked to return to the Mossad. A fitting message is the camera as it shows a shot of the New York City skyline, including the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. A message from Steven Spielberg to the world?<br /><br />This was a haunting film. So well filmed and brought to the screen. A message of the moral uncertainty of life and the lessons learned when revenge is a way of life.<br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-13-06</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Spielberg's film "Munich" is a remake of the 1986 film "Sword of Gideon" starring Michael York and Rod Steiger.  The true story of the terrorist incident at the 1972 Olympics and the Israeli response.  This film is grittier and more graphic than the original, though many scenes are taken verbatim from it.<br /><br />  One problem I have is the title.  Kind of like "JFK" which wasn't really about JFK, "Munich" isn't about Munich.  It does recreate the original incident, but better to see the 1999 documentary "One Day in September".  The final scene with the World Trade Center photoshopped into the scene was effective, but the point that was to be made was too nebulus.  What is it exactly Spielberg is trying to say there?<br /><br />  Again if you see "Sword of Gideon" much of "Munich" is redundant, and in a sense a rip-off, especially as it isn't being marketed as a remake, trying to sweep that under the rug.  The good points are the realism of the camerawork.  I think Spielberg reaches too far by taken incidents and trying to extend them into universal themes.  Schindler's list was not the quintessential Holocaust film as some believe, it was a specific story (War and Remembrance would be the quintessential one).  And likewise this is so far from a quintessential film on terrorism, but it wants to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This movie is inspired by real events, but is a work of fiction. From the book Vengeance and history we only know that terrorists killed the Israel Olympians in Munich and the people who were claimed to be associated with Black September were later killed.<br /><br />In this movie Spielberg weaves a story around those two basic facts that give us an intense story line of the secret Israeli squad assigned to track down and assassinate all eleven Palestinians to have planned the 1972 Munich massacre of eleven Israeli athletes. The director seems to focus on the personal toll this mission of revenge takes on the team and the man who led it.<br /><br />My brother had worked as a volunteer at those Olympics so we were close to the tragedy. And it was a horrible tragedy. But knowing of the Mossad, I doubt this is realistic. Also I doubt their chosen agents would be this incompetent. And the sex scenes in the movie serve no purpose as is stated elsewhere. Other then that it is an OK action film. The topic of terrorism and retaliation is as relevant today as it was in 1972.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Munich, directed by Stephen Spielberg, is a tale of revenge--its appeal and its final lunacy. It tells the story of the tragic kidnapping/murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, Germany, and then focuses on the team of Mossad (Israeli secret police) agents who are selected to assassinate Black Septemberist functionaries (the group responsible for Munich) in retribution.<br /><br />The movie is searing, brutal and difficult to watch. Among Spielberg's work, it has the same sense of uncompromising reality as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Technically, this film is well put-together. The acting is strong throughout. The film itself reminds one of a 70's movie, with gritty footage and muted colors. It is appropriate to the subject. Thematically, this movie shows the horrible reality of dreamed-about revenge; how politicians, from on high, make decisions over tea about how we have to "show people we're strong," but how those decisions eventually translate into the ruin of people's lives, some of whom are innocent and some guilty, but always complex. Munich begins by showing us the Munich tragedy, and the audience immediately wants the terrorists responsible to pay. But, by showing us the actual mechanisims of the Israeli revenge (and suggesting that their revenge will simply lead to more Palestinian retribution, which we now know it did), we start to repent of our desire for that revenge. Also, awful though the thought may be, we gain some possible insight into the original Munich terrorists, and even, perhaps, a little sympathy.<br /><br />This is not Spielberg's finest film, but it is great. Great and heavy and not something I think I will want to watch a second time, because it is just that hard. It is essential viewing once, however, because the historical content and themes are important, present and not likely to leave us any time soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>How could people be so cruel? How can people commit acts of terror? Are they just not like us, which is to say morally inferior? Study of history is crucial to understanding these questions. Ever hear about what happened at Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948? Or at Kafar Qasem on October 29, 1956. How much do we know about the founding of the Israeli state and what that meant for those non-Jews living in what was then the country of Palestine?<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is incapable of making a truly bad movie. He's one of<br />America's most entertaining and talented popular directors. Maybe the most popular. Spielberg movies are good Hollywood stuff. So, I very much enjoyed MUNICH as a suspenseful political/espionage action thriller. But truly useful in understanding history? Nah. Enjoy it as a well crafted Spielberg movie.<br /><br />If your an American you either A) passionately feel this film is unfair or even biased against Israel, or B) that it offers a challenging exploration of moral complexity and so on. You know shows "both sides". My sympathies much more with the latter, however I disagree with both. My guess would be that really only in America could there be such perceptions.<br /><br />The first part of the film portrays the events which took place in Munich during the 1972 Olympic Games. It is an amazing bit of filmmaking, making you witness to the tragedy. The second part of the film portrays the Israel response and it is largely fictious as director of the film Spielberg says so himself but some of the killings were depicted accurately.<br /><br />We get to know the head Jewish assassin, "Avner", played by the likable, intelligent and handsome Eric Bana. We meet his beautiful and see them together. We meet his mother who is quite an interesting character, but I'll not get into why...(I suspect Spielberg may have been saying something with this character, but who knows). We see the tragic terrorist attack in Munich and rightly are disturbed by this. We watch the top officials of the Israeli government decide on the proper response and we meet Golda Meir who is sort of Big Grandma of Israel.  Anway, it is clear that Israel must assassinate the terorists. No point in capturing any? Guess not.It is historically true is the Israeli government did murder those suspected have involvement along with some that may not have been and of course innocent civilians that were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the mission was called "Operation Wrath of God" and so what does international law matter.<br /><br />Spielberg said he did not want to do a Charles Bronson DEATH WISH revenge flick. So, we see conflcit in our hero Avner and we do meet a terrorist A-Rab. The Palestinian is allowed to speak of the Olive Trees and land of his people before being blown away. MUNICH does NOT show, doesn't dare show and nor does any character speak of what motivated the terrorist Muslims. In MUNICH we can admit they are human and it seems to be admited there is such a thing as a Palestinian -and for this along an adminition that things in the real world aren't always black and white Spielberg incured the wrath of, if not of God Himself, at least his spokespersons on Earth in the form of certain groups and individuals I'll not bother mentioning because quite frankly they're best left ignored as much as possible. If your American you'd do well to read what you can from the Israeli press which on the whole covers the business of that country much, much better and has a wider variety of view points than anything you can get from the mainstream media in the US.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>I was very curious to see this chapter of history. The story of the 11 Israeli athletes getting killed by Palestinian terrorists and the story that followed. I feel the actors chosen to play the characters couldn't have been better and the movie itself was incredible. However I feel the message that was sent to the movie going public was the incorrect one. (Caution: when I say incorrect I don't mean untrue)<br /><br />Right now we are living in a very controversial time where the situation in the Middle East is a very sensitive subject. I am one who wants to see peace, but with the violence escalating every day we are far from reaching that goal. What people need to understand is that only one side wants peace and unfortunately `Munich' did not elaborate on that enough. The Israeli task force is depicted to be just as uncaring as the Palestinian extremist groups in this movie. (Never do they show actual Palastinans that truly want peace).  In the beginning the message is to kill the plotters of the Munich murders and in the end the Israelis are leaving bodies uncovered in shame and the main character gives up his love for his homeland. The scene where Eric Bana's character sees himself fighting along side the terrorists is an absolute disgrace. The pieces of the movie that should have been elaborated more were the people they were killing. These were Palestinian officials high in power living far away from the Palestinian hostage camps in lavish mansions and accepting money from all different governments just to keep the violence going. Those are actual living breathing people in the P.L.O. that are still alive today.  The should have made it more clear that the mission was to kill the terrorists and not to hurt the innocent Palestinians like the women and children as well as Palestinian men that had nothing to do with assassinating Jewish people.<br /><br />Is this movie good...yes it is a brilliant film worthy of its credit. Will is be nominated for awards...absolutely. I don't think that Spielberg displayed anything untrue in this movie. He did however show more sympathy towards the wrong side. I believe his message was to say he wants peace and the only way to show that was that both sides shedding blood constantly would only make it worse and there never will be peace. I feel there is nothing wrong with showing there are two sides fighting and only one side wants peace. If the world can understand that there are certain people (not a nation) that don't then the true evils in this world will be wiped out and there finally will be peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>In 1972, during the summer Olympics in Munich, Germany Palestinian terrorists killed 2 members of the Israeli wrestling team and kidnapped 9 others.  They along with all 9 Olympians were ultimately killed before leaving the country.  Although some of the eventual operation to assassinate those responsible remains secret, much is known as well.  Based on George Jonas' novel "Vengeance", director Steven Spielberg fills in the gaps with this excellent thriller.  Eric Bana gives a powerful performance as the leader of a 5 man operation assigned the task of killing the leaders responsible for the attack.  The group surprisingly is not an elite unit in the usual sense.  Avner (Bana) is a mid level Mossad agent but had worked as a body guard for Prime Minister Golda Meir.  The other 4 are similarly a bit out of their element.  Although the film clearly separates the good guys from the bad guys, Spielberg still manages to make each character sympathetic in some way.  Avner and others in the group confront moral choices.  Is this murder or justice?  The film has a top notch cast including Geoffrey Rush as the Unit's government contact, Daniel Craig as the driver and the Unit tough guy.  Mathieu Amalric is especially effective as the French connection that helps with locations and logistics.  The film focus however is on Avner and begins to meanders a bit as his episodes of depression result in flashbacks to the original terrorist attack.  I guess that keeps him and us centered on why the mission is necessary.  Overall this is a fine political thriller based on real events.</p></br><a href="../users/AH1OH4PWR7NV6.html">AH1OH4PWR7NV6</a><br/><p>Very tragic movie.

Being that Gilliam was with the Monty Python gang the expectations are high. Unfortunately whilst the idea is a brilliant one, i.e., taking the world of the Grimm tales and turning them into a film; the end result is far from astounding and more of mediocre. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger both do what they can to create great characters but the problem is the less then great dialogue. Overall a film that is worthy of a 3 out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is a really cool look at fairy tales presented in a realistic setting, and I rather like how it was carried off. The idea was rather creative, and kept me engaged, especially as I learned more and more about it, and the actors did a really nice job in their roles. Overall a fun movie, and if you like fairy tales, you will enjoy this retelling, especially as it combines various elements of different familiar fairytales.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I like Terry Gilliam's stuff. Brazil is wonderful and Twelve Monkeys is the best time traveling movie ever, but this movie does not click. It starts off really slow, I gave up once. The second time I fast-forwarded through sections I saw before and was able to make it all the way through. There are some good moments and it does tie some loose ends together, but it is just too weird. The non-fantasical world is stranger than the enchanted forest. The happy ending works, but it was a very convoluted and nonsensical path to get there. I can't recommend this movie. It is Gilliam's worse movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>The Bothers Grimm is grim indeed, visually sumptuous, with some startling visual set pieces, but it's a movie without a shape and it ultimately lacks a decent plot. It doesn't help that the juvenile screenplay has the lead actors running around making it all up as they go along, with the director looking as though he has given them free reign to spend almost two hours shouting at one another and embarrassingly bumbling through all the fantastical proceedings.<br /><br />Director, Terry Gilliam is indeed a maverick director and his visionary reputation often precedes him, which makes his latest exercise in cinematic fantasy so enormously disappointing. The Brothers Grimm tries so hard to be whimsical and magical, but for some reason, the movie ends up coming across as rather flat, leaden, and joyless, an effects laden travesty with some of the images so over-produced and cluttered that most viewers will probably end up with a bad case of claustrophobia.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is a film that has little to do with the actual folklore heroes (they'd probably be turning in their grave). As played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger these German brother storytellers are now con men, a couple of wondering minstrels who specialize in the eradication of paranormal phenomena, such as witches. In the early 19th century, the couple trolls French-controlled Germanic towns preying on the superstitions of their inhabitants.<br /><br />Kitted out in period attire and unconvincing British accents, the story tracks the brothers as, at the request of a French general Jonathan Pryce, they try to solve a series of small-town kidnappings. Someone is stealing all the little girls - including red riding hood - with the trail leading to a giant tower in an enchanted forest, where an evil Queen (Monica Bellucci) is trying to recapture her youth, after her beauty has been ravaged by a terrible plague.<br /><br />The Bothers Grimm splutters and jolts along with some moments of visual flair, but the proceedings are just too contrived and all too predictable. Ledger and Damon are decent enough actors, but under Gilliam's direction their characters ultimately come off as blank slates, serving as handsome vehicles, or mere background to the next piece of CGI wizardry.<br /><br />When directors set about re-interpreting classical fairy stories, they need to be sure that they can fully honor the source material. One gets the distinct impression that Gilliam just doesn't fully seem to understand the primal attraction of these classic tales. Instead, mystery and fear has been replaced by corny, bumbling around, the characters made into cartoonish caricatures, more concerned with doing stupid sight gags than forwarding the flimsy plot.<br /><br />Of course, there are the usual lavishly trumped up sets, the detailed costumes and props, a darkly ironic if unsteady tone and hiccups of strained surrealism. But The Brothers Grimm mostly falls terribly flat - there's no sense of danger, excitement or mystery; and with all its efforts to towards visual flare, the Brothers Grim, comes across as just another one of those over produced summer studio films; a film that ultimately leaves the viewer feeling as though it was all just a big waste of time.

Set in 1811, characters hum "Brahms Lullabye" when not listening to Rossini's "La Gazza Ladra." Feh!<br /><br />I shoulda known better than to hope for a semi-biopic about these guys. In an ultra-busy fairy tale about fairy tale creators, Jacob and Wlhelm Grimm are depicted as a pair of traveling ripoff artists. The reality is quite different.<br /><br />They came from a family of nine kids and had an idyllic childhood. Both were academics; together they compiled a German dictionary. The fairy tales the Grimms are renowned for were written as a result of their main interest, the study of linguistics.<br /><br />In 1808, Jacob was named court librarian to the King of Westphalia. Their first volume of legends was compiled two years later; some of these got published in 1812. Eventually the Grimms amassed and published over 200 such fables.<br /><br />These facts wouldn't make for a good movie, though... or would they?<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(5.9) The Brothers Grimm (UK/Czech/USA-2005) - Matt Damon/Heath Ledger/Monica Bellucci/Jonathan Pryce</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie was Good, i thought it was Pretty good.

Of course, the special effects are very well made, of course, the German countryside and its disturbing forests are on the screen, of course the costumes and the scenery are superb. But I didn't find in the movie the pleasure I had listening to the brothers Grimm's fairy tales or reading their collections of stories. Everyone knows by now, thanks to Bruno Bettelheim's "The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales", that fairy tales are narrations filled with a symbolic meaning destined to children; you may watch the movie as often as you want, there isn't an ounce of allegory or second degree in it. This is only pure first degree entertainment, a wild ride through a dozen fairy tales of which the screenwriter kept only the exotic and hair-raising flavour. Too bad.<br /><br />A DVD zone disillusion.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>As much as I love Terry Gilliam, I'll admit that I didn't have very high hopes for his much maligned Brothers Grimm, which suffered from production delays, release date changes, and just overall trouble from the distributers and funders.  That aside, Gilliam still manages to craft a fast moving, whimsical, dark fairy tale featuring Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm respectively; two folklore collectors and con-men who end up becoming heroes investigating the disappearances of young girls in the creepy woods.  Soon enough, they team up with beautiful Angelika (300's Lena Headey) as they take on a horde of beasts and evil lurking in the forest.  Gilliam pulls out no stops as there are many nods and homages to classic Grimm fairy tales, including Monica Bellucci as the evil Queen for whom there is no fairer of them all, and the rest of the cast, including greats Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare, are excellent as well.  As for the CGI effects, I keep reading and hearing about how great many think they are, but in truth they are a mixed bag.  Some of them are very well done and look surprisingly real, but a few don't look as great as many are claiming.  That aside, Gilliam's taut direction and the fantastic set design alone are enough to make Brothers Grimm a memorable ride, and anyone having second thoughts about the quality of the film should check it out to see how surprisingly good it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>You can always expect certain things from a Terry Gilliam movie. When he has a budget as he did in this one, it will look beautiful, the story will be an odd one with some cool effects and sense of humor. These are all present in the Brothers Grimm, but the movie still doesn't completely work.<br /><br />The Grimm Brothers are con artists. They fleece money from villagers by setting up a myth about a witch or creature and then showing up to destroy said witch or monster. They are eventually captured by the French army and sent into the Thuringian forest to battle an actual ancient myth. The performances are good and it's a clever story but it just doesn't grab you. I was bored part way into it and never accummulated a great interest in how it would turn out.<br /><br />I think more humor might have helped. Also, the story didn't flow as well as it should have. Some scenes seemed just to be an excuse to show you some special effect they had thought up. The characters had little history and could have a used another dimension. This wasn't a bad movie, but something was missing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Most people interested in a fantasy movie will have heard of the brothers Grimm and how they collected folk tales and put them into print.  This movie is not about those guys.  These guys do listen to stories but for another reason altogether.  For in the French-occupied Germany, the brothers are interested in pretending to be heroes who defeat monsters, ghosts and witches to gain huge payments from the towns they are supposedly saving.  But the evils are merely their henchmen who arrived early to set the stage.<br /><br />But things get strange when the local French general (Jonathan Price) gets a hold of them and enlists them to put an end to some other stories.  The problem is that this time the stories may be real.  The brothers move through interesting sets, characters and plots as one would expect from a Terry Gilliam movie.  The story is interesting and the story they are investigating has elements of a number of classic Grimm tales.<br /><br />As one would expect from the talents behind this film, it is visually stunning.  The story is well paced and the acting really fits.  Jonathan Price is simply excellent and at the top of his form.  The extras are pretty typical and what you would expect but nothing too special.  All in all it was nowhere near the film I was expecting (that became obvious right at the start) but it still managed to grab me and keep me interested.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Thoroughly entertaining all the way through. Deliberately campy at times, but overall a pretty good flick.<br /><br />The $20 question is: Is this movie worth the price of purchase versus a rental? Let's see:<br /><br />-Two big stars...Matt Damon (plays Will...no not Good Will in this one) and Heath "Brokeback Mountain" Ledger (Jake).<br />-A great plot line...Will and Jake are con-artists that execute Scooby-Doo style pranks on various communities, but meet their match when they encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse and are commissioned to vanquish it.<br />-Many snippits of the famous Brothers Grimm tales are cleverly woven into the movie (The Gingerbread Man, Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, etc).<br /><br />But clearly director Terry Gilliam was torn between putting out a PG or a PG-13 movie. The deliberate silliness that I mentioned earlier, especially the portrayal of Cavaldi by the great character actor Peter Stormare (you know, the guy that sticks Steve Buscemi in the wood chipper in Fargo) takes away from any attempt at serious that the movie had. And all of the fairy tale references suggest that a movie for kids may have once been in mind.<br /><br />But genuinely frightening and nightmarish images were too much for the ratings guys at the MPAA and they threw the 13 on the end of the PG to make sure that our children were kept safe from the make believe fairy tale world of The Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />So back to the $20 question. This movie is not a keeper. It is, however, an excellent rental. Let kids watch it? That's up to you, parents, knowing that the MPAA says anyone under 13 may be damaged from viewing this picture about the Brothers that created stories for kids to scare kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>In a recent interview, Matt Damon recounted a story told by Jonathan Pryce. Both actors appear in Terry Gilliam's new film "The Brothers Grimm". Pryce had just finished filming his first scene in "Brazil" and thought it went well. Prepared to move on, Pryce was startled when Gilliam wanted to do it again. Approaching the director, Pryce inquired about the reason for a retake. Gilliam put his hands on Pryce's shoulders, turned him around and said "Look at that set. You aren't registering against that." Pryce's performance was too subtle against Gilliam's elaborate production design. It strikes me that this is, perhaps, the key problem with all of Gilliam's films.<br /><br />Wil and Jake Grimm travel the German countryside, circa 1812, banishing evil spirits from the rural villages, happily, for a fee. The Grimm Brothers are, in fact, con men, banishing the spirits they have created with smoke, mirrors and the aide of their two henchmen. Wil (Matt Damon, "The Bourne Supremacy", "Good Will Hunting") is the businessman, negotiating their fees with the local mayors and Jake (Heath Ledger, "Lords of Dogtown", "A Knight's Tale") is the romantic, recording every fable they hear. Soon, a French General (Jonathan Pryce) and his Italian aide (Peter Stormare) arrest the Grimm brothers. Napoleon has invaded Germany and controls everything. The General wants the Brothers Grimm to rid the town of Mar Baden of an evil spirit suspected of taking the town's young girls. If they succeed, they might be spared death.<br /><br />If there is anything Gilliam can do well, it is production design. For each film, he creates elaborate, beautiful and haunting designs transporting us to these places. He clearly devotes a large part of the filmmaking process to this part of his films. If "Brazil" and "Baron Munchausen" looked like they were created on sets, there would be no reason to remember them today. Gilliam's designs are massive and all encompassing, taking us along for the journey through these fantasies.<br /><br />Gilliam and Tim Burton are very similar filmmakers; each delights in creating the physical aspect of their fantastical worlds, each is clearly drawn to stories that are off center and unusual, and each brings an artists eye to the creation of these worlds. Each has also had varied success with the actors in their films and has a love affair with Johnny Depp, casting him in many of their respective films.<br /><br />I am a big fan of each director, but I am also maddened by both. They have each created some of the most memorable film experiences and also some dreadful, horrible wastes of time. Gilliam and Burton have difficulty dealing with the human element in their films. All of the production design in the world can't make up for wooden or hammy performances. Remember the story from Jonathan Pryce? This story is indicative of the problem with Gilliam's films. His production design drowns out any hope for subtle, lifelike performances, so Gilliam instructs his actors to act broad. As the production design becomes more outlandish, the actors feel it necessary to compete. The performances become more and more broad, louder and louder, and less and less human. This cycle that seems as though it will never end in Gilliam's films.<br /><br />Recently, a documentary was made about Gilliam's failed attempts to make a film based on the story of Don Quixote. The documentary, "Lost in La Mancha", detailed the constant funding problems the production had. Johnny Depp was cast as Sancho to Jean Rochefort's Quixote. This never completed film is especially intriguing because of the story. There doesn't seem to be a lot of opportunity for outlandish production design. Maybe a bit here and there, but the story would primarily have taken the two leads to barren landscapes in the Spanish countryside. Because of this, we might have had the opportunity to see Gilliam lead his performers to greatness. But it will never be. The closest we will ever see are the snippets included in the documentary.<br /><br />In "Grimm", Damon and Ledger are virtually always running around, shouting, arguing, screaming at each other, fighting with each other. But boy those sets look great. Each actor's performance easily ranks as one of their worst, and in Ledger's case, that's saying a lot. Ledger is an actor in search of a good role. None of his films to date have fulfilled any of the promise they may have had.<br /><br />Oddly, Jonathan Pryce's performance is very sedate. As the French General, he seems to be playing it almost straight to Peter Stormare's Italian aide. Stormare's character is amusing for the first few moments; his accent is thick and he seems intent on trying to kill anyone and anything they capture. But the character quickly wears thin and seems an odd match to Pryce's French General. Pryce adds a bit of a French accent and raises his eyebrows a few times at the antics of his aide, but that is about the extent of his performance.<br /><br />Monica Belluci appears in the film as well. This is another case of a beautiful woman who can't act appearing in countless films simply because of her looks. Her most successful American films were the second and third "Matrix" films, perhaps because she simply had to stand around and look exotic.<br /><br />The screenplay by Ehren Kruger ("The Skeleton Key", "The Ring") is interesting. Kruger works very hard to insert as many fairy tale references as possible. Some of them are clever and amusing, but it occurred to me, about halfway through the film, that it seems unlikely that these two guys would have one adventure, no matter how big, that inspired every single famous fairy tale they later recorded/ created. Seeds of everything from "Jack and the Beanstalk" (no pun intended) to "Rapunzel", "The Gingerbread Man" to "Snow White' make an appearance in some fashion. About halfway through the film, the process becomes a little monotonous and slapdash. References seem thrown in at any available point, whether they have a purpose to the story or not. The "Gingerbread Man" reference seems particularly tacked on.<br /><br />Kruger crafts the rest of the story well. Refashioning the brothers as con-men who are reluctantly called into duty provides an immediate sense of danger to the story and making the Napoleonic occupation a backdrop are interesting touches, but the main characters get lost. At one point Wil and Jake are fighting each other for the affections of a woman. It isn't really clear what Wil sees in her or what the outcome of this storyline is.<br /><br />If you can sit through two hours of interesting images, and perhaps tune out the dialogue and story, you might enjoy yourself. Otherwise, "The Brothers Grimm" is a miss, a big miss. Not really worthy of a rental either.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>There's a saying: "No one sets out to make a bad movie."  BROTHERS GRIMM (Miramax) might prove otherwise.  Near the beginning of his commentary, the usually brilliant Terry Gilliam actually says, "I didn't like the script, but I was out of work."  Not a good sign but an honest admission from the former Python.<br /><br />Although wonderfully visualized, the Czech locations can't make-up for the muddled mess of a screenplay culled from perhaps the richest mother lode of raw story material available anywhere: The collected fairy tales of Wilhem and Jacob Grimm.<br /><br />In spite of stars Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as con artist exorcists who encounter real evil, a great poster and an OK trailer, audiences rightfully stayed away via quick word of mouth ("incomprehensible" "unwatchable"). Worthy extras of interest mainly to budding filmmakers are Gilliam's commentary and the featurette: "The Visual Magic of the Brothers Grimm."</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>It is truly disappointing when a movie with such unlimited possibility is trashed by inept acting, poor effects, and a director who cannot seem to decide where the movie is going.  With such a cool premise, the movie just turns into a bunch of garbage that is unbearable to watch let alone get involved in.  I was glad this was a free rental at the local video store.  I would have been ticked off had I spent a dime on this crap.  Consider yourself warned.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Few complain when writers and directors take a fresh take on an old story: at times the new approach even enhances the original. Sadly, that is not the case with THE BROTHERS GRIMM.  Though Terry Gilliam is well recognized as one who makes magic out of old things retold, this time the magic seems to have been concentrated on costumes, weird head pieces, claustrophobic haunted villages, and animated effects. As a result the story is left behind and without a decent script, leaves little for the actors to mold into anything.<br /><br />This telling of the Brothers Grimm is more grim than fantastical.  Instead of fairytale writers, these misanthropes are snake oil salesmen out to purge villages of their demons (all a part of show that pays them well).  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are the wily two and try their best to make the story happen. Interspersed in the derring-do are snippets of the fairytales that came from the imagination of the brothers and they serve as sidebars of some interest, albeit distorted versions, intensely altered versions of Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Ridinghood, etc.<br /><br />There is a reason this film took so long to make and ran up high production costs: the production company was trying to make it work and failed.  Mildly entertaining but hardly worth the long hours it seems to take to tell it.  Grady Harp, December 05</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>If Terry Gilliam, the director of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," "Time Bandits," "Brazil," "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," and "The Fisher King," wants to make a movie about the Brothers Grimm in which their fairy tales turn out to be real, then that should be a real winner.  So the question on the table is why the 2005 film "The Brothers Grimm" is not a winner.  When I sat down to watch this film I was hoping for something along the lines of "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" (in which the brothers appear in the prologue) or even "Sleepy Hollow," but what we end up with is much more in the spirit of "Ghostbusters," and not in a good way.<br /><br />The initial misstep in this adventure comes when it is decided that Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger) will not simply be nonbelievers, but that instead they would be con-artists who exploit the believe of the common folk in witches and other things that go bump in the night ("Eliminating Evil Since 1812" is the film's tagline).  The fairy tales do appear, but they are not really integrated into the story in any significant way by screenwriter Ehren Kruger, who has previously written "Scream 3," "The Ring," "The Ring Two" and "Skeleton Key."  This resume comes into play because looking it over I was thinking that the story should have been more along the lines of "The Ring" films rather than trying for the tongue-in-cheek approach of the "Scream" films.  This is especially true since the way the images from the video in "The Ring" were integrated into the story were rather successful, which proves Kruger can do such things, but chose not to do so to great effect in this film.<br /><br />The look of the film is, as you would expect with Gilliam as the director, to be sumptuous.  Guy Hendrix Dyas did the production design and set decoration (the latter with Judy Farr), with art direction by Andy Thomson and Frank Walsh, and costumes designed by Gabriella Pescucci and Carlo Poggioli, all of whom do most commendable work generally worthy of Oscar consideration (I do not like the Grimm's armor only because it is the chief symbol of their work a con-men, which I have faulted above).  Having golden boys Damon and Ledger as the titular siblings probably helped get the film made and marketed, but I wonder if having unknowns would have helped make the story they chose to tell her work, since you have hero types playing against type for most of the film and for the most part their comic ineptitude falls flat for me.<br /><br />Anyhow, the Grimms are revealed to be charlatans by Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce), who is Napoleon's representative in Germany.  Instead of executing the con artists he dispatches them in another way, sending them to the village of Marbaden.  Children there have gone missing and the nearby forest appears to be haunted.  Delatombe sends along Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), his master of torture to make sure the Grimms do not run away.  Apparently the Frenchman thinks the Grimms will either figure out the scam or die in the process.  Of course the forest turns out to really be enchanted and is ruled by the 500-year-old Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci).  If not for the lovely huntswoman, Angelika (Lena Headey), this movie would be a lot shorter.  When the brothers worry more about romancing the huntswoman than fearing the queen I was again thinking that this film was simply playing its hand the wrong way.<br /><br />There was a really good film about the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm that could have been made and if Gilliam could not get it done I suspect it will be several generations before someone ventures into this specific territory again.  But there are such works as the Stephen Sondheim musical "Into the Woods," Orson Scott Card's novel "Enchanted," and others you can certainly name yourself if you are fans of the genre that make it clear we should have been treated to something so much better than this tale of "The Brothers Grimm."</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Terry Gilliam's 'The Brothers Grimm' has a lot going for it.  Stunning visually and occasionally funny, this madcap farce could have been great.  Heath Ledger and Matt Damon give spirited performances as Wil and Jacob Grimm.  Furthermore, the cinematography is beautifully illuminating, and the scenes are filled with cliff-hanging adventure.  So why doesn't it all work?<br /><br />The components are all top quality, but it doesn't really come together.  There are even two plots skillfully interwoven:  The Brothers Grimm are kidnapped at a local pub by French soldiers and are conscripted to save an enchanted forest.  The vignettes of the fairy tales then work their way loosely into the main plot.  The effect is not unlike a Mel Brook's movie.  Gilliam and company do to the Grimm's fairy tales what Brooks did to the Frankenstein movies (in 'Young Frankenstein') or to Hitchcock (with 'High Anxiety'), except it seldom works right.  They also draw from other sources, making the inspiration of Grimm's 'Fairy Tales' much the way 'Shakespeare in Love' did for Shakespeare's plays.  It's a good premise to borrow from, but the execution also falls flat.  The film also remains true to the absurd Monty Python tradition, but these elements  often come off as forced and arbitrary.  There are bizarre elements as well, but this, too, is done in a random fashion.  (There is, for instance, an odd predilection for creepy insects that appear throughout the movie that seem unconnected to anything else that happens.)  Also, the sibling rivalry from the brother's relationship could have provided entertaining banter.  Instead, we get wit that wouldn't remind one of the weakest moments from the TV series 'Frazier'; and the slapstick is slapdash--nothing that would make it on the Cartoon Network.  If they did the whole affair straightforward, they would have made a magnificent movie.  But, in all fairness, one should judge a film by what it is rather than what it could have been.  True enough.  As a farce or as a weird trek, it fails.  Gilliam's brilliant work 'Brazil' illustrates why this movie pales in comparison--even though the special effects are matchless next to any other Python work. As an offbeat adventure, it also falls short.  The only thing that does work is the traditional adventure and enchantment.  They could have fixed the film in two ways:  If the writing were far better caliber, they would have made a movie par with the 'Bullwinkle' series, but as a grander spectacle, of course.  Their only other recourse was to play it straight and build an exciting adventure with a few, selective laughs thrown in.  And, with the ending, they almost pulled it off--instead it comes together with too many elements that don't work together.  The whole affair seems haphazard.  This is an admirable effort, but the shortcomings provide too many disappointments. (**1/2)</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.

'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', 'Life of Brian' and 'Brazil', all big hits. 'Jabberwocky', 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' - big misses.<br /><br />Sadly, the troubled and much-touted 'The Brothers Grimm', thanks to a really awful script and some dodgy pacing, falls firmly and squarely into the Miss category, with little apart from the exquisite production design saving it from total worthlessness.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm are charlatans: creating monsters and terrorising various townships with them, our would-be demon-slaying brothers charge an arm and a leg to vanquish these nasties. Caught red-handed by French nobleman Delatombe (Johnathan Price, in an uncharacteristically awful performance, with an even worse accent) and his macho, bungling lieutenant Cavaldi ('Constantine's Satan), they are sent to solve the mystery of missing children in a small village, or they'll be killed. Upon their arrival, and aided by the beautiful-but-aloof Angelika (Lena Headey), they discover that yes, real fairytale creatures do exist, and yes, more than fake weaponry and brotherly rivalry will be needed to destroy the curse of the evil Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci).<br /><br />Damon and Ledger give gung-ho, ordinary performances, as does Headey, as the trio of heroes at the centre of the tale. Baddies Price and Cavaldi, having obvious trouble with their fake accents, annoy the viewer rather than inspire dislike, and Bellucci's part is so small as to be merely perfunctory, as opposed to the whole reason for the plot. On the acting front, then, nothing major occurs.<br /><br />Direction, too, is disjointed and stop-startish. There's no real momentum to build, with the story flip-flopping between the stronghold of Delatombe and the troubled village and its surrounding forests. It's difficult enough to retain our attention in an oftentimes confusing plot that mashes several elements from many well-loved fairytales together (Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, The Golden Goose, Hansel and Gretel, and more...), but when the story lacks a definete beginning, middle and end, as this does, it becomes very difficult indeed to remain interested in the antics of, it must be said, pretty unoriginal characters.<br /><br />The production design, on the other hand, is magnificent, and the grandiose, detail-laden visual design and treatment of 'The Brothers Grimm' is a triumph. Here's a real sense of Fairytales-Gone-Bad, and the costumes, effects and scenery all marry together to create a believable and powerful atmosphere that's the only real reason to keep watching.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Brothers Grimm' isn't a great movie, but, if flashy visuals and attention to detail are your thing, then you might be able to overlook the many other weak elements of the actual script and story.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>We have decided to only rate Amazon movies from now on that are either GREAT on one extreme or HORRIBLE on the other.<br /><br />Brothers Grimm had a great premise, great sets, etc...<br /><br />The ingredients seemed right but the movie was OH SO PAINFUL AND ANNOYING TO WATCH..... very deadpan humor, stiff acting, silly Jerry Lewis slapstick comedy..... just overall a dreadfully painful movie experience to sit thru.<br /><br />My wife and the guests we had over for movie night all agreed this movie got a "D" on the normal grading scale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>In a lot of ways, this film was like 'A Beautiful Mind' where he lived out his spy fantasies.  The Brothers lived through all of the scary fairytales they enscribed into book form.  Some describe it as just a story to scare children, but it was much more.  There was a lot of witchcraft with the symbols involved.<br /><br />Once upon a time, in 1796, the Grimms not only wrote those scary tales, they lived through and researched them.  Many were pranks which turned dangerous, and others were full-fledged nightmares.  The peg-legged man was like the wood figurine I have had for a long time.<br /><br />Matt Damon was fabulous as Will, the good-looking Grimm and looked the part exactly.  The owl moving its head around is like the false one here near Krutch Park.  Eat your heart out, Arthur Friend.  The frisky brown mare was like those they use at the Civil War re-enactments here in Tennessee.  They lived all that stuff they wrote -- it was not a figment of their imaginations.<br /><br />In the tower in the middle of an enchanted forest in Germany, they found the Book of Spells where the ancient Queen awaited the last (twelfth) girl's death to make her young and beautiful again.  As the revived Queen, she was exactly like Poe's Ligeia.<br /><br />The French General's statesman looked like our Admiral Farragut.  Unemotional Mark Hairr of KAT fame, was at the formal dinner as they authenticated the enchantment.  The lively music for the executions as entertainment was like James Cameron's.  The ferocious wolf with the blue eyes which turned into a werewolf was Angelina's father, the suitor of the old Queen.  He seduced the young girls to a point where they were entranced by a horse who entraps them in a net and swallows them.  Sasha is saved from having to end up in the twelfth crypt which encircles the tower (looked like a lighthouse) in the German woods.<br /><br />The French Revolution was in full swing (Merci) and the boomerang axe which was enchanted, as well, was a good touch.  I liked the monkey jumping around on the mantle as they played "Lullaby and Good Night."  The ravens eating the bread crumbs of Gretel was cleverly done.  The old man with the long beard and lantern looked like Tommy.  The white horse was fab.  The German march music as we see the beautiful landscape and countryside was stirring.<br /><br />The woods were heavily populated with all kinds of fowl, snakes, toad (with his white frog's legs).  One thing I didn't like was when the trapper skinned and deblooded the skinny animal which could have been an alley cat.  Jacob did some good acting at the grass-covered spring house in the dark forest of superstition.  The strange catapalts were overcomplicated.  They used a divining fork, which they considered as sophisticated technology.<br /><br />Will contemplates life without Jacob as he struggles to reach the peak of the tower.  They find treasure in the tower room as in the Egyptian tombs.  The General's "dummy" assistant was a good actor.  Viva Revolution! Mark Savage.<br /><br />Will tells Jacob, "We can give it a happy ending."  The eclipse was the time when the Queen was rejuvenated.  The ending was overdone a bit.  They'd used cannons to set the woods on fire, and the old Queen's magic put out the fires.  They used a French flag to defend themselves against the General's sword.  Too bad it wasn't the fighting Confederate flag.<br /><br />Farewell to your tales, they will not be remembered.  Wrong!  You know the end of the story.  It was most entertaining and the special effects were nice.  We had quite a diverse audience at the showing I attended.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`The Brothers Grimm' directed by the important fantasy / satire director, Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame is a disappointing movie on several counts.<br /><br />First and foremost is the promise of another Gilliam movie comparable to `The 12 Monkeys', `Brazil', or even `Time Bandits'. Gilliam has had his share of flops, but overall his reputation for quirkily entertaining movies is good enough to look forward to a new effort from the director of `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and other Python movies. As it turns out, we discover in Gilliam's opening statements in his voice-over commentary, he didn't even like the script when it was first offered to him to direct.<br /><br />The second count is that Peter Jackson (`Lord of the Rings') and the Harry Potter directors have raised the bar on expectations from the quality of human and plot aspects of fantasy movies. You can't get away anymore with great special effects anymore. Jackson gets more `human interest' out of his principle ent character, Treebeard than Gilliam gets out of his whole cast, not to mention the great characterization he gets from a CGI character, Gollum.<br /><br />The third count is that the movie simply doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a horror movie or a comedy or a drama? While `Time Bandits' is largely played for laughs and `Brazil' is clearly a tragedy with some funny scenes (especially Robert DeNiro's cameo appearance scene), I simply don't know what the authors are expecting from me in this movie.<br /><br />The fourth count is a lack of depth in the characterizations and story we have what I suspect is a really weak performance from Matt Damon and not much more from Heath Ledger. Some of this may be due to the way his shots were blocked and shot, but I do get the feeling that Damon in this movie is not the Matt Damon of `Good Will Hunting' or even the Bourne movies. Then again, maybe he was simply horribly miscast, as he did so well in those other three outings. Peter Stormare as the French torturer virtually steals the show from Damon and Ledger. Gilliam regular Jonathan Pryce does well in his small role, but is not enough to raise the overall level of human acting. The overriding impression I get from Gilliam's voice-over commentary is that he spends all his time talking about how locations were used and scenery and costumes were set up. Compare this to the commentary for a great movie of characters such as Renoir's `The Rules of the Game' and you can see how little humanity there is to be found in this movie.<br /><br />The fifth count is that Gilliam and the author have dreadfully misused their underlying text, the fairy tales of the 19th century folklorists whose names are given to the two lead characters in this movie. I can imagine a movie based on exactly the same material done in an entirely different way which would have been much warmer and made much better use of their audience's memories of the fairy tales.<br /><br />One of the easiest ways to appreciate how badly this movie fails would be to compare it to a movie based on a similar premise, `Ghostbusters' with similar reliance on special effects to move the story along. While both stories involve teams of con artists facing a real supernatural danger, with their feet being held to the fire by a strong government agency, `Ghostbusters' comes off as a triumph of both comedy and victory of good over evil while `The Brothers Grimm' simply plays out our expectations. One of the many symptoms of how one movie succeeds while the other fails is the fact that up to the last scene, `Ghostbusters' was pulling unexpected rabbits out of its hat while `Grimm' was just playing out its tired story. Just imagine what `The Brothers Grimm' would have been like with Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd in the lead roles!<br /><br />My biggest puzzle with this movie is why Gilliam decided to do it if he didn't like the script. I would have thought it would have had all the markings of an earlier failure on the Baron Munchausen movie. This movie will not even make anyone's top ten list of fantasy movies.<br /><br />Even with the Gilliam voice-over commentary, this DVD is not worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>British comedy is not for everyone, and british action flicks are really not for most people, especially when starring American actors.  Once you understand and accept this fact of life, then you realize how good a movie this really is.  The storyline is simple; the two Grimm brothers (Damon and Ledger) are traveling con men in Napeolonic Europe.  They use their knowledge of optics, chemistry, physics and psychology to create apparitions in isolated villages, and then appear to save the villagers from these demons.  The local French ruler (Price) uncovers their ruse and sends them on a mission to solve a real mystery in a German village.  They, of course do, and proceed to become local heroes.<br /><br />There are numerous aspects of this film that are quite impressive and admirable.  First of, this is one of the few films to accurately portray European village life before the Industrial Revolution.  The roads are muddy, the people and their clothes are dirty as daily bathing is unknown, bad hygiene (missing teeth, etc...) is universal, superstition is ingrained in daily thoughts and speech, and children of both genders often wear the same clothes.  None of the Musketeer films have done such a good job of portraying rural Europe circa 1800.<br /><br />Second, the action scenes are deliberate and integral to the story.  There are no grand war scenes, nor eye-catching CGI.  Every action scene progresses the story in some way or another, and each is innovative.  A good example is when the farmer's horse swallows his daughter.<br /><br />Third, the casting was quite good.  Lena Headey was perfect in her role as the village outcast.  She was attractive, but not too much as to cast doubt on the validity of her role as village outcast.  The choice of Monical Belluci as the Mirror Queen was also great.  She is very attractive, but for a queen who is centuries old, Belluci's natural age was a good fit.  And Peter Stormare does quite well as local henchman.<br /><br />I saw this movie twice; once at the theater and once on DVD.  The DVD viewing is much better because I could read the subtitles.  Terry Gilliam made this movie so authentic that a lot of the dialogue includes strong accents that can be lost in a movie theater, but which is captured with subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>First off, I liked The Brothers Grimm.  In particular, I found the blend of fantasy and horror and the creepy production with moving trees and the Mirror Queen were fantastic.<br /><br />The film is set in German during the Napoleonic wars and concerns Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, con artists pulling off fake exorcisms from village to village.  The different between the brothers is that Jacob (Heath Ledger) believes in things magical and Wilhelm (Matt Damon) is a pragmatist.  The bothers and their two partners in crime have a great scam going until they are arrested by a French general (played by Jonathan Pryce) and are sent to a cursed German village where children are being mysteriously abducted to prove whether they can actually battle spirits as they claim.  In the village, they find Angelika (Lena Headley) whose sisters have been claimed by the unknown forces in the forest.  Angelike knows the forest and the evil the lives there and guides Wilhelm and Jacob to a mysterious tower that is the home of the Mirror Queen (played by Monica Bellucci).<br /><br />Like many of Terry Gilliam's films there are moments of near slap-stick comedy followed by scenes of horror or the fantastic.  Mixed into the film are hints of well-known fairy tales, such as Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel.  One of the abducted girls is wearing a red cape and two children searching in the woods are dropping breadcrumbs.  This film is stunning for its production design and special effects.  The forest is fittingly forbidding and the story holds your attention throughout the film. I have read a review that suggested that the film was difficult to follow but neither I nor my wife had any such difficulties. Matt Damon makes a good Wilhelm Grimm but Heath Ledger is a passionate Jacob as he makes his case for believing in magic and that the curse of the woods can be lifted.  Jonathan Pryce was a slimy villain but I didn't care for his accent or the foppish way that he approached his role. Lean Headley was good as the determined Angelika.  If you like fantasy films and Terry Gilliam in particular, then you should see The Brothers Grimm.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The Brothers Grimm promised to be a well of Gilliam inspired anarchy and creativity for fans of the film director. While it doesn't quie fulfill on that promise, "The Brothers Grimm" is still entertaining Gilliam even if it doesn't compare to "Brazil" or "The Fisher King" (or even "Time Bandits"). There's enough of Gilliam's inspired lunacy in the film to make it worthwhile. I, for one, hope it's a financial hit just so Gilliam can get financing for his next feature film.<br /><br />The plot postulates that the Brothers Grimm (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) are con artists using folklore and superstition to make a living from ignorant peasants. When the Grimms are caught by the authorities they're given a choice; help the authorities unmask similar con artists who are kidnapping girls from a village or be executed. Needless to say, they decide to cooperate. What the Grimms find, though, is hardly a con men trying to bilk pheasants for their money.<br /><br />While the Ehren Kruger ("The Ring","The Ring 2", Skeleton Key") script doesn't take the opportunity to develop the characters or the situations to their full potential and the film's editing feels choppy during the first hour of the film, there's still much to be appreciated and enjoyed in Gilliam's film. The film felt like it could also have been trimmed in the middle where the pacing lags a bit.<br /><br />As usual the production design is top notch and the feel of the countryside authentic right down to the crippled solider asking for money in the town square. The cinematography by Dario Marianelli compliments Gilliam's work even though this was a marriage of convenience. Although hardly perfect, "The Brothers Grimm" is still a solid adventure for Gilliam's fans. Whatever flaws prevent the film from being perfect can easily be overlooked.<br /><br />Damon demonstrates a surprisingly nice comic touch as Will Grimm. Ledger plays Jacob as a shy academic type which doesn't always quite work (there were times I thought that Jacob might have nervous tics and some sort of neurological issues). Nevertheless, the two demonstrate nice onscreen chemistry. The rest of the cast from the Gilliam regular Jonathan Pryce (in another of his performances as a military buearucrat reimiscent of the character he played in "Baron Munchausen" --which is ironic given his first Gilliam collaboration in "Brazil")to Peter Stormare in a gloriously over-the-top performance as Calvadi pull off their roles admirably. Lena Headey portrays Angelika as a steely, determined young woman who has emotionally walled herself off from the town she lives in and has no real use for the Grimm brothers until she realizes that they might actually be something more than charlatans.<br /><br />While this might not be the blockbuster that many were hoping for, it's an enjoyable ride. I found that while I was a bit disappointed in the overall effort, it's clear that Gilliam (as usual) put his heart and soul into the effort.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Not a bad movie it was just very very disjointed.  Some of the special effects were very cool but when you stop being awed by the cinematography and take a step back you realize how shoddy the construction of this movie is.  Plot threads lead everywhere and were never really effectively resolved.  There was no chemistry between any of the actors, every single person in the cast played their roles sort of tongue and check like they were expecting the other person to bust out laughing.<br /><br />The movie would not annoy me so much if not for the moronic choice of villains.  I can forgive wooden acting to a certain extent I cannot forgive wooden pointless villains.  Any time the plot actually threatened to break into new territory one of the idiotic villains would show up and ruin the moment.  If these guys were supposed to scare me or make me root for the Brothers why was I rolling my eyes when the bad guys said their lines?  Why use French people as the main point of conflict in the movie?  A lot of things in this movie don't make a whole not of sense but this is probably the biggest point.<br /><br />Bottom line-Not good, not awful I don't hate myself for watching it in the theater but I am certainly not wasting my time with it ever agian.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Brothers Grimm / B000BKVQTS<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I love medieval movies and fantasy movies, and if you're like me, you've seen this movie already, even before you buy or rent it. There is, unfortunately, very little new material here that hasn't been done before (and done better) in earlier movies.<br /><br />By the way, I'm not usually a stickler for this, but in 2005, can we reasonably start to expect appropriate props and settings in medieval movies? I mean, iron shingles on peasant huts instead of proper straw and thatch? Pulleys and explosives? Bullet-proof vests? "Single-shot" guns which can be fired over a dozen times without reloading? I hate to be picky, but the end result takes the viewer out of the narrative, and jarringly.<br /><br />Past the anachronisms in every frame, the movie is hamstrung by simply not knowing what it wants to be - is it a comedy? Horror? Drama? Action? The genres seem mushed together haphazardly. The slap-stick is lame and stale, the drama is painful and predictable (The Serious Girl is Serious because, you know, she wears pants. Except when she randomly changes into fancy dresses for Dramatic Scenes and Capture Scenes. And, no, we don't believe the Protective Brother will try to steal the girl from the Sensitive Brother, so who does the movie think it is kidding?), the action is slow - to the point where the characters seem to forget what they are doing much of the time - and the horror fails to frighten because, fundamentally, the movie is too silly to take seriously.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and there's an eviscerated kitten. A fluffy one. Thanks, Hollywood.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie and I do not want to own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Hmmmm, disappointing movie for the likes of major film stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger.<br /><br />I like the premise of the movie being that of the Grimm Brothers and how they may have come up with the fairy tales they wrote! But other than really good special effects, I can't say the movie was really worth watching! Pass on this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Personally I welcome anything from visual maestro Terry Gilliam or ex-Monty Python members, but 'The Brothers Grimm' falls short of enchanting magic of 'The Fisher King' or deliciously dark humor of 'Time Bandits.'  'The Brothers Grimm' is fun to see, especially the detailed visual techniques of the director, but the story is stale and dull, not knowing what it wants to do.  Sorry if I offend his fans, but this Grimm world is far from the originality his name is always associated with.<br /><br />[GOOD STARTING...] You know where the problem lies.  It is the story of Ehren Kruger, whose previous work was very ordinary horror 'Ring 2.'  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are The Brothers Grimm, who, in this film, are not respected scholars of falklore, but are jolly con-men who make good use of gimmicks to convince the unsuspecting German people of the presence of the horrifying witches.  Of course, it is the brothers who banish the monsters from the village before receiving the money.<br /><br />So far the story is not bad.  Silly, but OK, I kind of like that.  Then, we are told that girls are missing in the cursed forest surrounding one decaying tower, where a witch (a real one, played by Monica Bellucci) is said to live.  There, many girls start to vanish, including Little Red Riding Hood.<br /><br />[AND THE STORY GETS ASTRAY] Nice touch, I admit.  However, the film gets slower, becoming more and more dull as it reaches the part where the French troop led by the commander Jonathan Pryce (remember him in Gilliam's masterpiece 'Brazil'?).  They arrest the Brothers after occupying the land, and hand them to an overconfidnet "Italian" officer Peter Stormare, who does overact so much that I really wished his early and quick demise.  Sadly Terry Gillaim thought otherwise.<br /><br />The rest of the stort is about the mystery of the forest, which is not particularly fascinating.  Kruger's script fails to interest us because of the too familiar elements, and as the story nears the conclusion, the logics of the film starts to fall apart.  The climax is terribly incoherent, and the disenchanting love triangle involving one femele hunter (Lena Hedley) only drags me down.<br /><br />Thankfully Terry Gilliam's vibrant imagination and his wicked humor are still there, barely saving the film itself from a total mess.  Well, actually, it IS a mess, especially in the second half, and not-so-good CGIs (of the wolf, specially) and very detached acting from Bellucci do not help, but still a beautiful mess to see.  But I'd rather watch his great films in the past again, except 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.'</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>I wasn't to impressed by "The Brothers Grimm".  As a whole, this was not an entertaining movie for me.<br /><br />The film certainly has an interesting concept: The Brothers Grimm (Matt Damon & Heath Ledger) are con-artists who go from town to town exorcising witches and demons and such from the local townsfolk. When they are recruited by a constable who forces them to battle the haunted forest of Marbaden to rescue several missing children (i.e. Gretyl, Little Red Riding Hood) they have no choice but to accept or be punished.<br /><br />The performances by Damon and Ledger are good, and the cinematogrphy is nice "eye candy"  throughout the picture. The movie looks decent, but then it turns into crap less than halfway through.<br /><br />Clumsy direction, a weak script, faulty editing, & bad French accents, turn "The Brothers Grim" into a mess of a movie.<br /><br />Besides a few short but fleeeting comedic lines, the "Brothers Grimm" was a real disppointment; and as far as summer films go, this was a total let down. You would think that after delaying the release of the film for a year (a clear sign of trouble) , they could have put something better together.<br /><br />Many people applauded in the theater after the movie had ended. I am not sure if they were applauding beause they liked the movie or they were just glad to see it finally come to an end.<br /><br />In the case of this reviewer, I'd definitely have to go with the latter of the two.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I'm a big Terry Gilliam fan, so the sense of disappointment (nay, betrayal) that I felt watching The Brothers Grimm put me into a deep funk.  There really is nothing to recommend this movie.  The story is a mish-mash, the characters are tinny and weak, the acting is, at best, passable. The whole thing feels like a weak drink, watered-down Brazil with a dash of Tim Burton shallowness.<br /><br />If I had to pick the weakest part of the thing, it has to be the script. It's unevolved, never fully realized, like a amateur's third draft: lacking the life of the first and chock full of bad items that someone thought might make it ideosyncratic.  And it never finds its footing, its tone. It drifts from slightly funny to to mildly strange to loud and conventional.  What makes this all the more disheartening is that the story concept has great potential -- charlatan ghostbusters coming face to face with the real thing.  And this movie, sadly, even borrows from Ghostbusters, with a silly scene involving a character who looks like a chocolate-dipped Stay-Puft? Marshmallow Man.<br /><br />I'll wait for Terry's next film before carving my disappointment in anything permanent.  This movie looks and feels like Terry was asleep at the switch, like he was going through the motions.

Time Bandits, the Adventures of Baron Munchausen and the Fisher King all have a fever-dream quality to them, where the viewer is swept along through strange, even sometimes nonsensical paths.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm could have used more of this. There are nods in that direction, but ultimately, the film feels like a Hollywood action adventure. It's not quite as bloodless as Van Helsing, but it's cut from the same cloth. To get a film like this from Terry Gilliam is almost shocking.<br /><br />There's still plenty of whimsy and strangeness in the film -- the Italian torturer who shadows the Brothers Grimm or the involved 19th century special effects equipment used to create many of their tricks -- but it all feels very much like the film any other Hollywood creator would make. Maybe that's what Gilliam had to do for his career, after Don Quixote went off the rails as badly as it did. Even so, this film feels like an opportunity wasted.<br /><br />The world can use more of Gilliam's madness and whimsy.

What a wonderful piece of work and it has become a part of my collection of Videos until it's released on DVD.<br /><br />This new version is a drug trip gone wrong in Hollywood.  There is NO WAY you could ever take a child to see this film.  He would be scared out of his mind.  What has gone so wrong in Hollywood that they can distort wonderful literature.  Those people in Hollywood are getting more and more pervertly sick in every way.  No wonder people are not going to the movies like they use to.  To me, it shows how the Hollywood film makers looks at life. Everything to them is violent.  I was just going to say something bad about Terry Gilliam, but then i would be just as guilty as he is.  This is the beginning of the end for Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>This is a really horrible movie.  There is absolutely nothing going for it.  I had to turn it off after an hour and I can't remember the last movie I didn't bother to finish watching.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam, aside from his legendary work with Monty Python, is probably the most overrated director there is.  Jabberwocky and Time Bandits were horrible. Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were hit and miss.  His last good film was Twelve Monkeys...from 1995...11 years ago; and it doesn't look like he'll ever make another one.<br /><br />So skip this one...or at least skip the first hour...who knows, maybe the last half was pure genius.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>This movie was a movie I had seen limited previews for so I was going into blindly which tends to work well for most movies.  However, this movie was lacking passion and power.  The effects were cool but the plot was just blah.  Personally, I would hold off on watching this movie until video or find it when it hits your cheap theater as it is not worth $7.  Two much was going on that was taking away from the movie that could have been.  Go to one of the other movies out right now such as 40 Year Old Virgin or Must Love Dogs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>The Brothers Grimm (* 1/2) comes off as a what the hell was that boo disappointment movie Directed by Terry Gilliam, who I like, but this really is a far cry from his other movies like Twelve Monkeys and The Fisher King. Will Grimm, played by Matt Damon, the good Ben Affleck (upcoming Scorsese movie The Departed, Dogma) who loses the accent along the way somewhere in the film and his jittery brother Jake Grimm, played by Heath Ledger (Lords Of Dogtown, 10 Things I Hate About You), are two brothers who make up stories, well Jake does the work and Will plays along with it. In the beginning the brothers vanquish a witch from a town, which is a fake, they made it up. Then comes the real deal where they go to a village where 11 girls have gone missing...two including one dressed up like Little Red Riding Hood and the other named Greta (Gretel). The Grimm brothers set out, with a huntress, played by Lena Headey (The Cave, Gossip). Her father vanished a long time ago and it was so obvious that the wolf in the woods was her father..duh. She tells them about this witch, this witch who was in a high tower and over the years she withered and died. The Grimm Brothers then set out and find that the forest is alive and maybe it's not in their imagination. Then, they find out that the witch is still in the high tower and see needs 12 girls for their youth. Funniest part in the entire movie was when actor Peter Stormare (Constantine, The Big Lebowski) kicks a kitty cat into a spinning whirly device. The rest is a big mixed bundle of disappointment...granted, there are some clever ideas in there but it just didnt cut it for me. Also starring Monica Bellucci (The Matrix Revolutions, Brotherhood Of The Wolf) and Jonathan Pryce (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Ronin). What the hell was with the muddy ginger bread cookie man? Did we need that Terry Gilliam? No...what about the horse swallowing the girl? No, No. Ledger and Damon do what they must in this very off movie. When I saw the shiny gold ring in the movie I was remembering back to Lord Of The Rings and I was expecting Viggo Mortensen or Orlando Bloom to pop out and shove the Brothers aside and show them how it's done. Peter Stormare's French man is annoying as hell</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>I really liked this until the part with the Gingerbred man...it just ruined the whole movie for me.  The special effect just didn't go with the time era of the movie.<br /><br />This was okay...I would watch it again if someone wanted to rent it.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>The movie has just ended, and for that I am grateful. It has been two hours of sincere unpleasantness. So why did I bother with it? Well, to write this review. Now that I've finished watching, I realized that I could have stopped watching within the first 30 minutes, because there wasn't much that changed. I thought it was a train wreck initially, and I didn't change my mind.<br /><br />This was an utter, complete mess. The attempts at cleverness with regard to twisting the Grimm's tales failed miserably, with one exception, and it succeeded only marginally. If I mention it, I will have put a spoiler into the review, so I won't.<br /><br />That Terry Gilliam directed this is unbelievable. I would have thought him far too good for such a wretched disaster.<br /><br />Damon and Ledger were serviceable, in their performances, but they had no chemistry together. The one scene that could have offered some form of chemistry came far too late, and was snatched away from us just in the nick of time. The one true moment of the film, and it never happened. What a pity.<br /><br />So they were charlatans, then ended up fighting real monsters, and then, we suppose, wrote their grim tales based on their experiences - giving "clever" twists to their resulting stories based on the "facts". I so want to say that I loved how clever it was, but I can't. It was only marginally clever. And whatever cleverness there was, there was a complete lack of suspense that overrode everything. With all of the action, the near death scenes, the real death scenes - there should have been enormous suspense and extremely enjoyable action.<br /><br />Nope. Wasn't there.<br /><br />Even the scenes that were supposed to be funny were flat. This evoked zero emotion from me. It should not have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Brothers Grimm" is great! Matt Damon (Wilhelm Grimm) and Heath Ledger (Jacob Grimm) are great. Peter Stormare adds some comic relief as Cavaldi. Terry Gilliam's directing is excellent. The story & screenplay by Ehren Kruger (who recently wrote the screenplays for "The Ring Two" (2005) & "The Skeleton Key" (2005) is great. The music by Dario Marianelli is great. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel (who also did the cinematography to "X2" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Lesley Walker (who also film edited some of Gilliam's films, like "The Fisher King" (1991) & "Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas" (1998) is great. The production design by Guy Dyas (who also did the production design to "X2" (2003) and the upcoming "Superman Returns" (2006) is excellent. The art direction by Andy Thomson & Frank Walsh (who both also did the art direction, recently, to "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" (2005) is excellent. The set decoration by Guy Dyas & Judy Farr is excellent. The costume design by Gabriella Pescucci (who most recently did the costume design to "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" (2005) & "Van Helsing" (2004) & Carlo Poggioli (who also did the costume design with Pescucci to "Van Helsing" (2004) and also "Cold Mountain" (2003) is excellent. This is a dark, funny, and twisted satire on the fairy tales that inspired the Grimm brothers.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Wilhelm & Jakob Grimm are famous for writing "fairy tales", which were grotesque and extremely "grim". How they became so popular to kids is only that kids' minds have a more resilient approach to horror. Here we have a big bad wolf and Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel & Gretel and a sort of Rapunzel character, but in the hands of Terry Gilliam, it's all given a new approach. Will & Jake are con men trying to scratch out a living, in a German countryside that's infested with the French army. (Imagine that!)  Without giving anything away, they save a village and children, purge a wicked queen, and make everyone happy. Everything in between is most amusing. Matt Damon & Heath Ledger are the attractive brothers, and Ledger shows a special flair for physical comedy. There's a happy ending, and it suggests that the brothers got the ideas for their stories from experience. Peter Stormare is especially delightful in his parody of the frightened Italian soldier. Special Effects were used (CGI) sparingly, but to good advantage. I enjoyed it a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to this film the second I heard about it since I'm a Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits, Brazil, 12 Monkeys) fan. I chickened out of seeing it in theatres since their was so many bad reviews. Now that I've seen it, I'm glad I did because it's really not that bad. It's not as good as a lot of Gilliam's other films but it's still a fun movie. I have an active imagination, so a movie like this is a dream come true to me. It takes a whole bunch of fairy tales and turns it into one enchanting horror/fantasy. It's sort of how Van Helsing takes all the classic monsters and puts them in one movie.<br /><br />  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger star as two brothers who fake battles with friends dressed up like monsters just to make some money. Soon though, they find themselves up against the real thing. They are sent on a mission to rescue captured children. Not just any children though, most of them you may recognize from classic stories such as Little Red Riding Hood. Ledger is the driving force of the movie. He believes in magic and happy endings and his brother played by Damon, just thinks he's an idiot. When their mom was sick when they were little, he sells the cow for magic beans instead of money that would pay for her doctor. Before he can plant the beans, Damon knocks them out of his hands and calls him an idiot. So when they're older, Damon still holds that against him. Damon trys hard and is good here but surprisingly Ledger steals the show. Ledger had a great year, he showed the entire year that he's not just a pretty face but also an excellent actor. He does that here as well. He'll probably even be nominated for an oscar this year and he deserves it.<br /><br />  The movie is a little mean spirited with how each child is taken and it's sort of disturbing. It could turn-off some viewers. Plus the film doesn't know if it's a comedy, fantasy or horror film. So that can make it a bit of a mess.The violence is a little too graphic and mean to be funny. The kid being swallowed by a horse in one scene for instance, is just creepy. Still though, it is pretty creative. The whole film is creative and that's what I like about it. I respect all the work and thought that goes into a film like this. That's why unlike some people, I just don't give out one star or even 2 unless the film is just too horrible to sit through. In that case I don't think the film is even worth writing about. After seeing the Brothers Grimm though, I couldn't wait to write a review for it. It's a little clunky with how it's put together but it's still a fun movie. Plus if you could sit through Van Helsing and actually like it, then you should love this. This is a Terry Gilliam film we're talking about here...not a Stephen Sommers film after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is a Terry Gilliam film, so if you have seen Brazil or 12 Monkeys you know this guy doesn't make films for the popular masses. Out of the all the movies of his I have seen, The Brothers Grimm is the closest thing to a hollywood film Gilliam has made in my opinion. I heard a lot of scenes were cut out due to the studio pressure, so there will likely be a Director's Cut which should help the film flow together a little better. The acting is very good from Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the brothers, but once again Peter Stormare steals the show with his zany officer of torture. The film is visually a beautiful sight, filled with lush landscapes and an enchanted forrest. I liked how many Grimm fairytales were woven into this magical world (Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, etc.) and the CGI wasn't overdone. Overall, The Brothers Grimm is a worthy film in Terry Gilliam's uniquely brilliant library.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I didn't know what to expect with this movie.

I went for a 1080p LCD and a Blu-Ray player to go with it, and as soon as I got these I wanted to get a movie to try out the 1080p definition.  This film seemed like a good choice, since I thought that the colors and characters of a fantastic story would allow the player to showcase its qualities. I really did not expect the plot to be all that great, but that was not what I was interested in at the time.<br /><br />The quality of the image was absolutely breathtaking, and superior to a couple of other Blu-Ray movies I have watched afterwards. But what was even more surprising was that the story was actually pretty good. The film immerses us in a town in the Germany of the early nineteenth century. But this is a fictional Germany, which is occupied by France, and in which we find a town next to an enchanted forest. The brothers Grimm are con artists that go from village to village feeding people's fears and charging them for eliminating the evil spirits. Running into the real thing is a rude awakening.<br /><br />If you enjoy fairy tales, this movie will keep you entertained throughout its duration, with an amusing story, satiric elements connected to famous fairy tales, and beautiful scenery. The performances of Damon and Ledger are actually pretty good. Even though it is hard to play roles that are a little "silly", these actors do a decent job at it. That is not the case with Peter Stormare, who plays the role of Cavaldi, an evil torturer who has a change of heart after meeting the brothers. Stormare is absolutely outstanding in his role, and leaves a long lasting impression.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to adults that enjoy fairy tales. But beware; this is not a movie to watch with your small children, mainly because in the same vein as the actual stories from the Grimm brothers, there are some scenes that may be too scary for little ones.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>A couple of weeks ago, I went out to see The Brothers Grimm.  It's a Terry Gilliam film, the well-known director of films such as Brazil and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  With such an illustrious past, Gilliam has much to live up to.<br /><br />With this effort, he's gone a little more mainstream, and a little more linear.  This is not to say that the movie is bad--it's not.  It's just that it's a little more normal than Gilliam fans would have expected.<br /><br />The movie tells the tale of two brothers, last name Grimm, who roam the German countryside, scamming unsuspecting small towns who are "haunted" or "betwitched" or somesuch, with said calamities actually created by the Grimms and their compadres.  Unfortunately for the Grimms, they've been caught by the government, and set the task of un-cursing a small town which, the government believes, is ensnared by another group of scam artists.  Unfortunately for the brothers, things are all too supernaturally real.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Heath Ledger play the lead characters, and don't do a bad job with their material.  Monica Bellucci plays a queen, and she doesn't do so well with the material, but her character is supposed to be rather shallow, so there's little damage.<br /><br />Great special effects and sound on a reasonable budget.  CG effects must be getting pretty cheap!<br /><br />I would recommend it, but only pay the matinee prices.  It's OK for older kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the Brothers of the title, look like they really enjoyed themselves making this movie, and whereas that's a good thing, it does take away from some of the picture. This is the first movie that Terry Gilliam has done since Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) and is a return to some of the more fantastical elements of his imagination, and directing skills. Most of his movies have either been disastrous, or remain cult classics with his fans, and hopefully this will be a welcome return to the big screen, and the box office.<br /><br />The story is an interesting twist on the famous fairytale authors, suggesting that the Brothers fed on the fears and superstitions of local peasants back in the 1800 and something's, by showing up and ridding the folks from demons, witches and the like with their own magic and exorcisms. The fact that they provided the "false" spirits in the first place through inventive (for the time) magic shows and props, was just incidental to the fact that they were heroes making an honest living. All seems well until the arrival of Jonathan Pryce as a warring French General in the region of occupied Germany where the brothers are working, who arrests them for being charlatans, and makes them a mafia style offer. They can either stay and be tortured to death by his henchman Cavaldi (brilliantly comic performance by Peter Stormare, piled high with pathos) or investigate the disappearance of all the young girls at a nearby town, on the edge of an enchanted wood. Pryce believes that someone with a similar MO to the Grimms is up to no good, as do the Grimms themselves, until they arrive, and actually see things that are more than hard to explain.<br /><br />The banter between Damon and Ledger is great, Ledger being the younger more imaginative sibling who makes notes on all their travels (hinted at being the famous fairytale bible) and Damon more rational and grounded. It will of course take a combination of them both, and the local knowledge of the fetching Lena Headey as Angelika to solve the mystery.<br /><br />I never felt like this was a big budget picture, the locations are fairly grim themselves, with rain filled muddy streets in small villages, and a forest made on a sound stage, but the overall effect was a real treat. Gilliam injects enough "magic" into the picture without being way way "out there" as you felt in movies like The Fisher King, and Baron Munchausen, and supports the maxim, that less is more.<br /><br />I won't spoil the story; it's inventive, funny, a little spooky in places for younger viewers, and cleverly laced with many references to the many and varied much loved tales of the famous authors. Go see for yourself, chances are you'll have fun. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Before reviewing The Brothers Grimm, it might be pertinent to explain the background of the director, Terry Gilliam. Gilliam was born in the United States but has citizenship in Britain, so that probably colors his perceptions of the world a bit more than your usual "I live here" American.  He's also directed the following films: Jabberwocky, Time Bandits, Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Twelve Monkeys, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  And oh yeah, he was part of Monty Python, creating the animations for Monty Python and the Holy Grail. If you can't find a common theme amongst those films, you've got it right: they're all extremely choppy, highly creative, all-over-the-place experiences that include flashbacks, hallucinations, and lots of European humor.<br /><br />That brings us to his latest effort, The Brothers Grimm, an accumulation of all the film experiences that Gilliam has acquired up to now. The plot is almost ancillary; like all of Gilliam's films, The Brothers Grimm is more a collection of scenes and concepts.<br /><br />Our heroes are Wilhelm Grimm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger).  Wilhelm is the no-nonsense, practical, warrior type. His brother Jacob is the exact opposite: bookish, introverted, and prone to flights of fantasy.  These two tour the countryside, making up monsters to scare the peasants and using the latest in Medieval (?) technology to pull off elaborate hoaxes.  Then the Grimm brothers ride into town to save the day, shades of Dragonheart.<br /><br />Of course, our two lovable rogues can't get away with this forever.  And so they eventually cross Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce), a French nobleman who doesn't believe in fairytales at all. He wants to put an end to rumors about an evil queen haunting an enchanted German wood in one of his recently conquered territories. Delatombe's chief henchman is the Italian Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), a toupee-wearing gun nut with a penchant for torture. With Cavaldi in tow, the Grimm brothers (or as Cavaldi likes to call them, "Grimmi") are sent out to do battle with whatever thing is kidnapping the children.<br /><br />Along the way, there are nods to fairytales of all sorts, including Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, The Gingerbread Man, Sleeping Beauty, Hansel and Gretel, The Toad Prince, and probably a bunch that I missed.  All throughout the movie, children are abducted in horrifying ways.  Gretel's animated kerchief lures her to certain doom.  Another child thinks he hears a horse crying out for help and, when he frees it, is snared by webbing from the horse's mouth...then it SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.<br /><br />It was about this time that I remembered Gilliam's complete and utter disrespect for modern conventions of who you're not supposed to kill or abuse.  Gilliam has never really cared one whit about the unspoken rules of movie plots, such as "don't harm children or animals."  Not only are the kids terrorized by scary monsters, there's even a moment when a kitten is accidentally pulped by a torture device.  A bit of gore spatters onto the cheek of Delatombe, who proceeds to taste it.  Mmm, delicious!<br /><br />The most horrifying point in the film is when a young girl named Sasha tries to help a struggling bird out of a well.  She ends up being overcome by the most horrifying goop monster I have ever witnessed on screen.  Every time the goop monster touches her flesh, it absorbs one of her organs.  In this case, it erases her face and manifests two eyes and a mouth.  It's like watching Pink Floyd's The Wall all over again.  Sasha runs around flailing without eyes or a face as this little squat goop monster, grinning maniacally, sloshes after her.  This scene seriously freaked me out. I'm not sure how Gilliam pulled off a PG-13 rating, but this film is certainly not for young children. Come to think of it, maybe it wasn't for me either.<br /><br />The film's sets look completely fabricated and the special effects aren't quite up to par with today's standards.  Still, that's part of the film's charm, in the same way that Sleepy Hollow was clearly a fairytale.  Gilliam doesn't strive to make the film convincing, though he does filled it with flavor-bad accents, strange lighting, and over-the-top characters.  I don't know if it was a blessing or a curse that my five years of Italian apparently paid off-I could understand what Cavaldi was saying!<br /><br />As it turns out, the Mirror Queen (the delectable Monica Bellucci), holed up in a tower with no entrance, haunts the forest. The Woodsman (Tomas Hanak), a werewolf with a boomerang axe, serves her.  She also has a variety of other critters under her control, including spiders, beetles, and animated trees.  .<br /><br />Opposing the Mirror Queen is Angelika (the equally delectable Lena Headey), a ranger-I mean huntsman-who has already lost several sisters to the Queen's machinations.  She instantly becomes a love interest for the two brothers to squabble over.  She also cast spells of a sort by believing in every superstition, including licking toads to navigate across the ever-changing enchanted forest. Good stuff for a Dungeons & Dragons adventure, actually<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's also plotted like a bad D&D session.  After the first encounter with the Mirror Queen, our heroes are sent packing back to France, whereupon he curses them for failing, threatens to torture Angelika, and then changes his mind and sends them back to the forest again, fully loaded with supplies.  It strains credibility that the evil French Guy would do such a thing, but it seems as if the writer (Ehren Kruger) painted himself into a corner and couldn't figure a way out.<br /><br />And back they go, better equipped to fight the Queen again.  Only to fail.  Again.  And then have the French army arrive (on recently claimed Germany territory, remember), to burn the forest down to the ground.  Which, if you think about it, is really a good idea when you've got problems with monsters in the forest.<br /><br />Things spiral from there and more or less go the way you expect them to go. Bad guys are killed, good guys succeed in spite of their bumbling stupidity, and the climactic moment of the Mirror Queen's return just happens to coincide with every other major plot point.  Given that this movie is about fairytales, that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />But it bears mentioning that The Brothers Grimm isn't as much a crowd pleaser as it is a film filled with Message.  And there are quite a few: fairytales aren't always nice, good people die, and sometimes it pays to believe in your dreams. It's a modern parable about fairytales, how they mirror reality, and the grim reflections that lurk beneath them.<br /><br />Fairytales once served as warnings and parables, to scare children into doing the right thing at the right time.  The Brothers Grimm is no different.  That doesn't necessarily make it a movie for everyone though.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>This movie follows the Grimm brothers thru Europe during their heyday.  Although don't look at this movie as a real representation of the two brothers.  If you don't know who the Grimm brothers are they have created some of the greatest fairytales.  Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood are just two of their many fantastic tales.  This movie creates a less than stellar tale.<br /><br />First off trying to capture what the movie is about.  Is it a whimiscal tale or a tale of two cons.  You eventually find out this story is a little of both.  The Grimm Brothers have been captured by the French and it's up to them to reveal the mystery of why so many children are disappearing from a Germanic village.  The brothers are portrayed as conmen trying to deceive people of precious money in order to rid them of fake ghosts.  Now the brothers must find the real answer as to why these children keep disappearing.<br /><br />This movie attempts to thrill but doesn't do a very good job of it.  It seems like a cross between a childrens tale and an adult movie.  Unfortunately it fails at both.  I believe this movie would have been much better if it was geared towards children.  Although many of the Grimm Brothers tales were violent they have been sanitized over the years.  Not to say this movie is awful it just misses it's mark.  Very little suspense or scary scenes here.  It's hard to hang on any characters since known seem very endearing.<br /><br />Now the movie looks great on Blu-ray.  It sounds great on Blu-ray.  Generally if you like fantasy type movies with mystical environments this movie may be for you.  Although it's hard to justify the purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>And i tought they could'nt make good movies anymore...i was fooled.<br /><br />Get your munchies and popcorn ready cause once the movie starts you<br /><br />will not want to pause it for too long..

However, the notion of an open mind has a very vague connotation, which is also the intention of Gilliam.  After examination of Gilliam's previous work it is evident that his visual manifestations have a bizarre and even unearthly tone to them.  It is with innovating imagination that Gilliam applies his artistry to the silver screen, as his creations are often fantastic in nature with a strong touch of cognitive dissonance.  Within the conflicting concepts, Gilliam allows the viewer to cerebrally struggle with one or multiple ideas, which presents some of his ingenious cinematic dexterity.  On occasion, his visions can feel a little tangled, and leave the viewer slightly disoriented.<br /><br />In many aspects, Gilliam is a pioneering artist that requires artistic freedom when he plunges into his passion.  It also means that when his creation is finished it does not always allow the audience to grasp his intentions, as his thoughts on the screen do not easily transfer to the mind of the audience.  Some of difficulty with Gilliam's films might rest in the audience's inability to surrender themselves to the story.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is one of these stories that might easily vanish among the many Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter's (J.K. Rowling wanted Gilliam to direct her Harry Potter books), and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  These epic fantasy films have serious undertones and strong moral messages while applying fascinating might and magic.  Gilliam uses a different approach, as he always breaks away from the well-traveled road.  In this process, Gilliam attempts to reach an audience that would allow themselves to unlock their tightly secured maturation and let out this inner child.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is not as easy as Gilliam anticipated to let out the child within each adult, as many have deem the story self-indulgent and an immature journey of irresponsibility.  Nonetheless, in Gilliam's free adaptation of the Brothers Grimm remains true to the gruesome violence in the Grimm fairy tales.  Thus, those that state that the story is too violent for children should consider the film in its historical context, as parents, grandparents and other relatives scared the bejesus out of their children to foster certain behaviors centuries ago.<br /><br />One of the traditional characteristics in Gilliam's films is humor, dry and witty with occasional slapstick to soften up the audience.  It might be relic from his days with the Monty Python, yet he is also very well aware of the importance of human laughter and its ability to heal people in pain.  Sometimes I get the feeling that Gilliam feels sorry for those who do not laugh, as he always incorporates some element of humor in his cinematic creations.  Thus, the audience should also be aware of the amusing absurdity in the Brothers Grimm, as the film frequently applies much of this healthy cerebral exercise.<br /><br />The story itself in the Brothers Grimm follows the two Grimm brothers Jacob (Heath Ledger) and Wilhelm (Matt Damon), as they make a living exploiting people's superstition.  Eventually, the law catches up with them, as the Italian torture master Cavaldi (Peter Stormare) arrests them by order of the French General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce).  However, a second chance is given to the Grimm's as they are told to put a stop on the mysterious events in the forest of Marbaden. If they succeed, Delatombe will spare their lives.<br /><br />Once Jacob and Wilhelm arrive to the German village of Marbaden with their eager to kill supervisor Cavaldi, they begin to witness the strange events of the small village.  With the help of the local scout and ranger Angelika (Lena Headey) they enter the woods and to their bewilderment they learn that there indeed exists strange and dangerous creatures heard from fairy tales.  Squeezed between two sides - the imaginary and the real - they soon learn that both sides want them dead.  It is an intriguing symbolical struggle, as imagination faces off with rationalization.  The struggle could also offer an analogy to modern times, as wars do not show sympathy to the people caught in between the fighting parts.<br /><br />Besides the fairy tale, the film presents a myriad of concepts both psychological and social in nature.  For example, the individual construction of beliefs, morals, and values emerge within the story through a childhood trauma experienced by both Jacob and Wilhelm concerning magical beans.  Expansionism and power then go under scrutiny through the character Delatombe and the magical creature in the woods.  Together these ideas offer a criticism of the contemporary society, as it is too rigid and not always understanding of the differences within the many parts of the world.  The intolerance often fueled by greed for power is the film eternal beauty.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is brilliant in several ways, but the profiteering machine of the film industry has blocked its genius in the contrasting light of many other films.  Thus, in comparison with other films, which are a natural act, the true gem within the film dissolves into a trite fantasy adventure.  However, if the viewer allows himself or herself to transcend beyond the ordinary into a world of individuality a sparkling fantasy tale that freely adapts the Grimm's fairytale world emerges.  Lastly, Gilliam's intentions are admirable, but to expect most people to free themselves from their previous experience is also a little too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I don't know why I finally decided to watch this after all these years.<br />I was in the mood for something spooky I guess.<br />Based on all the negative reviews this movie has gotten I was curious...with Ledger and Damon could it really be THAT bad?<br />Well...no.  :)<br /><br />This movie is VERY Tim Burton Sleepy Hallow except it came out years before that movie.<br />The atmosphere, art direction, cinematography, acting, score were all done excellently.<br /><br />The bad...the pacing was the only thing I didn't care for.<br />At 2 hours it felt a good half hour longer than it needed to be.<br />That minor complaint aside, if you love creepy Halloweenish Tim Burton sytled movies with great acting, visuals and dark humor than I'd say give this film a whirl.<br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>What an adventure! And the magic! Wow! I really enjoyed this film. Think back to the first time you saw or read about Cinderella or Little Red Riding Hood. There's something special in those stories, something magical and adventurous in every fairy tale. The Brothers Grimm is one giant fairy tale. And it's amazing. It's a movie that I'm sure the two brothers themselves would enjoy. What makes this fairy tale great is a combination of light, fluffy, happy material and the dark, foreboding material, both of which are set to an amazing film score by Dario Marianelli. And let's not forget the talents of Heath Ledger and Matt Damon.<br /><br />Damon and Ledger are Wilhelm and Jacob, the famous Brothers Grimm who travel from town to town and ridding each one of a spooky, mythological monster or ghost. What the people don't realize is that the monsters and ghosts are farce, that the brothers create a spectacle about killing the famed creature to extort money from the townspeople. This practice eventually lands the boys in big trouble, and they are sent to the town of Marbaden to assist in figuring out why the children keep disappearing and why the trees in the forest are moving.  Wilhelm is scientific about the whole thing and can't believe that any of it is actually real. The trees must be moving because they are attached to some sort of device, right? Jacob believes the opposite, thinking that the forest is magical and haunted by a legendary, vain queen who was locked in the tower with no doors or steps that still looks over the entire town and forest.<br /><br />If you want to know, I suggest you get to a theater, or more practically, wait till it comes out on DVD since this movie isn't playing in many theaters right now. It's definitely worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. The visuals are amazing and the atmosphere, the music, the story, all make this a wonderfully magical film!

It stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as two brothers who fight sorcery and various supernatural elements. The film is full of amusing characters and delightfully unexpected visual turns. For those that appreciate their fantasy/horror with imaginative, and over the top humour (Pirates of the Carribbean, Evil Dead 2) then this might suit their taste.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks great and there are a few extra features including deleted scenes, audio commentary with the director, and a short feature on the special effects seen in the film with views by Terry Gilliam.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>There's a real payoff in every way during the denouement of this Gilliam phantasmagoria, but sitting through the previous 90 minutes is not always easy.<br /><br />The main issue is the script and/or the editing, which produces a confusing opening act that is rarely clear and oft confusing. At points I was uncertain precisely what had happened, to whom, and why. Yet it was all so gorgeously rendered, and Damon so often wryly humorous, that I stuck it out.<br /><br />Glad I did, for the last half hour is truly masterful, and almost seems to be lifted from another movie---a movie where everything moves forward logically, the effects support the plot, and the characters' actions make sense. It made me sad, because if the rest of the film was this good it would have been a true a classic. Alas.<br /><br />My respect for Gilliam remains undiminished; his main fault here seems to me to have been not doctoring the early part of the script to make more sense and move more quickly. There are various liitle inside jokes/lines about not having enough money, which further research reveals must have been Gilliam's pokes at the studio for giving him "only" 75 million dollars to make this. Since when is 75 mil a pittance? One of the extra features has Gilliam mentioning that he wanted to avoid CGI and use real-action, but when he saw the rushes of the walking trees, for example, they looked horrible. And thus he used CGI. Sounds like Terry is at fault for not budgeting himself properly and blowing too much on pipe dreams.<br /><br />So perhaps that's where all the money went. In any case, the costumes and sets are mostly stellar, and the film looks like a million bucks, or at least 75. Yet the flaws remain. No order of filmic extravagances can save a muddled script. Ledger did little for me; Damon outperforms him easily by bringing some wryness to his portrayal, something Ledger was incapable of here. There are many moments reminiscent of other fantasy flicks; Legend and Van Helsing seemed to have been touchstones. But this film suffers as Legend did from implacability, and doesn't have enough of VH's tongue in cheek self-mocking to make it all fun.<br /><br />There are also some jarring scenes that detract, like the lengthy very real skinning of a rabbit, sickening to see in context of all this beauty. The kitchen sink et cetera are here, and take away from the focus of the movie, which to me should have been more on the original Grimm's fables and their many lovely and fearful contrasts and less on this script's pointlessly byzantine workings.<br /><br />I'd rarely recommend it, but simply watching the last half hour of BG might be the way to go. You won't miss much plotwise, and you'll see a truly great mini-movie. It'll make you want to see the rest, and when you watch that you'll lament at how close this is to a truly classic fantasy flick...and how far.<br /><br />But then again, Gilliam gave us not only the excellent movies Brazil and Time Bandits, and the perfect Holy Grail, but also the slapdash flops of Jabberwocky and Baron Munchhausen; this isn't his first confusing mess. Perhaps his Python buddies would have added the humor and focus this film shoots for but never quite attains.<br /><br />[And by the way: Happy New Decade to all! Let's hope this one turns out better than the aptly-named Zeroes. No villain in Grimm could ever touch Daddy's Little Idiot.]</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Many of you grew up in the sugar coated version of their tails. Some have read the real ones and recoiled. Well we finally get the real skinny; this fine true to life movie is more of a documentary explaining the real Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />In French occupied Germany the brothers Jake and Will Grimm (Heath Ledger and Matt Damon) are out to make a fast buck. And they do to, until they are found out by the French general Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce who played Juan Per&oacute;n in "Evita" [1996]). Now force to work for the French or perish they must confront what appears to be a better organized group of hucksters, or just maybe the real thing.<br /><br />Will they accomplish their mission and maybe find a new respect for each other?  Or will they fail to save a damsel in distress. Can we hold up through all this peril?<br /><br />Anyway this is an enjoyable film even if a bit too campy. And they all lived happily ever after. Well maybe not.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393058484">The Annotated Brothers Grimm</a></p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>Terry Gilliam is not unlike Tim Burton; both have an highly visual (rather than verbal) approach to telling stories. The story itself is less important than the imagery it inspires in their minds. So they sometimes choose weak or thin scripts (eg, "Edward Scissorhands", "Baron Munchausen"). "The Brothers Grimm" is, unfortunately, one of those weak scripts.<br /><br />The idea of the Grimms being con artists who take advantage of their knowledge of M&auml;rchen to defraud people by exorcising "spirits" of their own creation is farcical, which works against the seriousness of the real-life horror story they're dragged into. This might have worked if Gilliam had gradually adjusted the film's tone from light to dark, but he fails to do this -- there are too many comic characters and too much humor throughout. We're not sure whether this is a comedy or a scary fairy tale. It winds up being not much of either.<br /><br />There is one moment of marvelous pre-irony (???). After Jakob (Heath Ledger) has restored Angelika with a kiss of "true love", Angelika suggests that he do the same to his seemingly dead brother Wilhelm! Ledger tentatively leans over to deliver the buss, but Wilhelm (Matt Damon) awakes and tells him not to. And in the commentary for a deleted scene, Terry Gilliam remarks that it was removed because it rendered the film's structure "broken-backed". Weird.<br /><br />"The Brothers Grimm" is worth seeing once, simply for its magnificent cinematography and production design. But it's not very satisfying as either a comedy or a fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2005's "The Brothers Grimm" features a host of talented actors (Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Peter Stormare, Maria Belluci, Lena Headey, Jonathan Pryce), an experienced director (Terry Gilliam), and a franchise on the famous childhood fairytales, along with the CGI technology to bring everything to life.  The movie as delivered is therefore something of a disappointment.<br /><br />Damon and Ledger play Will and Jacob Grimm, two 18th Century con-men roaming a French-occupied Germany to rid small towns of their ghosts and goblins, for a price.  The two con-men run afoul of French law enforcement.  The local military governor (played with over-the-top menace by Jonathan Pryce), by way of punishment, sends them to stop a rash of child kidnappings in a small town, under the watchful eye of his chief torturer Cavaldi (played with manic energy by Peter Stormar).<br /><br />In the small town, the Brothers Grimm find themselves for the first time up against the real deal, an enchanted forest inhabited by monster trees and animals, at the center of which is a mysterious tower haunted by a long-missing queen. They enlist the aid of a local huntress (played with Amazonian strength by Lena Headey), who guides them into the forest.  The two brothers wrestle with the mystery of the missing children, racing the clock to head off a mythic tragedy while staying one step ahead of the vengeful clutches of the French military governor.<br /><br />The on-screen presentation is visually dense almost to a fault.  Scenes are packed with details, which creates a textually rich experience, but which is delivered far faster than the average viewer can absorb.  The storyline is also dense with allusions to aspects of the original Grimm's fairytales, which unfortunately have little to do with the plot of the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest challenge of the movie is that it can't decide whether to be a straight-up horror movie, a comedy, or some dramatic hybrid of the two.  The result is a frantic but uneven and often incoherent mash-up.<br /><br />This movie is visually exciting to watch; viewers with limited expectations who are fans of Damon and Ledger will find it entertaining but not much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Every so often, a movie comes along that seemingly defies any and all explanations.  Let's face facts; the concept of this whole story is just plain weird.  Here's the pitch: you know those two brothers who wrote all the children's fairy tales?  Well, we want to take these two guys and turn them into con men going around saving villages from "ghosts," "demons," and the like.  Then, we'll have, oh, let's say the French army, maybe, take them into custody, threaten to kill them, and then send them out to this Germanic village where kids keep disappearing into the forest.  Oh, and we'll throw little scenes of fairy tales in there at random moments - of course, it won't make a whole lot of sense, but we just can't pass up the opportunity to throw Little Red Riding Hood into the mix somewhere.  I'm telling you, man, this baby is going to be huge - that's why we need eighty million dollars to bring this utterly ridiculous story to life.<br /><br />I have to ask: did anyone actually believe this oddity of a film could possibly pay for itself at the box office?  The whole movie was just one ridiculous thing after another.  It's strange, though - the weak plot actually becomes a strength of sorts, as it keeps you on the lookout for whatever twisted fairy tale concept they could possibly throw in the mix next.  I almost hate to admit it (and I certainly don't understand it), but The Brothers Grimm was actually fairly entertaining - largely thanks to Heath Ledger and Matt Damon.  I had no idea this was even Matt Damon until I looked at the credits following the film.  I usually don't care for the guy, so the filmmakers did a great job making him hard to recognize.  The script itself is rather ridiculous; I don't see how anyone inside a film production company could have taken this project seriously.  Someone did, though, and secured a huge budget right along with it.  The money wasn't wasted, as most of the special effects are more than acceptable, but that's just a huge amount of money to spend on a moderately entertaining film destined to have audiences laughing at it as often as they laugh along with it.<br /><br />I must say that they definitely got one thing right in the movie, though.  A mere gust of wind is enough to send a large party of French soldiers into a panic-stricken retreat.  That one satisfying moment isn't enough to make up for all of the time we have to spend with prissy, arrogant Frenchman as the story plods along, but it's by far the most memorable scene for yours truly.  Overall, I would have to give The Brothers Grimm 3.5 stars (which I have to round down to 3).  This could have been a pretty impressive film, but the necessary focus and vision just never came together.  The Brothers Grimm is good for a few laughs, and that's about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I must say that I had expected Broters Grimm to impress and entertain me as much as Sleepy Hollow, but it turned out to be a rather boring fantasy/horror/comedy movie. The set designs, costumes, and special effects deserve more credits in this film, while the story and performances were mediocre or even silly at times. What was Monica Belluci doing here with merely less than 10 minutes of screentime? I mean afterall, she's the current "It" girl in European movie industry.<br /><br />Wil(Matt Damon) and his younger brother Jacob Grimm(Heath Ledger) are so-called con artists who make a living pulling off tricks on unsuspecting witch-terrorized peasants. One day, the brothers are hired by the people of Marbaden Village to retrieve their missing girls. With no real training whatsoever, the brothers set out into the nearby forest to find the missing girls. They are assisted by Angelika(Lena Hedey) who had some knowledge and skills to protect herself from the evil-enchanted forest. Her two younger sisters were also abducted myteriously by unseen force in the woods and her father had been missing for many years as well. During the mission, the brothers and Angelika encountered strange things and gets attacked by moving trees and a powerful wolf that occasionally gets transformed into human form. To her surprise, the wolf turned out to be her father who had been rescued and controlled by the powerful Mirror Queen(Monica Belluci) who had been the leading force in the abduction of the girls in order to perform a ritual that would reverse her old age to youthful beauty again.....<br /><br />Johnathan Price gives a striking performance as a arrogant and powerful French authority. He was a bit of a comic relief with a pretty realistic accent, but his character is somewhat on the sidetrack from the main plot.  Heath Ledger had a hell of time trying to display numerous clumsy mannerism and behaviors. Matt Damon occasionally failed to maintain a perfect British accent and he never quite managed to deliver the jokes effectively. What was more annoying was the brothers had to go through very amateurish looking fight scenes that certainly required no stunt doubles. The sultry and beautiful Monica Belluci was willing to don on two looks; the fairest of them all and the oldest and ugliest of them all. Gotta love her elaborate headpiece and cleavage revealing costume! I was also disappointed by the not so climatic happy ending. No wonder this film got postponed for so long before releasing this summer.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Fairy tales never were. Oh, there was some prettying up in the 19th century and after, to stop the adults from having nightmares, then to keep the kids happy. But the original stories came from small, scared people in a big, scary world that they couldn't control or understand.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam has brought back all that. That thing you almost see moving in the dark corner - it's there. That strange person who seems to know things others don't - she does. That feeling that something is going to get you - it's true.<br /><br />The Brothers start out as carefree con-men, working their petty scams across the countryside. They preyed on the superstitious fears of the peasantry and the simple people of the villages. It turned out, though, that some of those old stories were real. Gilliam brings them to life with a deliciously eerie edge. Being Gilliam, you can count on a few (or more than a few) bubbly giggles mixed in, or the dark mood would simple congeal around you.<br /><br />It's good. I won't spoil the story for you, but it's good. There are some nice effects, but maybe not as many as you'd think. And don't worry about how that mirror got un-cracked after the first hit.

The story stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Will and Jacob Grimm, the two scholars of history who traveled throughout Germany gathering the old fairy tales and legends that had been passed down through the generations through storytelling and collected them together in one collection.  Except, the Will and Jacob Grimm in THE BROTHERS GRIMM only resemble the real Brothers Grimm in name only.  In this story, THE BROTHERS GRIMM are a pair of sibling con artists, traveling from town to town fighting and apparently defeating one supernatural being after another, from ghosts to witches and trolls.  When they fight a creature it appears quite remarkable, but that's only because of all the gadgets and stage techniques the duo uses.  The ghouls and goblins are only their stage hands covered in makeup and assisted by lighting, pulleys, springs, and wires.  It makes for a great show and with at least one villager present to witness the event, it brings in a lot of money. The Germans love the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />However, Germany is under the control of the French and the French aren't as disposed to superstitions, myths, and legends as the locals.  When ten young girls in the village of Marbaden disappear the locals become so frightened that the French fear a revolt.  General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce) has the brothers arrested and places them under the care of the famed torture artist Cavaldi (Peter Stormare).  Delatombe threatens to give the brothers over to Cavaldi unless they are able to find the missing girls in Marbaden.  Upon their arrival, they hire a local woman, Angelika (Lena Headey) to guide them through the forest.  She does and the brothers begin to realize that maybe there is some truth to fairy tales after all as they come face to face with a man who can transform into a wolf, an evil gingerbread man, and a wicked ageless queen.<br /><br />Though THE BROTHERS GRIMM is a complete work of fiction, in the hands of Terry Gilliam it becomes a masterpiece of fantasy.  As every good storyteller knows, fairy tales have heroes and villains and end happily.  However, fairy tales are also very dark.  They are supposed to be that way because they help us (and especially children) understand a world that is often very cruel and full of pain and suffering.  THE BROTHER GRIMM is a grand fairy tale and in the telling it weaves together elements of many of the real Brothers Grimm's most famous tales: Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, The Gingerbread Man, Rapunzel, etc.<br /><br />I like Terry Gilliam as a director, but his films have been somewhat hit and miss the past few years.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is one that falls into the hit column.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The movie was engaging and captivating.  I especially liked how Damon and Ledger played the opposite type of roles they normally play.  I also like discovering the allusions to the various Grimm fairy tales scattered throughout the movie.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Gilliam, people who enjoy fantasy movies, and families who don't mind watching a fairy tale film told the way a fairy tale should be told.<br /><br />The DVD includes a director's commentary with Gilliam, which is worth the time to listen through if you have it.  There are a few deleted scenes, including the most expensive scene in the whole film: Will and Jake and Angelika fighting a giant tree.  There are a couple of behind the scenes featurettes, "Bringing Fairy Tale to Life" and "The Visual Magic of THE BROTHERS GRIMM".</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Join the brothers Grimm, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) as they travel through rural 18th century Europe preying on the fears and superstitions of the local villages they encounter.

Lambasted by critics for his excesses, admired by others for his genius.  I'm with the genius crowd.  Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I've seen in a long while.  Gilliam's style is baroque, and by a director who knows the definition.  Visually, this can be quite stunning, as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene.  Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas.  It's 1812, the Age of Napoleon, not a good time for the Imagination.  Nevertheless, con-men Jake & Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear, since it's also an Age of Anxiety, and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night.  The bumbling Grimms are played, quite effectively by Matt Damon (who pulls off the accent nicely) and Heath Ledger (a head scratching, eye-squinting success).  Their evil counterparts, End Products from the Age of Reason, are a French general, played by Jonathan Pryce, and his wacky henchman, played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare.  Little girls are disappearing in a small town, and something needs to be done about it.  And the Grimms are caught in the middle.  You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales, as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery.  To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises.

Heath Ledger did an amazing job in this movie. His facial expressions were classic and his physical movements often gave a slapstick feel to the movie, which was good! This movie needed all the comic relief it could get. In fact, I thought that the film did take itself way to seriously and that was a major flaw. It could have been a bit lighter and without all the scenes of animals getting killed. It is certainly NOT a movie for kids, and I think it could have been better if it was more welcoming to kids. But all in all, I thought it was a great story and the special effects were cool. Matt Damon was good enough, Heath Ledger was perfect as a conflicted soul. I'd say this movie is worth owning if it's a decent price.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>It's tempting to imagine that the overwhelmingly negative reaction to Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm was down to Harvey Scissorhands' reputation. After all, hadn't the film sat on the shelf for a year because Gilliam and the Weinsteins were arguing over the ending? Hadn't Harvey fired the cinematographer and (quite rightly in my opinion) insisted that Samantha Morton not be cast over Gilliam's wishes? And wasn't the film suddenly rushed out on the market as part of the mass dumping of other troubled Miramax/Dimension titles when the real-life Grim Brothers were making their lucrative slash-and-burn exit from Disney? How could it possibly be any good?<br /><br />The big surprise is that it actually is. While the bad reviews all seemed to focus on how this almost certainly wasn't Gilliam's vision of the film because of all the problems (as if he's known for untroubled shoots) and went to town on it, I found it surprisingly entertaining and even more surprisingly well-constructed. The screenplay is often genuinely witty and imaginative, the much-derided look of the film and its special effects are both perfectly right for the film in their sense of studio/storybook reality, Dario Marianelli's score is beautifully effective and the film itself is a lot of fun despite Heath Ledger's typical mumbling losing some of the funnier lines. Pitched somewhere between George Pal and Time Bandits, it sees a well paired Matt Damon and Ledger (mumbling aside) scamming their way from village to village vanquishing theatrically faked demons and witches until they find themselves up against the real thing in the form of Monica Belluci's immortal child-snatching queen ("She's 500 years old and the years have not been kind, I'm telling you!"). There's never much doubt about the outcome, and Jonathan Pryce and Peter Stormare's comic relief in the Terry Thomas-Peter Sellers roles is clumsily overplayed, but if you're willing to go along with it and take it for what it is rather than what it should be, it's a lot of fun. All in all Gilliam's most satisfying film since 12 Monkeys. I loved it.<br /><br />Gilliam's commentary avoids being too specific about the production problems while the two featurettes are typical promotional love-ins, but there's a good selection of deleted scenes, including an excellent battle with a living tree that's more exciting than anything in the picture proper.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />In "The Brothers Grimm," director Terry Gilliam and writer Ehren Kruger envision the famed storytellers as two snake-oil charlatans who roam the early 18th Century German countryside using their fame as writers to convince gullible villagers that they can eradicate evil curses (all for a small fee, of course).  Their sleight-of-hand methods, involving ropes and pulleys and a whole host of elaborate disguises and primitive "special effects," eventually count for naught when the boys confront an actual enchanted forest filled with mobile trees, diabolical insects and an evil princess frozen in time waiting for that crucial moment when the usurped lives of twelve young maidens will make her young and beautiful again.<br /><br />Gilliam has always been one of the most reliably imaginative and visually inventive of modern filmmakers, so much so that, even when the films themselves didn't amount to much, we could still find much in them to enjoy and appreciate.  Here, however, our hitherto unwavering faith in Gilliam's talent suffers one of its severest trials yet.  In many ways, Gilliam desires to have it both ways in this film; he wants to be iconoclastic in his approach by showing these beloved writers as being mere mortals with feet of clay, yet he also wants to make clear that he believes in all the fantastical elements of the tales by essentially creating one of his own with the Grimm brothers themselves placed front and center as key players.  That might have worked had Gilliam been able to keep his narrative elements in sharper focus.  Too much of the film feels subdued, rambling and disjointed, and although Matt Damon and a fidgety, hyper kinetic Heath Ledger seem to be having a great deal of fun in their roles, they are never able to break through all the nonsense and connect with the audience as characters about whom we can deeply care.  There's some fun to be had in the conflict that develops between the cynical, pragmatic  Damon, representing our modern times, I suppose, and the more fanciful Ledger, who clearly reflects the more imaginative time in which the story takes place, but that theme basically gets lost amid all the confused silliness and special effects-laden overproduction.<br /><br />Thus, despite all the talent involved, "The Brothers Grimm" turns out to be an empty, joyless, soulless film, a poor tribute both to the fairy tales it endeavors to honor as well as to the men who wrote them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Terry Gillkiam shows his Monty Python roots in this entertaining fantasy film.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is like watching a more sophisticated version of the old TV Fractured Fairy Tales, using elements of several Grimm fairy tales but giving them sardonic twists and turns.  In this film, the titular brothers are con artists roaming villages of French occupied Germany, allegedly ridding the villages of evil enchantments.  Things take a dangerous turn when they are captured by the French and forced to find out what is happening in a small village where ten children have mysteriously disappeared.  This leads them to the Mirror Queen, who has cast a spell on the village and is using the children's blood to return to life; she is now an old crone, and wants to be beautiful again.  Production values are excellent with superb effects and moody settings.  The tongue in cheek humor instills the movie with its sense of fairy tale wonderment and the acting is generally good.  Matt Damon plays Jakob, the more mature brother who is like a keeper to his rather nerdish younger brother, played by Oscar hopeful Heath Ledger.  They play off each other very well and seem to be enjoying themselves as well.  Lena Headey is the fair Angelika, whose two sisters are among the missing children, and she acts as a tracker for the brothers.  Peter Stormare gives an over the top performance as the General's aide.  Stormare surely gives his role 100% per cent, although his accent is sometimes very hard to understand.  Gilliam alumni Jonathan Pryce plays the General and he is very good as well.  The lovely Monica Belluci plays the Mirror Queen quite seductively.  THE BROTHERS GRIMM is an entertaining take on fairy tales and was overly blasted by many critics, but I think you'll find it enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Now some movies don't have the "empty pocket" syndrome of other films where if you need money the studio just gives you some more to help, provided the film makes its money and then some. But there are some films that come out with a limited budget and it keeps. Such was the case with the Brothers Grimm which was made for around 80 million. Now to Joe Normal, 80 million is a lot but on a major picture, it wouldn't even cover the salaries for Mel Gibson, Will Smith, Julia Roberts and Govenah Ahnuld. Well unfortunately Brothers Grimm suffers not only from laughably bad CG but an even stupid story.<br /><br />The world is basically all fairy tales in one world. So when Little Red Riding Hood and Greta(from Hansel and Gretel) are kidnapped, townspeople look to the French to help. So they send Will and Jacob, noted for being demon vanquishers. Only problem is they're con men, using trickery to make people believe they're being attacked, exorcise the demon, take the money and take off. So when they're brought in to investigate, they find themselves in the middle of something that could be the real thing.<br /><br />The movie sucks and I can't figure it out. The talent: Terry Gillam, noted surreal director known for 12 Monkeys, Fear and Loathing... and Brazil. Good cast with Matt Damon, Heath Ledger and easy on the eyes Monica Bellucci. Maybe it's not even scary? The "scares" are meant to freak us out and uncalm us yet we're watching with mainly apathy. Is it dramatic? Not really. The stakes never seem to be high and there's no rejoice when our villain is taken care of.<br /><br />Since the film has the look of Sleepy Hollow's distant cousin, it certainly looks the part until the CGI steps in. This is laughably bad and you can obviously tell where the CG steps in. The CG works best when it's not noticeable, where it's in the scene but it's actually hidden, almost like you couldn't tell it was. Here it's painfully obvious with a bad Gingerbread Man effect and one effect where 2 people fly just looks like bad compositing. Serenity had a small budget(even smaller I believe) yet the CG looks better there then here. Late in the film there's an abundance of red and it just looks very ugly.<br /><br />Is there any redeeming value? Maybe. Monica Bellucci and Lena Headley are a nice sight and Heath Ledger is quite believable as very fidgety Jacob. Peter Stormare, known for Lost World and Armageddon knows how to play the comic relief, often playing foreign characters and here maybe it's overwriting but he seems a bit TOO much in the movie.<br /><br />I knew that people found it stupid before I rent it but I thought people would say that about any film yet you watch and it's pretty good. Well, sorry guys, should've listened to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>To be fair, calling this movie simply eye candy is not completely doing it justice.  It is far too dark a movie to be categorized as such, and it is also clear that Gilliam has some aspirations beyond simply producing a visual spectacle.  If one really works hard at it, one could find the allegorical qualities in this film, as the captive children children in the forest could represent the captive population of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia.<br /><br />It is possible to see what this movie would have liked to have been. Unfortunately, the story-telling gets so muddy at times that any subtle messages that might exist simply get lost in the tangle of special effects and visual spectacle.  It also doesn't help that the Jacob Grimm, the central character who should have the most depth & complexity, is played by Heath Ledger, who has rarely displayed any particular acting talent.  Matt Damon (as Wilhelm Grimm) is adaquete but unremarkable in a role that has not been given much nuance by the script.  The supporting talents of Jonathan Pryce & Peter Stormare are put to entertaining use, but their characters are such broadly-drawn caricatures that they do not truly contribute to the development of the story.<br /><br />Younger children will be easily frightened by some of the abduction sequences, not to mention a few gruesome deaths.  I would imagine that those 12 and older will not find most scenes to be too jarring.<br /><br />And the rest of us?  In all probability, one will find this movie making precious little impact at all.  It is fascinating to watch while it is on the screen --- and the big screen really is the best medium for this film --- but once it is over, I very much doubt that many people will be drawn to see this movie again.</p></br></body></html>

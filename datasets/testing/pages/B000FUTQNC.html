Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), the mastermind behind it all, gives Jack (Harrison Ford) this option: steal 100 million from a Seattle bank, of which Jack is the chief of security - or Jack's family dies. The cat-and-mouse games begin when Jack seeks to thwart the callous but vigilant Bill Cox, who in turn seems to anticipate and foil Jack's attempts. The tension is ratcheted higher and higher as Jack's every scheme of escape goes awry and Cox's temper is further tested. Later, his family having vanished, the friend he desperately turns to having just been murdered, and having no other recourse, Jack must rely on his savvy secretary Janet Stone (who he had just fired) for help. Where's Han Solo when you need him?<br /><br />Harrison Ford once again ably portrays a role he's pigeonholed for himself:  that of the cerebral action hero. Holy Octogenarian, Ford is looking ancient (any forthcoming Indy Jones film better happen sooner than later). But his advancing age actually works in his favor, making the peril more credible. Jack Stanfield is older and greyer and, looking at him, one isn't entirely sure he'll be able to overcome adversity. But, fortunately, while the physical nature is diminished in Ford, the intelligence and suppressed intensity remain. Paul Bettany is an actor who is up and coming; his star is definitely on the rise. In his yet early carrer, he's already played several eclectic parts: from his verbose Geoffrey Chaucer (A Knight's Tale) to the cello-playing Dr. Maturin (Master & Commander), from the romantic lead Peter Colt (Wimbledon) to Silas, the tortured albino villain, in The Da Vinci Code. Here he brings an icy British demeanor to his greedy and amoral kidnapper character. To be honest, I don't think his Bill Cox vicious enough. On separate occasions, he places members of Jack's family in jeopardy, only to not follow thru, on Jack's pleading behest. No wonder Jack keeps rebelling. Virginia Madsen offers an earnest performance with her thankless role of kidnapped mother. The kid actors are...well, they don't get in the way. Robert Patrick adds his own brand of internalized focus and Alan Arkin and good old Robert Forster have good bit parts. Mary Lynn Rajskub's Janet Stone is reminiscent of her Chloe from 24, which isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Firewall isn't up to par with most of the pictures in Harrison Ford's scintillating resume, but having said that, it's still a pretty decent offering served up by this iconic film star. Not overtly familiar with computer technology, I don't have an expert opinion about the computer-oriented doings and their working validity. To be honest, I glossed over all the techno-babble, preferring to pay closer attention to the more diverting jeopardy presented in those same scenes. I still don't quite get the thing about the iPod. Sometimes, I really miss the abacus. Anyways, this is an intense thriller, with director Richard Loncraine never allowing the audience to forget about the family's peril for one sec. Amidst the somberness of the film, however, are fleeting moments of levity: a very quick scene where Jack and Janet attempt to start her car, Janet invading the stage where a band is performing just to borrow a cell phone, etc. But, yes, humor is in short supply. Then again, this movie isn't supposed to be a  comedy.<br /><br />Overall, the competence and star power of these actors overcome the sometimes derivative storyline. I did enjoy this movie and I do recommend Firewall, with the caveat that folks who've seen Ford's best shouldn't expect the same level of excellence here.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good Harrison Ford action flick.  He plays Jack Stanfield who is a pretty talented VP of security for a smallish bank that is in the middle of a takeover by a huge bank that is planning on getting, well, huger.  Our hero is none too pleased about the takeover and is vocal about it.  We see over the opening titles that Jack is being watched, but by whom?  The new boss of security in the new parent bank is Gary Mitchell (played very effectively by Robert Patrick).  He comes across that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  Is he behind this?  What about the sudden amazingly good offer from entrepreneur Bill Cox (played with the right presence by Paul Bettany)?  Why that offer and why now?  It seems to make sense now that Jack's senior position is going away.  Wouldn't he rather be his own boss rather than a step lower in a bigger machine?<br /><br />The always wonderful Virginia Madsen plays Jack's wife.  She is a talented architect who even designed the house they live in.  The indifferent put upon teenage daughter who hasn't a clue how great a life she has, Sarah, is played to perfection by Carly Schroeder.  Andy is the young son with a peanut allergy and played with the right amount of boyish curiosity and too much friendliness is played by Jimmy Bennet.  They become the lever that is used against Jack, but I won't reveal how or why.  That unfolding is the whole point and pleasure of the movie.<br /><br />As things unfold, I like the way they keep Jack struggling.  He is not a superhero.  He is slow to climb over things and doesn't run so well.  When he jumps down something, he stumbles and knocks over a chair.  When the fighting happens, he is more passionate than skilled.  This is a computer jock after all, not a member of the CIA or the Delta Force.  Heck, he probably has never even taken a martial arts class.<br /><br />Mary Lynn Rajskub is great as Jack's admin, Janet Stone.  She does her best, but gets put upon.  Is she in on the plot or not?  What about the big boss of the bank being bought, Arlin Forester (I really enjoy seeing Alan Arkin as often as I can)?  Is he watching Jack so the merger isn't derailed?  What!?<br /><br />Really, once things get underway, the plot isn't a big mystery.  Nor are the things that happen to Jack and his family things we haven't seen before.  Still, the movie works in its own way, especially if you don't think about it too quickly.  Like most thrillers, you have to suspend your understanding of reality and think sloooowly so you don't get ahead of things.  But it works well as a solid entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie. I viewed this movie as the DVD, borrowed from my online service.  I was so relieved to sign on and see I wasn't the only one who felt this way.  I will definitely refer to Amazon reviews before my future rentals.<br /><br />This movie reminded me so much of many of the Harrison Ford films of the past 10 years.  He is an executive, with a specialized knowledge, who gets caught up in a web of deceit and destruction.  Somehow he is made to look like the guilty party.  But in the end, justice prevails, and he is exonerated of all "crimes" committed.<br /><br />But there were LOTS of problems with this one!  LOTS of problems!<br /><br />TIRED PLOT<br />First of all, the plot was tired and clich&eacute;d.  Most of the movie, except for a short 20 minute segment I found myself completely bored!  I kept checking the time of the movie, thinking that it must be getting close to the 1 1/2 hour mark.  But it just dragged on and on.<br /><br />LOTS OF LOOSE ENDS<br />When I say loose ends, I'm not necessarily talking about unexplained or unfinished plot stories, but I'm talking about clich&eacute;d happenings, without any sort of resolution.<br /><br />Like (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br />1)The whole business about his credit being compromised: what was that all about?  First of all, no online Gambling service is gonna give you credit.  You use a credit card, and they charge you, simple as that.  It would have made more sense for his Credit card company to call him, about his non-paid credit card.  What if that thug from the gambling joint had shown up, and Harrison Ford's character had called in sick that day?  STUPID scene!!!  I found myself thinking about that illogical sequence, and it interfered with my enjoyment of the movie.  And it just got worse and worse!<br /><br />Why couldn't they have had an earlier (or later) scene that explained that interaction, to disclose to the audience, the director's point?  It meant nothing to me, and just interrupted my enjoyment.<br /><br />2) Firing of the staff at Harrison Ford's workplace.  Wouldn't it have been nice to find out the conclusion and explanation of them being fired?  It wasn't enough to see him come to the female secretary's apartment.  For help?  Why the hell would she be helping that lunatic now?  He had just fired her.  But the director could have made that segment more believable.<br /><br />3)The hoods keeping his family hostage was completely non-believable!  They looked like computer geeks, not hardened criminals.  I thought Robert Forester's roll was half baked and wasted!  Harrison Ford, himself, looked half asleep throughout the entire movie.  Was it filmed in real time?<br /><br />4) The ending was terrible!  I couldn't believe it when the credits started to roll.  Certainly there was some mistake!  What about all the people back at the office?  Maybe we could see him apologizing to the head of security  He had nearly run him over in the garage.  What about the bank manager at the airport?<br /><br />I could go on and on.  Suffice it to say, this movie stunk to high heaven!  I'm really glad I did not purchase it.<br /><br />Two thumbs down!  If you can borrow it free from a friend, do so, but don't pay for this tripe!<br /><br />MC White said: It stinks!</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I have been a fan  & collector of Harrison's for  26 years now.<br /><br />I USED to be first in the door opening day for his films.<br /><br />This film was good.  But, COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.<br /><br />Some of the scenes just DID NOT work.<br /><br />Ending of the film, just walk away & that was it.  NO clearing up the whole situation to show the Jack character was innocent & only did these things because of the situation with his family.<br /><br />Did NOT like the children.  The boy Andy, bad.  When the bad guys first break in their home he is sacred of them but the next morning, "OH BAD GUY IS MAKING PANCAKES SO I GUESS HE IS NOT A BAD GUY".  Then, with a medical problem there is only 1 medication dose in the whole home to help him.  As a diabetic since the age of 6 you have MULTIPLES in the home in case of emergency.  Too easy a plot "twist".<br /><br />Kids do NOT pay attention to their parents, just the TV, computer or to music.<br /><br />Some of this were similar situations that happened in "Patriot Games" & "Air Force One".<br /><br />Like I said above, good film BUT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.<br /><br />DVD package.  At least Warner Brothers gave up on those card board (CAN NOT STACK THEM) DVD packages.<br /><br />BUT, YET AGAIN, A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME, NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST INSIDE THE DVD PACKAGE OR ANY OTHER FILM INFORMATION.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Firewall" is the type of movie that could easily satisfy the action/thriller buff, and rightfully so; there are plenty of suspenseful, nail biting moments for all to experience. And I'm sure a lot of people will be enticed by its almost universal structure. It's basically a heist movie, the only difference being that twenty-first century technology is at its disposal. The fact that we live in a computer driven society is used to the fullest, pretty much to the point of flaunting it. It's now unnecessary to present physical money: bundles of green bills wrapped with paper strips are nowhere to be found; the black leather bag to stuff the money into is also missing. It's all digitally processed, with a series of pin numbers and codes being all that's needed to access account information. And this time around, a robbery entails the mere pushing of a laptop keyboard button. No guns, ski masks, or crowbars are required.<br /><br />And yet, despite the technological upgrades, it's still just your run of the mill bank robbery story: unoriginal, at times highly implausible, and always completely predictable. I suppose that may be an unfair assessment, and the truth is I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting going into this movie. Maybe I just wanted the drama and action to unfold in fresher ways. But that's probably asking too much; heist films of the past have been so formulaic that certain expectations have been permanently ingrained into our collective subconscious.<br /><br />Harrison Ford stars as Jack Stanfield: a security specialist for a small bank branch in Seattle. Right as the movie starts, we are given glimpses into his life (some of which are mysteriously viewed through a telephoto lens). He and his architect wife, Beth (Virginia Madsen), live the typical upper class suburbanite life with their children, Sarah and Andrew (Carly Schroeder and Jimmy Bennett). We see them in the morning, just as Stanfield is leaving for work. Automatic pleasantries are shared, the kids squabble over nothing (Sarah goes so far as to address her father by his first name), and Stanfield kisses his wife goodbye. We even see some average encounters at the office, the most prominent ones occurring between Stanfield and his secretary, Janet (Mary Lynn Rajskub).<br /><br />Some may view this type of introduction as uninteresting; indeed, the opening does lack some of the conventional attention grabbers. But when the events of the robbery are set into motion later on in the film, it becomes clear why the beginning was so bland: it was the only way to make the shock of the unfolding crime seem more intense.<br /><br />Eventually Stanfield is introduced to Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), the man in charge of planning the entire robbery. It starts out innocently enough when Cox poses as another bank executive looking to make a deal (while faking an American accent). But Stanfield is unaware that a band of Cox's henchmen have already broken into his home and taken his family hostage. That's when Stanfield sees Cox's camera phone, displaying a picture of Sarah screaming. "She has lovely eyes, your daughter," Cox says coldly (dropping the American accent). It's the first in a series of events indicating that Cox has definitely done his homework. That's when the demands are made: if Stanfield wishes to see his family alive again, then he must break into the bank's system and rewire a certain amount of money into Cox's personal account.<br /><br />I suppose you now see what I mean about this being pretty unoriginal. But that's only the start of the film's problems, not the least of which are the moments between the Stanfield family and Cox's team of computer geeks and hit men. Beth and the kids were tied up and gagged at gunpoint, and their lives are verbally threatened on more than one occasion. I figured this would be enough to instill uncontrollable fear in them. But apparently it wasn't; after the initial shock wears off, they go about the house seemingly oblivious to the danger they're in. The kids play games and Beth prepares meals. They're all allowed to sleep in the comfort of the master bedroom (granted; they're being supervised through a surveillance camera). There are even some friendly moments shared between Andrew and Cox. Call me crazy, but is this really the behavior you'd expect from people whose lives are on the line? I don't know; I guess I was expecting the drama to go a little further than that.<br /><br />I was also turned off by the inclusion of Robert Patrick as the bank's new boss (the old boss being Alan Arkin). His part was introduced well enough, especially since there's some uncomfortable friction between him and Stanfield. But as the plot ensued, his presence, along with his significance, decreased dramatically. By the end of the film, I suspected his character was included only as an afterthought (but to what avail, I have no idea).<br /><br />Fans of Harrison Ford will find him enjoyable, and he certainly did seem quite comfortable playing this role. It's really no wonder; the number of action films he's been in had long ago pushed him into the category of Typecast Actor. I tend to think that as long as there's a breath left in his body, he'll continue to be offered these kinds of roles. That might be a problem, considering his performance in "Firewall." His delivery was flat and his voice was monotone throughout the film; not even the threat of losing his family seemed to be enough to get a decent rise out of him. Maybe he was a little too comfortable playing Jack Stanfield. Maybe he's a little too comfortable in action films altogether.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film by any means, but it's nothing to write home about, either. Yes, it was quite interesting to watch a present day bank robbery in action (and the fact that the technology behind it was completely beyond me only heightened my interest). But I would have liked it if the characters' emotional responses were a little more realistic. I also would have liked the basic premise to not be so cookie cutter, following the patterns and copying the outcomes of all the old-fashioned bank robber films. That, above all things, was what made "Firewall" difficult to sit through. I can only hope that future heist films are made with some degree of story originality. Maybe then it would be worth paying the local theater's ticket price.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Let's face it. Harrison Ford needs `Indiana Jones' right now. I don't care if Han Solo is now 63 years ago. Good actor is always good, and age does not matter. However, it is not a little shocking to see Harrison Ford in `Firewall,' who gives least satisfying acting in his career. Probably I am not the only one who thought he is not commited to the project, and his acting, lifeless and dull, is far from his best.<br /><br />In `Firewall,' Harrison Ford plays Jack Stanfield, security specialist working for a bank. His wife (Virginia Madsen) and his two children, however, are taken hostage and terrorized by a villain one Bill Cox (Paul Bettany sporting distinct British accent), who orders Jack to do what he says, Of course Bill wants the money, and does not come to Jack's house alone. He is with four armed baddies, all non-descript guys.<br /><br />[CLICH?-RIDDEN] This extreme situation has been used with some variations added to it (as in `Don't Say a Word') and though it ceased to be fresh long time ago, it could be still thrilling with clever twists. But `Firewall' misses all the chances, relying on a number of clich?s. Instead of writing about the predictable plans of Bill Cox, let's see a check list prepared for you: An ordinary American male with beautiful and understanding wife [check]; his daughter with I-Pod [check]; his son [check]; the son's disease [check]; a dog [check]; one villainous male with British accent [check]; four henchmen foolish enough to follow the ruthless leader without worrying about their own demise [check]; computer jargons and one laptop, two cell phones, and last-minute escape [check]. It goes on and on.<br /><br />Perhaps these familiar ideas might be tolerable if Harrison Ford had done a better job. Sorry, but he is not only miscast, but his vapid performance undermines all the efforts of the supporting actors, and the film lacks in both life-or-death thrills and emotional impact.<br /><br />I almost forgot to say that despite the title, the film's content has little to do with the computer security. `Firewall' shows you that the best defense against the hackers and imposters is traditional fisticuffs. And don't forget a dog. Believe me or not, `Firewall' proves that keeping a dog would be very helpful in case you meet these bumbling baddies in person.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>If not for the mildly intrigueing 1/2 hour, I would have probably given this one the single star treatment.  Pretty sad<br /><br />to hear ole Harrison being harangued by the juvenile story of<br /><br />this movie.  Firewall was a fire sale of eigth grade ideas about technology and suspense.  The bad guys seem totally inept<br /><br />and there were about a hundred ways Harrison could have given them false info, retracted the info, notified the police, etc etc.  Anyways, bascially it is the kidnap dilemna, do you concede to the ransom or call in the cops, not much suspense.<br /><br />The movie just gets worse as it goes along, until the down right<br /><br />laughable ending. The last 15 minutes were straight out of a macho mexican western.  Old and decrepit Han Solo was brawling<br /><br />as the script ran out of ideas, reminding me of Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Premise.  This movie is bad...and sad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>I'm giving this one two stars, in part because, I suppose, there is a certain technical sleekness to Firewall.  Kind of like showing up for class and getting a C minus (or D plus).  But I'd love to go ahead and pull the trigger and give Firewall one star, just for the pure cynical calculation behind the making of the movie. Firewall is yet another PG-13 movie, playing it safe, staying within the bounds of whatever Hollywood deems as "conventional" thriller (which now includes food allergies for the kids).  Harrison Ford, as Jack Stanfield (strong name alert), wheezes his way through the connect-a-dots plot, while Virginia Madsen, as Stanfield's wife, looks glad for the paycheck, but that's about it.  She's supposed to be carrying on an affair with one of Stanfield's associates - which is tacked on as an afterthought.  Heavens!  Being a super soccer mon (and architect!), when would she have the time? Yes, ladies, in a PG-13 world, you can still have it all.  That said however, Madsen at least seems to have a pulse as she mother-hens the kids and the family dog through the danger.  Ford, on the other hand, just looks alarmingly gray most of the time (skin, not hair).  Paul Bettany is OK, I guess, as the villain who puts together a rather ridiculous high tech plot to steal money.  But I've seen him in much better films. Like Madsen, he's collecting a paycheck.<br /><br />As an alternative, consider watching Spike Lee's Inside Man (which I watched the same weekend), and see what a well-scripted, well-acted, thriller can be.

I guess Bettany wants Ford to hack into his own system so that he can steal some money and wire it to his offshore accountants and if Ford doesnt cooperate, what will happen?

With the way the world is you never know when your very identity can be stolen from you, often times without you even knowing that it's occurring.  In the Warner Brothers thriller "Firewall" Harrison Ford discovers that security is not absolute no matter how hard you work to ensure it.<br /><br />"Firewall" places us into the life of Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford), the head of I.T. (Information Technology) for Landrock Pacific Bank.  His day begins like any other, his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen) shares playful banter with him, and his kids bicker as usual, not a thing out of the ordinary.  As he goes throughout his day at the bank he tops things off with a meeting over drinks with a co-worker and a high-ranking employee of another bank.  After drinks are over, Jack leaves to go home when the very high-ranking employee of the other bank (Paul Bettany) appears in his backseat with startling news, Jack's family is being held hostage!  With his family in jeopardy Jack is forced to comply with the hostage-takers demands, he must steal 100 million dollars from the very bank he works for.  The criminals have anticipated virtually every scenario that could possibly occur during their heist; except one, what a desperate man will do to protect those he loves no matter the cost.<br /><br />When I first saw the previews for this thriller, my first thoughts were that the movie looked good and would probably be a movie I would thoroughly enjoy; however, I thought it appeared that Harrison Ford was basically doing the same character he had portrayed in "Air Force One" (minus the whole being President of the United States thing).  Now, many actors have made a career of playing virtually the same character that had brought them success in previous films, Tommy Lee Jones, Steven Seagal (though he's hardly successful anymore), Ben Stiller, and Jackie Chan.  In most of those instances each of those actors' movies are successful, except for Seagal's of course.  So, even though I thought that Harrison was doing the same character again, I still was excited to see this movie.  After watching this movie I have to say, that even though Harrison is playing the same type of character that he's known for, basically the average guy who is vulnerable, yet full of strength and resourcefulness, he still delivers an excellent performance that you can't help but enjoy.  The supporting cast led by Paul Bettany ("A Knight's Tale") and Virginia Madsen ("Sideways") are equally strong, especially Bettany who delivers a much more realistic villain than he did in his previous bad guy role in the lackluster "The Da Vinci Code".<br /><br />The story was very well paced, full of plenty of action and thrills that keep the audience riveted throughout the entire duration.  The director made a choice that can sometimes harm a movie's success, by pushing the movie into high gear early on.  But director Richard Loncraine ("Wimbledon") managed to get the audience to connect to the characters during the opening scene of the movie, and gradually fleshed out the characters over the entire course of the film, which gave the movie much more story than your average action thrill-ride generally contains.  The topic of identity theft is one that is very real in today's world, and "Firewall" treats the subject in a very serious manner, taking careful consideration to never make light of the very serious issue, and keeping that aspect of the movie as realistic to the general public as possible.<br /><br />"Firewall" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>More than anything "Firewall" (2006) directed by Richard Loncraine reminds the super popular TV action show "24" with the main character named Jack (Harrison Ford) who runs against the time to save his family from a gang of dangerous computer-literate bank-robbers and their leader Bill Cox (Paul Bettany). Cox is the mastermind behind a simple but effective plan that involves transfer of $100 million from Jack's bank to his bank accounts in Caymans by forcing Jack to hack the very security system he had created for the bank while keeping Jack's wife and two children as hostages. The only person who may help Jack is his assistant Janet Stone (Mary Lynn Rajskub, basically repeating the part of Chloe O'Brian of "24"). If you forget that Harrison is 63 and it is sometimes painful to watch him in the action scenes, you may actually enjoy the movie. I like Paul Bettany as a polite, charming sociopath. For one second, just for one it seemed to me that the movie might dwell in the "Funny Games" territory but it was back soon to the familiar turf to play its own funny games.<br /><br />5.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>This is a dull movie, and after you watch it, you'll see why it was released in February.  Starring Harrison Ford, the movie sets itself up and markets itself as a thriller with Ford, the computer expert having to break through the own security he set up to save his family.<br /><br />There's nothing high tech at all about this film.  A group of bad guys kidnap's Ford's family and won't release them until Ford does what they want him to do.  Ford easily does what they want but things go wrong along the way.  Now Ford has to find out where the bad guys are and save his family.<br /><br />The drama comes from Ford's interaction with his co-workers. (Chloe from "24" is his secretary)  Ford is being followed by the bad guys, a menacing Paul Bettany, and has to watch every move he makes.<br /><br />About the only good part of this movie is watching Ford act, and he didn't even do a great job.  But hey, it's Harrison Ford, so I'll watch.  The suspense nor the characters never once grabbed me, and the plot was about as straight forward as they come.  Still, not a bad rental, but probably not one for the at home collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*Firewall* is alright.  There's nothing really "edgy" in this movie.  *Firewall* isn't nearly as exciting as Harrison Ford's other movies, such as *Air Force One*.  *Firewall* is predictable yet still enjoyable.<br /><br />Jack Stanfield (Ford) is the head of security of a bank that will merge with another in the upcoming weeks.  However, Jack has some reservations about the merger, which is causing some delays.<br /><br />A group of thugs invades the Stanfield residence and holds the family hostage.  Jack has been told that the family will be released once Jack has successfully tranferred millions of dollars from the bank to offshore accounts.<br /><br />Sounds easy enough, right?  All Jack has to do is follow orders.  Or all Jack has to do is pretend he'll do it but report the crime.  However, every steps he make are monitored via hidden cameras.  If he makes one small mistake, his family is gone.<br /><br />The suspense builds here.  However, once Jack finds a solution, the rest becomes predictable.  The question you gotta ask yourself is "why is this happening?"<br /><br />There's nothing unique about this movie.  No interesting car chase.  No fascinating hand-to-hand combat.  No heart-thumping moments of suspense.  It's just a regular movie about a guy wanting to save his family from hostage.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>After a promising start, this film loses its way and ends up being a slightly below average thriller. The premise is definitely intriguing: a group of men holds hostage the family of the VP of Security of a bank and want him to transfer $100 million from various accounts into their offshore egg nest, in exchange for his family safety. The problem is that after establishing the basic premise, the story gets convoluted and quickly moves towards the realm of the unbelievable, with some situations that are pretty unreal.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays the role of Jack, the bank's employee whose family is kidnapped, and he does a fairly good job with the elements he has at his disposal. The fact that some of the scenes are borderline silly is not his fault. Paul Bettany is very convincing in his role as a villain, and he manages to draw some hate from the audience with his portrayal of the leader of the thieves. The rest of the members of the cast do not deserve much praise, and I was especially disappointed by the overdone emotions infused to her character by Virginia Madsen.<br /><br />Those people that do not mind when a movie has farfetched situations may enjoy this movie more than I did. However, I think that even these people will have to agree that there are many better thrillers available in the market. This one should get a pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This movie started out like many action/hostage movies I've seen, but as it progressed, there were some original situations.

The bank is due to merge with a huge conglomerate purportedly to enhance business and increase assets. Jack has conservative views regarding risk-taking and protecting the assets of customers. This strong stance stood him well for 20 years but places him in a dimlight with the new owners at the board meeting who are willing to risk the money of customers for future earnings. He is introduced to several high level entrepeneurs and associates believed to be associated with the new firm. The meeting is occuring right about when the banking network is being attacked by computer hackers who invaded Jack's home and are holding his family hostage.<br /><br />The unexpected break in to Jack's house begins the tension that keeps mounting as more details are revealed regarding the reason for the kidnapping. Jack's wife, daughter and young son are threatened with physical harm ... the team of five stop at nothing to get what they want. Jack understands the seriousness of their threats when Bill Cox the leader, shoots one of his own men in the head after he failed to follow directions and nearly foiled their plans. He proved his point: Jack agreed to do what they wanted -- break into his bank's software, override the firewall, and transfer money to an account in the Cayman Islands. His wife and children nearly manage an escape before they are caught and sent back into confinement. Bill Cox punishes Jack by letting Jack's son almost die of an allergic reaction to peanuts ... The family realizes, they know too much to be allowed to live if Bill Cox and his team manage the money transfer ...<br /><br />Jack desperately goes along with all the plans by moving money and changing information on the banks software -  while plotting to overthrow Bill COx and his team. Harrison Ford plays a gutsy, tough, family man who fights with everything he has to save his family, to keep them alive. This film is filled with edge-of-your seat moments. It has a well developed plot, great actors, and a very satisfactory ending. At times, the scenes can be gruesome but the acting is superb and required for the theme. Anyone who loves to see Harrison Ford at his utmost best ... should see this film. He is one of the few great leading actors of modern times. This is a serious film, with lots of fighting and frightening moments therefore not for the faint of heart.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Jack Stanfield (Ford) is head of bank security at a bank on the brink of a merger.  Bill Cox (Bettany) is a businessman that, after a business meeting with JAck, makes Jack an offer.  If Jack helps Bill rob the bank of $100 million, Bill will let Jack's family live.  He has taken them all hostage, and is pulling Jack's strings to accomplish the task.  OF course, Bill is less than trustworthy, and Jack soon finds himself in a no-win situation as the crimes start to point to him.<br /><br />"Firewall" is an entertaining thriller.  Harrison Ford gets the job done as Jack, although the years are starting to show.  Paul Bettany is a solid villain, and is believeable for his brains and toughness.  Mary Lynn Rajskub and Virginia Madsen are good in supporting roles.  This is not a perfect movie, but it will provide a couple hours of solid enjoyment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I expect better from a movie starring Harrison Ford. He is forced to steal from the bank he works for because a high tech criminal has kidnapped his family. It doesn't go smoothly because recent changes has been made so Ford has to think quick on his feet. As expected, Ford saves his family due to a fortunate circumstance.<br /><br />I found the plot trite and there was only a couple of mildly exciting scenes. I suggest skipping this dud.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Firewall is an entertaining flick but it has very little originality and worse of all it's very predictable. You have Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) as a loving husband and father of two. Stanfield is the expert that designed the computer systems for the bank he works at, maybe it was just me but it took a while for them to tell you that he worked in a bank. So about 20 minutes into the movie the Stanfields home is invaded by men with guns and his entire life is turned around but you still don't know what the heck they want. Finally after a bunch of talk you find out that the men want Jack to help them break into the computer system he built and wire a load of cash into various accounts.<br /><br />Of course there have been plenty of movies that are just like this one with so now all this film could hope for is that the cast gives a great performance. The acting is mixed up, those criminals that broke into the Stanfields home who are supposed to be relentless are far from it and that sets the movie back. These guys were getting beaten up and outsmarted by a couple of kids the entire time. Plus the guy from Wimbledon is leading them; the kids were pushing him around like it was nothing. Harrison Ford still has it because his skills are what keep you watching. Most people will have Firewall figured out within a short time. It has a few twists in it but I would advise to just wait for it to come on cable or for one of your friends to rent it because it's really not worth buying. I give it three stars because even though it was predictable there are a couple of parts that are good and Harrison and a few others give a good performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F7CCPK4QL359.html">A2F7CCPK4QL359</a><br/><p>Let me start with this personal fact, I think Harrison Ford is a modern day Jimmy Stewart. He can do comedy,drama, action and mystery. Now the bad news, Ford is in the DVD Firewall and it acts like too many other films  and TV shows.<br /><br />Ford plays IT person Jack Stanfield.  Paul Bethany (from Master and Commander, A Beautiful Mind) plays a cold as ice criminal mastermind who kidnapped Stanfield's family. The film sems almost like Desperate Hours with Bogart or the remake with Anthony Hopkins. Bethany starts to pressure Jack to heist 100 million from the computer design he created. Bethany is great as the icey cold mastermind, not as good as he was in Davinci Code.<br /><br />Bethany's character harrassas Stanfield's wife (Sideways's Virginia Madsen) and his family. This is similar to Capr Fear with Gregory Peck or the remake with Nick Nolte. Madsen preformance seem to assail fear in every scream, fear in all her action and still it seem a poor man's choice in her acting.<br /><br />To get the money, he usea gizmos (like an IPOD and plastic tubing) as if MacGuvyer would. Note, I like Ford as Indiana Jones, But Richard Dean Anderson was more suited to do these things Ford does in this film (Note Box set of MacGuvyer Season six is out!-better to get that , rathefr than this film !)<br /><br />He does what asked and the family is still kidnapped, so Ford goes on a one desparation to save his family. Just like Warren Beauty's Dollars, Desparate Hours or in Ford's own Franic (rent that instead of this if yoiu want a Harrison Ford Movie).<br /><br />Ford tries to hold this film together, but fails badly...The plot folds in the action.<br /><br /> It seem like twice told tales...I give it 3 stars-One for BEthany, one for Ford and One because I got this as a gift!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz  AUDIOWORLD</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>***<br /><br />Harrison Ford... er, Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) learns that his Wife (Virginia Madsen), Teenage Daughter and Son with Peanut Allergy have been taken hostage by a Bad Man (Paul Bettany) and his band of ruthless killers. Harrison, sorry, Jack must do whatever they want in order to protect his family and what they want is for Jack, er... Harrison, uh, Jack, to help them past the computer safeguards at the bank Jack has just spent 20 years constructing. Now he has to help the bad guys rob the bank and they want to steal a lot of money.<br /><br />So begins "Firewall", the new thriller starring Harrison Ford, Paul Bettany and Virginia Madsen. After years of subjecting us to romantic comedies and dramas, tepid at best, awful at worst, it is nice to see Ford returning to the genre he does so well. Yes, the film uses cookie cutter elements from many of his previous films (and many of Michael Douglas' previous films, for that matter) but it is still a welcome step in the right direction.<br /><br />Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the man in charge of computer operations at a mid-size bank in the Pacific Northwest. A merger has just been completed and they now have more branches, more assets and Jack doesn't get along with the larger bank's liaison (Robert Patrick). Jack is one of those movie heroes who cares about two things; his family and his job. This is one of those movies in which the hero will have the two things he cares most about threatened; his family and his job. He will ultimately have to figure out how to save his family while doing minimum damage to the institution that has employed him for the last twenty years. And from all indications, paid him well.<br /><br />In films like this, everything is about the hero and the villain; everyone else is pure window dressing. Paul Bettany makes an interesting villain. Cool and collected, he never loses his calm, rarely shouts, yet seems entirely menacing. His plan seems good, convincing, and very thorough, until he runs into an obstacle. Virginia Madsen is good as Jack's wife, but the role is pretty generic. Basically, any actress could play the role. This is a rather sad statement. Is this really the best role Virginia Madsen could find? She is closer to Ford's age than many of his previous film partners have been, but is still a good two decades younger, but it is better than the usual three or four. The implausible bit of the family dynamic comes with the introduction of their two children. Okay, I can maybe believe Ford, who is in his early sixties, might have a 14 year old daughter, but an 8 year old son? This stretches things a bit too much. In Matthew McConnaughey's new film "Failure to Launch", Kathy Bates, who is 56, plays McConnaughey's mom, and he is in his early 30s.<br /><br />The plan to rob the bank seems well constructed and it is interesting to watch both Jack and Bill Cox (Bettany's character) work through the various elements of their respective plans. At some point, naturally, Jack will attempt to turn the tide, and it is at this point that the film becomes more interesting. As we watch Cox's plan, and then Jack's start to unfold, the mechanics of these schemes hold our interest, involving us. It is more interesting to watch Jack unravel the intricacies of his scenario, because it is new and not necessarily as well thought out. Bill's plan is calculated and interesting, but he knows every detail of it. We learn the details because he is letting Jack in on a particular aspect. It is still fun, but watching Jack hatch a plan as we watch is like letting us in on the secret. It also allows us to root for the hero. As he hatches a way to get the upper hand, we feel included in this operation and we want Jack to win the day.<br /><br />The film is more a suspense film than action. Ford is getting older, so the filmmakers have, thankfully, confined the action to a segment during the finale. It seems more natural this way. If he were always getting into fist fights or car chases, we would begin to question where the character, a security person at a bank, received this training.<br /><br />"Firewall" is a long way from the Harrison Ford films we all love; a ludicrous plot twist late in the film and one of the most obnoxious images I have seen in film in a long time don't leave us with a favorable impression. But there are elements of suspense and Ford is an empathetic, believable grandfather, er... father and husband to his wife and kids.<br /><br />Worthy of a bargain matinee.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford stars as a security specialist for a bank.  His family is kidnapped and he is forced to break into his own computer system in order to get money for the extortionists.  He is losing his family at the same time that his efforts to save them make him look guilty of stealing money from the bank.  Ford has played similar roles numerous times, but that may be why he's so good at it.  He has a capable supporting cast, including Paul Bettony as the villain, Virginia Madsen as Ford's wife, and Mary Lynn Rajskub, as his secretary.  Although similar plots have appeared in several movies, this one does provide a good evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>It's poorly constructed, slow through its first two acts and, at its worst, a Frankenstein assembly of better Harrison Ford movies (most notably Air Force One), but gosh darn it, it's just enjoyable beyond any expectation. And Harrison Ford, that old dog, he's still got it. And by "it" I don't mean acting prowess, but screen presence.<br /><br />In Firewall he plays a computer expert that looks downright silly in front of a computer. Ford's hands are those of a carpenter not a computer geek. Still, he works because he plays a fish out of water: a president turned action hero, archeologist turned Nazi hunter, CIA analyst turned drug warrior, doctor turned fugitive, smuggler turned star captain, and, in Firewall's case, techie turned bank robber.<br /><br />Ford is Jack Stanfield, a bank's head security man. When his family is kidnapped and held hostage within their home, Jack's only hope of getting them out alive is to obey the somewhat pleasant bad guy, Bill Cox (Paul Bettany), who demands Jack hack into his own bank and do what most computer hacking movies require: steal $10,000 from 10,000 wealthy accounts. Because no one ever notices when $100 million goes missing.<br /><br />Bettany is a better actor than the material will allow him to be, but he's British, and accents make for great villains. He's shown here as a suave gentleman with respectable manners and trim suits. Jack flips out when he catches his son enjoying Bill's bad guy pancakes, which almost prompts the movie's greatest line, "Son, no blueberry pancakes with the kidnapper ... but buttermilk's OK."<br /><br />Firewall builds up and up and up until Jack is eventually (finally) stealing the money, which he does with a scanner from a disassembled fax machine and his daughter's iPod. The fact that this scheme is even tried -- forget that it's successful -- would make MacGyver wet himself. That's part of the fun, though: Firewall flies by the seat of its pants, even when it dabbles in fantasy.<br /><br />The movie surpasses other films of the same genre in small ways that I admire. For one, Bill presents his plan to Jack, who dismisses the whole thing as impossible. Rather than hold cute infants or handicapped nuns at gunpoint until Jack concedes to the plan, Bill's face turns white and he stands there like a dope holding a memory card that can't fit into the bank's computers. He's stunned that all his careful planning has yielded approximately zero dollars and one stack of pancakes. I liked Die Hard, but I was pleasantly pondering what the film would have been like if the bad guys didn't have all the answers like Firewall.<br /><br />Despite all the careful, and not-so-careful, planning, Bill and Firewall lead up to a fistfight and shootout in a lakeside cabin. Did this conclusion surprise me? Not really. It's the best ending a film like this can expect given the quality of the writing. Below-average script or not, though, here's a film that doesn't joke around about what it is. Firewall is dreck. It knows this and appreciates it. And so do I.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>Why does Harrison Ford continue to make such awful movies?  Its reallt sad and pathetic.  Does he really need the money or can he just not judge the quality of scripts anymore?  His last decent movie was 1994's Clear and Present Danger.  And why does Hollywood continue to greenlight such garbage?  This story has been told a thousand times before-and better too.  Ford plays a bank network security chief.  His family is held hostage and he is forced to steal millions of dollars.  There is no intrigue, no plot twists.  One-by-one, the aging Ford kills off the bad guys and claims sweet revenge.  Not only is it unbelievable, it is completely boring.  This was on a hybrid disc so the HD DVD portion was crammed onto 1 side and the picture quality is not great.  This one is not even worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>This movie is a Harrison Ford, "ordinary Joe" just minding his own business and the bad guys butt in and threaten his family, punches that look like they hurt, and hair and clothes get mussed and dirty, type movie.<br /><br />Harrison Ford has these roles in Air Force One, The Fugitive, and Patriot Games. The good guy wins, but he pays for it. In Firewall, Ford is a bank security specialist whose family is held hostage unless he helps the bad guys rob his own bank. Ford rolls with the punches (literally) and thinks up an alternative strategy (reminded me of Mel Gibson's character in Ransom).<br /><br />There are some interesting twists in the screenplay. Police were practically nonexistent in this movie... the viewer was always just ahead of them. The bad guys were pretty bad, which is a trend in today's movies... emotionless scoundrels. You wished you knew what happened the day after the movie ended... was Ford fired, his secretary rehired, and the money returned? Where did that money go, anyway... it was taken out of the bad guys accounts and put in...?<br /><br />Who cares?! This film had lots of the action expected in a Harrison Ford movie. That is all I expected, and I wasn't disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I think the producers of "Firewall" really wanted to capitalize on the popularity of "Air Force One" by making another movie where Harrison Ford tries to save his family from a bunch of bad guys. In this case, Ford's character is Jack Stanfield, a bank security specialist whose family is held hostage by a group of bank robbers. The robbers want Jack to help them steal millions of dollars from the bank by cracking into the network's security system.<br /><br />The premise of the film is interesting, but the first two-thirds of the movie really drag. The thing that bothers me the most about the film is that so much of the drama is underplayed. When the robbers break into the Stanfield house, Jack's wife, Beth (Virginia Madsen), is completely freaked out at first, but less than 15 minutes later, she's calmly making breakfast with everyone and chit-chatting with her kidnappers around the kitchen table. Similarly, little Andy (Jimmy Bennett) has no qualms about laughing and making pancakes with his captor the morning after the break-in. Is that normal behavior fom a six-year-old boy? I don't think so. I think the underplaying was a conscious choice on the part of the screenwriter and the director, and it was a poor one.<br /><br />Eventually, the film picks up the pace during the last 40 minutes or so. Ford does some impressive stunts and has some amusing scenes with Janet, his administrative assistant (Mary Lynn Rajskub), but that's about it. "Firewall" is disappointingly dull and predictable. I'm sorry that I wasted two hours of my life watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Firewall is one of those movies that you know what is going to happen before the opening credits start to roll.  Harrison Ford plays a security expert forced to break his unbreakable security system as a smarmy criminal (Paul Bettany) holds his wife (Virginia Madsen) and kids hostage.  It's familiar territory for Ford, but he plays it well like he usually does, while Bettany provides for a decent villain.  And that's just about all the good that Firewall does.  The film is a strictly by the numbers thriller that doesn't deliver on the thrills and opts instead for a safer route.  We never feel as if Ford's family is in any real peril, and by the time Ford comes to the inevitable conclusion to turn on the criminals, we know where things are headed and what will happen next.  Madsen, Robert Forster, and Robert Patrick all get wasted in roles that aren't worth their time; the only upside of which is that it's good to see each of them in a big budget flick.  All in all, Firewall is a typical, derivative, by the numbers movie that doesn't offer anything beyond it's glossy surface.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford stars as a man forced to rob his own bank or his family will be killed. We've seen a lot of movies like that before. Even Hostage last year is a similar film. The script here can be silly from time to time but it's still a more entertaining movie than Hostage. Harrison Ford may be getting too old for parts like this but he's still in top form here. Mary Lynn Rajskub who plays Chloe in 24 isn't bad here either eventhough she's basically playing Chloe and she even gets to call Harrison Ford Jack. Paul Bettany also isn't bad as the villian eventhough I liked him more as one in the Da Vinci Code. One thing I find silly though is that while the bad guys take the family they also bring the family dog.

A decent cast (Virginia Madsen, Paul Bettany and Mary Lynn Rajskub) is left stranded by the overall hopelessness. "Firewall" represents the absolute nadir of Ford's career.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) is a contented family man who for the last 20 years has been VP of Security for a Seattle bank.  When he's not working, he lives with his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen), an architect who designed their home and works from it, and his two kids, Sarah (Carly Schroder), 14, and Andy (Jimmy Bennett), eight.  The first hint he has of trouble is when he discovers that someone has compromised his identity and racked up $93,000 worth of online gambling debts in his name.  But if he thought things couldn't get worse, he soon finds out how wrong he can be, as a smooth-talking crook (Paul Bettany) seizes his home and family to force him to hack into the security system he designed and steal $200,000,000.  The problem is that a recent merger has left him unable to do it in the way his enemy has in mind.  Can he find a way to get his family free, or will he have to improvise--and then rescue his loved ones on his own after all?<br /><br />Ford may be getting older, but he's not slowing down; not only does he do a great turn here as a man in terror for his family and desperately searching for a way to save them *and* thwart the bad guys, but in a climactic fight scene with the boss robber he shows he can still get physical.  Bettany is a truly horrible villain--clearly both brilliant and a psycho, quite willing to kill his own men if they displease him or to threaten or even torture a child--which makes Ford's ordinary-guy heroics all the more believable and affecting.  It may bear a resemblance to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305222878">Patriot Games</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127719">Clear and Present Danger</a>, but it can stand on its own merits, thanks largely to the involved computer angle; and since Ford isn't expected to be an action hero for most of its length, he can better showcase his acting talents while still making his character both plausible and sympathetic.  An excellent action thriller, though not for young kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>..if you like Ford and don't mind him in his role as wronged family man out to wreak havoc on the perpetuators of evil.  It's true we've seen him in this role before (and many a time at that) BUT this is still a hands down entertaining, and suspenseful movie that won't have you wondering if it's time for bed yet, though great art it may not be.  The formula of wronged family man, as I mentioned, holds true here, set this time in the information age of banking.  In spite of his years, Ford still manages to deliver the goods and does more than a decent job of portraying an I.T. bank security manager whose family has fallen hostage to an elaborate scheme to have him rob the system he designed.  All in all, it was a fairly intense ride and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />An original role for Harrison?  No.  A fast-paced, intelligent thriller in a role that he does best?  Yes.  Better than Air Force One?  Much.  As bad as some of these reviews make out?  No way!  I suppose it depends on what you're looking for.  I should probably give it 4 stars all things considered, but for entertainment value alone, I'm giving it 5 stars, Gene.  Harrison's still got his chops, and this is a decent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Refreshing from all the foul languaged movies out there - entertaining plot - who cares if it has been done before.<br /><br />This was a good set of actors - and who was the good looking guy that Jack [H.

I guess Bettany wants Ford to hack into his own system so that he can steal some money and wire it to his offshore accountants and if Ford doesnt cooperate, what will happen? I dont know, I guess it's the old trick in the book, threaten to kill the family. Bascially it all leads up to a showdown between the badguy and the good guy. Predictable, sometimes really cheesy and hey, when havent you seen this? Also starring Robert Patrick (Walk The Line, The X-Files), Alan Arkin (The Jerky Boys Movie, Wait Until Dark), Robert Forster (Jackie Brown, Mulholland Dr.), Vince Vieluf (Rat Race, Grind) and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Fox's 24). Harrison Ford does his usual Air Force One routine here, though he doesnt say "Get off my plane!", he says "You wont get a dime!"...the man must of had serious backaches after those figh scenes...especially at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>An aging Harrison Ford stars as Jack Stanfield V.P of security in a Seattle based bank undergoing a merger with a larger instituion.  Ford is introduced to business entrepreneur Bill Cox played by Paul Bettany who proposes an attractive business proposition.  Bettany however has quite a bit more in mind.<br /><br />Using a home invasion reminiscent of a dumbed down version of the classic "The Desperate Hours", Bettany and his crew of computer hackers and thugs kidnap Ford's wife Beth played by Virginia Madsden and his two kids.  He uses threats to their safety to coerce Ford to transfer 100 million dollars from his bank into Bettany's offshore accounts.<br /><br />Even with a good cast starring Alan Arkin, Robert Patrick and a plucky Mary Lynn Rajskub of "24" fame, the film flounders under the weight of an utterly predictable sophomoric plot.  That a timeworn looking Ford still has enough fuel in his tank to single handedly thwart both an attack on his family and his bank in action hero style is just too much of a stretch.</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>It is an old theme for the old actor, Harrison Ford.  In this one, the story is way too old and the plot is way too unbelievable.  Computer wiz is forced by gun-toting terrorists to electronically rob his own bank "or his family gets it."  Of course, this untrained computer geek wizard is able to overcome the much younger and armed bad guys (automatic weapons included) and rescues his family single-handedly.  At least in the Tom Clancy movies the main character is a former marine with at least a believable background to give him the tools to carry out such things.  But a network security expert?  Certainly there are some that might be able to pull it off but, unfortunately, this movie did not see the need to explain how this nerd became so adept at fisticuffs.  The story just assumes that we all believe that rage alone is all we would need to overcome a multitude of evildoers.  Sadly, this movie is all too predictable yet unbelievable to even have much entertainment value.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>This movie is, sadly, the product of many movies before it accomplishing the same thing in much little time and effort. I'm seriously dissapointed with this movie becuase I had such high hopes about it. There were a lot of things that peaked my interest but they all got dragged down by several things. I will admit that the movie had a strong cast, impressive techno-skills on hacking, and great stunts and general stuff like that. But when you combine the dry performances with the recycled plot; it just feels like same stuff, different characters. Why? Becuase we have all seen it before in other thrillers.<br /><br />Within the movie, there are heavy chunks of wooden dialogue and tense moments shoved in between. Not to say that it wasn't acted well, but the lines of dialogue seemed forced rather than articulated. The story, although new, has little to do for today's audience.<br /><br />Plus, in all honesty, the movie is, dare I say, Long. Too long. And if that isn't the bad part, it's also that the movie ended so abruptly. What you are left with after watching this movie is a small eye spasm in why it took so long to make.<br /><br />Plus, one thing that totally turned me off to the whole Firewall movie is the fact that they were giving away free copies like they needed to get rid of it. Also, the main villian, is supposedly this super-savy villian that is a professional at his vouyeristic criminal activities . . . yet he can't figure out how to turn the volume up on the tv with a simple remote control???<br /><br />The bad guys are predictably bad, the good guys are predictably good, and the plot is predictably predictable.<br /><br />Rent it if you want. Just don't own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>The movies good. It would have been better twenty years ago, but audiences are more intelligent these days. Audiences are more familiar with movies these days and you have to do MORE in order to entertain and to impress.<br /><br />I had heard a review or two say that Harrison Ford was losing his ability to sell an action film, but I strongly disagree. I thought he was very believable and proves that he is STILL one of the strongest movie actors around. In fact, all of the actors did a great job. Virgina Madsen, Paul Bettany, Carly Schroeder, Jimmy Bennett & Mary Lynn Rajskub from "24" were all solid.<br /><br />The movie, too, moved well. It held my interest but as my review title suggests: there was nothing new here. It was a typical formulaic suspense, kidnap, heist thriller. Twenty years ago, when audiences hadn't seen 100 movies just like this, it probably would have faired better.<br /><br />Which brings me to my BIGGEST complaint of the film. The movie makers had the plot wrinkle, the film idea that in my opinon is the KISS of DEATH. And it showed. The bad guys kidnapped the FAMILY. The wife. The 9 year-old son. The 13 year-old daughter. So, why is this the kiss of death? Because throughtout the film, they do numerous things that a real life kidnapper would have killed one of them or at least dismembered or hurt one of them. Instead, the only ones that the kidnapper ever hurts are members of his OWN TEAM! Because Hollywoods mentality IS if you hurt a little kid like that... you'll lose your audience. I say... Bull. But, throughout the film, you just know that the filmmakers aren't gonna have the nuts to hurt one of those kids, so it ruins it.<br /><br />And believe me. You'll wonder after Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) tries to be brave three...four...five times in one day. Why the heck the kidnappers haven't put a bullet in one of his family members yet? Because you know a real life bad guy would. That, to me, was the biggest problem with the film. They didn't dare to be different and the so the film ended up being just another of the same ol' same ol'.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>The story behind FIREWALL is just another variation of the 'thrillers' that made Harrison Ford popular: that is not a put down because Ford created a 'character type' that has been highly successful in generating a lot of movies light of weight in script but heavyweight in excitement.<br /><br />FIREWALL updates Ford's persona (though his physical presence now strains credibility that he could have young kids involved) to that of a computer expert, the man employed by a major back whom everybody loves and who just happens to be a top flight security brain protecting the bank's assets.  At a meeting with a potential investor (Paul Bettany) our hero is kind and casual only to be kidnapped by Bettany and taken to his home where his wife (Virginia Madsen) and children are being held ransom by Bettany's crew (including handsome Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who costarred with Bettany in 'Wimbledon'). The aim: get Ford to gain access into the bank's assets and transfer the funds to Bettany's off shore account. How this all tediously works out is the movies plot.<br /><br />An odd factor here: there are numerous famous actors in bit parts (Alan Arkin, Robert Forster, Robert Patrick) that seem like PR padding.  The script is flimsy, the plot wanders, the outcome is obvious, but Harrison Ford, Paul Bettany, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and Virginia Madsen prove that good actors can overcome weak material, even in formulaic films such as this.

As Jack Stanfield, a bank security director, Ford finds himself forced to help a smooth villain rob the bank he works at, since his family is being held hostage.  Paul Bettany is a super villain, combining a gentlemanly exterior with a nasty, nasty interior.  Virginia Madsen doesn't get much to do except play the purloined wife, but she does it well.  The rest of the cast offers good support, and the action is brisk, with some suspenseful scenarios.  Critics were unjustly harsh on the film; it's quite entertaining, folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford is either getting senile in his old age or is extremly bored and will join any movie that asks him.  Harrison Ford is a great actor, in Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Air Force One and so many other movies he was great.  Hes not bad in Firewall either but the difference is that the aforementioned movies were good.  Firewall takes from so many movies and has been done before it becomes boring.  They use every bit of heroism in Ford to make this movie passable.  If your a huge fan of Ford rent it, because you won't want to buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>As dismaying as it is disheartening, "Firewall" is one of the least original, least interesting and least necessary films I have seen in ages.  This is the umpteenth version of that old chestnut about a bank executive whose family is held hostage while he is forced to assist the kidnappers in robbing the bank.  However, as this is the 21st Century, the  modus operandi of these criminals involves not guns and masks but coded passwords and computerized money transfers.  One would have to be the biggest computer geek going to understand even half of what the characters are doing at any given time in this film, though it scarcely matters since the story itself is so distressingly hackneyed that one is already watching the screen with an eye half-cocked to one's watch anyway.<br /><br />Poor Harrison Ford, looking like he hasn`t slept in days (and this is BEFORE his family is kidnapped), seems to sense that he is indeed at the nadir of his career and thus turns in a performance that is so lacking in energy and interest that he seems more bored with the material than we are.  Paul Bettany has some effective moments as the smarmy criminal ringleader, but none of the other actors is given even a fighting chance with this wretched excuse for a screenplay.  The only truly pressing question raised  by "Firewall" is why anyone even bothered to make this film in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>Since 2000's "What Lies Beneath," Harrison Ford has made some pretty forgettable movies.  I've been a fan of his since "Raiders," but I totally skipped such offerings as "K-19: The Widowmaker" and "Hollywood Homicide," as did audiences.  Thus, I was somewhat excited when "Firewall" appeared to be a decent action flick; well, not excited enough to watch it until a year after its release, but at least I did eventually see it.  I got about what I expected - a completely average, predictable action movie.<br /><br />Ford plays Jack Stanfield, a security technician at a large bank; or at least I think that's what he was - these kinds of details were mostly glossed over.  A group of British thieves decides to kidnap Stanfield's family, including his lovely architect wife, Virginia Madsen, and two annoying kids.  The murky plan involves Stanfield transferring funds to them, although it's later revealed that a new security system makes such a transfer seemingly impossible.  The kidnappers, led by a perpetually sneering Paul Bettany, supposedly tracked this family for weeks ahead of time and knew every detail about this job; how could they have overlooked such a crucial detail?  Well, that's just the beginning of the holes in the plot line.  Toward the end of the movie, Ford has to explain to his secretary everything that has happened; the look of confusion on her face summed up how I felt as well.<br /><br />"Firewall" advertised itself as a high-tech thriller, focusing on computer security systems.  However, the movie really drops the ball repeatedly on this angle.  Every time the high-tech elements get going, we cut to another lame fight scene or explosion.  I wish it had stuck more faithfully to the high-tech plot, particularly given how old Ford is starting to look during fight scenes.  "Firewall" makes me really hope that the upcoming Indiana Jones movie focuses on humor and not Ford puffing through action scenes.  Overall, "Firewall" is a passable thriller - the kind Hollywood pumps out at least 6 per summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>There really isn't anything original or surprising in this entire movie.  It provides by the numbers, rote suspense.  It doesn't exactly INSULT the intelligence of the audience...but for the most part, it doesn't exactly require a careful following of the plot twists either.<br /><br />But it's a Harrison Ford film, and there was a time when that alone was cause of celebration.  However, it's been a long time since there was a good Ford movie, and FIREWALL ain't it either.  Even in some of his poorer films of the past though, he was at least entertaining to watch.  Thinking back on HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE, which was a real mess of a film...constant changes in tone, loose pacing, Josh Harnett...Ford at least was amusing and his charisma helped a lot.  We brought our own good feelings about him to the film.  In FIREWALL, it's tough to like him.  Ford himself seems tired and disinterested...he's going through the motions.  And if we don't care about him, it's hard to care about his hastily sketched family either.  And if we don't care about them...well, it's just hard to care much about the film.<br /><br />There are some bright spots to keep this from being a totally forgettable film.  Paul Bettany makes a nice villain overall.  The character is written in very generic fashion, but Bettany, who is normally SO likeable (WIMBLEDON, MASTER AND COMMANDER) makes his intelligent bad-guy neatly creepy.  Sadly, during the final scenes of the film, all pretense that this guy is cool-as-a-cumcumber go right out the window and he becomes totally generic.  Not Bettany's fault...the script essentially abandons him.<br /><br />Also, Mary Lynn Rajskub essentially reprises her role from TV's "24," but it's such a fun character that she's very welcome in FIREWALL.<br /><br />The always wonderful Alan Arkin, as well as Robert Patrick and Robert Forster are all pretty much wasted in very generic roles.  They add a little class to the movie, but it's just a sheen that brings no extra substance.  Virginia Madsen is also a very welcome presence, but the part of "the wife" will hardly be in her list of most memorable roles.<br /><br />The action sequences are tame.  It's mostly one of those movies where things are one close call after another.  For awhile, Ford is simply trying to let someone know he's in trouble without the bad-guys knowing he's telling anyone, and those moments offer the most fun of the film.  They are small-scale and believable...we can almost feel him thinking of what to do next...refusing to believe he's been outsmarted.  Later, when the plot thickens, it becomes more unbelievable and losing its tenuous grounding in reality.<br /><br />So, I will continue my wait for a Harrison Ford movie worth seeing...you should wait too, rather than seeing FIREWALL.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>An icon in the action/adventure genre, the characters Harrison Ford often plays are passive, quiet types, that explode into action only when provoked, and then follow through relentlessly until they overcome whatever obstacles there may be.  That broad description covers the basic storyline of Firewall (2006), where Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the head of security for a financial institution, who is forced to help a gang of criminals rob his firm, in order to save his family.<br /><br />A group of men led by Bill Cox (Paul Bettany) invade Stanfield's Seattle home, and take his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen), daughter Sarah (Carly Schroeder), and son Andy (Jimmy Bennett) hostage.  Forced to wear a camera and earpiece, Jack's movements are transmitted back to gang.  Cox appears at the bank impersonating an agent of a government agency, but there is a problem with his plan to access the funds, until Stanfield finds a way to make it happen.<br /><br />Mary Lynn Rajskub, probably best known for playing Chloe O'Brian on 24, is Stanfield's secretary Janet Stone.  Stanfield is forced by Cox to fire her, but when the chips are down, he turns to her for help.  There's a bit of the flavor of 24, as Janet provides vital aid to another `Jack'.  Veteran actors Robert Forrester, Robert Patrick, and Alan Arkin, are familiar faces in supporting roles.  Although attempts are made to illustrate his ruthless side, and Cox is quite nasty at times, he mostly attacks the weak and helpless.  The role of Stanfield is nothing new for Ford, and he carries it off fairly well, for a guy that was 64 at the time.  He may be pushing seventy, but Ford still has a passion for action films.  After completing Firewall, his next project would be Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), a film that as a physical challenge, makes Firewall look like a jog in the park.<br /><br />Firewall is an unoriginal, mildly effective thriller.  The villains are amateurish, and not terribly bright.  You may not really believe that the Stanfield family could really be hurt, but there are some tense moments, before the action ramps up at the end.  As usual, Harrison Ford's performance, does keep things interesting.  The DVD has a couple of short bonus features which feature Ford, director Richard Loncraine, and writer Joe Forte.</p></br><a href="../users/A5WMBIOGE8Q6N.html">A5WMBIOGE8Q6N</a><br/><p>This movie was suspenseful, a fugitive quality movie. Harrison Ford was great and never seems to age. I like the selection of actors and the scene dynamics. The Action, music, and acting were suspenseful.<br /><br />Plot: Jack is head of computer security, at a local bank in Seattle with 27 branches and an airtight security system. Jack misdirects hackers by leading them to false accounts. The thieves realize they can't penetrate the system, so seek an inside job.<br /><br />Identity theft occurs and Jack is accused of Internet gambling fraud of $95,000.<br /><br />Jack wrote the banking software and understands the security systems. Jack and Henry are involved in merger takes with a large bank with over $200 million dollars in assets. A theft and his five-team (impersonating pizza delivery) kidnap Jacks family and force him to steal $100 millions deliverable to five Cayman offshore accounts. Sarah, the daughter, asks one of the thieves," why do you hate us" and he replies, "Sarah, I don't hate you - I just don't care about you." After the death of the first thief, Beth starts working on convincing the remaining thieves that Cox will not let them live because he wants all the money for himself. The thieves don't seem persuaded by her comments, with the exception of one, but he does little to aid in their escape.<br /><br />Cox is cruel. He purposefully causes the little boy, Andrew to go into an allergic seizure, after feeding a cookie with nuts. Jack must beg for the medication. At that point Jack decides he must steal the money.<br /><br />The thieves like the Cayman accounts for its low income tax. Jack uses an ipod and fax scanner input to record maintenance screen images of accounts and then uses optical character recognition to reverse the images into text for upload into the thieves' databases. The thieves have a way to setup accounts in the Cayman Islands.<br /><br />Jack fires his secretary. Jack uses Bills PDA to take a picture of wire account; he uses to transfer the $100 million dollars. Later, Jack tells his secretary, he was forced to fire her by thieves, and they need Bill's pda. Bill has been chasing the secretary and leaving flowers and inviting her to religious revivals. Jack uses the wire account to reverse the $100 million back into the bank, believing he will protect his family. Cox has plans to kill the family and takes them to a remote house near a lake. Jack uses the dogs GPS tracking system to local the family and rescue them. Jack saves the bank and his family.<br /><br />It is unclear, if Henry was involved in theft. Cox discloses to Jack that they were inside already at the time of introduction. Cox had control of Jacks computer when he tries to send a emergency email. Henry tells Cox, he can't believe the deal is happening. What deal is Henry excited about.<br /><br />Jack discovered encrypted files under the name "cox". Henry was the person who introduced Cox to Jack. Cox introduces himself as an entrepreneur.<br /><br />After Cox obtains the electronic money, he frames Jack for the murder of Henry. The plot was Henry was having an affair with Jack's wife, Beth, and Jack kills Henry in Jealous rages after Jack discovers the affair. Jack then was to disappear and the thieves escape with their money.<br /><br />However, Jack is hiding at the time of Henry murder by Cox, and kills the thief assigned to kill him. Jack reverses the action by taking back the thieves money by wire transfer and tracks down Cox.<br /><br />Cox himself kills two his team and Jack kills three (one with a food mixture and the other by automobile) and one in a fight. Cox and Jack remain, and it's a one on one fight between the two, with Cox dying by gruesome means.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Mark Twain once said that the difference between the right word and the word that's almost right is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.  Firewall, starring Harrison Ford, and the still exquisite Virginia Madsen, is a firefly.  It has all the elements of a taut thriller, highly pressurized situations, loathsome baddy, sympathetic good guys, excellent production value, acting, and cinematography. The only thing missing is the thrill.<br /><br />This is such familiar country for Harrison Ford that one wonders if he even needs to look at the scripts anymore.  He's in a jam, his family is in danger, and he must single-handedly battle insane odds and triumph.  Most familiar of all is his pained look, reflecting deep interior anguish.  We are so accustomed to seeing Harrison Ford looking haunted, stoically suffering in silence, that we must wonder if he gets a royalty every time somebody else looks like this.  His acting is fine, indeed the acting is fine throughout, but there's nothing unfamiliar or unexpected happening.<br /><br />Alan Arkin and Robert Forster - both excellent actors - aren't on-screen long enough to help the cause.  The plot offers no "aha" twists, which are a staple of films like this.  Worst of all, the evil mastermind - always the fulcrum of a thriller - played by Paul Bettany, gets less interesting and convincing as the film advances.  He begins well, a dispassionate, cerebral Brit that has done his homework very carefully.  But instead of controlled, implied violence - far more powerful in a thriller - he vents his anger impulsively, ironically at his own henchmen.  (Poor leadership skills.)  In the plus column, how he meets his well-deserved fate is totally satisfying.<br /><br />"High-tech" computer world drama is hard to present on screen; that said, the film fails on this level as well.  It is actually quite low-tech.  The movie "Inside Man," starring Clive Owen, is flawed, but at least it's a bank robbery movie fueled by a very interesting, unexpected idea.  The same could not be said of Firewall.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>*** 2006. Directed by the British director Richard Loncraine.

The action moves at a good pace and a few twists and turns add to the drama. I recommend it, and I think it has good replayability.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>In ancient times, kings would have everyone who constructed their primary defenses killed, and that was undeniably a pretty effective way of keeping anyone from discovering a backdoor entry into the castle.  Obviously, things have changed a great deal since then, but it's still a fact that the biggest potential threat to any leader, company, or business is the guy who designed the security system.  Crooks are well aware of this very thing, which brings us to the movie Firewall.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the network security chief at a medium-sized bank.  After spending many years doing everything he can to protect his customers' data, he suddenly finds himself on the other side of the firewall when crooks take his wife and children hostage and demand he help them steal the bank blind by transferring a cool hundred million out of the accounts of its wealthiest customers.  With his loved ones' lives on the line, he has little choice but to comply with their demands.  Kept under constant surveillance and oftentimes accompanied by one of the conspirators, he has to go about his daily business, acting as if everything is fine, while trying to figure out the best way of bypassing his own security setup.  Eventually, of course, he fights back, setting the stage for a rather action-packed ending.<br /><br />The whole robbery plan is pretty darned elaborate.  These guys would have needed to rob another bank just to be able to afford all of the equipment they put to use on this job.  I definitely would have asked for more than 100 million dollars if I was the one who put the whole plan together.<br /><br />Say what you will about the film's lack of originality, but I found Firewall to be a pretty exhilarating thriller.  There's a lot of detail to the story, especially in terms of the way the crooks set Jack up for the fall, and the pace of the movie works well (the nagging questions I had about the plot didn't really hit me until after the film was over).  As usual, Harrison Ford makes this film more successful than it would have been otherwise, but Paul Bettany does his part as well.  Bettany plays Bill Cox, the brains and muscle behind the robbery plot and the only half-way interesting or well-developed character among the motley crew of criminals.  Whenever Cox got frustrated or angry, he seemed to start channeling Christopher Walken, which I found rather amusing.  Other than that, though, it's a serious, suspenseful film that I would rank higher than a lot of similar action films.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of movies in this particular genre, but I really enjoyed Firewall.  Maybe it was the fact that Ford's character was named Jack, but the film reminded me a lot of the television show 24; it just had the same kind of feel to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford plays a man in charge of security for a large bank in Seattle. His family is kidnapped so that he will cooperate and find a way past the security for the thieves to steal $100 million dollars. Ford's character needs to find a way to rescue his family and keep the thieves from getting the money.<br /><br />This movie was better than I expected it to be. There are problems, especially with the underdevelopment of most of the characters in the film, but if you can overlook the obvious flaws, the movie builds some real tension in various scenes. There are no stellar performances here. Ford can sleepwalk through a role like this because he's done it so many times. Paul Bettany is good as the head bad guy. Everyone else is given so little to do they can't give great performances.<br /><br />You have to look past a script that is weak structurally, but if you can do that, Firewall is a decent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I don't know, maybe I'm being harsh, but I've seen Harrison Ford's "Everyman in Distress" act one time too many.  After all the Jack Ryan movies, and Air Force One (yeah, I know he was the President, but he was an Everyman President)and so on, its like I know every facial expression and every voice intonation that he's going to use.  Probably not fair, after all he only has one face and voice, but I've seen this bit enough and wouldn't pay to see it again.  Harrison used to try to stretch himself, oh well.<br /><br />As to the movie, it is only a passable thriller greatly helped by Paul Bettany's villain. I don't care whether the tech tricks were viable or not, this is a movie.  But the cliches were fast and furious wherein every advantage the hero or his family gets or creates is undone in the next moment so that their peril either increases or begins all over again.  They do dumb things and they do them often.<br /><br />This is the kind of flick that will hold your interest for awhile and you'll probably see it through to the end, but will just as quickly forget completely in short order.  I wouldn't recommend it. You've seen it all many times before. 2-1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>One of my favorite actors, Harrison Ford, plays Jack Stanfield, the head of security at a bank.  When his family is kidnapped he is forced to help steal $100,000,000 from his own bank as a ransom for his family.<br /><br />Sounds like a part of nearly every season of Fox's 24.  This even includes Mary Lynn Rajskub as his loyal assistant Janet Stone.  Mary Lynn Rajskub coincidently plays Chloe on 24 who is the loyal computer geek at CTU.  On 24, Jack or another character often has their family or loved ones kidnapped and, with Mary Lynn Rajskub's help, will sacrifice anything in order to get them back (even millions of other people's lives if necessary).  So the entire time I'm thinking that Firewall is just a waterred down version of any 24 season.  It doesn't have as many plot twists and is nowhere near as entertaining as 24.  But you can watch it in less than 18 hours so there is a bonus!<br /><br />Don't buy this movie.  But it might make for a decent rental with family or friends (not young family, mind you).  There are a lot of idiotic things that happen so just take everything with a grain of salt.  Just remember that this is FAR from Harrison Ford's best movie.</p></br></body></html>

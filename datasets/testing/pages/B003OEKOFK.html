One of the funnier scenes was the BJ scene based on a lost bet but I don't want to spoil it.  The first 15-20 minutes are slow and things don't really take off until they head back into time and we are slammed with 80s jokes after 80s jokes.  The overall story tends to lag and then rise several times but about a third to half of the jokes makes this worth watching if you like this type of humor.  I'm talking to you Saul Morales.  Heh.  Small cameo by Chevy Chase.  Fans of the 80s or those who lived through it will better appreciate this movie. MY GRADE: B minus to B plus (depending on your humor tastes and knowledge of the 80s).</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>At first glance, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97XS">Hot Tub Time Machine (Unrated) [Blu-ray</a>] seems like a mix between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00198X0UO">Back to the Future: 25th Anniversary Trilogy (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q4VBPQ">The Hangover (R-Rated Single-Disc Edition)</a>. It had the potential to be a really funny movie, particularly the speculation about when the bellboy loses his arm. Unfortunately, the constant cursing (especially f-bombs), unsubtle sex scenes, and simply disgusting moments really ruin the film. I don't mind some of this stuff, but too much and done in poor taste comes across as amateurish and boorish rather than funny. The characters' reactions to much of the movie's events are so blatantly unrealistic and stupid as to make it look pathetic. I'd like to see somebody take this concept and plot and do a decent, tasteful version of it. For now, I'll give it 2.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>Yeah, I know it's a movie that could be easily torn to shreds but the previews were enough to spark my interest and so I saw it on a lark with some friends at a discount showing and we were all three laughing throughout. Just to be sure it wasn't a fluke; I saw it again just now on dvd and it was still funny.<br />Look, I fully understand that the world needs another movie that celebrates the stupid like we need another religion, but for whatever reason, this movie made me laugh and I had a great time.<br />The in-jokes are rampant, all the way down to the Karate Kid reference topped by a cameo from the villain from said series. There is an excess of pointless nudity, f-bombs galore, and a plot as thin as the lines of coke drawn on the mirror in the many drug scenes. Even though this is not a movie you watch to point out the flaws, the 80s version of me demands I point one out: the total cognizance of John Cusack an hour or so after downing `shrooms, coke, pot, and a ton of booze. Somehow he is still John Cusack, i.e. a dronish bore of an actor with a very limited emotional range. To those who claim his career has taken a down slide, I have to ask from where? He's never been that great but he does seem to be fairly ubiquitous, so someone likes to see him in movies. Then again, he plays the same character he always plays - the self-obsessed navel-gazer - so maybe that's the joke. Fortunately he doesn't have to carry the movie. That task is handled joyfully by Rob Corddry, the man who makes this movie work.<br />If you are easily offended and/or don't like the content I've outlined, you will hate this movie. If you like raunchy yet wink-wink clever, you'll find this a very good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Its being a long long time that ive watched a movie and waiting till the last<br />end credits rolled by...why...because they picked the right music throughout the<br />film and did'nt slap you in the face with crappy music for the end credits like<br />most films have been doing for years.  Its good from the beginning to the end...and<br />also bring back great memories of the 80's crowd having fun, being colorfull in<br />the choice of clothes and atmosphere. Most situations are fun, and as a bonus we<br />have Chevy Chase making appearances here and there.<br />Had fun watching it...and will watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>From the beginning, it's obvious that "Hot Tub Time Machine" was written and directed by people who knew what they were doing.  This movie starts off funny and energetic, and doesn't waste time getting to the titular hot tub.  I'm a fan of when people say the name of the movie in a movie, and the part where someone says the name of the movie was very funny.  "Hot Tub Time Machine" keeps moving, pokes fun at 80s teen comedies, and doesn't let up on the comedy.  In a way, I'm surprised I liked this movie so much.  Yes, it is crude and vulgar, but in a way that works comedically.  And, yes, the characters at the beginning are unlikeable across the board, which is usually a recipe for unfunny disaster.  However, the actors are all professional and experienced enough, and the script is written well enough, to give us reasons to not hate the characters.  Indeed, you find yourself rooting for them, and more and more so as the movie goes on.  More to the credit of the script, "Hot Tub Time Machine" is devoid of maudlin drama bits where the characters get sappy at the end; they do undergo change, but it's organic and fits in the movie as a whole.  It's great to see Cusack in a role once again where he can be really funny and show off his comedic talents.<br /><br />"Hot Tub Time Machine" also doesn't overstay its welcome, at an hour forty, which is about as long as a comedy should ever be.  I haven't laughed this much at a movie for a long time.  Unless you are a person who objects to vulgar humor, you will likely enjoy this, and it is at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>If I understand the meaning behind the great white buffalo alluded to in HTTM, I can unequivocally say this film is in and of itself a great white buffalo.  From the title to the closing credits, this movie is an absurd, preposterous concept that absolutely works and had me crying tears of laughter.<br /><br />Four downtrodden, depressing friends get together for a wild male weekend full of cavorting and camaraderie at a ski resort.  This ski resort is special because it's where three of them had some of the most memorable experiences of their lives in the 80's, and the trip is meant to reinvigorate youthful momentum and break adult monotony.  Unfortunately, the resort is now in shambles, not nearly what they remember, and depressing as hell.  Not what they expected.  When the four decide to obnoxiously drunk in a hot tub, you know what happens next: They are transported back to their debaucherous and exciting 20-something lives of Winterfest '86 where they careened recklessly down the slopes, dove face first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C20VRS">Scarface</a>-style into mounds of drugs, and bedded bimbo ski bunnies dressed in atrociously colored yet wonderfully form-fitting 80's attire (spandex is a privilege, not a right).  The rest is side-splitting comedy, as the foursome must make every attempt to make their way "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXIDVI">Back to the Future</a>" while possibly righting past wrongs.<br /><br />The main cast (John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, Clarke Duke) is perfect together.  Tons of chemistry.  The supporting cast is just as good: Chevy Chase is the aloof hot tub repairman; William Zabka is the same character William Zabka always plays; and Crispin Glover is the oddball, one-armed* bellhop (a great touch considering his McFly roots in Back to the Future).  It's just too bad they couldn't find a bit role for Michael J. Fox.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the FACT that Rob Corddry absolutely steals every scene.<br /><br />With 80's references to pop-culture, music, fashion, politics, and everything else, the movie is packed full of hilarity.  When Robinson gets onstage to relive his musical glory days, I defy you not to bob your head and snicker at his "new" song.  When Corddry wakes up hungover in the hot tub and says hello to a squirrel in his own special way, there is no way you don't laugh.  And the "gag" joke between Zabka and Corddry is epic.  With the exception of the awkward insertion of a new love interest for John Cusack - a subplot never fully developed - the entire film is a compounded running joke that will evoke great memories for those who are fond of the era, mixed with various forms of laugh out loud comedy.  Add in an awesome soundtrack and a predictable yet completely fulfilling twist ending (it's the ultimate what if we all imagine if we were allowed to time travel), and this movie is easily the most enjoyable of the year.  While not quite on par with the cult status Hangover deserves, this film is very comparable, quotable, and hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 7:23 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews "Hot Tub Time Machine" directed by Steve Pink and starring John Cusack, Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson, and Clark Duke. Four friends travel back in time with the help of a magic hot tub.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is the theatrical edition, but also the unrated edition not shown in theaters. There is a trailer and some deleted scenes. There were several screenings of this movie in Indianapolis so I saw a really early version of the film that contained some of these deleted scenes like Craig Robinson waiting on Thomas Lennon at the 'Sup Dawg grooming salon and John Cusack sharing his past to Lizzy Caplan in the ski lodge.<br /><br />These scenes include more detail of the 80s ski outfits as they wait for a turn skiing and Clark Duke gets to interact with his romantic interest more. There is also some pathetic begging by John Cusack for his girlfriend to take him back while she leaves him for Gunner. Lots of extra ad-libbing by Rob Corddry from the, uh, bathroom scene and Craig Robinson on the phone to the young girl version of his future wife and both are simply hysterical.<br /><br />Chevy Chase shows up in another enigmatic sequence to tell them the Hot Tub is like Dorothy's ruby slippers and they didn't need the energy drink...which could have saved them quite a bit of time in the movie if they had used it. All in all, if you loved this movie, you'll get to see more funny moments that didn't make the cut theatrically and the unrated version of the movie is pretty nuts!</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>Okay, the title sounded pretty funny.  I mean a tub full of aging men can be a funny idea, in a weird sort of way.  And turning a hot tub into a time machine is pretty off-beat (can you imagine the pitch to the studio?  'Yeah, you've got a hot tub that turns into a time machine, with Chevy Chase!  Really!).<br /><br />Well, no.  The plot, such as it is, involves a group of guys who are trying to cheer themselves up by going to this formerly hot ski resort.  It was the best times of their lives, I guess.  Well, the resort has fallen on hard times.  It's pretty dismal, and even the surly bell hop has seen better times.<br /><br />I'm not sure the point of this film, except to make some money through a clever title and aiming for the 25-40 year old male crowd with a few topless pretty women (I guess).  The kid is kind of funny, and there is that recurring joke about the one-armed guy, but that's pretty much it.<br /><br />I did watch the whole thing, for some reason.  Sometimes you are just hoping a film will redeem itself.  I didn't have that hope for Time Machine; maybe I just wanted to do due diligence before I wrote a review.<br /><br />One-and-one-half stars for 'Hot Tub Time Machine'.  There's really not much reason to watch it.  Even the unrated version doesn't offer enough in the way of titillation to raise that rating even one-half star.<br /><br />Stay away, unless the only other thing on television is an infomercial.  And most of those will be more interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Adam, Nick & Lou have been "sort of" friends since high school, in the early 80s.  Now, decades later, they are distant from each other and have grown into essentially unhappy, poorly adjusted people.  When Lou nearly dies in an accident, the three friends, plus Adam's nephew Jacob head to a ski lodge that was the site of many debauched weekend ski trips for the three older men. (Apparently, reliving past glory is someone's idea of a "pick me up" getaway)  Much like the men themselves, the lodge is a hollow shell of its former self, run down and unappealing.<br /><br />But due to some sketchy science involving an illegally imported energy drink spilling on a control panel, their hot tub turns into a time machine that sends them all back to the 80s.  And naturally, they have a chance to relive moments they've always wanted a second chance with.  Can they turn their lives around?  Will they mess up the space/time continuum?  Will raunchy, R-rated behavior ensue?<br /><br />Well, considering the movie is named HOT TUB TIME MACHINE...I hope you can figure out the answers to those questions.  You pretty much know exactly what to expect from this film going into it.  The movie wants to be this year's THE HANGOVER.  But while it has many genuine laughs, it falls short of that lofty goal.<br /><br />John Cusack stars as Adam, a sad sack who has just left another relationship.  He's just sort of slouching through life, and in many ways, even when he returns to his former self, he can't seem to shake the malaise very readily.  He's more or less the party-pooper of the group.  It's fun to see Cusack in an 80's comedy, since he starred in so many great ones (BETTER OFF DEAD being a personal favorite).  I wish the actor Cusack had enjoyed himself a little bit more...he plays too much of the movie straight.  That's a shame, because his co-stars stretch the limits of credibility in their over-the-top performances.<br /><br />Craig Robinson (from THE OFFICE) is Nick.  He's the married friend who has to struggle mightily with temptation from all the young girls throwing themselves at him.  He's a former musician who recaptures his glory days by performing "Let's Get It Started In Here" by the Black-eyed Peas for his rapturous audience.  (Funny scene!)  Robinson is the kind of comic actor who gets by on a low key attitude most of the time...but this role actually has him stretch his usual persona just a little, and he does fine.  I wouldn't call it a game changer for Robinson, but it won't hurt his career.<br /><br />Rob Cordry is the perhaps suicidal Lou.  He's crazy and unconcerned for his physical safety, so when he's presented with a chance to relive his crazy youth, he embraces that with insane fervor.  Cordry is a master of being hugely offensive, particularly towards women (he stole his scenes in the forgettable WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS), and a co-starring role stretches the audience's ability to like him.  He chews into his part with gusto, though.  I'd like to see him in a more sympathetic leading role...there might actually be something there.<br /><br />There are a few odd cameos, most memorably from Crispin Glover (an always welcome oddball).  Chevy Chase makes a nearly pointless appearance in a couple of scenes.  And Lizzy Caplan (CLOVERFIELD, MEAN GIRLS, TRUE BLOOD) shows up as someone's love interest.  Her part is underwritten, but she's good enough to pull it off.<br /><br />The movie is just wildly uneven and choppy.  It has the 80's visual aesthetic of PORKY'S and tries to have the pacing and attitude of a Judd Apatow film...but in the end it isn't quite slapstick and raunchy enough to make us laugh all the way through, nor are the "tender" parts invested with any real feeling.  There are many funny bits, and I certainly enjoyed myself...but the premise (and great title) led me to hope for something more transcendently silly.  No such luck.<br /><br />Probably good for a rental, particularly if you've got a few folks (adults) over for a few beers.  But it's a near miss for me.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was awesome. I saw it a few days ago with some friends, and we had a blast. This is one my new favorite movies this year. I love 'time travel' films and was even better because I also love dirty humor. Although it has a cheesy title, I am sure that this film will become a cult classic. Four friends named Adam, Lou, Nick, and Jacob aren't happy with their lives, so they take a trip to the Kodiak Valley ski resort. While partying in a hot tub, they wake up the next morning in the year 1986. They are visited by the mysterious Repair Man who gives them guidelines. They all come to the same conclusion that sometimes you gotta change the past to help make a better future. I highly recommend HOT TUB TIME MACHINE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>The only reason worth watching is Craig Robinson,John Cusack(I've never liked him) truly bombs in this and then you have another stinkbomb like chevy chubby chaser in it.The premise is beyond dumb and despite a cameo from Thomas Lennon(Reno 911) and some shock value moments and of course a jab at Reagan(Cusack "the 80's We Had Reagan..."),plenty of boobage too.It really isn't the funny as a whole,I must admit I do like the Motley Lue and Lueggle though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>John Cusack once had talent and a promising career.  Now he not only stars in, but apparently also produced, this appallingly stupid, vulgar, and unfunny time-travel comedy.<br /><br />You know you're in for a long ninety minutes when you get one dog poop and one human piss joke in the first five minutes.  And that's about the height of the hilarity on display here.<br /><br />Really -- if you like bodily excretions -- or you're almost horizontally drunk -- you might enjoy this horribly acted, written, and directed film.<br /><br />Everyone else with an ounce of intelligence, taste, or sobriety should steer far clear.<br /><br />This is truly one of the worst so-called comedies I've ever seen.  I paid a buck to rent this film from Redbox for one night -- and I still feel cheated.<br /><br />Other famous whores on display here include Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover.  I feel sorry for the lot of them, but not as sorry as I feel for anyone who finds anything to laugh at here.  A wretched waste of celluloid -- and time.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>It's not funny at all.  We sat there straight-faced throughout the whole movie waiting for something funny to happen.  Poor John Cusack must be having financial difficulties or something.  We have already laughed at all the body fluid jokes - so they are not funny anymore, just desperate.  This whole movie is desperate. Anyway, this has to be a new low in what gets marketed as a comedy these days.

I am a big fan of John Cusack so I gave it a shot much to my chagrin. This is probably going to appeal to male teens and a few adults, but I don't see much market beyond this because it is basicly about 3 men and a teenager that travel back to the 1980s in a hot tub. They were so incredibly drunk at the time it takes them some time to realize what happened and how to track down the engineer, Chevy Chase, that can fix it. The biggest laugh is when a squirrel interrupts a touchdown play on TV that two of the men bet all their money and and one has to perform a sex act on the other. Does that sound like a movie you want to watch? Didn't think so unless you bullied teenagers in high school because I assure you the nerds don't reflect fondly on that time. I acutally was thirty-something in the "Eighties" and I loved living them. I still enjoy the music and most the movies made back then. This movie however didn't make me relive them in a good way.

Rarely funny - or even amusing. The movie attempts to combine Back to the Future with The Hangover and achieves something that's not worth watching. John Cusack's charm helps make it almost bearable. Clark Duke isn't bad, either. Crispin Glover's talents are utterly wasted.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Oh how John Cusack hath fallen.  This movie is a crude, dumb, corny, not even remotely amusing paycheck for failed comedians (watch for Chevy Chase saying reading from the cue cards occasionally as the Magical Guy who Happens in the Pointless Plot near the Hot Tub!)<br /><br />And what a portrait of humanity.  Three losers (Nick being the worst of them--he's not convincing as "the wild man", and judging from his embarassing acting ability maybe that garage/suicide attempt wasn't such a bad idea) who are getting into their late thirties are pining for their teens (is it a coincidence that these guys grew up in the 1980's?) and go back to a low rent cottage where they originally partied hardy.  While seeing a Poison concert!<br /><br />There was maybe one laugh.  You know, I love nihilistic and crude humor when it's done with degree of subtlety, sophistication--maybe I should just come out and say talent??  I'm a smoker who wants to quit, and this gave me a setback.  Stupid, pedantic garbage.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I was in the mood for a few good laughs, and even though I don't put high expectations on whacky comedies, this one was a complete dud.<br /><br />Of course, the boys are always getting drunk and stoned, because that's how boys have fun. Of course, they all say "f" this and "f" that, because that's how boys talk. Of course, they all think that the good old college days were the best time of their lives, and of course a movie like this needs some kind of gimmick - in this case a hot tub - to take them back in time. I didn't mind the hot tub gimmick, but it's too bad that the entire movie was a gimmick.<br /><br />The story couldn't quite figure out if it was in the sixties or the eighties; there was a lot of "free love" going on, conveniently leaving out the pre-HIV herpes scare of the eighties. One of the guys sang a little hip-hop at a nightclub - so derivative of Back To The Future. Chevy Chase's role seemed to be as a useless kind of cameo: a time machine mechanic? John Cusack is nostalgic for a girl who stabbed him in the eye with a fork. We get to see Clark Duke's younger mom as a slut (mommy sluts are SO funny!). We get to see Craig Robinson cuss out his 9-year-old future slut of a wife. We get to see man-on-man action as a result of a lost bet - a sort of "gag" joke, so to speak. We get to see Rob Corddry upchuck on a squirrel.<br /><br />Okay, so there are a lot of lame and predictable jokes in the movie, but that's not the worst of it, because I actually did chuckle at a few of them. The worst of it was that all of the characters were crass, and the ending was predictably crass. It was a "happy ending" for all, but none of them deserved it. These losers "stole" the future from a lot of smart people, just for money and the "good life." They make Madoff look like a Boy Scout. This is the kind of go back in time story that I would expect an immature teenager to write.<br /><br />If you're nostalgic for funny nostalgia movies, I would suggest you forget this one and watch Austin Powers instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>the talent that is.

Eight bucks poorer.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I first heard of this movie back in January of this year. I thought it sounded funny, but one I wouldn't pay to see in the theater. Then I saw the trailer, I thought it looked funny, and I decided "Eh, why not go see it? Should be good". Then my friend got an advance showing ticket and he invited me. I thought, "hey it's a free advance showing, go for it!" So I did. So anyways, that was a week ago today.<br /><br />Tonight was the screening of the movie. And boy, did I love it or what! This is definitely a movie I would pay to go see again in the theater. From its stellar cast to its substantial amount of crude and gross humor, this is a film that is rude, crude, and unabashedly vulgar- and proud of it. And it's another roller-coaster comedy- the moment you think it'll get boring, it throws even bigger laughs your way. So in that sense, I can definitely say that I am glad I went. It was one hell of a hilarious comedy that kept me laughing.<br /><br />After a stint that almost gets a person killed, his friends who are also unfortunately living rock bottom lives invite him to go on a road trip up to a snowy alpine town named Kodiak Valley, taking one's nephew. The town is practically desolate, and the hotel room is crappy. However, they find out their suite has a hot tub, and they get pretty trashed. Unknowingly, they knock over an energy drink and spill it on the panel.<br /><br />The next morning, they wake up, but things aren't what they seem. For one, everyone's wearing fashion that was made big in the eighties. there's only one logical explanation: The hot tub was a time machine that transported them back to 1986!!!! However, since 3 of them are adults, they also discover they traveled to the day they went there for the Winterfest music festival with Poison headlining. So they decide to re-live the night they'll forever remember, while simultaneously trying to get back to 2010, ending up in several sticky situations along the way!<br /><br />This was a fun movie for sure. It was totally odd yet hilarious. Tons of belly laughs, lots of WTF moments. Cusack sure didn't ruin his career with this one- he is very funny and he proved he can take on a rude and crude comedy very well. Crispin Glover has a small role here, and he really did the deed here too. But, the real star of the show here is someone I usually dislike- Rob Cordry. He stole the show greatly here. He was the real highlight here. He was consistently funny through and had me laughing so hard to the point I couldn't breathe.<br /><br />However, I recommend that you do NOT let kids see this movie. The jokes, as I mentioned are rude and crude and extremely vulgar which almost push an NC-17 rating here. There's tons of sex jokes as well and couple ugly sex scenes that do nothing but add hilarity to the movie. The ending also takes a direction that most comedies nowadays don't. You expect the clich&eacute; comedy ending but you get something here that you are NOT expecting at all, so it gob-smacks you. I wasn't expecting it, and it made the experience even funnier for me.<br /><br />In short, this was an amazing experience that is not for the squeamish and definitely not for the prudish. And I for sure will see it again when it gets released I will see it again for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>With a name like "Hot Tub Time Machine" I didn't expect a sophisticated movie.

While no instant classic, "Hot Tube Time Machine" is most definitely watchable if you are in the mood for something a little different.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this movie sees four pals (John Cusack, Clark Duke, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry) transported to the 1980s (via a hot tub).  While in that decade as their younger selves, the four compadres must both figure out a way back home and navigate the long-ago culture & atmosphere.<br /><br />The most important part of this review is to say that "Hot Tub" does indeed have a tangible plot...separating it from most current comedies.  It isn't just random stoner scenes or all-out raunch.  It is sexually-charged and chock full of profanity, but those elements don't completely obscure a coherent structure and even a few dramatic moments.<br /><br />Besides the period gags, which are usually hilarious, what really makes this movie funny is the acting of those four leading men.  Craig Robinson (Daryl of "The Office" fame) nearly steals the show, while Duke & Robinson also shine in their respective roles.  Cusack, playing the "straight man", is just okay.  Overall, though, the acting is a cut above most idiot comedies.<br /><br />Overall, "Hot Tub Time Machine" is indeed a watchable comedy adventure that will make you chuckle at both the circumstances and the characters.  How many other comedies can you say that about?</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>Hot Tub Time Machine can be described in the same way as its title; ridiculous, stupid and at the same time, funny. Many reviewers have found this movie to be plain stupid and obviously did not get it or simply couldn't get it; HTTM is definitely NOT a smart movie and will certainly not help raise your IQ. Someone who views it could possibly hate it the same way he hated movies such as Superbad I'll be the first to admit that as much as I enjoyed the movie it's dumb, really dumb. But you know what? It's what I like about it, it doesn't try to be smart and it's just a fun movie with this crazy plot that doesn't make much sense. This type of humor will not please anyone and the rating on amazon shows it. But really what do you expect of a movie with such a title?<br /><br />Adam and his friends Nick and Lou (along with Adam's nephew) go to snowy Kodic Valley, a place that holds great memories for them but they quickly realize that a lot has changed since then. Their hotel rooms has a hot tub and that night they do something that makes the hot go back in time, in 1986 precisely (you probably knew that a hot tub was going to be there at some point and that it would act as time machine, no spoilers there). The fun only starts there as they discover that what they do in 1986 could change their futures. Having a fondness for the 1980's in general (especially Motley Crue!) would really help you appreciate the movie, on the other hand if you can't stand 80's references you should stay clear of Hot Tub Time Machine. The movie references Motley Crue, Michael Jackson, Poison and mostly the MTV era, they even captured the clothes, the fashion and all. What really made me like the movie were the characters, Lou and Nick really carried the movie in m opinion.<br /><br />Watching Hot Tube Time Machine may either bring some fond memories, make you hate the 80's even more or wonder why you watched it in the first place. The reviews for HTTM are clearly mixed and not everyone will enjoy it. Oh and the movie clearly earned it's rated R rating, just so you know there is bad language and sex scenes. I like HTTM for what it was, it's a funny stupid movie and should be taken for what it is. 4 stars</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>With a name like "Hot Tub Time Machine" I didn't expect a sophisticated movie. I expected a 1980's style sex comedy with gratuitous nudity, potty humor, and a couple of good jokes. That is exactly what you get. Four people with dead end miserable lives go to a resort 3 of them once stayed at back in 1986. The go with the intent to cheer up Rob Corddry, who they believed attempted suicide, when really he just did something stupid. The place is ran down and not as they remembered. While drinking in the hot tub they get transported back into time. Chevy Chase makes an appearance as Hot Tub repair man and hints that they need to do everything the same tonight, or else they might alter the future. Attempting to remember all the bad and good things that happened that night, they go out to reproduce it, finding it equally hard to not to change the past as it is to change it. The movie includes music from 1986 as well as frequent drug use, drinking, and sex. Chevy Chase's role is almost cameo. A great movie to watch with the guys and have a few beers as long as you are higher than your expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>If you can't tell by the title alone that this is something that shouldn't be taken seriously in the least, then you've come to the wrong place.  Hot Tub Time Machine revolves around middle-aged friends Adam (John Cusack), Lou (Rob Corddry), and Nick (Craig Robinson), who along with Adam's teen nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), wind up going back in time to the 80s after a drunken hot tub accident.  It doesn't take too long for the trio to attempt to relive their glory days, with the end result being a cavalcade of raunchy and mostly funny stuff happening.  Seeing John Cusack in this kind of movie makes Hot Tub Time Machine worth watching in itself, along with the fact that he's actually pretty funny in it, as are everyone else, including Crispin Glover as a would-be armless bellhop and Chevy Chase who appears all too-briefly as the repairman who holds the key to everyone getting back home.  Though it does lose speed by its final quarter, Hot Tub Time Machine remains a fun, spirited, and raunchy-enough endeavor that is good for some laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Hot Tub Time Machine" looks like it was a heck of a lot of fun to make and to write.  John Cusack has a well-earned reputation as one of the Smart Guys in Hollywood - always reliable for delivering intelligent, wise, clever lines with humility and perfect comic timing.  Rob Corddry earned his stripes on the brilliant "Daily Show."  Craig Robinson never disappoints on "The Office."  This movie promises much . . . but unfortunately fails to deliver on its full promise.<br /><br />The plot is well-known.  Three buds and a nerdy nephew go back to the 1980's via the most ridiculous time machine since Bill and Ted were famous.  Virtually all the action takes place at one of those ski towns where everybody wants to "Party!!!!!"  Especially the nubile and loose bevy of gorgeously big-busted women who I never saw in Whitefish, Montana when I went skiing in the 1980's.  We get a bunch of 1980's-inspired humor, some of it great but some of it rather sophomoric ("What color is Michael Jackson?" has been done.  A lot.).<br /><br />What ensues is a tepid romp through time-travel cliches, T&A humor, and some rare moments of inspired hilarity.  The best running gag is the secret of just how Crispin Glover loses his arm (and Corddry's continued aggravation at the arm's series of near-misses).  Indeed, Corddry essentially steals this show as his head-banging, extremely profane Lou gets to exorcise some inner demons.  Corddry's got that gift of being able to look at even the most absurd situation with complete honesty and conviction, strapping on whatever emotional armor is needed to get things done.  Craig Robinson also has some inspired scenes as a man tortured by the apparent infidelity of his modern-day wife, whom he takes to task in a classic phone call even though back in the 1980's she's only nine years old.<br /><br />John Cusack is the biggest puzzle of this movie.  Cusack may be the ultimate scene stealer in Hollywood because he's so memorable and yet so restrained - he can go toe-to-toe with Jack Black in "High Fidelity" and still remain the heart of the picture.  But in "HTTM," Cusack is strangely unmemorable.  Usually there is at least one line in a John Cusack movie that you walk out repeating to yourself and saying, "I wish I talked that way."  Not in "HTTM."<br /><br />I am not certain if the "Unrated" edition of this movie is any better than the rated version - it does not appear to be any raunchier, but appears to include a few extended comic scenes that probably ended up on the cutting room floor because they don't quite work.<br /><br />A surprising return to the classic T&A comedies of the 1980's, "HTTM" is by no means a bad movie.  It's very funny in moments, but it does suffer from dizzyingly high expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Adam (John Cusack), his 2 friends Lou and Nick (Rob Corddry and Craig Robinson)  with Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) go to a ski resort where they used to hang-out in the 80's. While there they get smashed in a hot tub and find themselves transported back to the 80's.<br /><br /> The movie is sleazy, gross, offensive and...the funniest movie of the year. The cast work great together and most of the movie is funny. The movie even has it's touching moments. I also loved Crispen Glover as the doorman at the motel who has one arm in the 2000's, but in the 80's he has two arms and Lou can't wait to witness when he lost his arm. The scenes where you think he might lose his arm are just hilarious. I loved this movie, just see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Every now and then John Cusack will go slumming. The way I see it, John Cusack's massive appeal cancels out Chevy Chase's patented mugging. This still doesn't make HOT TUB TIME MACHINE watchable beyond a certain frat boy level. However, in that frat boy wheelhouse, this film's a laugh riot. To start with, I love the hell out of the film's title.<br /><br />When life gives you lemons, you can choose to make lemonades. Or you can squirt the lemons in your eyeball. Cusack plays Adam, one of the three childhood friends and losers-in-life who serve as our core characters. Adam is an insurance agent whose woman had left him and whose wise aleck 20-year-old uber-nerd nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) has permanently camped out in his basement. Somewhere along here, we meet Nick (Craig Robinson), once the front man of a band but now a sad sack stuck in a dead end career in pet care. When news hits Adam and Nick of the attempted suicide by their old party animal pal, Lou a.k.a. "Violator" (Rob Corddry), it reunites the old gang. Having fallen out of touch, the three decide to relive the best weekend of their lives, spent in the snowy Kodiak Valley ski resort back in 1986 when they were kids. Adam's nephew, Jacob, tags along, because who doesn't want a chubby young geek as a wingman?<br /><br />Except that the ski resort nowadays is a mostly deserted dump. And that ill-tempered one-armed bellhop (Crispin Glover) is surely putting out creepy vibes. Still, these four losers are up for one night of drunken revelry. And, oooh, is that a hot tub? They jump in the hot tub, and if you've glanced at the film's title, you should be able to make that intuitive leap.<br /><br />"It must be some kind of hot tub time machine..." The quartet wake up the next morning to find themselves somehow transported to 1986, back to that very same weekend they'd been hearkening back to. Back to 1986, era of leg warmers, Red Dawn, MTV when it actually showed music videos, and Eddie Murphy when he was funny. Adam, Nick, and Lou learn that the inhabitants of 1986 perceive them as teenagers, as they'd originally looked in that time, and that familiar events are unwinding as they once did. Can these tourists in time find their way back to their own time, and do it without destroying the space/time continuum? Even if it means that Adam gets stabbed in the eye with a fork again?<br /><br />If you're in the mood for gross out humor, then this is up your alley. HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is a sort of a bromance by way of smutty screwball farce. It trots out an unrelenting arsenal of pervasive language, raunchiness, nudity, and Chevy Chase as a mysterious repairman. There are so many f-bombs dropped in this one that even Lenny Bruce is all apologetic. The story has fun playing with time paradox, whether it's the Violator's surefire sports wager backfiring, Nick's introduction of a Black Eyes Peas joint to the 1986 crowd or his insane phone call to his future wife (who in 1986 is a nine-year-old girl), or a key subplot which threatens Jacob's very existence.<br /><br />John Cusack, ostensibly the lead actor, takes a back seat to Rob Corddry who ends up stealing all the scenes as Lou the Violator. You have to admire Corddry for throwing himself into the role with such abandon. In a sick kind of way, his performance approaches near virtuoso levels. He pretty much tops up his quota of cusswords within the first few minutes. He says stuff that make you cringe, except that, inside, you wish you had the sac to say them. He almost deserves his getting the last laugh. HOT TUB TIME MACHINE falls into my own wheelhouse, me being a child of the '80s. I, too, remember when Michael Jackson was black. I can see where that bully Blaine was coming from when he accused our oddball time travelers of being some sort of "21 Jump Street communist spy battalion type dudes." Heck, I even remember Scritti Politti. And, every once in a while, I get a yen for gross out humor.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Here's the thing about HOT TUB TIME MACHINE: it's a movie called HOT TUB TIME MACHINE.  If that doesn't immediately put you off, then you should probably watch it.<br /><br />For those of you looking for some summary: three middle-aged guys (Adam, Nick, and Lou) are having a bad time of it.  Together (along with Adam's nephew Jacob) then decide to go to a ski resort where they partied like rock stars in the 80's.  Except they find the place utterly dead.  The only remotely interesting thing there is the hot tub.  They all get in (four dudes naked in a hot tub, perfectly normal), get drunk, pass out, and come to in the 1980s.  There's a creepy old hot tub repairman (ladies and gentlemen, Chevy Chase!) who may or may not have something to do with time travel.  There are hot chicks and cool dudes.  And Adam, Nick, and Lou?  They're kids again, ready to re-live the best days of their lives.  Except something strange is happening to Jacob...and really, it's very, very hard to do the same thing twice, when you know you'll get your butt kicked, get a fork in the eye, and generally suffer the ravages of adolescence all over again.  It's so tempting to change things...<br /><br />Does that make any sense?  Probably not.  But it's not really supposed to; HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is about four guys bonding and having a good time, finding themselves and each other...along with sex jokes, other dirty jokes, and generally the sort of humor we've come to associate with Rob Corddry and Craig Robinson (both of whom shine here, by the way).  Clark Duke is pretty good as Jacob, too, but John Cusak is the real star here (no offense to the rest of the cast).  He brings the same amount of integrity he brings even to his worst movies; this isn't among that category, thank God, but it's nowhere near as good as his best comedies.  HOT TUB is something of an amalgam of eighties sex comedies and 21st century sex comedies; there's the heart of the former, with the utter disregard of the latter.  It creates an interesting blend that doesn't quite surpass the sum of its parts, as it should.  Still, if you're looking for a good time, you could do worse.  But again, it all hinges on the title: does a movie named HOT TUB TIME MACHINE sound like your kind of thing?  Normally you can't judge a movie by its title; here, you can.  So judge away.  And if you're at all interested, then give it a shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>I'm not normally a fan of raunchy, over-the-top, "boobies and beer" comedies. I didn't see why <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a> was so great, but I had a great time watching Hot Tub Time Machine. Yes, the premise of going back in time via a hot tub is utterly ridiculous and you could see the film's ending coming from miles away, but it got a few good laughs out of even a cynic like me. Hot Tub has just the right chemistry to make it work. Maybe it's because of the excellent casting choice. In the hands of another set of actors and comedians, this movie could've really stunk.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Craig Robinson's style of humor or Rob Corddry's (from The Jon Stewart Show), you'll like Hot Tub. It follows a time-tested formula, used by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYFXW">Beerfest</a>, the Harold and Kumar films, and many others: beer, girls, comic mishaps. Not coincidentally, it reminded me of classic 80's mischief like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056BSD">Revenge of the Nerds</a>, Back to the Future, and Weird Science for its campy humor.<br /><br />HTTB is at its core a buddy movie. Three dysfunctional middle-aged losers, each with their own problems and failures in life, decide to rekindle their friendship when one of them, Lou, a depressed alcoholic, tries to kill himself through carbon monoxide poisoning. They've drifted apart over the years and head off to Kodiak Valley ski resort to relive old times. They take Adam's (John Cusack) nerdy, shut-in, Second Life-addicted nephew with them. He brings along an "illegal" Russian energy drink on the trip. When they arrive, they find the town run-down and dilapidated. Determined to have a good time, nonetheless, they get into the hot tub and booze up. They wake up to find themselves hungover and in 1986, reliving their past and trying to avoid "the butterfly effect" of altering the future by changing events of the past. From there, they get into a series of R-rated adventures with the requisite nudity and drunken sophomoric shenanigans. Everything wraps up neatly at the end with all strings tied and everyone happy.<br /><br />As usual, slapping "UNRATED" on the box in slanted red capital letters is just a marketing ploy. It's really just two short scenes involving a topless woman and quite mundane. We also see several instances of Corddry's bare butt. I do not know how different the language is from the rated version, but Robinson and Corddry are as terrifically foul-mouthed as ever. They're paired for much of the later half of the movie, and together get into some very raunchy adventures, producing some of the funniest moments in the film and some memorable lines from Robinson (mostly due to his comical expletives and shouting). He does a lot of cursing, like his potty-mouthed barista character in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MEJYB4">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</a>. The counter-point is John Cusack, who turns in a solid performance as the more level-headed member of the bunch. There's a running gag with the porter (Crispin Glover) losing his arm and Chevy Chase makes a cameo as an annoyingly dour and cryptic hot tub repairman.<br /><br />As for complaints, the movie could've used more 80's-ness. Aside from a few sight gags all shown within 5 minutes of them arriving back in time (brick-sized cell phone, Ronald Reagan on TV, Miami Vice t-shirt, the famous Duran Duran poster by Patrick Nagel, leg-warmers) and references to 80's hair metal, the movie seems to drop this fiction pretty quickly in its art direction and dialog. I never felt a sense of nostalgia and most of the film still felt like it was happening in 2010. 80's songs play a prominent part in this film, but a lot of the musical selection I didn't recognize (or just didn't hear because it was in the background). Being a child of the 80's, most of the songs that I think of as quintessentially 80's were not here, like Boy George, Phil Collins, Madonna, Journey, etc, possibly due to licensing costs.<br /><br />All in all, still a lot of fun if you're in the mood for a silly, and very raunchy good time. Leave your maturity at the door, but that goes without saying.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Running Time: 1 hour, 40 minutes.<br />This DVD gives you the choice of Theatrical version or Uncut Version.<br />  A group of four guys, Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinso), Lou (Rob Corddry) and Jacob (Clark Duke) go on a male-bonding trip to Kodiak Valley.

Some films have titles that are worrying from the start and usually spell a disastrous film. When faced with Hot Tub Time Machine alarm bells began to ring. It wasn't that the title was bad it just seemingly explained the plot of the film and the idea sounded utterly ludicrous but was I proved wrong?<br /><br />The film begins in 2010 with three friends Adam (John Cusack), Lou (Rob Corddry) and Nick (Craig Robinson) who are all living unfulfilling lives. While Adam has just split up with his latest girlfriend, Nick has an unfaithful wife and has no job satisfaction in his role at a dog spa. For Lou things are much worse, culminating in him being rushed to hospital following carbon monoxide poisoning in what is believed to be a suicide attempt. Adam and Nick decide to take Lou away to the Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, a now run down place but back in the eighties a place of fond memories for the friends. Adam brings along his nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) and soon the quartet are at their hotel with a one armed bellman Phil (Crispin Glover) to contend with and of course a hot tub outside. Having one too many drinks and enjoying the hot tub the friends accidentally knock over a Russian drink called Chernobly (I shouldn't need to tell you what reference the drink is to) and when they wake the following day from their drunken slumber it's 1986! The audience sees the friends as they are in 2010 but for everyone else they see the quartet as their younger selves except Jacob of course! Worried about inserting paradoxes into the timelines the friends have to relive their pasts precisely as the events played out in 1986 but does the temptation to change things become too much?<br /><br />The opening part of Hot Tub Time Machine I found okay but not spectacular and I blame this on my worries about the film beginning with that title. Once the quartet hit 1986 the laughs begin to accelerate starting with Nick confirming they're in the eighties by asking the nearest person what colour Michael Jackson is! Reliving the past isn't especially easy. Adam recalls breaking up with Jenny (Lyndsy Fonseca) who responded by sticking a fork in his eye and, yes, Adam has to go through it again! Lou has to face the resort bully Blaine (Sebastian Stan) and take yet another beating, while Adam's sister Kelly (Collette Wolfe) conceives Jacob at this point and it is a somewhat harrowing experience for Jacob to witness his mother who loves to enjoy herself much to his disgust. Nick is the lead singer in a band which back in the eighties did a terrible gig but having to be faithful to the events Nick has sex with Tara (Jessica Pare) and weeps through the exchange, lamenting being unfaithful to his wife which he insists on explaining to Tara who loses interest, especially when Nick tells her his wife is only nine years old in 1986!<br /><br />The temptation to change things in the past becomes too much for the group. While Jacob tries to keep everyone focussed on not disrupting the timelines Adam decides to take the initiative with Jenny and keep their relationship going only for her to dump him! By this point Adam has met music journalist April (Lizzy Caplan) so the audience will wonder if she's a part of his future. Lou thrives in the eighties where partying and sex are his forte, a far cry from his meaningless existence in the present. Nick rediscovers his passion for music and in one of the best moments of the film he rings up his then nine year old wife-to-be and proceeds to verbally abuse her for being unfaithful to him. Another joke which lasts the entire film is the friends' encounter with bellman Phil who has both arms in 1986 but Lou is convinced he will lose one while they are there. What follows is a series of incidents where we think Phil is about to lose that arm, be it getting his arm trapped in a lift or slipping on some ice while performing tricks with a chainsaw.<br /><br />I had my doubts about Hot Tub Time Machine and the opening reels still had me worried but very quickly I settled into the film and began to enjoy it immensely. The ludicrousness of the film's title and concept seems to be addressed when Nick actually says "Hot Tub Time Machine" then looks at the camera as if he wants to roll his eyes. There are many laughs on offer here and Cusack, Corddry, Robinson and Duke are all fantastic and great fun throughout the film. Even comedy legend Chevy Chase makes an appearance as a hot tub repairman and by that point I was hooked on what is a very silly film but it never takes itself seriously or tries to be anything other than absurd.<br /><br />Hot Tub Time Machine may sound too bizarre to be worth your time but you'd be making a big mistake. The film is full of good laughs and nostalgia for one's younger days when life seemed very simple. Even though the friends go about changing their pasts you'll find yourself right behind them throughout and even when inevitably melodramatic moments creep in the comedy makes a mockery of them and prevents any sentimentality. A worrying title but a very funny film.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Steve Pink's film is really a rip-off of Back to the Future.

Well, I guess I just don't know what he was thinking here... Rob Corddry was amusing, as was geeky Clark Dane as the only smart one in the group.

I'm not sure what the creators of this film were thinking when they came up with the idea of a hot tub as a time machine, but this movie failed in some parts. I can appreciate the time travel aspect and trying to fix one's past, but there were way too many stupid and lowbrow jokes in this film to make it truly memorable. If you like any of the starring actors in this film, you might enjoy watching it. But this is a film better for renting, not buying.<br /><br />The ending was decent - one of the better parts of this film, that's for sure. If more thought had gone into this film, it would have been a more memorable one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Hot Tub.  Time Machine.  I'm sure when this was pitched the honchos probably jumped across the desk and had the contracts in hand.  Roger Corman in his heyday probably could have taken this and do it on a shoestring budget without any stars and make a ton of money.  Nonetheless this flick has John Cusack on hand who would be accused of slumming if he wasn't one of the producers.  The $64,000.00<br /> question is does the film work.  For the most part, yeah.  "Hot Tub Machine" is unashamedly raunchy version of "Back to the Future" with a twist of "Porky's" thrown in.  This is terrific flick for the bros to sit around to and drink beer.  I might add, though, that my sister liked it and my wife gave it a marginal pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Not a perfect comedy, but a talented cast and enough raunchy material keep it moving.  I think this is one of those movies that grows on you.  You might think it is just okay the first time you see it, but after watching it a few times on cable you may learn to love it.  I enjoyed it myself, though I still can't figure out what Chevy Chase was doing in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>Just admit it, when you guys first heard the name you were probably already prejudging it as some cheap, B grade, low budget piece of you know whats. But you know what? After years of waiting, I decided why not? So I got it and watched it and I now have it! It is actually pretty funny, combined with a group of decent, interesting characters. Thank god the jokes are decently timed and well paced and well presented. Usually movies like these try to get laughs by outrageous idiotic jokes that disgust or embarrass you into laugher...well this movie does as well but I would say it was good or very decent!<br /><br />I enjoyed it and it's a keeper, would be a fun watch a few months from now on a rainy day. Not bad, don't underestimate this movie, watch it now!<br /><br />I'm not paid to say all this either....i wish....</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Hot Tub Time Machine" is great! This is how the story goes: A group of best friends have become bored with their adult lives: Adam has been dumped by his girlfriend; Lou is a party guy who can't find the party; Nick's wife controls his every move; and video game-obsessed Jacob won't leave his basement. After a crazy night of drinking in a ski resort hot tub, the men wake up, heads pounding, in the year 1986. This is their chance to kick some past and change their futures - one will find a new love life, one will learn to stand up for himself with the ladies, one will find his mojo, and one will make sure he still exists!<br /><br />The cast led by John Cusack (who also produced) (as Adam) is great! The directing by Steve Pink (who also did the screenplays to "High Fidelity" (2000, also co-produced and was the music supervisor along with Cusack) & "Grosse Pointe Blank" (1997, also co-produced), both, ironically, co-written by Cusack, he is also producing the upcoming "Knight & Day" (2010) is great! The story by Josh Heald & the screenplay by Heald, Sean Anders & John Morris (both of them did the screenplay to "She's Out Of My League" (2010) is great!<br /><br />The music by Christophe Beck (who also did the music to "The Hangover" (2009), "Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief" (2010) & the upcoming "Date Night" (2010) is great! The cinematography by Jack N. Green (who also did the cinematography to "Diary Of A Wimpy Kid" (2010), he also did the cinematography to Clint Eastwood's movies from "Heartbreak Ridge" (1986) to "Space Cowboys" (2000) is great! The film editing by George Folsey Jr. (who also did the film editing to "Animal House" (1978), "The Blues Brothers" (1980), "Coming To America" (1988), "Basic" (2003), "Cheaper By The Dozen" (2003), "Hostel" (2006) & "Hostel Part II" (2007) & James Thomas (who also did the film editing to "Bruno" (2009) & "Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan" (2006) is great! The casting by Lynne Carrow & Susie Farris (who also did the casting to "Elf" (2003) & "Mona Lisa Smile" (2003) is great! The production design by Bob Ziembicki (who also did the production design to "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story" (1993) & "Scream 2" (1997) is great! The art direction by Kelvin Humenny (who also did the art direction to "Elf" & "Wind Chill" (2007) & Jeremy Stanbridge (who also did the art direction to "The Butterfly Effect" (2004), "Eight Below" (2006), "Shooter" (2007) & the upcoming "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse" (2010) is great! The set decoration by Jill Sprayregen Henkel & Johanne Hubert (who also did the set decoration to "Elf" & "Shooter") is great! The costume design by Dayna Pink (who also did the costume design to "Fame" (2009) & "Crank: High Voltage" (2009) is great!<br /><br />This is a great, funny comedy that keeps you laughing and on the edge of your seat. This is different than most comedies out there right now. John Cusack, again, has another great movie under his belt.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Positive two stars for selecting the Bollywood style colorful clothes and accoutrements and some of the music although they could have chosen more entertaining representations of  the '80s (probably didn't want to spend the money).<br /><br />Negative two stars for just copying a well worn "going back in time" storyline that made no sense (not a requirement), implementing it with another alcohol induced night of juvenile plot and dialogue writing in which, I lost count at around 200 uses of a f word or it's derivatives. At least the script writers did not have to exert themselves on a dictionary/thesaurus for dialogue longer than four letters.<br /><br />Viewers that were hot for "Hot Tub" will also have their rebellious inner self  fulfilled by "Youth in Revolt".</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>John Cusack has a lot of good movies from the 80's and he was in his element and he look like he felt at home. I love that he took out that long coat with the cut up gloves that he is known for in the 80s. I love the movie it was silly but I enjoyed my self and I had a few laughs and thought they all did good together I think John Cusack is so accomplish with the serious roles he has been in since the 90s so to come back to do a silly movie was fun and surprising. It's like a combination of old school and animal house.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Gross. Obnoxious. Over the top. Vulgar. Crude. Ridiculous. Great movie!<br /><br />Earning a hard R, Hot Tub Time Machine surprised me with how amusing it actually was. I think it was helpful to go into this movie with my expectations set for an adolescent-minded sillyfest, because that's pretty much what you get albeit with some very adult themes throughout. A perfect movie for me.<br /><br />After the biggest loser of a group of 3 peas in a pod friends seemingly attempts to commit suicide, they embark on a road trip back to a place that they used to go 25 years ago to have fun in order to try to get their friend out of his funk. They find that their favorite resort town has become pretty run down over the years, which only adds to the state of depression overhanging the group. So instead of going out on the town, they get some booze and hang back at the room and hit the Hot Tub, which of course turns out to be more that just your ordinary Hot Tub.<br /><br />The boys are transported back in time and the rest of the movie is a comical and often disgusting chronicle of their fight to get back to the future without causing a Butterfly Effect that alters history. The Hot Tub Time Machine Gods picked the wrong group of guys to test the wills of humanity here.<br /><br />4 stars may be a bit generous, but if you factor in the deliberateness of the inane disposition that the movie takes, it's really well done. I laughed a lot. I winced a few times. I enjoyed it! Definitely worth a look if you can stomach some of the crudest humor that I've seen packed into about an hour and a half movie in a while.<br /><br />This is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00198X0UO">Back to the Future</a> on crack.</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>Hot Tub Time Machine is a comedy, so let's keep that in mind when we consider it's merits. You should not take this movie seriously. If you do, you'll likely turn it off before it really even gets started, and you'll miss out on a lot of laughs. Sit back, relax, and disregard your sanity for an hour and a half.<br /><br />Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson) and Lou (Rob Corddry) are friends who used to go on vacations to a wild ski-resort in the 80s. Their lives are not going as well as they dreamed they would, so they take a vacation to the same resort, and Adam's nephew (Clark Duke) tags along. Once there, they see how much things have changed, but they're magically transported back in time through the hot machine on the back porch.<br /><br />(See what I mean about sanity? That would never happen!)<br /><br />The interactions between the main characters are excellent, because they mimic real-life conversations. They make lame jokes, they poke fun at each other, they make movie references, they give each other bad advice; it's all here.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the fact that it makes fun of itself. This is evidenced in a few ways. First, Crispin Glover plays the bellboy, an obvious throwback to Back to the Future in which Glover plays George McFly. This movie is a rip-off of that one, and the fact that it points this out so the critics don't have to is smart. Second, Craig Robinson uses the title of the film in his dialogue, then looks at the camera with a blank face. This ellicits a good laugh, because once again, the film is making fun of itself. Thanks to that silly, light-hearted tone, Hot Tub Time Machine is a winner, because we know not to take any of it too seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Recently, on "30 Rock", Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and her date (Michael Sheen) exit a movie theater. We catch them in mid discussion. "You have a problem with the science of "Hot Tub Time Machine"?" Liz asks sarcastically. This is a funny line because the mechanics of the time travel in this film, how they get to the late 80s and back again are so stupid, even this makes us laugh. The time travel isn't the point. "Hot Tub Time Machine" is a funny, dumb, nonsensical movie designed to do nothing but make us laugh.<br /><br />It is difficult to not like the new film. From the corny title (which perfectly summarizes the film by the way) to the actors who seem to be having the time of their lives playing these characters, to the story itself, which is extremely ribald and raunchy, just about everything in this John Cusack film works. In fact, there seems to be so much crammed into the film, you have to sort of admire the filmmakers for their 'kitchen sink' approach to comedy. No, I'm not kidding. This is a very funny movie and the rare example of a comedy that works more than it doesn't. For every joke that doesn't work, three do. Usually, the ratio is the opposite, if we're lucky.<br /><br />Adam (John Cusack) returns home to find his girlfriend has moved out and taken most of her possessions with her. His younger nephew, Jacob (Clark Duke, "Accepted", "Kick-Ass") lives in the basement, afraid to venture out into the world. Adam gets a call from Nick (Craig Robinson, TV's "The Office"), a former singer who now runs a fledgling music studio with his wife. Their old friend, Lou (Rob Cordry ("Blades of Glory", "Semi-Pro", "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart") is in the hospital and may have tried to commit suicide. Both go visit and quickly decide a to an old ski resort they visited as teenagers is just the ticket to get everyone moving and feeling alive again. Once there, they find the place is a pit, but a strange janitor (Chevy Chase) is trying to keep things going. They head to the hot tub and start drinking. Before long, a strange combination of fluids and circumstances allows them to travel back in time to the mid 80s when they were kids. But they also realize they have to tread carefully and repeat everything they did back on that fateful night. If they don't, they could change things in the present. But of course, none of them is happy, so the possibility of changing things begins to prove too seductive.<br /><br />Once the reunited friends, and Adam's nephew, get settled in and realize the place they have remembered for so many years is now a dump, they try to enjoy their time together and are eager to try the hot tub. When they realize it is in need of a major cleaning, they back away. But the mysterious handyman (played by Chevy Chase) sets things right. Soon, they are diving into the hot tub, drinking copious amounts of booze and energy drinks and enjoying themselves immensely. An incomprehensible event sends the hot tub time machine hurting back to the 80s and the three older men soon realize they are re-experiencing the greatest night of their lives. They all look like their late teen selves, but we see their middle aged personas. They've been given a "do-over" but have to work against their inner-self. Do they try to keep everything the same, to maintain the current status of their lives, lives they all hate? Or do they try to change things and use their knowledge of the forthcoming two decades to change and, hopefully, improve their lives?<br /><br />Produced by John Cusack and directed by Steve Pink ("Accepted"), "Hot Tub" joins the growing list of comedies designed to generate laughs with gross out humor. And it's funny. Expect at least one character to barf and at least one character to be barfed on. That is the humor level referenced throughout the film.<br /><br />And if that were all there is, it would be a funny but forgettable film. But because they also inject some genuine humor, some jabs at life in the 80s and some genuine emotion, the film becomes even better and more memorable.<br /><br />I want to take a moment to offer an appreciation of John Cusack. Cusack has a long and fruitful career both behind and ahead of him. The reason for this is because he has been able to balance appearances in silly blockbusters ("2012"), appearances that only serve to improve the film, with starring roles in more personable, quirky and enjoyable films. From "Say Anything" to "Gross Point Blank", the criminally underrated "Identity" to the subtle horror film "1408", he is always interesting. Even in the terrible, terrible film "The Ice Harvest", he manages to make his character watchable, abating some of the growing dread you experience as you sit through the film trying to understand how this piece of crap ever got made in the first place.<br /><br />In "Hot Tub", Cusack plays the most normal character, the one with the goals we can most easily identify with. Because of that, he becomes the center of the story, but he is also the least interesting because he is the least outrageous. He is almost, but not quite, the straight man. But without him, the film wouldn't work.<br /><br />Rob Cordry, on the other hand, plays the off the wall character. Lou is ready and willing for anything and to do anything. As soon as they arrive at the ski resort, he begins looking for possible hook-ups. When they return to the 80s, and he now has the libido of a teenager, these desires only increase.<br /><br />Craig Robinson plays Duke, a man who now owns a recording studio and works part time as a dog groomer, giving you an indication of how well his business is doing. His big dream as a teenager was to become a singer, so when they return to the 80s, he realizes he can start over. He accomplishes this in a funny, funny way.<br /><br />Clark Duke plays Jacob, Adam's nephew, who joins them for the ride. He is funny because he provides a sort of running commentary as the conscience of the group. He is also more intricately involved in the story than you might imagine.<br /><br />"Hot Tub Time Machine" takes necessary jabs at everything "80s". The guys' main nemesis is a guy named Blaine (Sebastian Stan), the leader of the Ski Patrol, complete with blonde feathered hair. Craig Robinson's 80's persona has the high, sculpted hair made popular by Kid of Kid 'N' Play. Everyone seems to be using drugs. These moments are fun, but not the best thing about the film and they become a little overworked after a while.<br /><br />The best thing about "Hot Tub Time Machine" is the fact the filmmakers made the film at all. It is such a preposterous story, executed so tongue in cheek that I would find it difficult for anyone to not enjoy themselves.<br /><br />But beware. The film is rated R and there are some very good reasons for that. But don't let that scare you off. In a way, it only helps to make the science of the Hot Tub Time Machine more believable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>This is utterly stupid and mindless, yet there was something about it that I liked enough to watch to completion. The plot is absurd, but the actors are somehow touching here. It's a little old-fashioned, almost like an 80s movie, maybe because the film spends most of its time stuck in the 80s as four time travelers go back to 1986 as if that were another century. Well, it was another century, but still....</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>I never thought I'd be giving Hot Tub Time Machine a 5-star rating, but this is funny stuff.  It's literally a step back into the good / bad ol' days of 80s comedies but a far more informed and self-conscious eye.<br /><br />What if you had to go back to the 80s and relive legwarmers, spandex and hair metal (on a ski resort no less) and PRETEND to be comfortable?  is the superficial premise, but this owes more to Groundhog Day meets (name your 80s flick)...<br /><br />Everything seems to fall into place like a hot dog on a bun.  At times cheesy, at times bizarre, but never hokey - the film just works.  The characters are brilliantly crafted and played by the Ensemble.  It's especially interesting to see John Cusack - a star who found fame in the 1980s produce and star in this.  Aside from Cusack in his usual good guy role, Craig Robinson and Rob Corddry are absolutely brilliant as his loser friends.  I thought this was way better than the Hangover; and the soundtrack aces The Wedding Singer...nuff said.</p></br></body></html>

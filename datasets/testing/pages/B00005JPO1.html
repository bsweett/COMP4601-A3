INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL takes places twenty years after Indy and his father found illumination and road into the sunset.  A lot happens in twenty years and the world is a far different place when we last saw Dr. Jones, e.g. there was a World War that ended in the defeat of the Nazis and the world is now involved in a conflict of a different sort, the Cold War.  The movie begins with a group of teenagers speeding down a long highway trying to race with a group of army vehicles.  Eventually the army guys turn down a different path that leads right up to Area 51.  The army guys turn out to be a bunch of Soviet spies sent to the U.S. on a special mission.  When they get inside the gates of Area 51, the trunk of a vehicle is opened and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and a friend of his the audience is just meeting for the first time, "Mac" McHale (Ray Winstone) are thrown upon the ground.  With guns pointed, the brains behind this operation makes her appearance, Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, who looks more alluring and ravishing than she ever has in any other movie).  Dr. Spalko claims that Dr. Jones has been to this place before.  Indy claims he hasn't.  Then Spalko weaves a tail about some mysterious object eleven years ago that Indiana was tied to and that she knows for a fact that it was brought here.  If you think this sounds more like a X-Files movie than an Indiana Jones film, you're not alone.  When I first saw where this whole thing was headed I kept hoping that it wouldn't turn out that way, but I was wrong.  From what we've seen in the first fifteen minutes along with the title of the movie, most anyone can piece together where the film is headed.<br /><br />That's not to say INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is terrible, because it's not.  There's a lot of good stuff that happens.  I'm not a very big fan of the overrated Shia LaBeouf, but I will say I really enjoyed his role in the movie as Mutt Williams, a rebellious teenager who seeks out Indy when his favorite professor, Harold "Ox" Oxley (John Hurt) and his mother go missing.  In fact, this is LaBeouf's best performance in a movie since HOLES.  Karen Allen returns to the Indy saga as the Marion Ravenwood, the love of Indy's life and the one he let get away.  There's a tribute both to Dr. Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) and the late Marcus Brody (the late Denholm Elliot).  There's a fun chase in around the school Indy teaches out and is now a tenured professor at, Marshall College.  There's also a really awesome homage to those B films of the 1950s and 1960s particularly in a scene with some really vicious flesh-eating jungle ants.  Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and Shia LeBeouf play well off of each other and John Hurt is hilarious as the tutor to both Indy and Mutt who for reasons that won't be named has retreated into a child-like state.<br /><br />Yet with all that and the great action, hilarious one-liners, references to previous Indy pictures and shows (there's one reference to THE YOUNG INDIANA JONES CHRONICLES), and a beautiful and domineering villainess, there's still the whole matter of the Crystal Skull.  For the first part of the movie, the Crystal Skull is like a McGuffin, an object that everyone seems to want but really serves no purpose other than to get things moving.  Then it becomes clear that the Crystal Skull isn't some worthless object.  It's an object of great power, but unlike the artifacts from the previous Indian Jones movies, it's not an artifact from some forgotten time but holds the key to the future.  The whole concept the ultimate conclusion of what the Crystal Skull leads to is the downfall of the movie.  I know there were some people that were turned off by the whole "nuking the fridge" segment, but I wasn't bothered by it; there's at least one scene similar to that in every Indiana Jones movie--it was solely there for humor.  I could deal with the nuking of the fridge, but not so much the whole Crystal Skull.<br /><br />Instead of an Indiana Jones movie, the major plot structure seems more akin in the world of the X-Files.  In fact, much of the plot of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is like watching a rejected episode of the X-FILES.  And the blame for that one lies at the feet of George Lucas.  In 2003 Lucas was given a draft of a script for an Indiana Jones movie written by Frank Darabont.  Darabont had spent a year writing the script and had worked closely with Steven Spielberg on the project.  Spielberg loved Darabont's script and called it one of the best scripts he has ever read. Harrison Ford loved the script.  George Lucas didn't and Darabont's script was thrown out.  Five years later, this is the drivel that we ended up with: the worst of the Indiana Jones movies.  Thanks, George.<br /><br />Overall, INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is a decent action picture, but a very sub-par Indiana Jones movie. It's worth watching, but it's the weakest movie in the franchise and the overall plot of the film doesn't gel with everything else in the Indy canon.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>OK, I admit "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a pretty entertaining film. Harrison Ford is impressive as likeable hero Indy Jones and the film certainly offers a fair amount of action and lots of stunts in the course of the hero's adventures to seek treasures and fight Russian baddies led by Cate Blanchett's "Col. Irina Spalko."<br /><br />But quite honestly I cannot believe that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have really chosen this awfully contrived script for the new Indy film. We have waited so long for the "comeback" of Dr. Jones, especially after reading so many publicized reports of failed attempts to find the right screenplay, but surely we didn't expect to see this one given the green light.<br /><br />From the opening sequence where we are told something about a government's secret and Roswell, this fourth Indy film will not be the same as good, old 80s-style action adventure the franchise was once. Spielberg tries to keep the spirit of old-fashioned action adventure, and Karen Allen reprises the role of Marion of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," but the overuse of special effects, unbelievable actions (apparently Indy can survive anything, even a nuclear blast) and the lack of coherent storyline (who is Ray Winstone"s character anyway?) are too much to be ignored.<br /><br />But what is most disappointing to me is that there is nothing new in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." There is no formidable villain or villainess; no thrills of watching a falling bridge; no charisma of Sean Connery. After the third Indy film made back in 1989, we have seen such films as "The Mummy," "The National Treasure," "Sahara" and so on. The new Indiana Jones film needs something that these films don't have, but except the heroic figure of Indiana Jones I couldn't find one in "Crystal Skull."</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>From the moment the silhouette of that famous fedora crosses the screen, you'll feel that old surge of movie-house giddiness that you felt the first time you went to a darkened theater to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>. Indy is older...a bit greyer and a bit creakier, but he still has a killer smile and a rapier wit to go with that twinkle in his eye. So when the nasty Ruskies (the Cold War now replacing WWI) kidnap Indy and take him to Area 51, the thrill ride kicks in almost from the very start to the sounds of Elvis Presley and John Williams.<br /><br />Seems the mythic artifact this time around is an alien skull, and the Russians want it. A kicking Cate Blanchett is Col Dr Irina Spalko, Soviet Psychic Baddie who has kidnapped Professor Oxley (John Hurt) and Marion (the welcome return of Karen Allen), and "Mutt" (the ubiquitous Shia LeBeouf) now enlists Dr Jones to help rescue them and save the world. Along the way, they must overcome a nuclear blast, carnivorous ants, waterfalls and the usual cavalcade of bad guys with guns in moving vehicles. Yes, the plot is obvious. But when you watch the older DVD's, I was a bit taken aback at just how obvious the old plots were. As Dean Stanforth says early in the film, "We seem to have reached the age where life stops giving us things and starts taking them away."<br /><br />"Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull" is no-where near as bad as some of these aging fan-boys make it out to be. It's a darn sight better than 1984's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a>, and lacks only the magnetic presence of Sean Connery to equal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>. The humor of the originals is intact, and Jones/Ford takes the wind out of the aging issue with some great lines and sight gags (fave line from Mutt - "for an old man you ain't bad in a fight. What are you, like 80?"). The usual wild white-knuckle chases through the jungle are terrific, even if you've seen it before.<br /><br />Ok, so the alien thing might be a bit harder to swallow than Holy Grails for the X-Files generation. And I did kind of miss the old fashioned non-CGI booby traps. But that doesn't detract from the basic fact that this is Steven Spielberg and George Lucas firing on all cylinders, and a welcome addition to the Indiana Jones Legacy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" attempts to resurrect the Indiana Jones trilogy that we thought ended 19 years ago by moving it from the World War II era to the Cold War. About 20 years have passed since Professor Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr. discovered the Ark of the Covenant in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". He's still teaching, digging, and being caught up in international intrigues. A young man named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) shows him a coded letter written by his godfather Harold Oxley (John Hurt), an old school friend of Indy's. Harold claims to have found a Crystal Skull that legend says will give its mysterious powers to whomever returns it to the mythic city of Akator. Harold and Mutt's mother have been kidnapped, so Indy and Mutt are off to Peru to find them. But a Soviet Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), who has an intense interest in objects with paranormal properties, seeks the Skull as well.<br /><br />While previous Indiana Jones films were inspired by the adventure serials of the 1930s, George Lucas conceived this one as a take on the sci-fi exploitation films of the 1950s, the decade in which it takes place. Spending a fortune to cross one low-budget genre with another is probably not the cleverest idea. But low-budget genre films succeed because they take themselves seriously. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> (1981) did that and improved upon the films it emulated, as did Lucas' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars</a> (1977). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a> (1984) was entertaining. The series went off the rails with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a> (1989). Almost a parody of the genre, it was dull as dishwater. "Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" continues the descent into self-conscious silliness. There is no suspense, no real emotion of any kind, action scenes aren't remotely credible, Indy survives a nuclear blast in a refrigerator...I could go on. And there is so much conspicuous CGI that I felt like I was watching a cartoon.<br /><br />It's obvious that the filmmakers had a lot of fun making "Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull". It shouldn't be so obvious that the folks on screen are having fun -even when their lives and limbs are supposedly imperiled -while the audience sits bored out of its gourd. The level of self-indulgence from Spielberg & Co. rivals that of Soderbergh & Co. in the last two installments of the "Ocean's" series. There seems to be a conceit that if they're having fun, the audience will have fun watching them have fun. And, in this case, watching them play around with CGI. No writing or credibility necessary. How obnoxious. And Shia LaBeouf is dreadfully miscast.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): There are 2 featurettes on the single disc edition. "The Return of a Legend" (18 min) interviews director Stephen Spielberg, co-writer George Lucas, producer Frank Marshall, writer David Koepp, and the cast about how they came to make another Indiana Jones movie and how the film was conceived. "Pre-Production" (11 min) interviews Pre-Visualization Supervisor Daniel D. Gregoire about the computerized form of storyboarding they used, DP Janusz Kaminski talks about the lighting, Bernie Pollack about costumes, and Shia LeBoeuf about preparing for his role. Subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Heck, even Spielberg and Lucas advised moviegoers to "lower their expectations" before the film came out.  I remember that news article very clearly.  From one standpoint, that could mean that they acknowledge that NO  Indy film could ever live up the the nearly 20 years of pent-up expectation.  But I truly believe they asked us to lower our expectations because they knew they had a cinematic turd on their hands.<br /><br />It was widely reported for years that Spielberg and Ford were opposed to Lucas' vision of a fourth Indy film featuring extraterrestrials.  Other ideas and treatments came and went over the years too, but finally George wore everybody down and masterminded this abomination of a sequel.  I guess Spielberg and Ford realized that the clock was ticking and it was either do it George's way or don't do it at all.<br /><br />Lazy script, stiff and wooden performances, lack of real suspense, ridiculously absurd action set-pieces, lapses in logic..... everything adds up to a high-budget film that was made simply for the point of making it.<br /><br />Add a few Playboy Playmates to it and it could be an Andy Sidaris film.<br /><br />I'm sure the DVD release has some bells and whistles included, but for the sake of all that is cinematically holy, do NOT buy this film.  Rent it if you simply MUST see it once in a while, but don't buy it.  If this DVD release makes a lot of money, it'll just encourage Lucas to make more bad movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single-Disc Edition) is the fourth film in the Indiana Jones franchise and unfortunately it is not nearly as good as the other three previous ones. Try as he might, the magic of Indy is just not there. The storyline is just all-right and the the dialogue so so. The special effects are good but nothing that I have not seen before. Overall an film that is just descent. However, this is just the problem. An Indiana Jones film should be awesome. Still I give it a 3 out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I did enjoy this movie, it had some really good action sequences and exciting scenes, though I can also see why people didn't like it. Part of me wishes that the original trilogy had been left as is, but that did not mean I did not enjoy this film. I would say just keep an open mind and just enjoy the scenery and story even if you do not wish to consider this canon or anything like that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>A return to the Saturday matinee thrills of yesteryear, with Harrison Ford in terrific form and some memorable set-pieces courtesy of director Steven Spielberg. Despite a slow midsection, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (2008) is a more satisfying adventure than "Temple of Doom." Ford manages to hold the film together, but why do producers shove nonentities such as Shia LaBeouf down our throats? Luckily, there is Cate Blanchett's villainy, Ray Winstone's comic relief and Karen Allen's spirited reappearance as Marion Ravenswood. The formula still works and a fourth sequel would be welcome - minus LaBeouf.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I vividly recall seeing the original Raiders on opening night back in 1980 not realizing what a phenomenon it would become. It became a tradition for me to see each of the sequels opening day as well--and when I discovered that Crystal Skull was actually IN production, I remember thinking to myself, "I'm going to LOVE this movie no matter WHAT."<br /><br />Unfortunately, reality has a way of making me swallow my words--but I discovered crow ain't so bad once you get past the feathers...the film, on the other hand, left a LOT to be desired. Now first, let me say that aside from the ending, I really enjoyed this movie a LOT. My initial reaction to seeing Harrison all decked out as Indy was a bit of a shock as I thought, "Holy CRAP he looks old!" But I got over that rather quickly as I became enveloped in the story.<br /><br />I don't CARE how believable the story is, as long as it stays within the Indy-frame of reference of what has gone before and manages to entertain me. For the vast majority of the movie I honestly was on the edge of my seat (as were my 6 & 4 year old sons who count this one of the greatest examples of movie-making in history...). I believe, and I think that I am NOT alone in this, that when it comes to the supernatural that we have come to expect from the Indiana Jones franchise, the success or failure of these movies relies heavily upon the phrase, "Less Is More". HINTING that aliens exist is one thing, it is another to just force it down our throats. Again, other than the outlandish ending which was about as far from what we have come to expect from the three previous films as you can get, I seriously enjoyed Crystal Skull a LOT.<br /><br />The inclusion of Marion was nothing short of genius if you ask me. It was unfortunate that Sean Connery couldn't be convinced to give Henry Jones Sr. another try, but despite that, the story was thoroughly engaging all the same. The atomic blast at the beginning was stretching it by quite a bit, but I found myself entertained even so. Was it even remotely believable? Of course not, but then again, does anyone really believe the Ark opening scene from Raiders could really happen...? Didn't think so. It's a MOVIE for heavens sake--and yet as I realized that hinting at aliens was not going to be enough for George Lucas this time around, I had a feeling that something was going to go terribly wrong. I was right.<br /><br />I also realize that I am not necessarily in the majority here as MANY Indy fans actually LOVED the ending, some of which were rather surprised at how it all unfolded. I felt that it was telegraphed early on, so it wasn't that much of a surprise for me...all the while I was hoping that it wouldn't happen as I feared it would--and DID.<br /><br />In short, 97% of the movie was awesome...the last 5 minutes left a sour taste in my mouth if for NO other reason than I felt that leaving us wondering more about the so-called alien connection would have been much more in keeping with the history of Indiana Jones rather than the bold approach of pulling back the curtain and showing it to us in vivid color. Am I wrong? I guess that depends on your opinion, and as I like to remind everyone: opinions vary. I suppose that the last few minutes bothered me enough to revoke two stars from my review, even though up to that point I was really having a great time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Having a baby takes one out of the movie swing of things, so it took a long time before I was able to finally able to see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. With over 400 reviews at the time of this writing, I'll skip my traditional format of summarizing the movie and just move on to what could have worked and what went horribly, horribly awry.<br /><br />It made perfect sense to place Indy in the 1950s. I appreciated the nods to the 1950s alien invasion genre, which includes everything from Roswell to psychic powers to a rampant fear of Communism.  And the film expertly sets up the 50s, managing to cram in greasers on motorcycles, ice cream shops, Russians, and nuclear bomb tests in the first fifteen minutes.<br /><br />This movie is loaded with fan-service.  There are nods to the other three films, from a fight in the mysterious warehouse at the end of the first movie to Indy starting to speak just like his father ("This is intolerable!") to his fear of snakes. The quicksand scene had me laughing so hard that I was in tears.  But somewhere along the line, Spielberg and Lucas lost sight of the purpose of the film.  It transformed from making a thrilling adventure to a "one last act for Ford, Spielberg, and Lucas."<br /><br />I blame the majority of Crystal Skull's foibles on good old Professor "Ox" Oxley (John Hurt). He is a raving madman who has already made it through all the traps leading up to the crystal skull's resting place, so it's not particularly exciting to have Indy decipher his mad ramblings or retrace his steps. This is an Indy adventure in reverse - Indy HAS the object and he's trying to put it BACK. Which isn't all that exciting.<br /><br />The villains just aren't all that villainous.  Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) is a caricature of a Russian that's not all that scary.  Her claim to fame appears to be that she carries a sword (how quaint!). The master plan seems to be vaguely along the lines of "we're going to capture this artifact we don't understand and use it to conquer the world!" It's not even clear the Russians would know what to do with the skull, much less put it to nefarious use. The Australian turncoat is both obviously a turncoat and barely comprehensible. And don't get me started on the bug-squishing scenes that involving ant-ichor splashing on the camera...not once, but TWICE.<br /><br />Mutt (Shia LeBouf) is a cardboard personality - it took me a second to realize that he never actually cries on cue (the camera whips over to him already misty with tears...twice), filled with angst over Ox, the guy we've never heard of. Mutt appears, with a wink and a nod, to be Indy's successor, but it's a heavy-handed portrayal: Mutt doesn't read but he's worldly! Mutt knows fencing but practices with a knife (that he never uses)! Mutt can ride a motorcycle and calls Indy "old man"! See Mutt swing from a vine and...<br /><br />I saw this one coming when Mutt got separated from the rest of the group during a fight chase. I prayed: "Dear Lucas, please, please, PLEASE do not have Mutt swing from vines." Then the animated monkeys show up, in much the same way animated gophers showed up in the beginning of the film and threatened to turn Crystal Skull into a nuclear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J07O">Caddyshack</a>. I prayed again.  "Please, please, please, don't have the monkeys swing along with Mutt and help him attack the Russians.  Please, please, please..." Then the monkeys attack. Ever see the Simpsons episode, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FO0AME">In Marge We Trust</a>," where Reverend Lovejoy fights off the baboons?  It's like that.<br /><br />In the "making of" docs, Spielberg dismisses using the Nazis as villains out of hand.  And yet he went with an off-the-wall sci-fi theme that Lucas struggles to make Indy-esque.  They could have easily included <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892062097">Nazis, UFOs, aliens, and arctic bases</a> in one neat, conspiracy-laden package.  Instead, two movie-making giants took a weak premise and turned it into an opportunity for nostalgia. It's like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P0XBO">Ocean's Twelve</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1V5VU">13</a>...you get the impression the cast is more interested in working than in making the movie work.<br /><br />Crystal Skull isn't the worst movie ever.  But as a final chapter in the Indiana Jones canon, it's more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Temple of Doom</a> than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Last Crusade</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>After nineteen years since he rode off into the sunset, the James Bond of archeology returns in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." And overall, the wait was worth it. The film once again includes the wit, humor and excitement fans have come to love. Where the film's weakness lies is in the last forty minutes, which features some truly outlandish moments.<br />The film's weaknesses are made up for by a terrific cast. Harrison Ford still embodies the role of Indy, and adds some great emotional impact as he discusses the passage of time. Karen Allen is again fantastic as Marion Ravenwood, while Shia LaBeouf is really good as Mutt Williams. Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent and John Hurt give great supporting performances. The visual effects, action sequences and exotic locales are all impressive.<br />Overall, this is a welcomed return to the world of Indiana Jones. While it does feature some truly bizarre moments, fans will find much to enjoy in this film.<br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>It all started with the first film,<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F21K66">Raiders of the Lost Ark - Full screen Version (1981)</a> (1981).<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition)</a> (1984) (actually a prequel)<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)</a> (1989)<br /><br />Followed by the tv series, Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1992-93, 94-96)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDVE">The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones, Volume One - The Early Years</a> (1992-93).<br />  Harrison Ford returned as "Indiana Jones" (at age 50) in the episode, "Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues" (1993-tv).<br /><br />  It has been 19 years since the Last Crusade and finally a new "Indiana Jones" Adventure is made, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).<br />  Harrison Ford is in great physical form as "Indiana Jones" and the action and adventure is all here.<br />  Karen Allen returns as "Marion Ravenwood" from her role in the first film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F21K66">Raiders of the Lost Ark - Fullscreen Version (1981)</a> (1981).<br />  There are no appearances of anyone else in previous films, except for a photograph.<br />  The Cemetery Warriors are played by Nito Larioza and Ernie Reyes Jr. You may remember Ernie Reyes Jr. from his brief tv series, Sidekicks (1986-87).<br />  Ke Huy Quan (now Jonathan Ke Quan), "Short Round", is now a martial artist--stunt coordinator, but not in this film.<br />  Originally it was planned for him, Kate Capshaw and John Rhys-Davies to make an appearanc at the wedding, but I guess it didn't happen.<br />  Sean Connery turned down his chance to do a couple scenes in the film favoring retirement instead.

For the long awaited fourth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg bring the aging action hero back to life, older and worn but still finding himself at the center of amazing archeologicial adventures.<br /><br />  After a run-in with Russian baddie, Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett (a deliciously wicked villainess, by the way!) and drawing the attention of the FBI, Jones is forced into a leave of absence from his professorship at the university.  Before he can get out of town, however, a young man named Mutt Williams, (played by Hollywood's current "IT" boy, Shia LeBouf, in full-on Marlon Brando/James Dean mode) convinces the doctor to take a look at the case of a crystal skull, an artifact believed to be part of the Amazonian legend of the mysterious city of gold---in fact, a key to finding the well hidden city.  With a mutual friend, Oxley, in jeopardy as well as Mutt's mom in peril, the two adventurers set off for Peru to find Oxley's whereabouts and search for the crystal skull.  Of course, the Russians, led by Irina, are not far behind, racing neck and neck, as one would expect, in order to find the artifact and the city's mysteries and treasures.<br /><br />  Indy 4 is a fun ride, a nostalgic return for many of us to the days of our youth.  This addition to the franchise is entertaining, full of great CGI effects and give us both familiar and new characters, welcomed additions to the Indy universe.  All the essential elements are there for an Indiana Jones film---nail-biting chase sequences, the inevitable Indy snake scene, a little romance and some great one liners!  Although I enjoyed the movie, I will say there was something lacking from the film that I found so pleasing in the earlier films.  I'm not sure what it is, to be honest, but there was just a missing spark that left me not quite satisified.  Nonetheless, it is a worthy addition to a summer movie season that seems to be brimming with more hits than misses---and for that, I am grateful!<br /><br />  Harrison Ford does well as the older Indy and falls into his role with apparent ease.  Cate Blanchett with her tidy bob haircut and pale skin is an icy and ambitious foe, a worthy adversary for Indy and Co.  Mutt is an interesting new addition to the cast though a certain revelation about him midway through the film can be seen a mile away.  And, the return of Miriam (Kate Allen), the hard drinking, acid-tongued heroine of the film that started it all, takes the fans full circle. Jim Broadbent and John Hurt, both fine actors, figure into the story, though Broadbent to a lesser degree.<br /><br />  The ending sets the stage for a possible new chapter in the Indy chronicles with Mutt, perhaps, as the heir to Indiana's adventurous ways. I'm sure we haven't seen the last of Dr. Jones, and with this weekend's huge talley (something like 126 million not counting the actual Memorial Day take) it is likely in a few years we'll be watching a fifth installment...and I doubt you'll get few complaints about that!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>After twenty seven years since the Raiders of the Last Ark introduced the  archeologist and adventurer Henry "Indiana" Jones who divides his time between teaching the University students in a quiet auditorium and saving the world in the incredible dangerous and breathtaking adventures, and after nineteen years since his quest for Holy Grail in the Last Crusade, Indiana Jones is back - with his fedora, leather jacket, whip, grin, fear for snakes, and the new big adventure, spectacular, fast-paced, silly, funny, and  jaw-dropping at the same time. Believe it or not, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is the first IJ movie that I've seen at the theater. They were not released in the former USSR (that's probably why, Spielberg and Lucas made their bad guys Russians this time:)) and I saw the trilogy first in the end of the 1980s when the videotapes became available. The new movie is full of adventures, has not one but three fallings down of waterfalls and the huge attacking red ants. As in all Indy movies, there is a long and spectacular signature chase sequence, this time a multi-vehicle chase through the jungle with the heroes jumping on the full speed from one car to another, two characters engaged in the sword fight standing on the parallel moving jeeps, the Crystal Scull of the title falling back and forth from the good guys to the bad ones. The "baddest guy" here is the girl played by Cate Blanchette wearing the uniform not unlike Dr. Evil's and the black wig a-la Louise Brooks of "Pandora's Box" or Uma Thurman of "Pulp Fiction". She plays a Russian villainess, Dr. Irina Spalko, the lead researcher of psychic phenomenon and the supernatural.  Blanchette is as good as ever proving that she can play successfully any role, including the one that requires a lot of physical actions. The fourth movie takes place in the different time than the first three, and it is set against the realities of the 50s: the beginning of cold war, the double agents, the talks about UFOs and aliens. One of the scenes, as remarkable as it is memorable, depicts a ground-level nuclear test in Nevada on the picturesque town that was built only to be destroyed after the drop of atomic bomb.<br /><br />The movie is beautiful - no surprise here, Janusz Kaminski, usual Spielberg's "partner in crime" was DOP for it. I just realized that it was the first Indiana Jones movie for Kaminski - the first three were shot by David Slocombe. I liked the story and the acting by Ford. At 65, he is perhaps one of very few actors who could bring back to life beloved character and the years would not have power over him. I like a lot John Hurt as Professor 'Ox' Oxley - equally comical and moving as the scientist who was able to talk to the mysterious Crystal Skull and who kept the keys to its secrets. I am always glad to see Ray Winstone and Jim Broadbent on the screen. No matter what nay-sayers think of it, I like the latest Indiana Jones movie and I was glad to see that "for an old guy", Dr. Jones is still good in a fight.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>Young viewers might find plenty to like in this fast paced, decidedly family friendly affair, but older viewers who know the original films will find the latest installment is missing something essentially 'Indy'.<br /><br />The elements that made Indy so great, the snappy lines, the hunt for artifacts, the ceaseless chasing, are still intact but often seem forced, as if they were added just to make an otherwise stock action film fit the Indie brand. Ford still delivers the goods as Indiana Jones but the new additions to the marquee, including sidekick Labeuof and villain Blanchett, are relatively uninteresting, and the plot gets a tad too convoluted for its own good.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes hint at the possibility of greatness, but sadly the remaining hour or so is mostly mediocre. Perhaps the film was butchered in editing, or maybe Lucas tried to cram too much in from the start, but somewhere along the lines Crystal Skulls lost its charm.<br /><br />While it's good to see Indy dust off his hat for one last globe spanning adventure, I wish the film had been handled with more skill. It entertains for 2 hours but is ultimately forgettable and for the franchise, that's a shame. Somehow I doubt we'll see Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in the same sentence with 'classic' 15 years from now.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>After three weeks I finally went out and saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. One of the first things that I noticed is that the theater is still full, even with the release this weekend of The Incredible Hulk [Theatrical Release]. One other thing that I noticed is that the 15-20 minutes of pre-show commercials have gotten more annoying than ever. I mean, how many times to I have to be pounded with Verizon ads, over and over again? Ugh!<br /><br />But on to the movie. This fourth Indiana Jones effort takes our hero forward 20 years, into 1957. Instead of Nazi's he's now battling Communists. Seriously, what would Indiana do if he didn't have an evil empire to fight with. The attempt here by the film makers is to go back to the original formula of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009Q98M">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Widescreen Edition) [Region 2</a>], something that was missing in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7OMZ2">Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom - Widescreen Version (1984)</a> and only partially there in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7OPCC">Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade - Widescreen Edition</a>. We are back to the "serial" format, where every 10 minutes he's put into an impossible situation only to get himself out again.<br /><br />There are many things to like here. Harrison Ford not only plays a great "older" Jones but seems to actually embrace it. The return of Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood (now Williams) was better than I expected. Still tough and very much the equal of Jones when it comes to wit. Shia Labeouf plays Marion's son and does a more than credible job. Cate Blanchett and John Hurt both tend to steal scenes and are wonderful additions.<br /><br />But, there are also things here that are not so great. The plot, while starting off well, begins to get a bit hokey. Some of the action sequences have strayed from the unbelievable to the ludicrous. And the resolution of it all almost became silly. Not quite, but almost.<br /><br />Still, overall it was a great escape into two hours of sheer fun. And the final scene with Indy and Marion left open the possibility of another Indiana Jones movie, but with a different hero. Could be interesting!</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>After seeing the seemingly endless trailers on TV, I suspected this film was going to be awful, but I had to see it because I enjoyed the others so much.  Well it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be and I did enjoy this one, but it really didn't come close to the others so I only gave it three stars -- sort of a gift for previous efforts.  I felt that they took ideas and incidents from the previous films, warmed them over, and pasted them together rather than coming up with a new idea.  The result is constant motion, constant action, unbelievable escapes,some of the worst marksmanship I have ever seen, and all of this punctuated by some dialog -- errr-- acting.  The entire film from start to finish was highly predictable, right down to the unfriendly natives, and the shocking realization about the kid.  However, I did enjoy the give and take between Ford and Allen and they contributed the only acting in the film.  But -- this is truly a comic book and realism shouldn't be expected or anticipated.<br /><br />The villains are led by a Russian Villainess -- of sorts -- sort of the Cat Woman in disguise. This character could have definitely used some remedial screen writing and the sword was cheesy right from the start.  As soon as you heard Mutt say he took fencing you knew the sword fight was coming -- foreshadowing at the sophomore level.  Still it was fun even if it wasn't surprising and none of these villains ever seemed very threatening or evil.<br /><br />Crystal skulls do exist and whether there are aliens from Roswell is unknown but connecting these two seemed a little bit of a stretch even for a comic book type movie. I think they could have found a better vehicle than aliens and flying saucers but maybe this is a salute to all of those 1950's sci-fi flicks.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and it was fun to watch, but as a professional endeavor it ranks right up there with the Star wars Prequels- disappointing.  The actors did a good job with a very poor screen play.  Unless the screenwriters can return to their previous quality I would say let this be the last Indiana Jones Adventure.  By all means see the movie, you'll enjoy it, but you'll see why I was disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>Well it's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, but Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is still better then The Temple of Doom and will stand proud with its predecessors as a solid action flick living up to an American icon. This long awaited final chapter to the story of treasure hunter Harry "Indiana" Jones Jr. may not live up to the greatness which were the first and third entries, but don't let a simple comparison ruin the fun of this fourth movie; on its own merits it still stands well enough on its own two feet, even if it isn't a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film starts off with a convoy of troops driving down a large road in Nevada while a gang of kids trail behind. The convoy pulls into a military base which is closed for a military test, but little do the guards know that these are actually Soviet KGB agents come to steal the treasures of some old military warehouse, the same one we saw the Ark go into at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indi is in the trunk of the car. Oh no, what kind of trouble has our hero gotten himself into this time? On the hanger doors of the building a large 51 is painted in black letters. Surly this couldn't be the infamous area 51. Or could it?<br /><br />Okay, I'll stop right there so not to give away too much of the films premise, but as I said in the title this is a VERY different movie then the kind we're used to seeing for Indiana Jones. Gone are the Nazis and biblical artifacts, here come the Russians and the cold war. One of the things I found very entertaining about this film was the harkening back to the 50's, the cold war red scares, the double agents, the talks of aliens and such, very much like the old films from that time. It really brings to light that this is a different time period then the previous films, this is the beginning of the cold war, and darn it we're going to have some cold war fun. From jet engines, to demonstrators marching down the street with signs saying "better dead then red," this movie really pokes fun at all the scares and worries of that time period. We even get to see the detonation of an atomic bomb in one hilarious sequence of events which involve Indiana climbing into a refrigerator. I'm telling you that is one of the greatest scenes in any Indi film ever.<br /><br />Now I know what's on everyone's minds, you want to know if Harrison Ford can still pull off his old jump around and whip people routine. Well I'll let you know that, no, there isn't as much action in this film as there is in some of the older ones but what action did make its way into this film is quality stuff. No worries here my friend, Ford is still as good as he was in his prime. Fortunately Ford doesn't have to do all the work in this film, he has some help from Mutt, a new character who ------------ oh, sorry about that, I forgot, you all don't like spoilers. Okay, fine.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure they wrote his part into the film not because it would make it more interesting (although it does) or that it would deepen the plot (but it still does), I have the sneaky suspicion that he was put in to take the strain off of Fords back. Well no problem because Shia LaBeouf can pull off the action hero pretty well. I've never liked him very much, but here his performance was right on Q, giving us a LOT of comic relief and a healthy dose of action. Oh yeah, the action; well its solid. Three words for you buddy, REALLY BIG ANTS!!! Remember the scene in Raiders where that Nazi got chopped up in the airplane blades? Well this scene is a combination of that and that one scene in the first Mummy movie where the guy got eaten by bugs, only it's a Soviet getting killed and their in the Amazon, not Egypt. From Ford jumping back and forth on moving cars, to LaBeouf showing off his best Tarzan impersonation, the action leaves little to be desired.<br /><br />So how about negatives? Well, as I said, it's strange, maybe a little too strange for its own good. Why not stick to what we know? I hear Lucas wanted to do something even stranger then this but Spielberg and Ford had to talked him out of it, and at this point I'm really glad they did because there is no telling what he would have done had no one gad been there to knock some sense into him. Maybe that's why his new Star Wars movies were so bad. I know it's an Indiana Jones movie and I have to suspend my belief if I'm going to enjoy it, but please, don't push it. There are also a few inconsistencies in the plot, some characters who are less then believable, and maybe one too many "look at this really cool special effect" type shots, but I'll leave that judgment up to you.<br /><br />So for all you die hard fans wondering if this new entry will live up to expectations, just go in expecting something slightly better then Temple of Doom but maybe not as good as the two other films and you'll be alright. For everyone else, just sit back and enjoy. This is, after all, an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />Replay value; High.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I'm just not understanding all the bagging being done on INDIANA JONES & THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.  Look, I realize following 'The Last Crusade' is a tall order--even almost 20 years later.  And Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are definitely showing some mileage, but they still deliver their roles (especially Ford; no other sixtysomething actor could have pulled it off).  The one word I associate with the Indiana Jones franchise is Fun.  The first three were grand fun.  And so is this fourth installment, where this time, instead of the menacing Nazis, the villains are Soviet operatives, led by Comrade Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, sporting a coal black bob and heavy Russian accent, is priceless), racing Indiana into the Peruvian wilderness to find a treasure of gold that has extraterrestrial ramifications.<br /><br />And like all the predecessors, CRYSTALL SKULL is grand, seat squirming fun, from surviving an atomic blast to evading some nasty ants with serious attitudes.  And throughout, Ford is vintage Indiana Jones, escaping peril after peril with a smug quip at the ready.  With Indiana, humility is always right around the corner, and that's certainly the case with this fourth installment.  Other noteworthy roles are turned in by Ray Winstone and John Hurt; the weak link (as in all his films) is ghoulish Shia LaBeouf, playing young Mutt, a faux rebel who soon learns an extraordinary (yet not surprising) secret.  When LaBeouf makes his entrance riding a motorcycle and sporting a police cap ala Marlon Brando, I was doing some serious eye-rolling.  Yet even his inherent floundering takes little away from my enjoyment of this film.  INDIANA JONES & THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL may be far removed chronologically from the first three installments, but it more than holds its own being worthy to join this illustrious franchise.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>After "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (1989), the second sequel in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" franchise, there was talk among producer George Lucas, director Steven Spielberg, and star Harrison Ford about making yet another chapter in the exciting exploits of the archaeologist/adventurer.  Ideas were bandied about, various writers were hired to pen treatments, casting was discussed, schedules had to be considered, and ultimately the project was postponed -- indefinitely, it seemed.  Apparently, it took 18 years before the three principal filmmakers could agree on a story and get it made.<br /> "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," a title that would have given heart attacks to the guys who put titles on marquees in the days when every movie theatre had one, offers plenty of action, a reunion with a character from the first film, a brand new sidekick, and enough exposition to fill a doctoral thesis.<br /> It is 1957, the height of the Cold War, so the Russians are trotted out after a long rest on the shelf of handy movie villains.  Indiana is kidnapped by a team of Soviets headed by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) so he can lead them to an ancient artifact -- a crystal skull believed to possess supernatural powers, just the thing to give Russia the edge over the capitalist West.  Essentially, the movie is a football match -- sometimes quite literally -- as chases, fights, derring-do, aggressive soldier ants, monkeys, and an agent who keeps changing his loyalty conspire to keep possession of the treasured skull in a state of uncertainty.<br /> Director Alfred Hitchcock always used what he called a McGuffin in his movies -- a device that exists just to set the dramatic forces in motion:  the stolen $40,000 in "Psycho," government secrets on microfilm in "North By Northwest," the chance meeting of a tennis star and a mild-mannered looney in "Strangers on a Train."  In "Crystal Skull," director Spielberg ladles out loads of chatter about the McGuffin -- the skull's history, its mystical associations, its power over mortal man. Meanwhile, the audience is impatient and eager to get on with the story -- how is Indie going to retrieve the skull and extricate himself from one perilous situation after another?<br /> It's great to see Harrison Ford back in fine form in one of his two signature screen roles (the other, Han Solo in the "Star Wars" films).  The script has some self-deprecating bits of humor revolving around Ford's age (he's 66), but they're clever and not overdone.  Assisted by countless stunt teams, Ford makes his way graciously through the action scenes, particularly a wonderful motorcycle chase across a college campus.  John Williams' terrific Indiana theme is present throughout, making the action stuff all the more thrilling and bringing back memories of the first film.<br /> Indiana is approached by a Marlon Brando/greaser wannabe named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf, "Disturbia," "Transformers") who wants help in locating his mother.  She turns out to be Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) from the first Indiana Jones movie, "Raiders of the Lost Ark," and she's as feisty and spunky as ever.  Mutt has a chip on his shoulder the size of a telephone pole, a short fuse, and a pocket comb he likes to moisten in other people's Cokes and run through his 50's pompadour.  There's some good chemistry between Ford and LaBeouf, who share many scenes in the film.  There's also a neat bit of repartee going on, even when the going gets tough.<br /> Ms. Allen appears about halfway through the film and perks things up considerably, especially in a scene in which -- as captives of the bad guys -- Marion and Indie bicker, recriminate, and blame even as their lives appear in serious danger.<br /> Ms. Blanchett has fun with her role as the humorless but agile Russian comrade, as efficient with a 50-millimeter machine gun as she is with a sword.  There is a lot of comic-book villainess in her Spalko, but that is OK considering the tone of the movie.  She certainly adds stature to the picture, mostly from her body of work. Here, after all, is Elizabeth I chasing Indiana and an elongated skull in an armored truck through the jungle.<br /> For all its fun, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" lacks the overall impact of the earlier films.  Spielberg is known for creating wonderfully visual scenes in his films.  Think of "Jaws," Jurassic Park," and "E.T."  These are movies in which the story is told largely through a series of carefully crafted images with a minimum of dialogue:  the shark attacking a lone swimmer; the Tyrannosaurus Rex stamping the car into the mud; Elliott and friends escaping the police roadblock on their bicycles by soaring into the sky.  In "Crystal Skull," the director plunks in too many static sequences of characters standing around spouting exposition we don't really care about.  Spielberg has set a high standard for himself and other directors.  I'm just sorry this is not Spielberg at the top of his form.<br /> Rated PG-13 for a few scary images, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" has family appeal, is geared to attract a wide age range, and offers a neat roller coaster ride.  Only don't expect the Cyclone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull is a fun movie and that's about all. A 4th film was rumored since 1997 but they couldn't agree on a script they liked. If this was the best script of them all, then I'm scared on how bad the others were. But still there's a lot less to whine about than there was with episode 1. This movie is never dull like that was. It's goofy and cartoonish though. But I didn't have a problem with that since the others have had their share of unbelieveable moments. Like Indy using a raft as a parachute and landing on to a river of all places in Temple of Doom for instance.<br /><br />  The action alone really isn't the only goofy thing about this one though. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress but I stopped taking her villain Russian character seriously after she tries to read Indy's mind with the palm of her hand. Shia LaBeof befriending monkeys the second he sees them and swinging on vines with them wasn't needed as well. But still, people shouldn't whine so much. I'm just happy to finally see Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones again. I mean all the reviews here that say stuff like Spielberg and Lucas let me down again just make me wanna puke. I mean when Lucas is coming up with the story you should know that you shouldn't be too excited any more. The Star Wars Prequels are examples of that. His imagination has gone to a galaxy far far away.<br /><br />  The movie still managed to make me feel like a kid again though. No matter how goofy the action got I was still entertained. Ford is at least in good form as Indiana despite his age. He also has some fine chemestry with Shia LaBeouf (Transformers). They almost make as good of a team as Ford did with Sean Connery. It's also nice to finally see Karen Allen's character reintroduced as well. While Ray Winstone (The Departed) and John Hurt (Hellboy) are fun in supporting roles. The movie wasn't perfect like I said but I still left with a smile and so should other fans. They should just be happy that the movie was finally made and it could have been worse. Like, Indy could've had a new sidekick called Jar-Jar Binks for instance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Before getting to the theater to watch this new installment of Indiana Jones I watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to help get me in the mood.  I was reminded what a wonderful movie and franchise Indiana Jones was.  And then I went to see this fourth installment.<br /><br />There is no way this could be a bad movie.  Again, it stems from a wonderful franchise and has some of the most leading names in the industry behind it (Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Lucasfilm, Steven Spielberg, Shia LaBeouf, and David Koepp).  How could this go wrong?<br /><br />The fact that it did baffles me.  I understand that Indiana movies are supposed to be fun, but this movie got a little bit too fun.  Being a little over the top is okay, but the extremes that this movie took were too much for me.  For instance, and I only mention this because it is right at the beginning of the movie, a man cannot be blown away several miles within a refrigerator, drop, roll a few hundred yards for good measure, and then get out and dust himself off.  And if something this implausible happened once or twice throughout the movie I think I could be okay with it but something like this happened every ten minutes.<br /><br />I wouldn't be so upset about this but the rest of the franchise isn't like this.  Indiana Jones wasn't quite so immortal.  The storyline was never this predictable.  The plot was never so thin.  You would think that after twenty years that something wonderful would be created.  I'm extremely disappointed.<br /><br />And some of the changes... changing from Nazis to Cold War Soviets as the enemy was a needed change.  Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones is now 20 years older so if Nazis were still around there would be a lot of explaining to do.  But the fact that Indiana Jones now goes by Henry irked me extremely.  Indiana's name has ALWAYS been Henry but he has ALWAYS gone by the name Indiana.  There was no reason to change it so friends called him Henry only because Sean Connery mentioned it was his real name as the end of the third movie.  And somewhere along the line Indiana Jones became a Colonel.  What is that all about?  Also, they couldn't pull Sean Connery out of retirement to do this movie.  That's too bad, but I can understand Sean wanting to remain in retirement.  But how about a two minute cameo like he did in Robin Hood?  How about at least leaving the door open to future cameos if they start making more Indiana movies?  No, instead they have him killed off.  Just closed that door.<br /><br />There were some good things about this, however.  Harrison Ford could not have done any better in his reprisal of Indiana Jones.  He flowed back into the role like he had been playing it for the last twenty years.  Harrison Ford is one of this and last generation's greatest actors and this movie reminds us why this is.  Shia LaBeouf's star keeps rising and I, for the most part, enjoyed his role in this movie.  There were some light-hearted funny moments and hearing the Indiana Jones score by John Williams on the big screen filled me with a flood of memories.<br /><br />Despite the two-star rating, I'd advise seeing it at least once if you are an Indiana Jones fan.  If this were a regular movie I would have given it three stars but I docked it a star for its lost potential.  It really should have been soooooo much more than it turned out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Maybe I'm getting too lenient or forgiving in my old age, but I thought "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" was a pretty good time.  Some famous movie figure (I forget who) defined a good movie as one that had three good scenes and no bad ones.  Well, this movie has at least four or five good scenes (sequences, actually), and nothing bad.<br /><br />And the characters and their interactions actually move beyond just being fun and into genuinely memorable territory a time or two, as well.  A favorite moment was when Jim Broadbent's college dean character comments to Indy, during a conversation about the recent losses of Indy's dad and their friend Marcus, that everyone eventually reaches a point where "life stops giving you things and starts taking them away."  That's a sad, resonant line worthy of Hollywood's serious fall dramas.<br /><br />But, yes, this is an action movie primarily, and the action is very good... and it's aided by the most lavish, polished effects of the series.  Likewise the villains, the sense of mystery, Indy's cocky yet "am I sure I know what I'm doing?" attitude with the characters around him, all of it works.<br /><br />Somewhat annoyingly, Paramount, Lucasfilm or whoever is making fans choose between a bare-bones DVD of the film or a two-disc set with all kinds of special features.  I found the latter a bit pricey, so I bought the single-disc version.  However, even here I was able to enjoy a nice little mini-doc (about 17 minutes) about how the new film came to be and a short pre-production piece (about 9 minutes) about the actors' preparations prior to filming.  And that was actually perfect for me, as I enjoy special features on a DVD, but don't like when it gets to be a "tail wagging the dog" situation... you know, where a two-hour movie is accompanied by seven or eight hours of special features.  Maybe in some cases that's good (if the film is a timeless classic or if you're just a huge, huge fan of a certain movie), but mostly I think the film itself should be the centerpiece of its DVD version.<br /><br />Anyway, ignore the nitpickers and pick up this new Indiana Jones adventure (in whatever version suits you).  I can't imagine anyone who enjoyed the other movies in this series not liking this one, too, at least a little.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Although able to spark a significant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE">Indiana Jones</a> sense of nostalgia, and add a possible newcomer to the ranks of what might be future Indiana Jones films, there's not much else to Spielberg's latest adventure film ...except an ending that harkens back to the not-so-good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP">Artificial Intelligence</a> film.<br /><br />Understandably Spielberg was waiting for the perfect script, but Harrison Ford wasn't getting any younger, so it is my assumption that Spielberg took the leap and decided to direct a so-so film rather than let Ford's character forever fall into obscurity. The film itself isn't necessarily so-so, but the concept and ending are not, shall we say, in keeping with the Indiana Jones film mentality.<br /><br />Although I'm no Harrison Ford fan, I did enjoy his early work on such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBMWG4">Blade Runner</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322737X">American Graffiti</a>. His later work became mundane and unexceptional, myself only being able to see Harrison Ford playing Harrison Ford and not the character(s) I was supposed to see. But the Indian Jones series was an entirely different ball-game. Funny. Action-packed. Historically ...strange. And just fun to watch. These are the things that make for entertaining cinema. And although this fourth installment in the Indiana Jones films carries many of those items, it does not carry it all the way to its newfound ending.<br /><br />And speaking of newfound, Shia LaBeouf (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB489I">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a>) as Mutt Williams, Indiana's spawn and possible successor, was a very good idea. He's cocky, strangely funny, and enough not like Indy to make the character believable. The sword fights on top of careening cars as they travel through the jungle and disrupt his testicular fortitude were just the right amount of zany action and ridiculous comedy that needed infusing into the story.<br /><br />Nostalgic-wise, the incorporation of Indiana and his love for his hat are immediately taken to heart as we witness him being ripped from the trunk of a car by communists, the main one being Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067DNF">The Lord of the Rings</a>), a sword-carrying and tough spy in the likes of actor Paul Freeman who played Rene Belloq in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">The Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>. Most Indy fans will also be very happy to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion, Indiana Jones' love interest from the first film. Although the years show heavily on Mrs. Allen, she's still spunky enough to give a fine performance.<br /><br />Lovers of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016GLZW4">original score</a> will also be happy how it was folded into this latest release, portions of the music being liberally sprinkled throughout the story. The filming used for Indiana Jones 4 did not use digital cameras, so the original style can also be seen and felt by the viewing audience.<br /><br />Where the story begins to crumble, however, is in the storyline that reuses old themes from the Raiders film (anyone who looks at or knows what they shouldn't is wiped off the planet), and adds Spielberg's heavy-handed sense of science fiction that helped destroy the end of the aforementioned Artificial Intelligence movie ("It's a portal to another realm!") The crystal skull(s) also just seemed like a key to a puzzle that easily could've been solved by anyone, not just the supposedly adept Jones (and his new prodigy). Which makes the "alien" ending seem all the more ludicrous.<br /><br />My assumption is that Hollywood and Spielberg himself think that audiences need something bigger, better, and more spectacular than the last. That's not necessarily true, especially when dealing with nostalgic cinema the likes of Indiana Jones. Audiences will come because they want that old timey feel, not something bigger, better, and more "alien" than before.<br /><br />Regardless of this film's failings, it is entertaining. The action is practically nonstop throughout its 124 minute length, making it seem shorter than it actually was. That's something, I guess.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>I have to admit that I was surprised that Ford would reprise his role as Indiana Jones.  Heck, I didn't even know there had been talks of making another Indiana Jones.  So, this was a surprise for me.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull dealt with a particular topic that I would have never guess that Indiana would explore.  I guess it only makes sense with him being an archeologist/adventurer as well with the time frame.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and his band of friends race against the Soviet agents to acquire the crystal skull that is believed to be originated from the Mayans.  The lead Soviet agent believes the crystal skull holds psychic powers.  Indiana fights to save the crystal skull from falling into the wrong hands.  However, his attempts are deflected as he faces capture, betrayal, chases, shoot-outs and, of course, surprising revelations.  Ah, the good ol' Indy movies!<br /><br />Despite some erroneous facts, such as the siafu ants, and some not quite-up-to-par stunt works, Indy remains capable of capturing my attention throughout.  I'd see it again!</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>What can I really say?  Being that it is popular to hate on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, giving a positive review almost sets me up for accusations of my "inferior intelligence" and that I am "easily entertained."  Well, I'll tell you this much, I am neither, and yet I found Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be an incredibly entertaining experience and leaving the theater I had no idea people would be treating like one of THOSE movies; one of the ones people just love to rant and rave about without end.  This film is light years ahead of the first two Star Wars prequels and easily better than those dreadful Transformers movies that have been making so much money lately.<br /><br />Okay, to start off this movie is clearly the lesser of the Indy films, but I feel lots of people have been overly harsh on this movie for not living up to its older siblings.  The greatest action-adventure film trilogy of all time is one hard act to follow, and so Spielberg and Lucas clearly wanted to try something different.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what many audiences hated most about this Indy: too different from the originals.  It is flawed, but I never felt this movie came from greed.  It was the nostalgia, and recollections of two friends, who only wished to recreate the entertainment of their youth, and that fun factor was present throughout Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, in the end I do think the good aspects of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull easily outweigh the bad.<br /><br />For starters, Indiana Jones as played by Harrison Ford...do I really need to say anything else?  This is the best action hero to ever grace the silver screen and no one will ever crack a bullwhip the same.  I really don't think I should have to defend this character, or explain what makes him great.  Welcome back Mister Jones.  In an age of giant robots dominating the box office I welcome your return with open arms.<br /><br />Also back all the way from Raiders of the Lost Ark is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, who is sorely underused in the film's plot.  I'm fine with bringing back one of Indy's previous love interests, but she really doesn't contribute much to the plot.  She drives some cars during the jungle chase scene and aside from that is nothing but an extra face in the cast.  If they were going to bring back Indy's original love interest they should have given her more to do.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett's Irina Spalko is, in my humble opinion, the best antagonist in an Indy film since Major Arnold Toht (the Nazi in the all-black get-up in Raiders, for those of you who don't know his name).  Here is a female villain whose tone is cool, precise, yet can slip into vicious blood lust when the situation becomes violent, and Blanchett nails it.  This is a huge step up from the femme fatale of Last Crusade, and I appreciate how Blanchett's gender is not overly sexualized for the benefit of enticing male audiences.  She wears a crisp uniform that doesn't highlight her sex, and is quick to draw a rapier when she needs her captives to comply.  Never does she flirt with Indy, nor does she waste much time in classic villain mistakes such as rambling about her plans.  This is a serious female character that is treated seriously by the script, and Spielberg's direction, which cannot be said for 95% of Hollywood's attempts at female villains.  I think this character is one of the most sorely overlooked aspects of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />And this brings me to a character many have criticized the film for...Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams, a 1950s greaser who drives a motorcycle, wears a leather jacket, talks smack, and is quick to draw a switchblade.  Now, let me get this straight:  I hate, and I do mean HATE most of the work of Shia LaBeouf.  He has had roles where I've liked him (Holes) but for the most part he's one of the most annoying male actors I've ever seen.  Almost every role he's ever had he spends panicking, overacting, and stammering like a madman and it is enough to make the ears bleed!  The Transformers movies alone almost made me want to smack the annoying twerp upside the head with a mallet, if only to momentarily shut him up...luckily for Shia, and to the surprise of those who may be reading this: I actually liked his performance in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  In fact, I honestly forgot at times he was the actor playing Mutt.  It's a nice performance, that really did combine honest character acting with a bit of camp that poked fun of 1950s teenage culture, and I really do think he gave perhaps the best performance of his career thus far (not saying too much, but hey: when Transformers is the alternative, this is a huge improvement).<br /><br />No, instead of Shia, the most annoying character in the film is Mac (Ray Winstone), Indy's traitorous former colleague.  Above all the nitpicks such as the refrigerator, and CGI, that so many fans complain about, this is the one aspect of the movie that annoys me above all other errors.  Winstone plays the part well enough, but the scripting is horrible.  He betrays Indy multiple times in the movie, and yet Indy trusts him whenever he comes up with some weak story to explain how he's been on Indy's side the whole time...only to betray him again five minutes later.  Once or twice I might have let this slide, but by the third time it made me want to scream "COME ON, INDIANA!"  Indy in the old films would have never made this mistake three times.<br /><br />I think the film has some really great action, and set pieces, but there are some moments that really make it clear why so many people hate this film.  CGI gophers, a dreadful vine swinging sequence (I get it's a homage to Tarzan, but what makes me draw the line on "Based on serials" as an excuse for the movie's actions, this still a poorly  thought out idea that could have easily been cut), and of course the refrigerator (in all fairness, my reaction to this moment was the same as when Indy survived the raft in Temple of Doom), but quite frankly...when have the Indiana Jones films made much sense?  Despite the amazing intro, and one of the best final actions sequences in movie history, Temple of Doom was just as riddled with flaws as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  I think many people really were trying to count the ways this new film couldn't live up to the originals, and due to the original films being classic, everyone put a magnifying glass to every flaw.<br /><br />Aside from the moments mentioned above, I believe CGI was used effectively, and, honestly: it was 2008.  Would it have been awesome if Spielberg filmed the entire movie with the same methods as the he used in the 1980s?  Without a doubt, but to expect that is just being too harsh.  It would have been better, but for what we get there is plenty of good stuff here.  A motorcycle chase that uses real stuntmen with occasional effects to make it seem as if Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf are actually there, a great car chase through the South American rainforest (I know, CGI isn't as thrilling as, but there are real parts sprinkled throughout, and you know what: actually doing an action-chase through dense rainforest would have been suicidal, so I fully understand the use of CGI), but most importantly: Temples and tombs.  That isn't CGI, and the team did a great job creating enormous set pieces for Indy and his companions to explore.  Also great is a series of thirteen crystal skeletons modeled personally by the late and great Stan Winston.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created Indy as a tribute to the Saturday morning serials they grew up with and it seems to have always been a labor of love for the pair.  The first three films took place in the 1930s and reflected it.  Now, twenty years later, Harrison Ford's age dictated an older Indy so the setting moved to 1950s.  Indy, having always been a creation of Spielberg and Lucas' nostalgia for the films of their youth, shifted from the more serious 1930s treasure hunter serials to the more fantastical, implausible series and movies of the 1950s.  This isn't betraying the fans, this is two friends remembering why they created this character in the first place and it just happens that this may seriously annoy the fans who wanted a far more serious Indy movie.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not as good as the classic trilogy, and people who go in expected it to live up to its predecessors have set themselves out for disappointment.  Yes, it would have been great if this new movie could have at least lived up to Last Crusade, but I was just happy to see Indy on the big screen again.  Indiana Jones has always been based on the fun B-movies that Spielberg and Lucas love, and in that regard I believe Kingdom of the Crystal Skull accomplished what it set out to do: be a light popcorn entertainment that transports the viewer back to a time when movies weren't so obsessed with being edgy or "Realistic."  As for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I'm happy that Lucas and Spielberg understand what makes an entertaining action movie.  This will never be a classic like the original trilogy, but for me it succeeded at its primary goal:  Entertainment.<br /><br />When Kingdom of the Crystal Skull got dumb it got really dumb, but those moments passed by so fast I was easily able to forget them and enjoy watching the greatest action hero of all time do what he does best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I have been a life-long fan of the Indiana Jones films (I first saw "Raiders" when I was ten).<br /><br />I really don't understand all the negative reviews heaped upon this flick. So many people balked at the "aliens" factor, but they seem to forget that the Indy movies (as well as the novels) always dealt with the occult and/or supernatural. Where else could the Indy saga go? How could the creators take it one step further? Well, how about the mystery of the so-called Roswell incident?<br /><br />I thought the aliens mystery was the next logical step for Indy to try and tackle. Why not? When you consider the "ancient astronauts" theories that have been circulating for the past 40 years or so and how these theories tie in with archeology around the world, I found the latest Indy premise to make sense and found it interesting and exciting.<br /><br />Another bone of contention seems to be the now-infamous "nuke the fridge" scene. Why do so many people have a problem with this? No one seemed to scream and holler when, in "Temple of Doom" during the mine car chase scene, the car that Indy and company were racing around in managed to jump a 100 foot gap in the track and still land safely and accurately on the other side just because they "ducked"?<br /><br />That's what Indiana Jones films have always been about; escaping the inescapable. The original 3 films all had certain scenes that were kind of hard to swallow, but so what? It's an action/adventure film! You've got to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good story!<br /><br />I found "Kingdom" to be everything that an Indy film should be; a great leading man, plenty of action, a healthy dose of comedy, exciting chases, great fight scenes and a terrific mystery to unravel. What else do you look for in an Indiana Jones film? "Kingdom" delivers all of that.<br /><br />It's not my favorite Indy movie (that distinction is awarded to "Last Crusade" with "Raiders" only a hair's length behind it), but it IS an Indiana Jones film! My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed it and were glad to own it on DVD. I loved being able to share it with my kids who, since "Kingdom"'s release, have shown a tremendous interest in the original 3 films as well (which we have all watched an enjoyed together).<br /><br />I especially loved the scene where the Russians' car crashes into the statue of Marcus Brody in the courtyard of Marshall College and the statue's head breaks off only to crash right into a Ruskie's stomach effectively removing him from the chase. What a wonderful, nostalgic touch and a wonderful homage to the late Denholm Elliot.<br /><br />Relax and enjoy this movie. It's not meant to be anything more than it's predecessor films; high adventure escapism!<br /><br />"It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage."</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTPZNY">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a> certainly isn't the best Indiana Jones movie. That title probably goes to Raiders. Still, Crystal Skull is still a fun movie and certainly has much of the feel of the Indiana Jones series. Despite some risks and questionable choices, it works well overall. The relationship between Indy and his lost son, Mutt, is actually one of the better parts of the film. Mutt is a likable character who grows over the film. Unlike some of the other characters (more on that later) he actually brings quite a bit to the movie.<br /><br />The plot works surprisingly well too. I initially thought it would be a cheesy aliens movie, but the alien presence is subtle. By and large, this is still Indy going into lost cities looking for treasure. I admit it's not the greatest MacGuffin and not my first choice, but given that choice Spielberg and Lucas used the idea well.  I suspect whether you like Crystal Skull or not depends upon your view of the Crystal Skull as the MacGuffin. If you hate it and can't accept it, then you won't like the film.<br /><br />That said, the movie suffers from a few misguided choices. First, as others have noted, there are too many over-the-top situations. I know Indiana Jones isn't supposed to be realistic, but too often the characters would survive some impossible situation - the multiple waterfalls, driving onto a tree branch, and, of course, nuking the fridge - and I'd nearly roll my eyes. However, more than the particular scenarios is that by and large the characters faced these situations passively, by essentially "bracing for impact."<br /><br />Also, I didn't think bringing Marion (Karen Allen) back worked so well.  It got about 30 seconds worth of nostalgia, but otherwise she doesn't really do much. Sure she's there and drives the duck, but it feels like the movie barely reintroduces us to her before she's off marrying Indy. I suspect this is because the movie already has a lot of supporting characters, particularly Mac and Oxley, most of who are simply not that compelling. It's simply too many people to introduce into a film like this. Even in Last Crusade, with it's large ensemble, we had already met Brody and Salleh before and could empathize more with the characters.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite pleased that Spielberg and Lucas decided to make a 4th Indiana Jones movie. It's not the greatest of the bunch, but it certainly doesn't detract from the series. It's worth a try if you're an Indy fan.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>"KCS" was not anywhere nearly as bad as I'd been lead to believe. But I understand why so many fans were disappointed.<br /><br />As others have said, it's not fair to condemn Indy's "refrigerator escape" without also criticizing all the other silly gags in the films (they are, after all, supposed to be tongue-in-cheek homages/parodies), most notably the "life-raft escape" in #2. Indy, Willie, and Short Round /should/ have been killed (or at least had their hips rammed into their jaws), * but it /looked/ plausible. Sort of. The "refrigerator escape" so obviously crossed the line of plausibility that audiences rejected it. (I have no problems with CGI prairie dogs, however.)<br /><br />"KCS"'s main problem is that, unlike the other films, there is no specific item -- the Ark, the stones, the Grail -- to drive and motivate the plot. Instead, he and the others are headed someone to find something that might be of interest. We've already seen the powers of the Crystal Skull, so why should we remain interested? And we're told so much about what to expect that the climax isn't much of a payoff. (And it isn't very exciting, either.) The result is an adventure film lacking the tension such films need. The whole thing has a set-piece "concocted" quality.<br /><br />The Blu-ray Disk comes in a nice little hard-back book with production photos. It's not a big deal, but it's nice to see this sort of deluxe packaging, which other companies seem to be adopting. (Maybe they're trying to maintain the price of BDs.)<br /><br />Now, how about the first three disks in good BD editions?<br /><br />* I recently met a retired Army man whose chute failed to open -- and whose legs were so badly injured he's now 3" shorter than he used to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones movies are supposed to be a little silly. However, this plot with the aliens just drags. The big revelations are lame and the end is silly. Are the extra-dimensional beings good or evil? They help start civilization, but they seem pretty careless about all life when the ship took off.<br /><br />The stunts were a hit and miss. Harrison Ford was great as Indy again. The relationship between Jones and his son was ok. I thought the relationship with Jones and the old girl friend was pretty good. However, the plot itself became so silly that I didn't care after a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starring Harrison Ford is a decent 4th installment of the Indy series. To me Ford looks exactly the same even my folks beg to differ, his performance is classic Indiana, he plays a brainy goofball pretty well. Cate Blanchett's thick accent is a bit much and Shia Labeouf shows what he's made of as a '50s greaser. Good flick, better than expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>This is a worthy entry into the Indiana Jones canon, though (lynch me for saying it, but it's the truth) it is a little disappointing. The action is fun and there is plenty of humor. It isn't as dark as the black sheep in the series: The Temple of Doom. However, it doesn't feel quite like a true Indy movie. Without giving anything away, (but you do get this feel fairly early on anyway) it's much more Sci-Fi than the previous Indy movies have been. The original trilogy was all about mystical objects that had magical or theological powers. Here it isn't so much magic as science.<br /><br />And before you call foul, the legend of the skulls is a real one and this movie took one of the theories surrounding the skulls and brought it to life, so it was more than sci-fi sensationalism. However, it still didn't quite ring true to Indy's repertoire.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Every Indy film that I can remember, in spite of its silly action-movie crust, had some kind of meaty, emotional heart.  The religious idolatry of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>, the enslavement of children in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">the Temple of Doom</a>, the father-son dynamics of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">the Last Crusade</a>.  Sure, the films were mostly about watching this sexy archeologist/professor risk his neck for posterity's sake, they chewed up the outer edges of believability with centuries-old booby traps and supernatural relics, they hammed it up with dialogue as chewy as Bazooka Joe.  They were, in a word, fluffy fun.<br /><br />But, even as they packed a wallop with their exuberance, they also made sure to tone down at the right times and to add a little soul.  Even the hotly contested TEMPLE OF DOOM, well, say what you will about its darkness, I always got a rush when those kids broke their shackles and ran free.<br /><br />I'd tell you what CRYSTAL SKULL wants its emotional backbone to be, but that would require a spoiler alert.  Let's just say that it's not hard to guess, especially when Shia LeBouf sticks his well-manicured coif into the screen and starts muttering about his poor, kidnapped mother.<br /><br />Harrison Ford seems to be enjoying himself, in spite of a script that eschews plausibility more than any other Indy film, yet.  (They don't even try, at some points, to keep the pieces together.  For instance, the circumstances surrounding Indiana's recovery of the crystal skull make absolutely no sense whatsoever, and that's big news for a movie that has a man withstand a nuclear blast from inside of a Fridgedaire.)  LeBouf's character is mostly annoying, if not grudgingly necessary.<br /><br />It's got the sort of blockbuster energy that will keep the seats filled.  And all of the Indy elements are there: a horde of nasty critters, that red line criss-crossing a map, Jones losing and regaining his hat, and even helpful monkeys.  I guess the real test would be to imagine this film coming out before any of the others and then asking if it would've inspired the same kind of hunger that RAIDERS did.<br /><br />Not likely.  Jones may look old, but he's as wry and competent as ever.  Give him a whip and a goal and he'll give you a ride, that's not in doubt.  He's still got the muscle and the wit.  Maybe what's missing is the heart.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.  That was torn out in THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  No wonder so many people hate that film.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>My wife hated it. I expected pretty much what I got. A far-fetched, cheesey Indiana Jones film, chock-full of car chases, over-the-top bad guys, unbelievable sequences that can make your eyes roll with the extreme cheesiness of it, but a decent film for what it is.<br /><br />I would have liked to see this franchise grow-up a bit more.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford still has it, Karen Allen still has it but apparently George Lucas and Speilberg doesn't.<br /><br />The plot is pretty loose the Soviets after a great weapon hidden away in a wooden box in a forgotten warehouse. And although the lost ark makes a brief cameo we are instead looking for the contents of area 54.<br /><br />Of course the plot weak as it is plays 2nd fiddle to the ongoing and never ending chase.  We are crashed, sunk, buried, chased and made to dodge the Bomb.  Because the characters are ones we care about it adds to the moments but they seem recycled.  Those moments are great fun but stringing them together do not a great movie make.<br /><br />In the first and 3rd movie the stakes are made clear early, an great battle between good and evil with the world at stake.  Hollywood today being what it is they can't quite bring themselves to make that clear connection when the foes are Communists until very deep in the movie and even then not without the obligatory early "Red Scare" scenes to suggest moral equivalence.  Cate Blanchette's performance doesn't help matters, she is as wooden a character as we have ever seen but I suspect a lot of that is due to the writing.  The presence of Marian seems to preclude any kind of relationship or bond forming between Blanchette and Ford (although it did't have to) so instead she becomes a stock villian.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong there are stunning visuals, great stunts, good comedy and Shia LeBouf does a much better job than the critics give him credit for but like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1903654297">Dr Who Audio Twin CD Loups Garoux (Doctor Who)</a> for the Big Finish Dr. Who audios or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8QVBK">Marx Bros.: Go West/The Big Store</a> for the Marx Brothers it is an avg entry in a quality franchise.<br /><br />Still you can't have the whole collection without it and it is enjoyable.  The best way to describe it is like a scene in an old comic book I once had. The JLA finds themself in an alternate universe and when the 40's Superman expresses satisfaction at fighting the Nazi's Green Arrow Comments "Lets not spoil the man of steel's fun."  Dr. Fate replies "Tis not fun tis nostalgia".

This fourth installment of the famous film series also includes extra-terrestrial elements, and I think we all know how successfully Spielberg has tackled that kind of subject matter. But that's the only new component; despite some new locations, a few new characters, and a whole new period of history, "Crystal Skull" is really no different than the first three "Indiana Jones" films. I don't mean this as a put down. If anything, it's the film's greatest strength. Formulaic stories work best in this case; we want Indy to find a supernatural ancient artifact, fight political evils, and keep his hat on during impossible action sequences. We want him to do that, and nothing more.<br /><br />And he delivers. The entire film delivers, not just as a fun-filled, action-packed send up of old time Saturday afternoon movie serials, but also as a cornucopia of impressive special effects. Just about every scene is an eye-popping visual feast, and this perfectly compliments a story this blatantly unrealistic. Producer/story creator George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp unabashedly went all out conjuring up Indy's fourth adventure, a tale of political intrigue and lost civilizations and heretofore-unknown connections with an ancient alien species. Taking place in 1957 at the height of the Red Scare, a much older Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr. (Harrison Ford) is reintroduced as a captive of the KGB, the covert operatives of the former Soviet Union. Having been betrayed by his long-time partner, "Mac" George McHale (Ray Winstone), Indy is taken to Area 51 and forced to locate a special crate in a gigantic warehouse; the mission leader, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), believes the crate contains something important, something that will lead the Soviet's to a source of power greater than the world has ever known.<br /><br />Indy, as you probably guessed, energetically escapes this predicament (but not before a wonderful reference is made to an earlier "Indiana Jones" film, and I won't say any more). Unfortunately, the FBI now considers him a Person of Interest, meaning he can no longer teach Archeology. Just as he leaves for New York, he's approached by a tough-talking, knife-wielding young bike-rider named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). He needs Indy's help; both his mother and his friend, Professor Oxley, have been kidnapped by the Soviets. All Mutt can give Indy is one of Oxley's notes, written in a dead South American language and serving as a way to find one of thirteen skulls made entirely of crystal.<br /><br />Apparently, Oxley is an expert on crystal skulls, real-life ancient artifacts mysterious both in structure and origin. If, like me, you had never even heard of crystal skulls before this movie, here's a little background info: archeologists have discovered a number of crystal skulls over the years throughout Mexico, Central America, and South America. The most famous skull was the one supposedly found by Anna Mitchell-Hedges back in 1924, sculpted from a block of clear quartz. Claimed to predate all known Colombian Mesoamerican artifacts, the craftsmanship remains a mystery to this day; not only was it sculpted against the natural grain of the crystal, it also shows no evidence of chipping or scratching, and this is virtually impossible considering the primitive tools used by early civilizations. This led to myths about the skull having supernatural powers, being able to radiate psychic energy and possibly being of alien origin.<br /><br />Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get back to the movie. Indy's and Mutt travel to Peru and find a half-insane Oxley (John Hurt) and Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indy's old flame from "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Naturally, they also find Spalko and her Soviet goons. This kick starts a frenetic race to a temple deep within the jungles of Brazil, where the final climactic scenes take place. You can rest assured that all this is loaded with action, with sequences including a swordfight atop two moving army vehicles, Mutt swinging from vines with a pack of monkeys, and three gigantic waterfalls, all of which Indy, Marion, and Mutt go down. Never mind the fact that they survive--as they climb out of the water, we immediately realize that Indy's hat remained in place the entire time.<br /><br />If the excitement and fun of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" left a definite impression on you, then you're well on your way to loving every minute of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." The plot may be original, but the spirit hasn't changed a bit, and that's exactly the way it should be; each of the four films is a masterpiece of escapist entertainment. We have a hero to root for, even if he's afraid of snakes (and just watch what happens when he has to climb out of a sinking sand trap). We have villains to jeer, and just as the Nazis of the first and third films were goofy caricatures, so too are the Soviets in this film. "Crystal Skull" goes one step further by paying homage to the previous films, specifically by mentioning the passing of both Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) and Marcus Brody (the late Denholm Elliot). We also get to see man-eating ants, and what "Indiana Jones" film would be complete without a swarm of creepy crawlies? There's no question that "Raiders" is the best of the series, but there's also no denying that "Crystal Skull" is a fun, worthy addition. I expected nothing less.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie and rate it at four well earned stars.  I believe the quality of the special effects were excellent and the story very good as well. The transfer quality of the Blu-Ray DVD was one of the best I have ever watched and helped make this movie special for me since my first viewing of this film was on my large screen home theater.<br /><br />I am surprised that this film scored such a flat 3 star rating but the statistics are what they are. These statistics probably reflect as much about us, the audience growing old watching Indiana Jones films as the movie makers.  All in all, I think it was a very good effort and within my small group of movie going friends I know this film was well thought of and provided a very entertaining evening.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>I have to admit, I had pretty low expectations for this fourth film in the series. I mean, with the generally high failure rate of sequels, what can you realistically expect from a fourth attempt? But I was pleasantly surprised: This one is almost as good as the first. It certainly resembles "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in various ways, both in the story line -- a race against the Bad Guys to find the secret location of a mysterious artifact that possesses occult (or at least arcane) powers -- and in its "bits of business." There's also a running fight between the Goodies and the Badies in separate vehicles racing on parallel tracks through the jungle. There's a nerve-wracking precipice. There's even a love interest in the return of Marian Ravenwood, played by Karen Allen. What's amazing is that, while Harrison Ford certainly looks older, he's still very spry for being 65 years old -- which is only a shade older than me, and I'm not even remotely in that sort of condition. Not every shot can be handled by a stunt double or faked with CGI. The period this time is 1957, roughly 18 years after the last film, in order to account for Indy (and Ford) being 18 years older himself, so the embodiment of all that is evil is now the Commies instead of the Nazis. What genre of films were peculiar to the mid-50s? Science fiction-slash-monster flicks, with invaders from Mars standing in for the other side in the Cold War. The plotline, with interdimensional instead of interplanetary visitors, plays deliberately against that. So does the entry of Henry "Mutt" Williams (played very nicely by Shia LeBoeuf) astride a Harley and looking very much like James Dean. Mutt, who is Marian's son (by, of course, Indiana Jones) develops the same tense and rebelious relationship with Indiana that Indy himself had with his own father. Wheels within wheels. The film's semi-violent action opens _in media res_ and seldom pauses for more than a minute or two. There are plenty of surprise antics (my favorite probably is Indiana popping up and blowing back through the business end of a native's blowgun, burying the poison dart in the guy's throat). The army ants are also a nice effect. I would rate this one at least as good as "The last Crusade," which means it ties for Second Place after the original film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is certainly the weakest of the Indy films, not because of its "extraterrestrial" plot (which I didn't mind, by the way), but because of its uneven flow. Sometimes it's fast-paced, then other times it's slow-paced. The action sequences aren't that great, and ants don't seem to be as threatening and creepy as snakes and rats. CGI doesn't work well here: the visual effects in "Temple" and "Crusade" look much more realistic than the effects here in "Kingdom". The prairie dogs and monkeys don't fit in; they make this look like a naive family film, which it isn't. John Williams's music seems to be a re-has of the music from the trilogy; nothing special. And plus, Shia Lebeouf is badly miscast. I'm sure they could've picked a more believable (and perhaps, new) actor to play the greaser. His presence in the film makes me think of "Transformers"; I'm supposed to think of this as an INDY film!<br /><br />But this film does have its moments. We get to see an older Indy, and knowing what it's like to lose some of the spark that's found in the original trilogy. The Soviets are the new enemies, and they're a good replacement for the 40's Nazis. Karen Allen returns as Indy's old love, Marian, and plot twists do ensue here (I won't spoil all of it). John Hurt and Kate Blanchett give out splendid performances, while Harrison Ford and Karen Allen brings this film up a notch.<br /><br />It's hard to say whether this film is a Godsend or a piece of crap, so I give this a 2.5/5.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Qualifying as gleeful entertainment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull definitely doesn't come close to the greatness achieved by the first three Indy flicks, but it isn't nearly as bad as many have claimed it to be either.  Harrison Ford makes a triumphant return to his defining role as the fedora wearing, whip wielding adventurer; who is coerced by a young greaser named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) into taking a trip to Peru to rescue his mother (Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Karen Allen) and friend (John Hurt) who knows the secrets of the fabled Crystal Skull.  With a team of Soviets (led by Cate Blanchett) hot on his tail as well, the aging Indy certainly has his hands full.  The biggest flaw of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is that it is ever so predictable.  Any of the big twists, revelations, or surprises you will see coming a mile away; and the biggest plot element of all is so weakly inserted here that you'll wonder just what it's doing in an Indiana Jones movie.  Still though, there's just something about the film that still makes it worth seeing regardless, with spectacular stunt work and action sequences, and the fact that Ford still stands tall as one of the best screen heroes in all of cinema history.  All in all, despite its many flaws, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an enjoyable romp that many will no doubt be split on, but in the end, seeing Indy back in action is reason enough to celebrate.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>the end of it did much to spoil the the matter. The special effects were brilliant and Harrison Ford did well for a man of his...er stage. Shia LaBoeuf brought a bit of spice to some of the stunts and Cate Blanchett was smashing. The end aside it would have been so much better.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>In any other case, the fact that seeing a 64-year-old man bend down, pick up his hat, and put it on is one of the most exciting images this side of the millennium would be a dismal statement about the films being released.  This is a special case, though, because it's not just any 64-year-old man picking up his hat, and it's not just any hat, either.  It's Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr., and he's picking up his trademark fedora, easily the most iconic hat in cinematic history.  After nearly twenty years of waiting, Indiana Jones has returned for his fourth adventure: "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."<br /><br />A lot has happened since we last joined Indy for an adventure.  Off-screen, that was 1989.  On-screen, it was 1938.  Indy was still young and devilishly handsome, and though he was still having run-ins with Nazis, America wasn't involved in World War II yet.  It's painful to realize that in the time it took for "Crystal Skull" to arrive, we missed all of the 1940s, including Indy's involvement with World War II (which would certainly have been something to see), and most of the 1950s.  (That doesn't include Harrison Ford's brief guest-stint as a fifty-year-old Indiana Jones on "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" in 1993.)  In "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," set in 1957, Indy is getting up there in age, and the Cold War is in full swing.<br /><br />That means that, inevitably, a lot of the so-called fans of the series' previous entries will not be pleased with the new film.  They would like the Indy they grew up: a young, dashing, restless womanizer.  Those fans are living in Neverland.  There's no way "Crystal Skull" will satisfy them, because it's not another adventure of Indiana Jones in the 1930s.  Hard as it to accept - and it seems to be harder for some people to accept than others - there will never be another one of those.  They're over.  Those fans have grown older, and their hero has too.  Those people who go into the theatre expecting a fourth 1930s-style Indiana Jones movie will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Those who seek a new Indiana Jones movie, on the other hand, needn't worry.  The same smug, wisecracking, clever, and very human American hero that we know and love is back.  If anything, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a savage attack on ageism.  Yeah, Indy's joints are a little creakier than they used to be, but he can still run with the best of them.  And I mean run.  Watch Harrison Ford move in this movie.  This guy is 64 years old!  (And before you say "stunt double," Ford did an enormous amount of his own stunts.)  At Ford's request (!), screenwriter David Koepp inserted a number of jokes about Indy's age into the film, to acknowledge the fact that the Man with the Hat has added a few rings to his tree since last we saw him.  The filmmakers don't pretend that Indy hasn't aged, but they try (successfully) to accentuate the fact that that doesn't mean a darn thing.<br /><br />And it really doesn't.  Harrison Ford is as spectacular as he's ever been.  He has the same mischievous twinkle in his eye - watch for it in the opening sequence, you can see it - and the same charming grin.  He's in excellent shape for his age, since, according to Ford, he's been trying to stay in shape for another Indiana Jones movie since they filmed the last one (George Lucas' original deal with Paramount stated that five films would be produced).  Seeing Ford in the opening of the film is enough to transform the most masculine of adult males into the same bleary-eyed little boy they were when they saw the original film, "Raiders of the Lost Ark," back in '81.  Indy has grown up with us, fortunately.  Though he does have a love interest in the film, it's an old flame.  He's not running around with women half his age (unlike his real-life counterpart, Mr. Ford, who has been in a highly-publicized and apparently very happy relationship with "Ally McBeal" star Calista Flockhart for the last decade).  He's learned a bit from his past adventures, too.  He is only a few steps from being the same sort of wise old man his father was in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," a fact referred to by a very clever allusion to "Last Crusade" around the middle of the film.<br /><br />Though Ford's aging shoulders prove more than sturdy enough to support the film, he has a supporting cast as colorful as his adventures.  It's really a delight to see Karen Allen, who was a prominent and very well-liked actor from her first major role, in 1978's "Animal House," until the release of "Scrooged" in 1988.  Many Indy fans have long held that Allen's character from "Raiders" was Indiana Jones' one true love, and those people will be jumping out of their seats and whipping on to the theater's fans when they see how wonderfully the filmmakers have treated Allen in this film.  The chemistry between she, Ford, and Shia LeBouf - yes, he's in this one, there's no escaping him in blockbusters now - is surprising.<br /><br />LeBouf is a pleasure.  He provides a lot of the comic relief, which he does with the same natural grace which has made him the hottest young actor in Hollywood.  Steven Spielberg has taken a lot of flak for dressing LeBouf up as a "painfully obvious" homage to Marlon Brando in "The Wild One," but it works.  It's funny, it's a nice little wink to that picture, and that's all it's supposed to be.<br /><br />The highlight of the supporting cast is Cate Blanchett.  Are you surprised?  Blanchett's portrayal of unstoppable and determined Russian agent Irina Spalko, clearly based upon the character of Rosa Klebb from "From Russia with Love," is hilarious, intriguing, and right on the spot.  If one desires anything more from the cast, it's that her role had been expanded.<br /><br />As for the film itself, well, if there's anything wrong with it, it's the script.  The rough story, concocted by George Lucas, is interesting.  The script, on the other hand, is pieced together from previous scripts by writers like Jeff Nathanson (who receives story credit with Lucas) and, more than anyone else, Frank Darabont (the man who brought us "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile"), and it shows.  David Koepp, who also crafted the scripts for everything from "Jurassic Park" to "Spider-Man," tries his best, but his script is ultimately sort of a Frankenstein's monster, full of great ideas and great scenes that don't quite slide together into one cohesive whole, and filled with some very questionable dialogue.  Oh, if only they'd gone with Darabont's script!  Word on the street is it was brilliant; Spielberg reportedly was head-over-heels crazy about it.  Koepp's script isn't bad, it just goes off occasionally, and when it does, it's enough to throw one off for a minute.<br /><br />Spielberg's directing won't throw anybody off, though.  Those pesky nihilists who have been crying like banshees that Spielberg's lost it should be silenced by this movie.  Spielberg shoots just like he did in the `80s, back when no one was shooting better.  Surprisingly, he shines the most in the action sequences, which are incredible.  They are by far the most exciting action sequences this side of the millennium (yes, better than those in the damn "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies!).  They're also some of the most over-the-top, a trait Spielberg recognizes and even exploits.  Among the sequences: Indiana Jones battles Russians in Area 51, is chased by KGB agents through his college campus, and survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a led-lined refridgerator.<br /><br />If you're thinking this all sounds like hogwash, this isn't the film for you.  The only problem with this movie is that people seem to be expecting something deep or even something realistic, like Spielberg's last movie, "Munich."  That's exactly what the Indiana Jones movies are NOT about.  These films were created by George Lucas as homages to the five-minute serials of the 1930s, or ridiculous old Charlton Heston adventures.  They're meant to be over-the-top, they're meant to be colorful, they're meant to be silly and unbelievable.  They exist for one sole reason: to entertain.  And if one realizes that, one comes to realize that these movies are brilliant.<br /><br />After all, the Indiana Jones movies are widely regarded as the greatest action-adventure series in cinematic history.  Expectations aren't necessarily too high for this film, they're just off the mark.  The characters have aged and even grown, but anyone who expects anything deeper than the previous films best turn right around and rent "Youth Without Youth."  The cast is superb, Spielberg is at his finest, and, in his mid-60's, Indiana Jones still can whip with the best of them.  What more could you ask for?</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>I've had to let this film sink in a bit after seeing it in the theatre.  Indiana Jones is certainly one of my all-time favorites, and I had been looking forward to ths 4th installment since the news was released years ago it was in works and even cancelled for some time (boy was I dissapointed).  I was too thrilled when I learned about its come back and I knew with Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford on the project it had to be a winner.  Funny thing is, it never felt quite like what I expected out of these guys.<br /><br />Ok, so Ford is older and just wasn't the same.  But he really was not bad either, in fact he held up pretty well in some of the action scenes (and he did do a few stunts himself).  Karen Allen is definelty a returning treat as well, who was always my favorite of the three original Jones ladies.  Shia Lebouf, surprisingly, made a stronger impact than I thought possible (though Im not sure I can see him taking over the role of Indiana Jones as has been rumored for a sequal).  Cate Blanchet, despite being an excellent actress, never stole the show as a memorable villain.  She definelty has a few strong scenes (mainly her sword fighting in the jeep chase scene) but her part never came close in comparison to previous Jones villains.<br /><br />The story suffered a bit I thought.  Though I appreciate that once again the Crystal skulls artificats are real world artifcats that contain mysterious powers, the plot got a little carried away on this one I thought.  Now I won't give away the ending (though I'm sure one way or another the secret is already out) but it just didn't fit into the Indiana Jones realm in my humble opinion.  However, the adventure, action, laughs and thrills are all there along the way, with some scenes (the beginning warehouse scene and the jeep chase) brining some Raiders nostalgia back.  Things do slow down quite a bit and get a bit boring about mid-way through, but overall its a fun ride.<br /><br />Kingdom of the Crystal Skull surpasses Temple of Doom, but that's about it.  This one is nowhere as good as Raiders or Last Crusade, but that was kind of to be expected.  Considering its almost 20 years since the last film, there is more good to this one than bad.  Fans will enjoy it and should see this, but it will leave you with a bit of a bitter taste in the end.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is an entertaining Indy film.  It's no "Raiders" or even "Crusade," but it's good for what it is.  Over-the-top action, a little romance, some vaguely paranormal archeological mystery: it checked all the boxes.  Those who consider it unbelievable may want to look at the premises of the previous movies.  You have to be willing to suspend your disbelief and accept the internal logic of Indiana Jones World.  Ultimately, the film hewed to its own internal logic, moved at a decent pace, and was entertaining.<br /><br />Shia LaBoeuf takes a lot of flak from reviewers, but I thought he did a good job with the material he had to work with.  I cringed when he made his Brando-ripoff entrance, but that wasn't his fault - he didn't set up that shot, pick out his wardrobe or select a motorcycle.  Frankly, he held up well against Harrison Ford, and although I'm not keen to see a Young Indiana Jones movie with him as Indy the Third, he was fine in this movie.<br /><br />I loved Karen Allen in the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark."  She stole that movie from Harrison Ford in virtually every scene, and Marion Ravenswood was as much as part of what made "Raiders" a classic as Indiana Jones.  She was the girl next door who could also drink you and an Mongolian yak herder under the table.  But in "Crystal Skull," I don't know if it was Allen or the script, but she came across as flat and unengaging.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is at least worth a rent.  And while you're watching, ponder the fact that 5000 year old civilizations had robust technology and elaborate traps that still work 5000 years later, while you probably have a hard time getting your car to start reliably.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>Before beginning my home viewing of this film, I had a premonition that it would not meet my expectations.  Sorry to say that my intuition serves me well.  "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a film that is poorly constructed, a film that fed the mouth of hype and left a bitter taste on the palate of its viewers as well as excess calories of criticism.  I find it hard to concentrate on anything other than its flaws and I am deeply disappointed in a filmmaker whom I thought incapable of surrendering to the push of a mass-marketed film.<br /><br />This latest Indy installment gets off to a busy start with a trip to the warehouse where the infamous Arc of the Covenant ended up in the first film.  Among a small caravan of vehicles is Indiana Jones (Ford), a captive of a zealous band of Russian soldiers, his new nemesis in lieu of the Nazi regime.  The Cold War has Stalin's army looking for any possible advantage over their adversaries and it comes in the form of a strange skull made entirely of pure crystal.  Jones manages to escape from their clutches but crosses paths with them again when a rebellious high school dropout named Mutt (LaBeouf) beseeches him to help locate a missing professor (Hurt).  The rest of the movie has Jones and Mutt dodging fists, swords, poison arrows, bullets and creepy crawlies to retrieve and return this mysterious artifact.<br /><br />Production values on this particular venture are glaringly overblown; the end result is elaborate sets that look anything but ancient and fantastically awful action sequences that require strict suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The script could've used a minor overhaul - the storyline/plot leaves much to be desired and there are one too many cheesy lines and maudlin moments.  The editing is a bit questionable as well; one particular chase sequence goes on for far too long.  In fact, most of the film falls prey to these painstakingly choreographed scenes replete with fisticuffs, swordplay, gunfire and cars/trucks crashing and/or blowing up while the meager plot creeps miserably into the background.  "Raiders", "Temple" and "Last Crusade" all had religious themes coupled with the turbulent backdrop of World War II.  "Crystal Skull" blazes ahead to the late 50's and has nothing to show for it except some lame theory about Roswell, the Mayans and alien artifacts.<br /><br />Spielberg has done better work than this - the previous Indiana Jones films are proof-positive.  This has no place with his beloved saga and instead reigns supreme as a super-charged popcorn action flick.<br /><br />On the upside, no one gives a bad performance despite the somewhat lackluster screenplay.  Ford is a bit toned down, seeming to relish his role as an older and wiser Henry Jones Jr.  John Hurt is under-utilized as is Ray Winstone.  LaBeouf is passable as Mutt, a leather-jacketed motorcycle enthusiast who flagrantly sports the James Dean guise that was so de rigeur of the time.  It's great to see Karen Allen again but her reprise as Marian Ravenwood is disappointing - she's missing much of the spark she touted in "Raiders".  As the film's villain, Blanchett probably treated this more as a pet project than serious acting work because an actress of her caliber just doesn't belong here (her Russian lilt doesn't hold strong either).  Broadbent is the most pleasing of the smaller roles, equal to that of Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody.<br /><br />Bottom line: I give 2.5 stars for Ford, Broadbent and Allen and a story that would've been great had it not been in the hands of such mediocre screenwriters as David Koepp and (sigh) George Lucas.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>Let me say up front that I am a big fan of the Indiana Jones series. I really wanted to love this film but I couldn't completely! It isn't a bad film but it definitely falls short of the first three.<br /><br />The first hour or so of the movie is probably the best of this film. After that, the plot goes downhill though I have to admit I found myself enjoying the chase through the jungle!<br /><br />The Crystal Skull legend I did find interesting. I hope there is some special about those because I understand they really exist but no one knows how they were made or where they come from. Back to the film, it goes downhill when Marion (Indy's love in the first film) shows up. I don't know why but she just didn't add much to this film this time other than rekindling her romance with Dr. Jones.<br /><br />Shil LeBeuf is okay as Indy's son (a fact not revealed until later in the movie) but I don't know if he's interesting enough to have his own film series. The best thing about this film is actually Harrison himself. His performance as Indiana Jones is still very good. I just wished he would've had a better story!<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this one as a rental or buy at a reduced price. For me, I am waiting until they re-release all of them on blu-ray in one set and get them then!

The adventure itself is a little on the confusing side, but will keep you interested throughout.<br /><br />The two main flaws with Indy IV are the dialogue which is pretty bad at times (some of it comes across okay) and the heavy use of CGI that you can't help but notice.<br /><br />Just don't go in expecting a soon to be classic movie.

This is a captivating film from start to finish. It won this viewer immediately with the breath-taking cinematography of the Nevada desert landscape. Also highly appealing were the teenagers driving down a lonely Nevada road, with the radio on full blast playing an Elvis tune. They challenged the lead car of an Army convoy to a race, little did anyone realize what was soon to transpire. At the checkpoint, the convoy soldiers murder the guards. Russian soldiers and their leader infiltrated a secret storage facility hidden in the Nevada desert. There, Indiana Jones and a former British MI6 agent were prisoners, forced to locate a treasure they had discovered about 15 years ago ... It turns out, the Russian leader Dr. Irina Spalko (played exquisitely by Cate Blanchett) was a scientist who was involved in mind research and needed the Crystal Skull which was purported to have secret powers. I loved the ingenious technique by which Indy found the chest which contained a mummy from Peru with a disfigured skull. It verified something of great importance to the Russian scientist ...<br /><br />Next, Indy is interrogated by the CIA for his association with the British Agent who turns out to be a spy working for the Soviets. The CIA pressures Marshall College to fire Indy who instead is given a leave of absence based on a deal made by the President of the college with the Board. On leave, Dr. Henry Jones Jr (Indiana Jones) plans to teach in the UK where he has connections. On his way out of town, he is tracked down by a rebellious teenager named Mutt who has a personal letter from someone very well known to Indy, a UK archeaolgist who disappeared on an excavation in Peru. I loved the fight scene in the cafe which was deviously initiated by Mutt to allude the Soviet Agents. Mutt needs Indy's help to locate the missing professor and Mutt's mother, both of whom disappeared while on search of the Crystal Skull ...<br /><br />Indiana Jones and Mutt fly to Peru where they dig through the tombs of Spanish Conquistadors to locate clues. The Soviet soldiers and Dr. Irina Spalko are hot on their tails. Naturally, Indy and Mutt free the professor and Mutt's mother from their captors. The jungle chase scenes and the Amazon River escape with the two falls, were particularly enjoyable. High accolades and loud praise to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas who outdid themselves with a spectacular ending. The special effects and cinematography associated with the temple at Akator were inspirational. The ending was dynamic and jaw-dropping. This entire sequel was filled with superb creativity and amazing craftsmanship ...Erika Borsos [pepper flower]</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>The first disc starts off with "The Return of a Legend." With the final shot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)</a>, Steven Spielberg assumed that he was done with Indiana Jones but five years ago fans started asking about another film. It was Harrison Ford who expressed an interest in revisiting the character and kept after George Lucas and Spielberg. This featurette takes a look at how this new film came together.<br /><br />"Pre-Production" examines the preparation and planning that went into the project. Spielberg wanted to maintain the same look as the previous films. We see Ford getting outfitted with his iconic gear while Shia LeBeouf says that Spielberg gave him three films from the 1950s to study in order to get a handle on the time period that the film takes place.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the impressive "Production Diary: Making Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." It is broken down into six featurettes or can be viewed all together for a feature-length look at principal photography: from the first day to the final one. For Spielberg it felt like no time had passed between films. This is a detailed look at shooting in key locations of the film: New Mexico, Connecticut, Hawaii, and four soundstages in Los Angeles. There is plenty of on-location/on the set footage as we see Spielberg and co. at work.<br /><br />"Warrior Makeup" takes a look at the make-up job done on the warriors that guard the temple that houses the Crystal Skulls.<br /><br />"The Crystal Skulls" examines the legend behind them and the mystery of how they were made. Stan Winston and his team created the props for the film and we see how they were constructed.<br /><br />"Iconic Props" takes a look at some of the gear used in the film - who uses it, when its used, and its source.<br /><br />"The Effects of Indy" examines the digital photography and matte paintings done in the film. We see the scenes that were enhanced by CGI and how the final product was achieved.<br /><br />"Adventures in Post-Production" takes a look at editing phase. Spielberg shot and edited on film, the latter of which is rare nowadays. Editor Michael Kahn talk about the challenge of working on this film while Ben Burtt shows how he created some of the sounds used in the film.<br /><br />"Closing: Team Indy" is a brief montage that pays tribute to the cast and crew of the film.<br /><br />"Pre-Visualization Sequences" features the rough, CGI footage for three seqeunces from the film that gave the filmmakers an early look at what they would look like.<br /><br />Also included are five galleries of artwork, production stills and behind-the-scenes photographs.<br /><br />Finally, there are three trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This is an excellent continuation of the Indiana Jones series. Steven<br />Speilberg has made another excellent movie. Indiana Jones has gotten greyer since his last Indiana Jones Movie.<br />  This movie starts out with a base is New Mexico being taken over by Russians. You are introduced to the personna of evil Dr. Irina Spalko played by Cate Blanchette. She are her KGB goons are on the base after a box that is stored there. Indiana Jones has been taken hostage by the Russians to help find the box that the KGB is looking for. After a running gun battle and a atomic blast Jones escapes. He is then located by<br />a young man who has been sent by his mother. His mother turns out to be Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen. Jones and the young man take a trip to South America where they start finding clues. They are kidnapped by the Russians and taken deeper into South America. They are searching for a "City Of Gold". There are many chase scenes that add to the excitement level of the movie. When they finally find the location there are some surprises. The ending of the movie is spectacular. Be sure to go and see this movie. It is definitely a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Indiana Jones 4 hits the wrong notes from the start (kids driving while listening to rock music? In this franchise?) and never fixes itself; as a fan of the first three I found myself sinking into my seat, realizing with dawning horror that the movie kept finding ways to get worse--terrible CGI, an awful performance by Cate Blanchett, completely wasting John Hurt--and when it was over I couldn't believe that I had enjoyed National Treasure 2 more than an Indiana Jones movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>It's been 19 years, as the press is fond of reminding us, since we saw Indiana Jones ride off into the sunset at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Now after nearly two decades in what we shall call Indiana Jones and Development Hell, the man in the fedora is back in action!<br /><br />And it is good.<br /><br />Very good.<br /><br />Not great, though. But it is better than Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, though not quite as good as the aforementioned Last Crusade. It comes close, though.<br /><br />You know the plot by now. Indiana Jones goes looking for a McGuffin, while eluding the bad-guys. A simple formual that can work very, very well indeed. It worked so well with Raiders of the Lost Ark that Roger Ebert considers it one of the Great Movies.<br /><br />As for how well it really works in this movie? Well, there wasn't anything about it I specifically disliked. Shia LeBeoff does a good job of playing a rebel without a pause. It was nice to see Karen Allen again. Jim Broadbent was good, but along with Ray Winstone, his appearance was completely unneeded, though in the case of Winstone it was interesting seeing him after seeing Beowulf. Removing his character and Broadbent's wouldn't have changed the movie in any fundamental way, though it might've streamlined things.<br /><br />Basically the only real gripe I guess I have can be summed up like this: It seemed like they were trying to hard. Like Lucas and Spielberg were saying, "Look! We can still make a movie that's good and popular! LOOK, DAMN YOU!" As a result, just about everything seemed to be set to eleven. This sometimes took the form of silly things, like someone surviving a nuke by a: hiding in a fridge, and b: being hurled miles away and not dying on impact.<br /><br />There's also the fact that there didn't seem to be any real stakes in this movie. With Raiders and Crusade you had clearly defined objects. You knew what they were and what they'd do. You knew why it would be bad if the Nazis got a hold of them. That just didn't seem to be the case here. The franchise seems to work best when looking for holy artifacts. Maybe next time we can have Indiana Jones and the Spear of Longinus?<br /><br />Despite this, it made for a good movie and I was pleased to see Harrison Ford up there doing what he does best. I'm hopeful there will be another movie, and I have great confidence that it will be even better than this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>So its almost been...twenty years since the last Indiana Jones movie and after all that time, a fourth film has finally been done, with Speilberg, Ford, and Lucas all re-teaming up again for a new adventure with everyone's favorite archeoligist.<br /><br />From the very beginning, things start going. We find an older Indy being taken captive by a group of Soviets, led by the bobbed Cate Blanchett, using him to find a treasure hidden within the confines of the mysterious Area 51, which turns out to be that of a crystal skull that hold mysterious powers. After that, Indy finds himself on another quest, in tow a young greaser named Mutt (LeBeouf) and the return of Marion Ravenwood from the first film, as the three set out to find the mysterious lost kingdom where the skull came from, all the while sidestepping the Soviets advance.<br /><br />To put it all in a nutshell, Indy 4 is basically just a good ole dose of nostalgia for all those whole grew up with the beloved series. But that aside, the film is pretty weak compared to the original three, in both spirit and concept. Where the first films were all witty and original, with genuine stunts and thrilling chases, this Indy has suddenly taken on a very glossy effect and we find a lot of the characters pretty hallow in comparision to the other films.<br /><br />One big problem with the film is the plot in general. The whole idea of aliens, mayan temples, mind control, to put it as one reviewer said, it starts to cross over into X-Files territory, which seems to completly dislocate the whole movie from its beginnings. This also happens to be the first film of the whole series where effects seemed to have taken over from the general idea of the whole films, and thats the shear fun of it all. With all that said, the film just does not make an impression, which is really quite sad. Its like, Speilberg and Lucas had all this time and this is really the best they could come up with?<br /><br />Indy 4 will definantly please all hardcore fans, who will gladly welcome back the archeoligist with open arms. Other then that, this film really has nothing else to offer and may be a sign that Indy should hang the fedora up once and for all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>The first half hour shows lots of promise, but the kid is not a compelling character and can't break out of his nerdy image (spoken by a fellow nerd).  You know the plot points, so I won't recap. Some exciting chase action in a jungle, some fake-looking killer ants, and the rest of the movie is more concerned with spectacle than enjoyable action. That is to say, there is some action, but we're left thinking, so what?</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>Indy's back...and knees...and other aches and pains. You gotta admire a man willing to revisit a success in such a sacrificial way. It was easy to cheer him on even though the action had slowed a bit.<br /><br />Dry, droll and to-the-point, the older, wiser and classic Indy takes on the Russians, the feds and a mushroom cloud.<br /><br />Within this flick are unbelievable scenes...just as I expected. You have to be willing to go along for the ride and enjoy it. If you plan to take a notebook to record the moments you have to suspend disbelief, then don't go. Indy also delivers creepy crawlies and moldering corpses. A whole lot of bad guys guarantee the wild car chases and crashes. Indy has slowed down but he can still kick some serious bad guy rear end.<br /><br />Youthful foolishness and posturing is delivered by Mutt, Indy's new and not necessarily welcomed sidekick. But Indy has grown up and is ready to teach.<br /><br />Besides some of the miraculous saves, I didn't buy some of the too easily mended relationships, but other than that, this was a great, entertaining summer flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Indy IV was hyped for close to a decade, going through various screenplay rewrites and writers, Indy was put on hold numerous times, rescheduled and then finally announced, the story kept shrouded in mystery. Then Indy IV was eventually released to only mediocre reception but thankfully still has some of the original flare to save it from absolute failure. The truth is that Indy IV comes very close to not only being the worst of the four Indy movies, but a low point for Spielberg in general. In short, The Temple of Doom is better than this. So what went wrong and what saves it?<br /><br />It suffers a bit from Phantom Menace syndrome. The decade long hype nowhere nears pays-off and neither does the secrecy. It is not an original story. In short it looks taken from an Erik Von Daniken chapter on `ancient aliens' combined with X Files: The Movie and maybe even `Predator'. All of the other hyped proposals, Atlantis etc., sounded a way better and probably would have been. So the story is maybe a letdown.  Then we have the bad guys, pesky Russians. This is the 21st century and that is the best we can do? The Russians? Okay so maybe it's keeping in tune with typical Indy stereotype bad-guys but it just doesn't pack the same kind of punch that it would have done say in 1980, but in 2008 it is positively lame. Then we have the new kid who does a lot of Indy's fighting for him. Okay so Harrison is old, but he is not that old and this is an Indy picture and really this is what saves the day... Indy.<br /><br />Harrison doing Indy hasn't changed and that is what rescues this film. He hasn't changed one bit, not one iota, even though he might look older, he has all the moves, one-liners, facial expressions and kicks. Whenever Indy is on the screen, Indy IV is great. Also Indy IV is heavy on archaeology and that gives it an edge that maybe Temple lacked. The action sequences are not bad although there are some questionable graphics during the jungle fight. At least Indy IV gets right into the action within the first few minutes and continues right through to the end. There is also a classic gag with a snake.<br /><br />So all in all, Indy IV is only ok, it is watchable, but for people who have invested in this series (and who hasn't) or followed the hype with anticipation will wonder what has gone wrong with the kind of mentally stimulating exciting movies that Spielberg and Lucas once had going. It almost paves the way for the new generation directors to make the most out of the missing blockbusters. Yet again thinking of 2008, they have haven't they?... and that's the point. Maybe we have been spoiled by better films and better Indy's, some of them by the director/producer duo that brought us this, but at the same time I cannot see the 1 or 2 star reviews being wrong about this motion picture. I am being generious with 3. It is kinda sad too thinking that there will probably not be another one. It feels like the end of an era.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Young biker Mutt Williams (to Indiana Jones): "So, what are you, like 80?"<br /><br />Some SPOILERS in this.<br /><br />See Indy battle the KGB!! Thrill to his sidekick's simian exploits!! Witness Chris Carter calling his lawyer!!<br /><br />Trying to be fair. Trying to be fair. But I guess I'm sipping a bit from a bottle of hater-ade right now. Firstly, by no means is this a terrible film, not with Spielberg at the helm. Any other picture, and I may even think it a four star film. But the Indiana Jones franchise should be held to a much higher standard. Only, I guess George Lucas wasn't satisfied with mucking up the Star Wars universe. Dude looked around, gazed at his belly button, and then arrived at the big epiphany: "Hey! Indiana Jones and space aliens!!" Spielberg and Ford should've flung him off a cliffhanger. INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL just goes to prove that it's better to strike when the iron's hot. Did it really take this long to come up with a working storyline? And then this is the best that could be worked out? I am hugely bumming right now. This fourth entry effectively takes away from the luster of the Indiana Jones franchise. STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE and STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER are snickering at THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. They might even be pointing fingers.<br /><br />It's been 19 years since INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE. With Harrison Ford now in his mid-60s, it's unrealistic that the film would have him still gallivanting in the World War II era, fighting Nazis. Truth is, I was actually looking forward to seeing our favorite archaeologist in a 1950s backdrop, which is more age-appropriate to him. The film touches on that decade's nervous tropes - the McCarthy paranoia, the fear of the atom bomb, the Cold War... And for villains, Indy gets the KGB, which is a fine institution for nefariousness, except that these guys aren't as classic or as contemptible as the Nazis; so, right there, something is diminished. On the other hand, the film does capture that vintage 1950s look. There's a fun scene in which Indy instigates a rumble at a vintage diner (to the tune of "Shake, Rattle and Roll") and then motors thru the college campus.<br /><br />It was George Lucas who came up with introducing a 1950s sci-fi B-movie element into the storyline, even though you can tell in the bonus features that Spielberg wasn't too enthused about it. But, moving on, there's always a fun pulp adventure element in the Find-the-Relic game in which Indy so often finds himself playing. The McGuffin here happens to be an ancient crystal skull, the return of which artifact to the fabled city of Akator (a.k.a. El Dorado) will, if the legends are true, grant unimaginable power to its bearer. So it's another race against time around the globe, with Indy this time going up against the psychic female KGB agent, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, who is having fun).<br /><br />It sucks that Sean Connery insisted on staying retired, rather than reprising his role as Indy's dad. But at least Karen Black returns as the always feisty Marion Ravenwood, so there's still something of the familiar in this new continuity. Decades later, Marion and Indy still have unresolved issues. Shia Labeouf enters the franchise as the scowling, leather jacket sporting, hair-greased-back biker Mutt Williams -and I didn't like him much. There's a revelation about him later on which fails to stun anyone. Ray Winstone is here, as well, as Indy's untrustworthy ally, and John Hurt also, as a demented professor.<br /><br />Harrison Ford, despite the creakiness, only lets up a little with the action sequences, and reportedly, he performed a fair bit of his own stunts. Even in his dotage, Indy can still take infinite amounts of punishment. There's still very much a sense of those 1930s cliffhanger serials in this film. The movie starts out with a nifty set piece in a musty, gigantic military warehouse in Nevada, with Indy held at gunpoint and instructed to seek out a stowed-away relic. Longtime fans will recognize this warehouse, of course, and there's even a fond nod to the Ark. It's pretty cool, also, the clever manner in which Indy tracks down that relic. And when the guns start blazing, Indy demonstrates that he's still pretty spry for a sexagenarian, knocking heads and swinging thru the air with his trusty bullwhip. This extended sequence culminates with Indy silhoutted against a nuclear mushroom cloud. A pretty cool image.<br /><br />I used to think that THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL was a dumb title, until I heard the other ones being passed around (INDIANA JONES AND THE SAUCER MEN and INDIANA JONES AND THE ATTACK OF THE GIANT ANTS). One writer for the film, joking around, actually came out with my favorite, INDIANA JONES AND THE SON OF INDIANA JONES. Ah, well. There's bits of humor scattered throughout, including a very funny revisiting of Indy's ophiophobia. The action sequences are predictably dynamite stuff, with plenty of cliffhanger moments, that is, until they're undermined by a dose of silly buggers. One such is introduced in the elaborate Jungle Chase Which Takes Forever, which features Mutt precariously dueling with the KGB villainess on speeding vehicles and then swinging vine to vine with CG-created monkeys, at which point I threw up my own imaginary fedora in disgust. Also offputting is the tonal shift from occult in past films to sci-fi in this one. So, just when I thought I was done nitpicking, not only is the climax somewhat reminiscent of NATIONAL TREASURE 2, but its trite X-Files overtones has the film officially jumping the shark for me. George Lucas tried to hedge it, stating that, nuh-uh, these creatures weren't at all extraterrestrials, but, rather, interdimensional beings... who just happened to look like aliens. Ooookay.<br /><br />Two discs in this package. Disc one has the feature film, as well as two special features: "The Return of A Legend" (17 minutes long) and a pre-production segment (12 minutes). On Disc 2: an in-depth six-chaptered Production Diary (around 79 minutes, and you get your money's worth); "Warrior Makeup" - a segment about the extensive makeup process for the keloid-decorated jungle warriors and the mud warriors (5 minutes); the legend of "The Crystal Skulls" is explored and also how the production crew manufactures their likeness (10 minutes); "Iconic Props" - concerning the props used in the film (10 minutes); "The Effects of Indy" covers the CG f/x and the model work done, including the desert test town that gets blown up (22 minutes); "Adventures in Post-Production" covers Ben Burtt's sound design and John William's scoring of the film (12 minutes); "Closing: Team Indy" is a shout-out to the film crew's principals (3 minutes); Pre-Visualization Sequences - pre-vis is a rough animated storytelling device which, in this case, preps the crew for 3 action sequences (the Area 51 get-away, the jungle chase, and the ant attack; totalling 14 minutes); 5 galleries and 2 trailers; and a game demo of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, XBOX 360.<br /><br />There's a sense of trying too hard in this picture. I got the sense also that it was trying really hard to sell Mutt Williams to the audience, to the point where I felt threatened for the Indy character. So, while I'm so glad to see Indy still very much doing his thing, this movie leaves me feeling robbed. It's good that John Williams' theme song is along to make things feel more canon. I, for one, wouldn't mind another Indiana Jones film, if only so that Indy could bow out on a higher note. Harrison Ford may be past his prime as an action hero but, for his age, he still carries himself well, so another adventure is still do-able. But if Ford wants to retire Indy, then I hope the movie studio isn't contemplating plonking a fedora on Shia LaBoeuf's noggin and handing him a bullwhip. Because there will be an uprising.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>After a 15-year hiatus, Harrison Ford has reprised his best role as the swash-buckling, fedora-wearing archaeologist/university professor Indiana Jones.  This time, Indy's up against Russian agents led by a sword wielding female commander, played by Cate Blanchett.  The two groups are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has powers related to a mythical city of gold.<br /><br />Indy, along with his partner Mac, were captured by the Russians in Mexico.  Upon returning to the U.S., Indy and the Russians head to Roswell, New Mexico, site of the infamous "Area 51", which is loaded with secrets.  Indy is forced to locate a box containing the mummified remains of an extra-terrestrial who crashed in the desert.  But, Indy has a surprise in store.  After managing to escape from the Russians, Indy wanders into a specially-constructed city with mannequins designed to measure the effects of an atomic blast.  Indy manages to save himself by hiding inside a lead-protected refrigerator.  But, the adventure's just beginning.<br /><br />Indy is then convinced to head to Peru at the behest of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf).  Mutt's friend Professor Oxley, played by John Hurt, has been captured because he knows the location of the crystal skull. Oxley is also a colleague of Indy's.  It is said that whoever finds the skull and returns it to its rightful place will gain knowledge beyond their wildest dreams.  But, the Russians are on to the skull as well, and its a race between them and Indy to find the skull first.  Along the way, Marion Ravenwood, Indy's original love interest from "Raiders of the Lost Ark" returns, played once again by Karen Allen.  Marion holds a revealing secret that surprises Indy.  Marion has softened somewhat over the years, but she still holds a spell over Indy.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is once again at his swashbuckling best as Professor Jones.  Indy has become Ford's signature role over they years; even above his role of Han Solo in the first "Star Wars" trilogy.  Karen Allen is very good as the gutsy but softer Marion, and Shia LaBeouf does a surprisingly good job as Mutt.  There is lots of great action scenes throughout: I especially liked the scenes with the giant ants, and, of course, there's some great comedy from Indy, too.  This film might not stack up to the first three movies in the series, but it is still very good and definitely worth watching.<br /><br />I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  Its a must-see for Harrison Ford fans and fans of the first three Indiana Jones movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>I don't know about that! To me, "Raiders" will always be the lame one of the bunch! "Raiders" suffers from the same flaws that "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" and "Batman" did: all dazzle and no substance. This one has the same non-stop action, character development, humor and incredible situations and juxtapositions that made "Temple of Doom" and "Last Crusade" so entertaining. However, there's a HUGE Spielbergian element in the hokey mysticism/science involved with the storyline. This is the childish way Spielberg handles ALL his science and/or eldritch goings-on in his movies, and you'd think Lucas would have held that aspect in check in this movie. Alas, he did not!<br /><br />You know the story by now: Indy's closest buds are now dead, (his dad, Marcus,) and Sullah is nowhere to be found. However, another character, Charles Standforth, played by Jim Broadbent, has taken the place of Marcus and has very little to do with this episode outside of being the bearer of bad news in the beginning of the film. Well, after having a run-in with the U.S. Govt. over the elaborate goings-on that open the film, (Indy being coerced into helping Russian operatives track down a mysterious artifact stored in Area 51 in New Mexico,) he's fired from his university job and then gets sucked back into further dealings with der Russkies after a mysterious young man yanks him off a train he was taking home. (*Spoiler Alert!*) What follows are chase scenes from hell involving Indy, a Russian cutlery freak straight out of central casting played by Cate Blanchett, an old colleague whose integrity he overestimated, his old flame, Marion Ravenwood, and surprise, surprise...LITTLE INDY!!<br /><br />After the SPECTACULAR image of the a-bomb going off in the New Mexican desert in the beginning, (and it's a major distention of suspension of disbelief to accept Indy surviving all that radiation,) it was obvious that the visuals in this film were going to be a major focus, as well as action, and the movie doesn't disappoint on either level. It's a non-stop art-director's extravaganza from beginning to end, and MUCH more substantial, I think, than "Raiders", still, to my mind, the weak link in the Indy oeuvre. Make up your own mind on that count....</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>Great fun!

It's a shame he wasn't in it more.<br /><br />Overall I hugely enjoyed this. I knocked one star off because it does get a bit lost in the middle, but otherwise a fantastic action movie with the feelgood factor too.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>I don't think I can cover anything that hasn't already been covered in other reviews.

This series really should have taken the "James Bond Route" and began casting new leads to lend viability to the franchise.  At this point it's too late.  Still, it was fun while it lasted and took me back to the truly great films of the 80s.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In 1957 Nevada, Indiana Jones (Ford) and his sidekick Mac (Winstone) have been kidnapped by Irina Spalko (Blanchett) and her Soviet henchmen.  They break into an American military facility and Spalko enlists Indy's help in finding something.  Indy manages to escape, and soon finds that he has been given a leave of absence from teaching.  Before leaving town, "Mutt" (LeBouf) enlists his help to find Professor Oxley (Hurt), who has gone missing while looking for crystal skulls in South America.  They set off, and soon find themselves face to face with Spalko again, as well as a face from the past - Marion Ravenwood (Allen).<br /><br />"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" could never live up to the hype surrounding it.  One would have hope that is was less disappointing than it is though.  It is good to see Indiana Jones back in action.  George Lucas's desire for the perfect story/script has been the major factor in the delay, and it is ironic that the story/script is the weakest point of the film.  In fact, it is downright silly at times.  Sure, it is good to see Harrison Ford back in action as Indy, but that can only carry a movie so far.  LeBouf and Blanchett are adequate in supporting roles, and it is good to see Karen Allen again.  Marion and Indy recapture some of the magic from "Raiders", but it is not enough.  "Kingdon" will make a bunch of money, that is certain, but it is likely to leave a bit of a sour taste in the viewers' mouths as they leave the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Every summer, there are a number of films so highly anticipated that when they don't meet those expectations, even slightly, people badmouth the end result, angry they wasted their time and money. The film could be 'good', but because it isn't 'great', many people aren't happy. If the expectations weren't so high, the film would receive better word of mouth.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is such an example. Not a perfect film, or a great film, it is, nonetheless, a fun ride and provides a lot of enjoyment. But because this is a sequel to one of the best films ever made, expectations were high. Too high. No one, not even the combined talents of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford could meet these expectations.<br /><br />It is difficult enough to create a magical film. With all of the people involved in any film production, everyone has to be at the top of their game to create a movie experience to be remembered for the ages. "Raiders of the Lost Ark" did that. Sorry, George, I refuse to call it "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark" as you have relabeled it. Quit screwing with the magical films you have created in the past. Stop renaming things and stop adding digital enhancements to your classic films. Stop. But it is almost impossible to capture magic a second time, let alone a third or fourth (depending on how you view the various sequels.<br /><br />"Crystal Skull" has some fun chase and action sequences; an interesting villain, a nice new sidekick and it is great to see Harrison Ford play the role again. It feels like putting on a pair of old slippers. Very comfortable.<br /><br />But those slippers have some holes. That and some technical problems make the experience of watching this film less than stellar.<br /><br />1957. Jones (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick, Mac (Ray Winstone, "Fool's Gold", "Sexy Beast", "Beowulf") have been kidnapped by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and her Russian troops. Spalko has been combing the Earth for artifacts rumored to help people control other people's thoughts and minds. That is her goal. Mind control. Spalko is after a crate she knows Dr. Jones saw about 10 years earlier in New Mexico, so she takes him hostage and brings him to a military warehouse at Area 51 in the Nevada desert. He is incredulous, but has no choice but to help her, due to the sheer number of guns pointed at him. Later, the FBI becomes suspicious of his role in this operation and ransacks his college office, causing the University to fire him. As he is about to head to New York, Mutt (Shia LaBeouf in full "The Wild One" regalia) shows up on his Harley and asks Dr. Jones for his help. His mother, Marion, was taken prisoner by some people in South America after their family friend, Professor Oxley (John Hurt) went crazy trying to find the location of the City of Gold and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cryptic letter leads Jones to help and he and Mutt are soon off to Peru to help find Marion and Ox. There, they run into Irina again, who has Marion and Ox in her custody. Jones is soon happy to learn that Marion is Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and Mutt is their son. Will they be able to get past all of these complications to find the fabled City of Gold and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?<br /><br />The "Indiana Jones" films are Spielberg and Lucas' tribute and homage to the Saturday afternoon serials they used to watch in theaters when they were kids. The same sort of matinees made with zero budgets and zombies, monsters from mars, ghosts, Flash Gordon and other fantastical heroes and villains. When you start applying logic to a film based on such subject matter, you might go as crazy as John Hurt's character in the newest installment. So, when there are definite holes in the script, you have to decide if you want to go along for the ride, or start dissecting the film and pointing out all of the various problems. For the most part, I chose to take the ride and had a lot of fun. There is an event that happens near the beginning of the film, which proves to have no consequence to the rest of the story. This was more problematic for me than anything else, but I'm willing to overlook even that. "Indiana Jones" is all about the thrill ride and "Crystal Skull" provides a number of sequences with this type of endorphin thrill.<br /><br />Harrison Ford returns as Dr. Jones, the intrepid archaeologist who works part time as a college professor and finds himself embroiled in some outlandish plots. In "Crystal Skull", Lucas, Spielberg and David Koepp (who wrote the screenplay based on Lucas' story) have taken a real thing and formed a story around it. This follows the modus operandi of the other installments. In "Crystal Skull", they use the discovery of such an item as the springboard to create a whole history and mythology for the characters to discover over the course of the film. Some people may find this creation interesting and fun. Others will (and are) discounting it immediately, for face value. But these same critics should remember back to the original material these films are based on in the first place. Flash Gordon. Monsters from Mars. The like.<br /><br />The key to "Indiana Jones" is the elaborate action, special effects and production values applied to these same fantastical ideas. In "Crystal Skull", there is a lot of effort to make everything seem very normal and real. But in a number of instances, I noticed a stunt double sitting in for Ford and other actors and there seemed to be a couple of instances of noticeable green screen use. These are not acceptable. One of the best things about these films is that "Ford always does most of his own stunts". When they use a stunt double during a relatively tame motorcycle chase, it just spoils the illusion. And you can always tell when they are using a stunt double; the hair is always slightly off and the scene is shot from behind and far away. Or the character has their face turned away from the camera. These moments, and the plot hole I mentioned earlier do a lot of damage, but they don't ruin the film.<br /><br />In the earlier films, Spielberg and his cinematographer, Douglas Slocombe worked very hard to give the films the look of an old film from the 30s or 40s, to match the era in which they were set. This gives the films a rich, lush look. In "Crystal Skull", Spielberg works with Janusz Kaminski and the look is very different. Everything seems to be infused with light, bright white light seeping from the edges. I think this was done for a couple of reasons. The film is set in 1957, and the beginning of the story takes place in the Nevada desert. But it also seems like this might have been done to help disguise the true age of some of the characters. It almost seemed like gauze or Vaseline had been used on the lens a few times. This infusion of light might be designed to help cover this up and make everything seem a little washed out, a little blurry. What better way to hide the signs of aging?<br /><br />Harrison Ford is back in a role so tailor made for him, so comfortable, you can't do anything but welcome him back. He is clearly having a lot of fun, even if the role seems to be a bit of a strain for him at this age, that he becomes instantly watch able again. Watching him portray Jones again almost helps to erase some of the abysmal performances he has done in the years since his last outing as Dr. Jones. Almost. I'm afraid "Hollywood Homicide" is just too bad to forget. That and "Random Hearts". But for the few truly terrible performances he has done in the last 19 years, he has also created a number of memorable roles, like Dr. Richard Kimball in "The Fugitive", like Jack Ryan in "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger", like President James Marshall in "Air Force One". When Ford is on his game, there is no one better. Ford's return as Indiana Jones is welcome, but a bit of a strain to watch. He is clearly 19 years older to match the 19 years since "Last Crusade", and isn't as nimble as he once was, but the fedora and leather jacket still fit like a glove.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is memorable as Irina Spalko, "Stalin's fair haired girl". She takes people prisoner left and right and seems to have no problem taking over a military base on U.S. soil. Nothing will stand in her way because she is so intent on her goal. She is a brazen woman, perhaps more so because she seems to have the unconditional support of her boss, Stalin, the leader of her country and a very powerful figure in the Cold War. She is a cultured woman and addresses Dr. Jones in a cultured voice, like most movie villains of yesteryear. She can also wield a mean sword and uses this weapon to fight off an attack by Mutt.<br /><br />Speaking of Mutt, Shia LaBeouf is very good as Mutt. For a while, I have heard reports about rumors swirling on the Internet, about two aspects of this film. Unfortunately, these seem to be the worst kept secrets in movie history because both are essentially true. Mutt is Marion's son, but when he initially shows up to meet Dr. Jones, he doesn't know they are related any more than Dr. Jones does. Mutt is all sneer and attitude and LaBeouf seems to be channeling the spirit of James Dean or Marlon Brando. Mutt rides a motorcycle, wears a leather jacket and slicks back his hair with a comb dipped in soda pop. When Indiana says something Mutt mistakes as an insult, he grabs his switchblade in a threatening manner, threatening no one but himself. As the story progresses, they each eventually learn the truth. When it doesn't immediately register with Indiana, Marion tells him "It's not that hard, Indy."<br /><br />And Spielberg clearly enjoys the work of the new, younger sidekick, so much so, he lets his inner child get the better of him a few times. Initially, there are a couple of ideas used in the story that seem fun, at first, but they are so overused they quickly become tedious. There are three or four such instances.<br /><br />Karen Allen returns to play Marion Ravenwood, Indy's true love and it is nice to see her participating in the adventure. Ray Winstone plays Mac, Indy's partner in adventure and his role is meant to provide some complications, but it isn't deep enough to make a lasting impression. John Hurt plays Professor Oxley and he spends most of the film in a delusional state, spouting crazy information only Indiana seems to understand. Jim Broadbent has a small role as the Dean of the College where Indiana works.<br /><br />When we finally get a clue as to the meaning behind the Crystal Skull (and as soon as you see it, you'll know what it is supposed to be), the rest of the story falls into place and the big finale makes sense. As much sense as anything in this type of story could. This involves the second Internet theory leaked a while ago. Again, one of the worst kept secrets in movie history. When we first see the Crystal Skull, which is quite early in the film, you have to be prepared to go along for the ride. If you aren't, nothing they do will make the film work for you. If you can suspend belief and take the ride along with the characters, you'll have fun.<br /><br />Where will "Indiana Jones 4" fall in film history? That is up to you... and you... and you to determine. For me, it is all but impossible to make a film to rival the original "Raider of the Lost Ark". The third installment "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade", featuring Sean Connery as Indiana's dad and River Phoenix in a prologue as a young Indiana Jones, came close. Very close. The second installment, "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" is widely acknowledged as the low point of the series. So, I would rank this fourth installment better than "Temple of Doom", but not as good as "Last Crusade".</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Great action scenes and special effects (even though Spielburg said there wouldn't be so many, there are quite a few...but I think they're cool and still fit well with the Indiana Jones universe).<br />*Cameramanship and photography are great.  A little different and more dynamic than the originals (I think because Spielburg's style has naturally changed that way), but is still very cool.<br />*Interesting story with lots of interesting supernatural, archeological, and sociological elements (although it is pretty outlandish).<br />*Maintained proper pace, style, and mood of the original series.  Has lots of humor, some gnarly parts, and loads of exciting adventure.<br />*Remained accurate to the 1950s, in regards to politics, society, and culture (some parts made me think of "American Graffitti"...must be a Lucas thing...).<br />*Good continuation of the characters.  Indy is still cool, despite his age.  Marion (Karen Allen) is good (although I think she could have used more screen time).  Mutt (Shia LaBeouf)  was pretty good.  Cate Blanchett made a great villian.  Good acting all around.<br />*Some good homages to the original movies (although I think it was a bit much in the opening scene).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Storyline, even though I thought it was cool, can also be seen as outlandish.  You may consider it to be silly, overblown, or too far-out (although I think it's still handled gracefully, and fits well with the Indiana Jones universe).  For that matter, this is the same type of story you would see in one of the Indy computer games.<br />*The nuclear explosion in the opening scenes (although pretty darn  cool) is kind of pointless.<br />*They never followed up on the FBI harassing Indy (then again, maybe it's not important).<br />*Lots of new characters are thrown out there, and are not nearly as familiar as any of the original characters (sorry, no Marcus and no egyptian dude).  But they do all right for themselves.<br />*Ultimately, this film does lack the original freshness and originality of the originals.  Some parts may even make you think of other Spielburg films...<br /><br />Despite having a very supernatural plot, this movie is quite exciting.  It maintains the same mood, style, and pacing of the originals.  It could even be seen as being better, now that Spielburg is a more matured director and has done more complex camerawork (whereas the original Indy films have been kind of plain and static).  Even though he said there wouldn't be so many special effects, I think there are loads of them; I think it's very cool, but others may not agree.  But no matter what you think about the quality of the film, or its characters, or plot, it is very fun to watch.  All Indy fans should check it out by all means.  Action/adventure fans may even like it  too; it looks to be one of the best that will come out this year.<br /><br />In a nutshell too, this would be to Indiana Jones what "Live Free or Die Hard" was to Die Hard.  The two are very similar in some ways.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Truth be told, the latest Indiana Jones installment, nineteen years after the last, is fine, rollicking popcorn entertainment and not nearly the major disappointment some critics would lead you to believe. It may not compete with Iron Man in terms of story freshness or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T8C">Spider-Man 3</a> for state-of-the-art CGI effects, but I never felt producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg had much more on their combined minds than updating the outrageous derring-do of the Saturday afternoon matinee serials of the 1930's and 40's. With the predominant use of traditional stunt work and pyrotechnics, the 2008 film represents old-fashioned escapism at its purest and falters only when the convoluted plot gets in the way, which is quite often, especially in the exposition-heavy first half. Fortunately, the veteran hands keep the high-spirited adventure afloat over its 123-minute running time, even though it never quite achieves the breathlessly excitement of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>, an inevitable fate for all the sequels.<br /><br />Written by David Koepp (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a>), the overcrowded story is set at the height of the Cold War in 1957, as the aging Jones finds himself captured by a group of Russian soldiers in legendary Area 51 out in the Nevada desert. Headed by Colonel Irina Spalko, a severely mannered doctor with psychic abilities, they force him to find a crate with the remains of an extraterrestrial inside (shades of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2IPP0">E.T.</a>). This leads to a terrifically energetic warehouse fight sequence that quickly reassures us that the filmmakers have not forgotten what the chief lure of the series is. Jones next manages to escape a nuclear test blast through creative means, at which point the movie calms down with the professor back at Marshall College. Forced to leave the university due to an FBI investigation, Jones meets a young motorcycle greaser named "Mutt" Williams, who tells him that his old colleague Harold Oxley is lost in the Peruvian jungle looking for the mysterious crystal skull.<br /><br />Once in Peru in the film's last hour, the action brings all the characters together, including Spalko and her soldiers, on a maddening chase for not only the skull but the secret temple from which it came. In the middle of the morass is Jones' old love and Mutt's mother, the still-feisty Marion Ravenwood. There's a wildly enjoyable chase scene on the edge of a steep cliff that has everything thrown in - a rapid-fire machine gun on a turret, fanciful swordplay, wine-swinging, aggressive howler monkeys, and an army of man-eating red ants. The last scenes bring the science fiction aspect into focus with Spielberg in familiar territory, and I have to admit that a lot of the climactic excitement is undercut by too many characters that are relatively incidental to the action at hand. Throughout the film, you'll see winking tributes to Lucas' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322737X">American Graffiti</a> and Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADD4">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>.<br /><br />At 65, Harrison Ford wears his age well, meeting the physical demands of the role head-on, and what comes across is a smart actor who innately understands the mythic qualities of his character while having fun with the outlandish situations he faces in quick succession. It's great to see Karen Allen, still with her wide, infectious smile, come back as Marion, but other than a few toss-off lines and her character's gutsy driving skills, she is given little to do this time. An actress as vibrant as Allen should be used for more than nostalgic purposes. As Spalko with her harsh Louise Brooks-style bob and using a bit of the Dietrich accent she used in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OY8NBK">The Good German</a>, Cate Blanchett is obviously having a good time playing a military dominatrix with equal parts Garbo in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009S4IJW">Ninotchka</a> and Natasha Fatale, Boris' taller half. My only complaint is that the filmmakers don't make Spalko evil enough to be truly as menacing as Blanchett could be.<br /><br />As the obvious successor to the series, Shia LeBeouf plays the cocksure "Mutt" as a young Brando wannabe (circa <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767818172">The Wild One</a>), but he lacks the genuine swagger and dangerous edge to make the character more than a plot device to attract younger viewers. Ray Winstone as the loyalty-shifting Mac, John Hurt as Oxley, and Jim Broadbent as Jones' fellow academic all play their smaller roles with their usual &eacute;lan, although I wish each one was given more opportunity to shine here. On the upside, John Williams' heroic music score is intact, and cinematographer Janusz Kami&ntilde;ski does a nice job succeeding Douglas Slocombe in picking up on the look of the previous films. The movie is just a little too busy to be a complete home run for the series, but it should satisfy long-time fans who have clamored for Indy's return. Judged from that perspective, it succeeds.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Searching the past for crystal skulls is something archaeologists have done.<br />There have been lots of stories about how the ones known are modern forgeries.<br />The sculptures in the desert that can only be seen from the air are true.<br />There have been speculation that the cotton, straw boats and cocaine<br />connect Peru's ancient civilization to ancient Egypt.<br />Many of the ancient civilizations shared things like pyramid building, sun, and moon worship and astrology, but scientific historians put that down to parallel evolution as the different civilizations were based on different staple grains. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1843330520">The Return of the Gods: Evidence of Extraterrestrial Visitations</a>  and other such books have<br />inspired a lot of thought.

It lacks every quality for which the originals were so loved: plot, energy, pace, imagination, suspense, smart dialogue, surprising humour and spine-tingling moments of religious wonder. Such a heady mixture regularly had you grinning from ear to ear. This time around you'll be sitting there in slack-jawed wonderment at the lameness of it all. What the hell happened? A dire screenplay, for one thing, which seems cobbled together from several variants. Rather than setting up a simple goal as the driver for an array of action set-pieces, it seems content just to wander around aimlessly plundering the originals for references. Don't blame David Koepp. He's a reasonable writer, but here seems to have been hired as a typist. No, this cack-handed travesty has the stink of George Lucas all over it - the man who, let's face it, spent the last decade boring us senseless with the storyless downfall of that irritating sap, Anakin Skywalker. Where's Howard Hawks-devotee Lawrence Kasdan when you need him? What happened to the version Frank Darabont wrote? Surely it wasn't worse than this. Performances are fine, but they can't salvage it. Ford is grizzled but convincing because his age is acknowledged. Shia LaBeouf adds some cheek and youthful spark. Karen Allen's sass is tempered with girlish affection and the few snatches of dialogue Marion shares with Indy are among the film's best. Cate Blanchett might happily have brought her stagecraft to a ludicrous caricature, but she isn't given a chance to save the day. The screenplay forbids it. Overall, this is a tremendously disappointing film. Sure, expectations were high. But that's not unreasonable: when one of the world's best filmmakers revives one of the world's most loved series you expect he'll make an effort. None is in evidence here. This is the laziest film Spielberg has ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>I was such a fan of Indiana Jones when it first came out.  The beauty of the premise was it revolved around a very complex man who lived two lives; that of a Professor and that of a globe trotting archeologist.  Even though the second movie (Temple of Doom) was the most disappointing, it was still better then this over the top attempt to make more money on a popular franchise.<br /><br />Once again, Spielberg & Lucas do it THEIR way.  It doesn't matter if they break the barriers of realism.  C'MON GUYS, I used to love your work.  And sadly, they know exactly what they're doing.  War of the Worlds wasn't like this!<br /><br />So what happened to the first movie we all know and loved?  Raiders of the Lost Ark came on to the scene as a breakthrough genre, making the Saturday morning serials that I'm too young to remember come to life...and Ford played it perfectly.  He was born for the role.  Indiana Jones ventured his way across the global, finding artifacts and history.  Sometimes having to fight his way through a world where civilization had not found it's foothold.  There were great stunts, great villains and most all...the fun that comes with going on that journey.  The supernatural element of Raiders was kept to a minimum.  We were teased throughout about the `Power of God' and the influence of the Ark.  So when something out of this world happened, we believed it.  It was scary.  And most of all, it worked at the most minimal state.<br /><br />Now...Indy is surviving an atomic explosion in a refrigerator!?  I don't care how much lead that thing was lined with, he would have been smear on the inside when it finally stopped!  And falling over not just one 80 foot waterfall in an amphibious car...BUT THREE?!  That car would have been splintered on the first fall!  This puts Indiana Jones in a Superhero, indestructible category and de-humanizes him.  And he barely got hurt.  By the third act of Raiders, he was almost incapacitated.  But we were routing for him to keep going.  By the third act of this one it was apparent that nothing could kill him, so I didn't care anymore.<br /><br />None of this might have bothered me too much if the movie had been really entertaining...but it wasn't.  Quite frankly it bored me at times.  I was glad to see Karen Allen return and some of the nostalgia was nice to see.  I like Shai LeBouf but he is Spielberg's golden boy of the moment and he's putting him in every movie he can.  He just seemed like an add-in here.  I've always admired Ford though.  He still persists as a great action hero despite his age.  He looked a little more haggard when doing his stunts and his punches didn't have the finesse they used too, but he looked great for his age.  He altered Indy's demeanor for this role to reflect his senior status and how things had changed.  Unfortunately the script could really carry the weight of the situation.<br /><br />I felt like after watching this movie Spielberg and Lucas were saying, `Ha!  You wanted it so bad we knew we could make it over the top and still get your money.'  For Spielberg, a man who uses so many digital composite shots and green screens, yet claims he loves movies for the grandeur of making movies, it's hard to believe he won't shoot a film on digital like his friend George.  Seems like quite a hypocrisy.  I should have known.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>WARNING: This review contains spoilers!<br /><br />After 19 years, Indiana Jones returns to the silver screen in what may be Steven Spielberg's worst film ever (or until now, anyway). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a bust. The screenplay was amateurishly written and the film itself is directed with juvenile enthusiasm. The overall mood of the picture doesn't even feel like that of Indiana Jones, but rather more like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1SZAO">National Treasure</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CWESA">The Mummy Returns</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ1">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a>. This is not the Indiana Jones that I grew up with, certainly not the anti-establishment, cynical yet humorous hero who went on adventures with a devil-may-care attitude.<br />Now there are a few positive things to say about this film (not many). Mainly Harrison Ford still has "it". He's fantastic as Indiana Jones as he always has been and probably always will be. Unfortunately the way his character is written seems to contradict his persona of the original three films. In one scene when confronted with a group of clich&eacute; Communist villains intent upon his destruction, they ask him if he has any last words... he responds, "I like Ike." What the fedora?<br />As for the Communists in the film, they are in no way an accurate portrayal of Socialism. They are nothing more than fill-ins for the Nazis of Raiders and Last Crusade. There is no historical value in their portrayal here, none. I had no idea that the filmmakers were going to turn Indiana Jones into a conservative, narrow-minded hypocrite. I'm not coming to the defense of the Soviets in their actions but to the defense of the history of politics.  And as for the idea that Communists have always been fascinated with the occult and psychic abilities, this is only partially true. In the 1940s and `50s, some dictatorial figures in the Soviet Union were interested in ideas such as mind control. But this is a very small group of fanatics, most of which never came into power. However the idea that the Communists held the same plebian concepts about the occult that Hitler did, is an insult. (One of the main ideas behind Communism was that religion on a whole operated on two simple and destructive emotive factors: fear and the need to invert it into faith, and hate with its initial birth from ignorance and beliefs concerning superiority and inferiority. For further studies of this subject, try reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591023068">And God Created Lenin: Marxism vs Religion in Russia 1917-1929</a>, which examines the conflict between Communism and Christianity.)<br /><br />Indy searches for a fabled crystal skull that may hold great power, which is why the Soviets are after it. Other plot elements include the discovery of an ancient Aztec civilization, Indiana Jones reunites with Marion, Mutt Williams becomes Indy's young sidekick and a traitorous spy weaves in and out of the story. Not to mention the aliens. Correction: "Inner-dimensional Beings".<br /><br />The entire plot feels something akin to an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002W4TNA">Ed Wood</a> film. Now I'm not one to compare films (I find it to be elitist and narrow-minded) but since Spielberg and Lucas seem to feel that recycling all their old films into new ones is acceptable, I don't feel that I will have lowered myself at all. This could be viewed as the Indiana Jones equivalent to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006HBUJ">Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</a>. In fact Indy even uses the classic Star Wars line, "I've got a bad feeling about this." And that's not the only reference to other Spielberg and Lucas films. The "beings" look just like those in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters</a>.<br />There's even a scene in which Indy climbs into a refrigerator to escape a nuclear blast while on a test site in the Nevada desert. This entire scene is simply an in-joke that refers to an old version of the screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AL1E">Back to the Future</a>. In that early draft Doc's time machine was a refrigerator and Marty was only able to escape the `50s by going to a nuclear test site in the Nevada desert. Notice the mindless repetition. There are of course other in-jokes that revolve around the Indiana Jones films as well. Hey, did you just see the Lost Ark? Uh, huh.<br />When will directors learn that sequels are often unnecessary? We didn't need three sequels to Jaws, the prequels to Star Wars, the sequels to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCE918">Jurassic Park</a> or this pathetically inadequate sequel to Indiana Jones. Why do they feel the need to re-release their classic films with new special effects and new footage? Why do we suffer through summers of endless sequels, prequels, remakes and spin-offs? I'll tell you why. Most of the directors have lost not only their originality but also their artistic integrity. They're greedy, capitalist schmucks. They don't care about the fans of their films or of their characters. They only care about merchandising, exploiting their fame, and making as much money off their once brilliant ideas as possible. It's sad really.<br />I'm not one to dictate to others but if you're a fan of Indiana Jones, I'd suggest you skip this and go watch the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">DVDs of the originals</a>. In fact you'd probably be best if you didn't even acknowledge this fiasco of a film. I know that ignoring the new Star Wars and Indiana Jones films may seem juvenile and melodramatic to some, but not as juvenile and melodramatic as the films themselves are. In conclusion the Indiana Jones legacy is history. Its remnants shall be lost along with those of other franchises driven into the dirt by greedy filmmakers.<br />The only way to bring Indy back would be to have him go back in time and erase this part of his story arc. Yes, that's it! He should meet up with Doc Brown and build a time machine and go back in time. And perhaps he'll go back too far and end up in the Cretaceous Period where he'll be forced to fight off the Jurassic Park dinosaurs only to be saved by E.T. and Chewbacca. Really, this would be great. In fact I think someone should pitch this idea to Spielberg. *<br /><br />* = ironic statement</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>I thought that "Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade" was pretty bad, but this is the ultimate stinker!  Why did they do this?  Harrison Ford is old and decrepit these days.  The sound man probably had to edit out all his wheezing when he just bent down to pick up his hat.  So I can imagine he was struggling a lot with some of the scenes where a stuntman wouldn't work.  And that energetic "Indiana Jones" theme music was ridiculous to hear knowing that Harrison Ford was probably ready to pass out from running so much on the screen.<br /><br />No, I won't be buying this DVD.  God, I hope they don't do another "Indiana Jones", at least not with Harrison Ford.  It's OK to get another younger actor.  They do for James Bond and it seems to work.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones" is a great saga to continue (perhaps with a better story writer), but Harrison Ford should move on to something else.  How about "Grumpy Old Men III".<br /><br />I hope I can convince my kids to watch "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" now that I've seen them put their fingers to their noses to this one.  I can't blame them that they were disappointed watching this with me.<br /><br />And one more thing; CGI is really killing the appeal of movie these days.  It's like watching cartoons being put in the movie and we're suppose to take it seriously? The old-fashion visual effects and the lack of CGI is probably the reason why the original "Star Wars" trilogy was more visually believable and entertaining than the over-saturated CGI effects of the "Star Wars" prequel.<br /><br />Does anyone else agree?</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Looking forward to a bit of Indiana Jones nostalgia, we rented this DVD with high hopes.  High expectations may be what thwarted us, but this one just didn't hold up to the original Indiana Jones trilogy.  There were dangerous insects, collapsing temples, car chases--all the requisite stuff for an Indy movie, but somehow the cleverness, the humor, and the heart were missing.  Interactions between Indy and his old girlfriend and her son were wooden and forced and didn't really get the viewer on board.  My favorite part was a sword fight between two men on fast-traveling, side-by-side jeeps, but much of the movie seemed like old stuff rehashed.  Harrison Ford is still Harrison Ford, though a bit older and grayer, and that was worth about 2 of the 3 stars.  Watch it if you must, but be forewarned that it is only a shadow of the first 3 movies in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Saw this one in Baltimore's beautiful and historic Senator Theater. It is a high-action adventure flick, like the other Indy movies. Indy might be getting older but he can still whoop arse. This time, Indy is going after a crystal skull that can pass information psychically to others (through their minds). The Russians want the skull and the FBI is snooping around too. The movie begins with a caravan of military vehicles across the desert. And that's about all I can tell you, without telling you too much, except that Karen Allen returns from the 1st Indy movie, where she was Indy's adventure girl against the Nazi's for the Arc of the Covenant. Cate Blanchette is the Russian "bad guy" in the flick. (She plays one of those smart arses that you wanna slap.) Excellent flick and a fast 2 hours. It's probably ok for most kids about age 7 and up?. (There are some skeletons and a few people get toasted with flames and shot, so, use your judgement.) I loved it and would see it again in a heartbeat (even though I thought the end was a little squirrelly)!  It's the same type adventure as the other 2 Indy movies.<br /><br />If you want to find out more about crystal skulls, you might enjoy reading "The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future" by Chris Morton. This book contains a whole lot of Mayan cultural and historical information.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Not bad love the action, shia lebouf (love him)but at times thought it drag on in the middle because i kind of fell asleep in the middle of the movie as well as my husband. so i would actually rate this 3.75 STARS. not BAD just not PERFECT still watchable and enjoyable.

If that is not enough we have new actors of great caliber and some new one liners to repeat to friends and family. Everything that made the original Indiana Jones films has been intensified.<br /><br />Karen Allen's character is just as cute and feisty as ever. It takes a couple of double takes to realize that Col. Dr. Irina Spalko is the Academy Award wining Cate Blanchett in a Natasha outfit. I could go on but it is time for you to see for your self.<br /><br />My favorite scene is where Indy is being showered down, hosed off and scrubbed. Watch closely as he is being scrubbed in a private part of his anatomy and has to make a broom adjustment.<br />--------------------------------------<br />It is the height of the Cold War. The Ruskies are looking for an upper hand. Naturally they look for the super natural or inter-dimensional physic advantage. And of course they get Dr. Hennery Jones Jr. (much older Harrison Ford) to unwittingly play into their hands. With the help of a young sidekick Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) he must find a crystal skull in an effort to free his kidnapped associate Henry Oxley (John Hurt). In the process he has to navigate between two independent women Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and Marion Ravenswood (Karen Allen.)<br /><br />Watch the movie to find out the mystery of the skull and if Indy, oops Hennery Jones Jr. will succeed or stick his fedora in it.

What is there new to say?<br /><br />I adore Harrison Ford. Has he won that special Oscar yet? He should (but not for this role). Let's get right on to Karen Allen. "Marian, you're going to drive off the cliff." "Trust me, Indie. I know what I'm doing," and she does. She drives right onto a tree over the river and the car is gently delivered into the water. Wow! How is this possible? Because she is older and better? Because this is an Indiana Jones movie and the characters can do darn well anything they set their minds to doing. Then they skee-daddle right over a huge waterfall in that car. No problem. No broken bones. No concussions. Everyone lands a foot from their sitting place in the car and hops right back in. Then they do it again two more times over two more waterfalls.<br /><br />But my favorite action scene is when Indie and is-his-name-Mutt-or-Mudd? are riding the motorcycle through campus, trying to escape mad Russians representative of the Three Stooges minus one. Indie is pulled off the bike right through that little car window. After he wrestles around with the Stooge a bit, he slips right out that window onto the motorcycle again! Holy Moly! At his age he's that agile?<br /><br />One other thing that seriously bothered me was Indie opening the cocoons and allowing the folks inside to puff--go up in dust! No posterity! You'd think an archaeologist would know better.<br /><br />I do have a favorite scene: At the end when he and Marian kiss, it's such an old geezer kiss. Come on, Lucas and Spielberg, even as geezers we can still pucker out a wet one.<br /><br />I dozed off during this movie. I dozed during an Indiana Jones movie! What's wrong with the world? And that kid? Please don't make him the next "Indie" He doesn't have IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>This latest chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has been a hard movie for me to review. I loved the movie, but it wasn't perfect. A lot of the problems others have hated about it, never bothered me. I want to write it a glorious review because it's Indy, I had fun, and this character means a lot to me. 1984's "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" was my introduction to the character and his world, and it was a childhood shaping experience for me. Saw it in the theater 10 times. It means a lot, and so did this movie. Indy's return. There are little creaks here and there, but I enjoyed the heck out of most of it. I've already written two other reviews for it elsewhere, but took a long time to do this one. Why?. For it to settle in and to really get my thoughts, since those other reviews I wrote seemed to be based in childhood nostalgia for me and could of been better. Again, this has been a tough movie for me to review.<br /><br />First and foremost, Indiana Jones is back after a 19 year absence from our silver screens. There is no doubt that it is a most welcome return, nor is there any doubt that Indy is still Indy, or that Harrison Ford can still deliver the goods. Plot-wise, it doesn't hold up as much. Indy tries to find a crystal skull before those pesky russians(headlined by Cate Blanchett, who is both good and channeling femme fatale Natasha from "Rocky And Bullwinkle")do, and so on and so on. It's really nothing new and, quite frankly, gets kinda confusing and bizarre as it goes along. Story and plot is not KOTCS's strongest suit. Along for the adventure is Marlon Brando wannabe Mutt(Shia LaBeauf), as well as Indy's former love, Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen).<br /><br />KOTCS is both steeped in warm nostalgia and a new world. It's Indy, looks like Indy, feels like Indy, but there is something different. Coming almost two decades later, that's to be expected. Director Steven Spielberg is still a master at directing summer popcorn fare, and he knows how to do a tight action scene(key being the motorcycle chase thru campus)like nobody else. Effects wise, there are some startling moments and some very CGI moments, but the CGI never distracted me from the movie like it did others. In fact, I thought it all looked really good. After a while, you do long for the good old days of the earlier Indy films, but it still worked for me. And Spielberg, well, there is still plenty of Spielberg magic left in the guy, and some of that is on display here.<br /><br />Harison Ford is 65. So what?. He doesn't look much older or different than he did 10 years ago, and he is in incredible shape. He's a man's man, and a man's hero, and he is more than up to snuff to put the fedora back on. He and the character are a bit older, but nothing much else has changed. He still hates snakes(in one of the film's funniest and most endearing moments), and he still has that spark. LaBeauf is not the 'Jar Jar Binks' of the movie. He is quite charming, actually, and more than holds his own. It was also great to see Karen Allen back, but I felt she was relegated to just 'one of the gang', and wasn't given all that she could of been given. Still, she did a fine job, and she looks incredible. Not much difference with her either.<br /><br />In the end, KOTCS is a fun movie. It's an entertaining movie. It's an Indiana Jones movie. Some of it is silly, some of it is exciting, and all of it is fun to watch from beginning to end. The story of the film is shaky, and as the film goes along, it gets even more wobbly. The climax to the plot is somewhat head scratching, and I am still torn by it. But the very, very end of the movie, the last scene, is fantastic. All in all, it was a nearly 20 year reunion in the making and, for the most part, it was most welcomed. Like any reunion with someone in some place you haven't been in decades, there are some awkward moments, but it's still a good experience and you are glad you went.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones is back and those who love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">the original films</a>, especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>, will be placed under the spell of nostalgic bliss until you realize the following:  That Harrison Ford is just a cranky old man punching-in for one last paycheck; John Hurt is Raspberry Award destined every single time without proper directorial guidance; Ray Winstone's character was seemingly forced into the screenplay, no one cares who he is or why he is there; the hype about how Shia LaBeouf is entirely undeserving of any and all kinds of hype is spot on; George Lucas is fat-headed and out of touch with what made the original films great, and really, after Jar-Jar how are we surprised?; and Karen Allen smiles in every scene as if she can't believe for one second that she is in a  $185 million dollar movie, and neither could I.  I will say in all fairness that Cate Blanchett is as professional as to be expected.  There are scenes in this film that capture the excitement and unlikely humorous action of the original three, but where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Temple of Doom</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Last Crusade</a> at times teetered on pushing the degree to which I will suspend disbelief in exchange for a laugh, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls doesn't assume I want to believe any of its shenanigans.  I don't want to be critical of the fundamental science fiction/historical fiction story, because it could've worked in the right hands and with actors and filmmakers who knew the magic they had with the original films.  Surprise! They're cashing in this time around kids, so don't be fooled.<br /><br />Harrison Ford has bits of that same presence but his effort is clearly lacking.  He plays Dr. Jones as if he just doesn't seem impressed with discovering these artifacts anymore.  His performances in the earlier films expressed that of a passionate archeologist, someone who cares tremendously about the artifact he must recover and preserve.  He wanted to stop the Nazis from getting the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail because they were arrogant enough to think they were actually worthy of such power.  They were plunderers. There was a lesson in there and even though it was just an action film, the message was a little more than just "Nazis, I hate these guys".  None of that exists here in the fourth installment.  The passion behind discovering history's most provoking questions seems to have been lost and that is after all why Indy would do absolutely anything, including jump from a horse into a moving jeep with eight armed men, to recover an item and ensure that it is kept from those who would abuse its power.  Besides, Han Solo and Indy are two great heroes but with all due respect, in interviews Harrison Ford gives me the creeps.  He has that creepy earring and that subtle and cold arrogance.  I hate criticizing celebrities but he just doesn't come off as a likeable guy and there are times during this film that he isn't really acting at all, so it is kind of relevant to mention.<br /><br />I want to explain what completely ruined this film for me.  I was actually prepared to give this three or four stars and a slight recommendation until the film started to climax and the unbelievable happened.  Even among scenes of CGI dancing, landing on rocks as if they were pillows, cheesy and rushed written dialogue etc., I could not believe it when one character was knocked from a cavalry of moving vehicles in the jungle and into some vines above.  Somehow this character miraculously obtained the ability to telepathically communicate to the monkeys in the same way that Aquaman communicates with fish, and so they followed as he made his through the jungle via vine-swinging like Tarzan.  Perhaps this was because the scorpion that bit him earlier was radioactive?  It is the kind of scene the skews everything for me.  I began to realize I was watching a bad movie and I grew quite sad.<br /><br />I would listen to anyone who says that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest adventure film ever made, so my realization halfway through Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls was profoundly disheartening.  I loved these movies but as with any sequel, there are too many powers banking on the idea that the success of the original can be equaled.  Unfortunately for us, $311 million dollars later and they are still right.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>The first movie was written and directed like the old serials of the 40's and 50's had been, Raiders Of the Lost Ark was awsome. Temple Of Doom, fell flat on it's face. Not too hard, but it fell. Indian Jones and the last crusade was terrific, sean connery playing his dad. Bringing some of the characters from the first movie into the last one was great. Steven spielberg and george lucas caught lightning in a bottle, with this series. Then came 2008, and the fourth Indiana Jones movie. It opened up descently enough, with him and his new found friend being taken to Area 51 by the Russians. We get a cameo shot of the Ark, which is all well and good. But one major problem poked it's ugly little head early for me, Harrison Ford is old and he looked it. I would've had no problem with a fourth movie say 2 years after the third one, but not 19 years later! Anyway, the Russians want him to look for one of the crystal skulls that's hidden at Area 51, he escapes. But not after having a showdown with one of the bad guys deep in the bowels of area 51, and getting strapped to a land rocket. But wait....... there's more, he finds himself in a nuclear test site. And MANAGES TO SURVIVE THE NUCLEAR BLAST BY JUMPING INTO A LEADLINED REFIDGERATOR, now some of you may think i'm nitpicking. But I'm not, in the specials section. Steven spielberg had to george Lucas, he didn't want to do a fourth movie. Lucas and Ford begged and begged for him to do it, Lucas had even written the script. And spielberg finally agreed to do it, but only if there weren't any aliens. Since that's how Lucas had pitched the idea for the movie, Lucas agreed, AND CHANGED THEM TO INTERDIMENSIONAL BEINGS. Yep, complete with a flying saucer at the end. We even get marion in this, annnnd it's almost like why?!, really?! This movie  was also very glossy, unlike the other movies. Indiana Jones has always been about archeology, not aliens. And that is where they failed, even the original score felt out of place. I kept wanting this movie to get better, and it never did. Not even close.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This movie is just regurgitated garbage from Speilberg and Lucas. It like its lead actor is a tire old worn out mess. And what do they do to spruce up this old hag of a movie? Why they throw in a young sidekick! And who better than to play it but Mrs. Speilberg herself Shia 'I am not really good looking, not really talented, and not really anything special... except to Stephen) Lebeouf! Yipeee!<br /><br />Save your money and rent 1 or 3 and if you want to prove how bad this pile of dung is watch 2 it is even better than this.<br /><br />Harrison Ford? Retire please. You are worn out and  you haven't done anything origional or even good in years. Lucas? Keep sitting on  your big pile of money and keep producing the same two movies over and over and over. Speilberg? Take your girlfriend and get on Death Star and go to Dantooeen forever. This movie is a bloated old worn out mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Ugh, not a good movie. I was thoroughly disappointed on the whole with the new Indiana Jones movie and was glad that I only saw it via dvd rental.<br /><br />Yes, the action was good and non-stop as to be expected, but the storyline wasn't even good. The previous three Indiana Jones movies had a pleasant balance of both action and storyline, but not this one.<br /><br />Also, the action scenes seemed to be down almost entirely of CG/computer graphics and the CG looked so fake and unreal, which was another let down while watching this movie. I'd have thought with all the technology out there today, that the CG would have been a lot better quality... I guess I thought wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is perhaps about as good as one could expect after all these years, the biggest problem with it is that while I remember the excitement-a-minute of the first three films, regarding this new one and bringing up Hannibal Lecter: "my pulse never got above 80". The biggest complaint I have about the movie has to do with the complexity of the plot: two thirds into the film I had no idea what exactly Indy was going after. Remember how in Raiders every bit of the way you felt how critical it was for Indy to get the Ark ? Not here. As a result I just didn't care too much about what was going on. I also don't think Shia LaBeouf has the chops for inheriting the Indiana Jones role, I have no idea who does but certainly not him. I suppose you just can't expect Spielberg and Lucas to catch thunder in a bottle every time (see Raiders) so one has to value this new film for what it is: a good time at the movies, nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>Absurd can best describe some of the over the top action sequences. Even the construction of some of these scenes, seemed to be lacking in detail, as far as continuity is concerned. Plus, Harrison Ford is noticably older, and so is Karen Allen, who was missing in the last two films. The point being, maybe they should not have waited this long to put out another film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>George Lucas and Steven Spielberg team up once again for the 4th installment of Indiana Jones.<br /><br />As expected, they have gone overboard with the CGI, however... you may feel that aliens and telekinesis powers and zombies are just too unrealistic for the Indiana Jones franchise, but then again, I suppose a fictional holey grail, and ancients who rip hearts out was over the top too, so Indiana Jones has never been on the non-fiction side of the real world.<br /><br />I did not like this one as much as the 1st and 3rd Indy, but it's better then the second one for sure.<br /><br />Indy is back, 20 years after the last movie, his father and Marcus have died. But his girl is back, and he has a son this time. Indy is first brought to Area 51 in 1950 something, and he is to help the bad guys find an alien skull that is made of crystal and magnetic. Then the rest of the movie is him escaping them, the FBI and trying to return this skull to it's rightful place.<br /><br />I guess Spielberg and Lucas decided to blend some of there old movies together, some felt like American Graffiti mixed with Close Encounters meets the X-Files.<br /><br />Overall, if you go in not expecting it to top the last movie, then it is kind of a fun ride. Just remember to suspend belief in reality, and the movie is ok.<br /><br />It just seemed some things where rather rushed, and not expanded upon, tho, maybe they cut out a lot of scenes. So it will be interesting to see the deleted scenes when this comes out. Provided they release a proper edition when they release it on DVD and not release a single disc, then a special edition later, then a gold edition, then the 2 year anniversary edition etc..<br /><br />Just watch it in expecting to see something very different from previous films a long with a little of the old Indy feel mixed in.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I loved the original Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Its one of my all-time favorites.  The series has been a wreck since then.  The Crystal Skull installment is possibly even worse than the awful Temple of Doom episode that was dragged down by Kate Capshaw and that little twerp "shortround".  In this case, its the horrible story (thanks to George Lucas) and the stiff performance by Harrison Ford that dooms this movie.  Neither one of these guys has done anything worthwhile in over a decade.  Steven Speilberg doesn't do much better with his unimaginitive direction.  He goes through the motions in a lame attempt to copy the previous movies.  The gag lines are poorly conceived and delivered and as a result that fall flat.  There isn't even a compelling villain.  A complete disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>This is not an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />This is a FARCE of an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />I knew this movie was in trouble the moment the Paramount logo dissolved into a gopher mound and a CGI gopher popped up it was painfully clear that this film is a joke that doesn't take itself seriously, like a Mad magazine spoof on the big screen making fun of not just every Indiana Jones film before it but also every Lucas and Spielberg production from American Grafitti to Close Encounters, only Lucas and Spielberg were having fun making fun of themselves at the audiences' expense while laughing all the way to the bank. George Lucas once again stubbornly relies on silly digital cartoon characters of the Pixar kind instead of human performances and lazy digital effects instead of spectacular, good-old-fashioned in-camera stunts and falls into the same pitfalls that reduced his epic Star Wars franchise into a heaping mound of juvenile Saturday Morning kiddie fare.<br /><br />When Indy makes his silhouetted entrance donning his trademarked fedora, Harrison is so creaky in his delivery of cringe inducing dialogue with stilted lines like "I like Ike," and "Drop dead, comrade," you'd think he was a relic in his own museum. When Marion Ravenwood finally makes her welcomed entrance, I could almost hear the applause track from the studio audience as if there was an electronic cue card flashing just below the screen. Karen Allen spends the last half of the film staring doe-eyed at her hero Indy like a grade-school girl with a puppy-love crush that was completely out of character with her performance as the feisty tough-as-nails Marion from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Shia LaBeouf tries in vain to imitate Marlon Brando from The Wild One but instead comes off like Fonzie-lite. Every time he pulled out his comb I was waiting for the "Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!" John Hurt delivers an embarrassing performance looking like an acid-wasted Timothy Leary hippie stoned out of his mind and speaking in acerbic riddles pined from the pages of Dr. Seuss and the traitorous Judas, Mac, has no problem selling out his best friend and his country in the name of Capitalism but whenever he's in a bind has no qualms about turning to "Jooooooonneeessssyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!" for help and to which Indy willingly obliges him. The imitable Cate Blanchett chews every scene she's in with her villainous Russian dialect but takes it so far over-the-top that you'd think she was an evil-doer from a Saturday morning cartoon, specifically of the Boris and Natasha kind.<br /><br />To say that the characters were never in any kind of peril or jeopardy is an understatement. All of the action is so ridiculously contrived and exceed the threshold of suspension of disbelief into a new level of cinematic absurdity that makes the gags in Last Crusade and Temple of Doom look like Schindler's List. If you thought parachuting out of a plane on a rubber raft was implausible in Temple of Doom (and successfully busted by Mythbusters), that's nothing compared to going over three of the biggest (CGI exaggerated) waterfalls in the Amazon that make Niagara Falls look like a waterslide at Water World. Or how about Mutt Williams swinging from vines like Tarzan while being chased by digital monkeys?  Dovenchenko is not just Pat Roach-lite but the fight scenes between him and Indy are so tediously dull and predictable without any of the brilliant improvisational choreography that made the fight scenes so spectacular to watch in the first two films. Spielberg relies so much on his own cliches and once brilliant movie-magic and storytelling that he phones it in here asking us to fall for the old Close Encounters/E.T. schtick that I was waiting for Indy to pull out the Reese's Pieces from his bag and Mulder and Scully to show up.<br /><br />I'd just like to know where the real Indy 4 is hidden. Probably in a magnetic crate somewhere inside of Hangar 51 because what I saw on the big screen wasn't it. In fact, I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to step out from behind the screen and tell everybody they just got punk'd.  Kingdom of the Crystal (Bored Outta My) Skull is so drivelously dull that it plays like a TV reunion movie where all of the aging cast members come back for one last big brouhaha to celebrate their lifetime achievement cumuppance. I wish that this film had never been made and relegate it to the same toxic landfill of pointless sequels that should never have been made as Batman and Robin, Highlander II, Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions and Phantom Menace.<br /><br />There is something very poignant during the scene when Indy rolls out of the lead-lined fridge, comes face-to-face with a digital gopher, and stares up at the giant atomic mushroom cloud hanging over him emblematic of watching his franchise going up in a cloud of radioactive dust but I doubt that will stop dogged old George Lucas from running it into the ground further and milking it dry with Indy 5. For Harrison's sake (and ours) it's time for Indiana Jones to hang up the hat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>As one of Hollywood's most rememberable franchises, Indiana Jones has a strange ranking among fans compared to others like Star Wars and James Bond. Either fans are based within two categories: the ones that absolutely love it or the ones that thinks that it's just okay. I have yet to meet someone who ever dispised the series, and with good reason. Harrison Ford had and has such an appeal as the early to mid 1900's archaeologist and explorer that it became his most recognizable character, giving even more of a chance to showcase his acting chops than his work in the original Star Wars trilogy as Han Solo. The first three Jones films were shot at Ford's peak as an actor while he was still in his early forties, easily able to keep up with the films action packed scenes and storylines. But like life itself, you can't stop the passage of time, and almost 20 years later can Ford, along with mainstay producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg, be successful with a now 65 year old Indiana Jones? Could he still crack a whip and knock out the bad guys all the while not looking like someone who's just past his prime?<br /><br />Taking place 19 years since the events of the third film "The Last Crusade", Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr, is still up to his old tricks. Part time college professor, part time explorer. But now the adventures are getting harder and harder. His long time mentor and friend Marcus Brody has passed and his rival father Henry Jones Sr. is gone too. Also, the world around him has changed as well. The German threat is over, and now the fears of the Russians, Cold War, and Nuclear Weaponry loom over each personal success. After a fouled up assignment to stop Russian Spys from stealing "extra-terrestrial" artifacts from a hidden Nevada goverment station, Indy finds himself on a forced leave of absence from Barnett College. While trying to leave, he runs into a young man by the name of "Mutt" Williams who has been looking for Indy to help him rescue Harold Oxley, Mutt's father figure and Indy's old friend. Oxley and Mutt's Mom (eventually found out to be none other than Raiders co-star and former flame Marion Ravenwood, again by seemingly ageless Karen Allen) have been lost while searching for a Crystal Skull within South America that as legend tells has strange powers that might not be from this planet. However the Russians, led by Cate Blanchett want this too, and will do anything to stop Indy and his gang from achieving the ultimate goal of returning the skull to it's proper resting place. Will this so-called alien artifact open a doorway into the great beyond, or is it as Indy originally thinks, just something that belongs in a museum?<br /><br />While watching this film it surprised me how the Lucas/Spielberg team were able to hold back the outrageousness of previous films to bring this one into a more realistic light, especially for it's star. Jones is older in this, and at times it shows yet being respectful and still highly entetaining. While other Indy sidekicks have provided little more than comic relief, Shia LaBeouf's Mutt picks up the slack where Jones shouldn't be able to provide at this point in his life. Don't get me wrong, Indy still will whip your butt, but it's just not as easy as it once was nor should it be. Another classy move is how the first three films reflected the memories of 1940's action adventure films, this chapter moves properly ahead to the 1950's Cold War era with it's Atom Bomb testing and the threat of Russian dominance & communism. Honestly cast-wise there's not one weak link here, everybody does a great job and keep this 2 hour & 2 minute movie going without any drag or unnecessary parts. While the idea of Indiana Jones dealing with an alien-like scenerio might seem hokey, it really does fit well here, be it the film's ending might have had you expecting something a little bit different. Overall, the once heralded Lucas/Spielberg has provided another great film instead of say another Episode I thru III, all the while keeping it in it's place knowing that it could never be as good as the original nor should it be, just an extension like revisiting an old friend years after your first glory.<br /><br />The Single-Disc edition (that I'm reviewing here) has the usual fantastic picture and audio of a modern day SD-DVD release, but also comes with two 15 minute plus documentaries speaking of both the Indiana Jones legacy and how some of the shots were accomplished. Many may be awfully surprised to see how little CGI was used in this flix (even the film itself was shot on actual film, NOT digitally!), and how much effort was made to keep this within the confines of the trilogy before it. Sorry, we again get no Spielberg/Lucas commentary, but this should be considered a good thing if you ever sat through a Lucas one. So while I assume you get behind-the-scenes overkill with the 2 Disc set, those with light wallets won't get bare-boned with this version either.<br /><br />Like seeing an old friend from high school it was nice to revisit such an icon of many's theatrical past. While it isn't the Indy of old (or is that young?), he still has some life left in him for this chapter. Nice cast additions and a story that keeps you going throughout, Crystal Skull will entertain and having that theme song back in your brain for weeks to come.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull might have been a favorite of mine if I had watched it a quarter of a century ago - before seeing the first Indiana Jones films and much of the rest of the Spielberg canon.<br /><br />Unfortunately for my enjoyment of THIS movie, I couldn't help but compare it to what came before.<br /><br />Without spoiling it for those of you who want to see the film, how can I convey to you, gentle reader, my disappointment?<br /><br />I see many "spoiler" reviews posted here, and I don't want this one to join the ranks.<br /><br />There is much to like about the film.  There is perhaps no living actor who so embodies the fictional character they portray as Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.  Indy is twenty years older, but undeniably Indy.  Seeing him gives you the same comfortable feeling as putting on a favorite pair of jeans or pouring a glass of your favorite beverage.<br /><br />But part of the appeal of the Indy of the previous films was his apparent real human fragility in the context of near super-heroics.  Near the end of "Raiders", after Indy has been beaten, dragged, shot and near exhaustion (in the time frame of the movie he's been awake for three days at least), he finally gets to lie down.  Karen Allen's Marion tries to jump his bones, but he is too tired and hurts too much to respond.  We similarly see Dr. Jones recoil realistically from beatings, draggings, etc administered in "Temple of Doom" and "Last Crusade". This AARP candidate no longer seems vulnerable to trauma because "Indy, Revision Four" takes several hits that would kill a strong person and barely flinches.  The "human" Indy is interesting - the "indestructable senior citizen" Indy is a cartoon character.<br /><br />The early plot is interesting in a movie serial kind of way - updating the convenient screen villains of circa 1940, the Nazis, with convenient screen villains circa 1957, the commie Russians.  Along the way we get to see Jim Broadbent as a surrogate for the late Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody and Shia LaBeouf in a Brando "Wild One" homage.<br /><br />The last part of the plot is a mess, and though I'd like to say more about WHY, let's just say it felt like a blatant ripoff of at least two OTHER Spielberg movies from a five year period straddling 1980.  If you see "The Color Purple" or "Schindler's List" you have a certain expectation.  If you see an Indiana Jones movie you have a certain expectation, and the final part of the plot simply does not belong.  I felt disappointed in a "what a rip-off!" kind of way.<br /><br />Excellent stuntwork fills the frame in one thrilling set-piece after another.  If not for the "you've got to be kidding" ending and the newly indestructable nature of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., I would have rated this movie MUCH higher.  As it is I can only recommend it for people who can't imagine missing an Indiana Jones movie - and you've probably already seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Thankfully neither George Lucas nor Stephen Spielberg have ruined the Indiana Jones franchise, like the Star Wars prequels almost did to the entire series, with the "Phantom Menace" being almost unwatchable. Instead, in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", we get a rousing bit of popcorn entertainment, harkening back to classic 1930s and 1940s serials. It is definitely not the best in the Indiana Jones franchise ("Raiders of the Lost Ark" is quite far the best), but it is a credible sequel to the previous three Indiana Jones films, picking up the action nearly 20 years after "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade". Noted screenwriter David Koepp has wrought an occasionally clunky screenplay, but this one truly works with ample excitement in store for veteran archaeologist Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr. and his pals. Of course there is also yet another rousing film score from composer John Williams, though the Indiana Jones theme isn't heard in its entirety until the film's closing credits. And there's excellent cinematography too from Janusz Kaminski, who is probably best noted for his work on "Schindler's List".<br /><br />It's 1957, and the opening sequences open and close with a bang, as a kidnapped Jones finds himself and his pal Mac (Ray Winstone) as prisoners of a secret Soviet Red Army strike force who've sneaked into Nevada's secret Area 51 in search of extraterrestrial treasure. Led by the sadistic KGB Colonel Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett in yet another fine performance), Indy is forced at gunpoint to find this treasure, and he does, before escaping and finding himself the lucky survivor of a US nuclear blast near the Area 51 complex. Back in Connecticut teaching archaeology at Marshall College (which is set at real-life Yale University), Indy finds himself the victim of a FBI witch hunt and the target of several KGB agents. He also meets up with college dropout Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), the bearer of dire news; old graduate school friend and colleague, archaeologist Harold Oxley (John Hurt) has been abducted in Peru,  along with Mutt's mother Mary, after Oxley discovered a secret kingdom of the crystal skull. So it's off to Peru in search of Oxley, mother Mary (who is actually Indy's old flame Marion Ravenswood) and meeting up once more with Mac, Spalko, and more Soviet soldiers.<br /><br />There are laughs a plenty in store for anyone who fondly remembers the previous Indiana Jones films. Ford brings a fine blend of elderly wisdom and young derring do in his latest portrayal of an older Indiana Jones (There's a brief reference too to the "Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" television series.). Karen Allen is superb as the older, more mature, Marion Ravenswood, but frankly, I wish she had more dialogue and screen time. As her son Mutt, Shia LaBeouf comes across as a risk-taking fictional version of a young James Dean, complete with almost the same wardrobe and coarse slang as Dean's. Last, but not least, Jim Broadbent is terrific in his few brief scenes as Marshall College's dean and Indy's long-time faculty friend and colleague. The film's end may not surprise those who've anticipated correctly the fine chemistry between Jones and Ravenswood, but it is certainly a delightful sentimental touch, with potential promise for more adventures in store for both Indy and Mutt. While "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" isn't quite the cinematic adventure that "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was, it is still a pretty darn good Indiana Jones film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a marvelous final film in the Jones series, to say nothing of the fine action sequences that one has come to expect from this series.  All of the elements are here: the chase scenes, a creepy scene in a graveyard, clues to the mystery of the crystal skull provided by Professor Oxley and encounters with huge killed red ants, hostile natives and an amazing opening sequence ending with an atomic bomb test.<br /><br />It will go without saying that Harrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones wonderfully but it is an older Jones who has had quite a few wartime adventures that we meet.  Cate Blanchett (Dr. Irina Spalko) is nicely cast and makes a good sword-carrying villain; she is marvelously single-minded pursuit of the crystal skull. Shia LeBouef really steals the film as Mutt Williams and is the quintessential 1950's motorcycle riding school dropout always worried about how his hair looks.  It was very good to see Karen Allen again in an Indiana Jones film as Marion (also Mutt William's mother); she brought a lot of energy to the film and her verbal sparing with Indiana Jones was a delight. John Hurt plays Professor Oxley, an archaeologist friend of Jones (nicknamed Ox), who is like a father figure to Mutt and found the crystal skull but mysteriously returned it.  Ray Winstone was good in the small role of McHale, who was certainly not to be trusted (but Indiana Jones is willing to forget his early double dealing for old time's sake).  Jim Broadbent is also good in the brief role of Dean Stanforth (substituting for the late Denholm Elliot who is nevertheless in on the action when a statue of Marcus Brody is crashed into by the KGB).<br /><br />My only problem with the film is the ending which I did not think was quite clear.  What was the reward for returning the crystal skull? In Raider's of the Lost Ark the villains are destroyed by the prize they think they have found. Dr. Spalko meet a similar fate in her quest for the ultimate psychic knowledge but one wonders what Professor Oxley's reward is for returning the skull was supposed to be.  I found the ending a bit anticlimactic on first viewing but I may change my opinion after I have seen the film more than one.<br /><br />The production and locations are fabulous and John Williams has once again written a great score.  Indiana Jones 4 will definitely be added to our DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>After all the gritty, raw-edged tragedies I have seen this past few months, I did not expect to like George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg's latest installment to the iconic Indiana Jones series, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".<br /><br />But I did.<br /><br />Yes, the characters are older, but aren't we all?  Heck, my son wasn't even born when the first Indiana Jones adventure came out in 1981.  Harrison Ford's Indie sports a little grizzle around the muzzle, but he still snaps a mean whip, gets a lot of action dropping his trademark fedora and apparently can blow a mean horn as being a man few women forget.  Age seems to agree with him, however, he's wiser, a bit mellower--the cynicism so intrinsic to the earlier character toned down--and just as much of a klutz as he is an impulsive hero.  His moments with a certain reptilian creature sparked involuntary amusement in me--after all he is Indiana Jones, a cinematic icon, as familiar to me as Superman and Batman--so why wouldn't I instantly want to hunker down in the plush-ness of my movie theatre seat, wallow in popcorn and just enjoy?<br /><br />Likewise, the rest of Indie's band of adjuncts falls in line in a beloved formula again recognizable to the audience.  Shia La Bouef as Mutt Williams emulates a likeable sidekick--his fifties panache evident in his `Route 66' habit of combing his would-be greaser ducktail at the most unlikely times.  As the film's young beefcake (as his last name implies,) Shia unfortunately has some of the film's sillier interludes--his entrance on motorbike donned in Marlon Brando's "The Wild One" regalia, his acrobatic foray with a group of coiffed Amazonian monkeys and his exhibition of fencing skills while balancing precariously on racing jeeps may suspend belief, but only for a few seconds as the audience again gets a grip and realizes that Spielberg delivers exactly what is expected--family fun targeted to capture multi-generations.<br /><br />Karen Allen, as love interest Marion Ravenwood, impressed me the least--as the independent woman depicted in `Raiders', now seasoned and tempered by time and life she should have toyed with Indie a bit--more banter--more anger--more tension--she caved a little too fast for my sensibilities--she too should have had a little more fun with him.  What I did find admirable about Ms. Allen is her authenticity--yes, she is no longer the fresh cheeked ing&eacute;nue, but, thank heavens, she has not opted for a plastic Botoxed face and the other sickeningly vain accoutrements of pseudo-sophistication that so many older actresses seem to find necessary to compete in a marketplace obsessed with youth.  Refreshingly, Ms Allen revels in her crow's feet--her beaming smile a testament to real inner beauty.<br /><br />Cate Blanchard comes as close to embodying Natasha Fatale of Rocky & Bullwinkle fame as arch-villainess Irina Spalko as it gets--she's more cartoon than actual woman, playing campy with a capital "C"---but who cares?  Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?  These characters are supposed to be larger than life, like the serials from the 30s. Blanchard sure seems to be having a good time goose-stepping it up with a sword at her jumpsuit belt.  All chiseled cheekbones and manic eyes when she sites the answer to her heart's craving for power, she certainly doesn't seem to care if the audience laughs at her or not--she anticipates it--its all part of the caricature--putting the "E" into Evil.<br /><br />Bottom line?  "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" delivers pretty much what one would expect from an Indiana Jones installment.  Fun, campy, corny, chuck full of improbable stunts, raucous chases and a wild storyline that reaches resolution in just over two hours, this film oscillates with pure fun.  The intermingling of the Sci-Fi with the archaeological lends a dash of signature Lucas to an already appealing hero that is probably better known than Homer's Odysseus.  If you, like me have had your fill of this year's serious drama and just want to sit back and enjoy the ride, this one's recommended for you.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Wow, you know when Speilberg misses he really misses.  Im in my thirties so I grew up on Indiana Jones and I was really jazzed that they were making a new one...uh until I saw the finished product that is.  Harrison Ford, geritol love him, does his very best, and frankly he is by far and away the best thing about this movie.  Let me state right off, I am no fan of Shia LaBouef, I just dont get his popularity at all, and he is totally miscast in this film, and lord, Cate Blachette is just as bad, that accent is hilarious.  Really, I cant state strongly enough how disappointed I was in this film, if it had not been for my love of Harrison Ford, I would have given it one star.  Hopefully, this is the last Indy, it's just a shame it had to end on such a lackluster film..Professor Jones deserved better, hellz I deserved better..really I want my money back..hummm..wonder who I contact.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>It is sometimes the case with films that sequels fail to match up to their predecessors.  "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is one of those times.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's latest incarnation of Indian Jones sees the story largely unchanged.  That is, Indy is still an archeologist whose life is more frenetic that the average university professor.  He is still fighting baddies.  He is still getting into scrapes but always comes through remarkably unharmed.  Never a broken bone in sight!  In the "Crystal Skull", the only change of significance is that a decade of time has passed and the bad guys are no longer Nazis but Russians.  This is after all, the peak of the cold war.<br /><br />Harrison Ford does an admirable job again as Indiana Jones but the show is stolen by Cate Blanchett who plays an evil Russian intent on bringing Indy undone.  Without Ms Blanchett, I'm not sure where this film would have ended up.<br /><br />My advice to Steven Spielberg is to put Indy out to pasture.  The brand is being tarnished.  Let's call a halt to the process so that we can fondly remember the films and not have the earlier works denigrated by these attempts to wring very last dollar out of the concept.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>I was greatly intrigued when I heard that the fourth Indiana Jones movie was coming out.  I enjoyed all three of the original trilogy films back in the 80s & early 90s, and was hoping they would be able to end the series with a blockbuster story.  Unfortunately, this was just not to be.<br /><br />This IJ movie picks up in 1957 and as such it taps into some of the more noteworthy aspects of that time, such as the Red Scare / McCarthyism and nuclear bomb testing (I never knew that refrigerators provided such protection against nukes!).<br /><br />The central theme of the film, however, revolves around the infamous E.T. incident at Roswell New Mexico that has received so much press the past 60 years.  Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IK">Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>, the story also indulges into the associated mythology of little green men being held at AREA 51.<br /><br />As an adventure film, this is roughly as well done as the first three, albeit with some action sequences which go well beyond the realm of believability.  Harrison Ford is back, Karen Allen reprises her role from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a> (and she has aged quite well, I might add!) and  Shia LaBeouf is a good young up-and-coming actor.  While the identity of LaBeouf's role is pretty predictable, it is still a worthwhile addition to the IJ storyline.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that I found the plot rather....well....hokey.  Once you get into the "This stuff is too advanced to have been crafted by humans.  Must have been aliens!" motif, then everything becomes very silly very quickly.  Having occult stuff and Hindu stuff in IJ movies is great fun, but to summon space aliens just isn't very Indy like.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie struck me as a cross between a cross between an IJ movie and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition)</a>.  While I enjoy both the adventure movie & science fiction genres, it's just not a good thing to try & combine the two (in my opinion, at least).  It's kind of like putting ketchup on your ice cream;  you may enjoy both, but.....</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>The kids are going to love it.

After 19 years of waiting we deserved something better. I can't imagine what Spielberg was thinking when he threw this film together. It's a long, long way from the previous installments in the franchise.<br /><br />Harrison Ford looks bored out of his mind and who wouldn't be. It's not that he's too old or anything it's just that there is nothing much for him to do apart from spew loads of exposition (the previous films kept this to a minimum). Up until this installment every Indy film had several key, iconic scenes. Be it a tumbling rock or a mine car chase there was something standout and memorable about all of them. There's nothing like that here, nothing.<br /><br />The pre-release hype reminded me a lot Bruce Willis talking-up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMQ6">Live Free or Die Hard [Blu-ray</a>] the previous summer. He assured that the film would be 'old school' and was 'the best one yet'. And then when it did finally come out it was a PG-13 family movie filled with CGI effects. So much for old school. Spielberg tried to hype Indy IV with the same logic. He'd be shooting in Panavision (sadly not as common as it used to be), editing the old-fashioned way and using as many non-computer-generated effects as possible.<br /><br />Well, that turned out to be a lie. Crystal Skull looks far too slick to be in the same category as Douglas Slocombe's fantastically dark photography of the first three. Not only is CGI prevalent throughout there is also extensive use of digital mattes which look totally out of place in an Indy film. In no way does this look or feel like either of the three movies that preceded it.<br /><br />I have read that Frank Darabont wrote the original script which both Spielberg and Ford loved but George Lucas (who has been flogging his one long-dead horse since 1977 for all it's worth) hated it. I have no idea what that script was about but I have no doubt that it was miles better than what we finally got. Aliens simply do NOT belong in an Indy film. Lucas can force that nonsense on us in his endless Star Wars series as much as he wants but not here, Sir. And on top of that the plot doesn't even make sense and is very poorly delivered to the viewer, excessive exposition or not. Indy IV feels more like a rejected Mummy 3 script than anything else.<br /><br />Karen Allen returns as Marion but has next to nothing to do apart from drive a car-boat and tag along with the already bloated cast. Indy, Mutt, Mac, Ox and Marion all searching for an ancient treasure while being pursued by (a gorgeous) Cate Blanchett. My God is this friggin' ain't <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFW7UA">The Goonies [Blu-ray</a>], man. And despite the PG-13 rating it is probably the tamest Indy film yet. Look at the final scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a> with the exploding heads and melting faces. How brilliant and timeless is that? It's pure imagination mixed with great make-up effects and it's a finale that everyone remembers. Irina Spalko (who does not one evil thing in the whole movie) meets an altogether much lazier fate. I won't ruin it for you despite already having given most of the ending away but I will say that it's quick and unaffecting and looks like it came out of a video game.<br /><br />When all else fails you could usually turn to John Williams for comfort. Sorry folks, but Williams (along with everyone else, it seems) is strictly phoning it in for this one. His themes are lazy, boring and instantly forgettable. Don't expect anything as awesome as 'Parade of the Slave Children' or 'Desert Chase' here. The Ark of the Covenant theme can be heard near the start but all the new material is as bland as it can get.<br /><br />Indy IV should never have happened. If the series MUST have been continued then a big-screen Young Indiana Jones adventure would have held so much more potential. The Young Indy series is exactly what you need to watch if you feel let down by this time-wasting potboiler. Though I did appreciate the Young Indiana Jones reference about half an hour into it. I wonder how many people picked up on that.<br /><br />Spielberg has lost it. Plain and simple.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I had a big grin on my face throughout this entire film.  I laughed out loud in many places, and cheered the characters on in others.  After 20 years, Indy is back, and so is the fun and excitement.<br /><br />As with every film in the series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starts off at warp speed and never lets up.  Like its three predecessors, this very entertaining film is full action, adventure, excitement, thrills, chases, true love and, yes, even camp.  Did I know what was going to happen pretty much every step of the way?  Of course, but it all happened exactly the way I wanted it to.  It was typical Indiana Jones, full of references and homage to the past films, and I did not need it to be anything else.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is once again brilliant in his portrayal of our hero.  At 65, he is still handsome, sexy, believable, and true to character.  And as always, he gets the girl.  Karen Allen is wonderful reprising her role of Marion Ravenwood.  She doesn't look like she has aged a bit, and she is absolutely terrific.  The chemistry between Indy and Marion is palpable.  Shia Labeouf as Mutt Williams does quite a remarkable job.  His high-speed sword fight through the Amazon is amazing and memorable.  I have to say the ants were an inspired choice for this film's requisite creepy-crawly scene.  We live in an area swarming with fire ants. I HATE ANTS.<br /><br />As always, John Williams' musical score is rousing and fills you with anticipation.  As the music set the perfect stage for all of the film's action, I found my self humming along with the familiar and well loved theme.  This is one that I can't get out of my head, and I don't really want to.<br /><br />Set in the 1950s, smack in the middle of McCarthyism, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings the Indiana Jones franchise into a new era. It is jam packed with classic and clich&eacute; 1950s references, from motorcycles and greasers, atomic bombs, Roswell and little green men, and the red menace. Overall, this film isn't supposed to be particularly serious (and neither were the others!). It is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable continuation of a well loved story.<br /><br />And I think it succeeded.  As the credits rolled, the audience applauded and cheered.  I highly recommend this film for the entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>What a disappointment!<br /><br />The first movie, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is just about perfect.  A terrific tale culled from Judeo-Christian mythology subverted by the core obsession of Hitler's occultic desperation.  Talk about good versus evil!  That was 27 years ago!<br /><br />But after a 19 year wait from the last Indiana  Jones movie and numerous official screenplays commissioned and then rejected by George Lucas, it is hard to believe that this is the absurd, overblown story that was finally agreed on by Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. What happened to Frank Darabont's version?<br /><br />What "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is really about is three old men looting their fans' wallets with a highly anticipated and  decidedly empty parody of the original entry.  Did anyone have his heart in this enterprise?  A better title would be "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of Your Wallet."<br /><br />Shame.<br /><br />Nice atom bomb effect, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones leaps into the fifties and captures every meaningful bit of life during that era.  Aging only slightly less than his onscreen character, Harrison Ford seems every bit fit and spry as the time-lapse could possibly find him.  At his side is a new adventurer, Henry "Mutt" Williams (Shia LaBeof), as likely as any successor to fill his shoes as the next matinee idol.  Noting Shia's screen presence in everything from `Transformers' to `Disturbia,' it has already happened.<br /><br />Still reinventing the tricks from the serial adventures of old, Director Spielberg and Executive Producer Lucas have teamed up to dazzle us once again.  This time the "Red Scare" is given a `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792838289">The Manchurian Candidate</a>' balance by offering an unvarnished Soviet menace matched by an overzealous FBI investigating Professor Jones' and his university.<br /><br />Set in Nevada in 1957, Jones and his sidekick "Mack" (Ray Winstone) defend a military facility being overtaken by the Soviets in the desert.  At the compounds' storage warehouse, we find out early that "cliffhanger" is going to be as potent as any Jones has taken so far.  Leading the enemy is Col. Irina Spalko (played expertly by a steely cold Kate Blanchett, who has truly earned her own gold by her multi-faceted acting ability).  Once Indiana escapes, he finds himself on a model test city that's about to be detonated by a test atom bomb.  An asset of quietly cheeky satire, we see him going across a linoleum kitchen floor until he finds a "model" (as in mannequin) family in the living room.<br /><br />Once he regroups, he runs into leather-jacketed motorcycle Mutt who leads him to find Jones' lost colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt) who has been kidnapped along with Mutt's mother down in the Amazon in a lost Mayan city of gold.  This time instead of a lost ark or a lost holy grail, Indiana and his new friend head to South America in search of the loved ones along with a precious artifact in the "crystal skull".  Here they sort out clues and translate an ancient language to find the lost treasure before the Soviets can.<br /><br />I can't help but make comparisons to recent DVD release '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YABYPQ">National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>'.  Both sport likable characters and able actors, and both stories are about deciphering clues that bring both entourages to a lost city of gold.  What wins out in this adventure is the suspense and entertainment:  The danger is more immediate; the timing is nearly flawless; and the jokes are far more formidable.  What separates 'NT2' from '...The Crystal Skull' is that this one is more stimulating with peril and revelations that are surprising; the other is more breezy and only lightly entertaining. Between David Koepp's screenplay, the right touches by Spielberg and Lucas, Michael Kahn's excellent editing, and, of course, the right feel by John Williams, this film makes a world of difference.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Leave it to George Lucas to ruin another franchise. This lousy mish-mash of a film stinks of his tone-deaf storytelling, although he surely isn't alone shouldering the blame. Spielberg, after all, let him get away with it, and David Koepp (an otherwise decent screenwriter) gets credit for taking Lucas' "story" and trying to make sense out of it. Much like Episodes I through III tarnished the three original Star Wars films, this sad, overly long exercise makes the original Indy films feel like Oscar contenders.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Over the last several years we as moviegoers have seen a resurgence of sorts amongst our former big screen heroes and legends. Beginning in 2005, with the excellent resurrection of the Batman franchise with Christopher Nolan's gritty and much more realistic "Batman Begins", followed in 2006 by Rocky and James Bond returning in "Rocky Balboa" and "007: Casino Royale" respectively, also that year marked the triumphant big screen return for one of the greatest heroes of all time, the man of steel in "Superman Returns". So, with all of these film franchises being dusted off to continue on or just rebooting to start things off fresh, it seems to make perfect sense that after a nearly 20 year absence from theaters, that acclaimed director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas would bring back their iconic collaboration, the treasure hunting archaeologist Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr. for another adventure with "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".<br /><br />"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is set in 1957, as Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. is yet again finding himself on the run from foreign agents. This time he's not trying to outwit the Nazis; instead, it's the Russian KGB on his tail, led by a dangerous, power-hungry agent (Kate Blanchett) in search of the mythical crystal skull of Akator. With the aid of his former love, Marion (Karen Allen) and a biker named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), Indy must face odds the likes of which only he could call fair, all in an effort to ensure that these powerful and priceless artifacts never fall into the wrong hands.<br /><br />After being away from the big screen for 19 years, the announced return of Indiana Jones was sure to inspire droves of fans to begin wishing about what they would like to see their hero do in his next adventure. No doubt just like with the Star Wars prequel trilogy, expectations went so high that no movie was ever going to be able to meet them. So, here we are after several years had passed since the first announcement was made in the early nineties about a fourth Indy film, and promise after promise being made over the years by George Lucas, or someone else associated with the movie, that another adventure was coming, the time has finally arrived, and the results were... Well, quite mixed from fans, to say the least.<br /><br />Many fans felt that this installment lacked that special something that made the original trilogy so great. There were some fans that enjoyed this newest adventure, feeling that it was just as good as a majority of the original trilogy, or at least on par with them. I for one fall into the category of a fan that enjoyed the original series, and found this one to be on par with the majority of the other installments; perhaps a bit lower than the standard set by "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade".<br /><br />Is this a perfect movie? No, not by any means, and I admit that there are some aspects of the film I wish could have been removed or reduced here and there; yet for the most part I found this sequel to be completely entertaining and plenty of fun for the family. As for the story of "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", writer David Koepp ("Spider-Man") did a very good job of evolving the character naturally from where we'd seen him last, into this much more weathered archaeologist/tomb raider; and by realistically representing Harrison Ford's age as being that of Indy's so as not to stretch believability too far with what the character can do. I personally appreciated this effort on the writer's part by allowing for the 19 years that had passed in reality, to be the exact same as what has passed in the franchise's history so that everything done within the story holds more merit. Some have complained that the movie went too much into the science-fiction realm, and should have stayed more in the supernatural realm as the original three movies had done. I can't really agree on that point, because if you think about it science-fiction and supernatural elements kind of go hand-and-hand. So, to say that for instance "Raiders of the Lost Ark" was obviously supernatural by dealing with God, and the power of the Ark of the Covenant, but that it wasn't sci-fi doesn't make any sense to me. I'm not saying that God or anything related to him is science-fiction, but most of the movies that deal with that area tend to fall into the sci-fi category; thus, the alien element in this film isn't that much of a stretch. I also, liked that they clearly linked this film to the original film with many nods throughout the story; this to me was most likely done in an attempt to show you where the seeds for this story were planted way back then. This was further evidence that this film's storyline came as a natural progression for the series, not something completely out of left field as others have protested.<br /><br />For those audience members that chastised this film for not including enough action from Indy, and relying far too much on Shia to get a lot of the action done; personally, I think you all should get a life. But, I'll address the issue all the same, because it's annoying to me and I want to say my piece about it. If you were one of the many that wanted another Indiana Jones adventure with Harrison Ford then you got one, but you have to realize something, the man is in his sixties now; therefore, he can't do everything he used to do 19 years ago or more. If you would have rather they recast the role (which I doubt you would) then you would have all griped about how it's not the same as when Harrison played the role. Basically, you can't have your cake and eat it too. Either you wanted another Indy adventure with Harrison or you recast it? Those were the options, take them or leave them? I for one, am pleased that they didn't recast the role, and thought that Harrison, although much older now than he was in the last adventure, still did an admirable job of playing the character believably and was still able to handle himself easily enough in the various fight sequences he found himself in. Were there times when it seemed apparent that the torch was being semi-passed to Shia for the action/adventure stuff? Of course, he was the obvious choice in the cast. But, at least he's an up-and-coming young star, who is amassing quite an impressive fan base, and is a skilled actor that can handle the action and the drama equally. So, if the series had to be handed off eventually, at least they picked an actor that could actually handle the mantle rather than crumble beneath the weight of it.<br /><br />The casting for the film was exceptional. Harrison once again does an excellent job with the character. Getting to play Indy as a much more mature character than he had been in previous movies must have been fun for him, plus it was nice to see the little nods to what he knows he could have done in years past, but age just won't allow any more. The return of Karen Allen to the role of Marion was a nice touch, she was much better in the role this time around than she was in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Out of all the different women in the series, I'm glad they chose to bring her back, because frankly, Willie would have been just too annoying to see again. Shia LaBeouf ("Transformers") was a welcome addition as Indy's reluctant new sidekick, as it were. He played a typical tough guy from the fifties, seemingly obsessed with his hair and his leather jacket; yet fiercely loyal to his friends and family. Rounding out the supporting cast we have Cate Blanchett ("Elizabeth 2: The Golden Age") as the despicable KGB agent trying to use Indy to gain access to the powerful crystal skulls. I thought that Kate was very good in the role, and having the Russians be the primary enemy in this installment made sense given that the Nazis were hardly a concern any longer in the grand scheme of things. Lastly, we have Ray Winstone ("The Departed") as Indy's partner of questionable loyalty. Ray played the part in such a duplicitous way that I never knew for sure which side his character was actually on until the end. His was truly one of the better red herrings/betrayers throughout the series' history.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a truly entertaining return to the big screen for the so-called "Man in the Hat". While some moments within the movie cause the story to stumble about here and there; overall, the final result is a fun-filled adventure that perfectly continues this long-lasting film series that families can enjoy time and again.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Thankfully Harrison Ford's age had nothing to do with it. He's just fine. In 19 years we've all become more jaded & a lot harder to impress with obvious but great special effects. Even so I recommend seeing this on the big screen because those special effects are that good. However, seeking out crystal skulls that may or may not have existed are not as compelling as the Ark of the Covenant & the Holy Grail. As we have changed so has Indy. He is no longer a treasure hunter plundering other countries antiquities, for $$$ & his favorite museum's glory. He is seeking to return a crystal skull, gain knowledge & prevent the greedy commies from getting it. Bringing back his old girlfriend, Marion, was a really nice touch. In a minor plot she also had a son that is Indy's. He becomes Indy's sidekick & you could see that coming a mile off. Cate Blanchett is somewhat miscast vamping it up as a Garboesque villian. That had to be done deliberately. A great summer movie & it should win the season unless the ladies rally around the ultimate chick flick, Sex & the City.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a fun movie with some great actors, good action and great b-film script. And like his other movies this Indiana Jones adventure springs from a genuine archeological mystery. We should have expected this topic since the crystal skull is back in vogue again as we approach 2012, the year the thirteen crystal skulls need to be rejoined according to Mayan legend. One of the problems is the movie takes place in 1957. And the skulls do not match the shape of those that have been found since the 1860's.<br /><br />Crystal skulls really exist and look like human, unlike in the movie. No one knows much about the real skulls. They have no tool marks as is described in the movie, but they do exist. As does the Mitchell-Hedges skull that is mentioned in the movie, which has unsubstantiated Mayan origins and supposed mystical powers.<br /><br />Now back to 1957 and the movie. Since the Nazi's have been defeated Indiana Jones new nemesis is the Russians and the McCarthy induced paranoid F.B.I. Which makes sense for that time in U.S. history. Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones well, he is still has his great one-liners while performing death defying acts and still using his skills to deftly solve all the puzzles. Instead of Indy's specialty of the spiritual or mystical mystery, we are taken into the realm of Sci-Fi.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett plays our villain, Stalin's favorite psychic scientist, Irina Spalko. Her acting is good, but as a villain she is not too diabolical. I hate to say it, but at times she seems almost comical, yet professional enough to stay in character. We start off with her forcing Indy to find an item in a government warehouse that is obviously White Sands New Mexico, which is near Roswell. And because of his actions, Indy is set off on an adventure that is not of his choosing. As he escapes a situation, which would not be possible, even for Indy to escape. Which leads us to what the film is lacking, that feel that Indy is never in any real danger.<br /><br />Mutt Williams played by Shia LeBeouf is the key that starts him on his quest to save a friend and find the crystal skull. It is as if Mutt is being groomed to carry on the series as he becomes Indy's sidekick. He is ok for a few moments at a time, but I am not sure if he could pick up for Harrison Ford. Perhaps Indy will give us one more adventure before he retires.<br /><br />Then Indy's love interest from "Raiders," Marion, once again played by Karen Allen, is back and is the real star of this movie. Like some of the other reviewers I do not wish to ruin the surprise on how she fits into the plot of the movie. But I was sure pleased to see her as she steps back into her role as Marion. And She still has the on screen chemistry with Indy with the fiery personality that we remember.<br /><br />This fourth installment of Indiana Jones is a little contrived, the plot is not the greatest, but if you just go along for the fast packed action ride with great visual effects you should enjoy it. Three-and-half stars, but since Karen Allen played her part so well I'll rate it four and watch it again when its on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>There's never a dull moment for poor old Indiana Jr. And I haven't had so much fun since...well last week when I saw the premiere of the phenomenal IronMan. The special effects are amazing. And I Expect the DVD to be a work of Art. Namely the Sound. Lucas and his THX, Dolby Digital EX and Spielbergs own DTS ES. And for those really lucky, and rich, people out there the Blue-Ray will be explosive! Try the state of the art Dolby True HD and the Spielberg equivalent DTS-HD Master Audio. I can't wait to see it on my own equipment.<br />  The Chrystal Skull has a great, and imaginative story. The ending is, Unpredictable to say the least. And Indie jumps and dodges like a younger version of himself. Professor Jones never looked so weary as he was in the scenes in classroom. Kate Blanchet is Gorgeous and is equiped with a saucy sword to go with her leather gloves and boots. Shia Labeouf as Mutt Williams works well along-side the battle, blood and guts Harrison Ford. Karen Allen wears the biggest smile I've seen in a long time, and I'm glad to see her because it's nice to reminisce in movies. If I were to rate the Four movies this would be last. But that doesn't make it a failure. Those movies are all legendary classics. This just doesn't beat them. The way the movie reveals itself to me isn't as effective as the original trilogy. There were times in the originals where I was dying to find out what happens next. I was more or less searching for the meaning more than in the pursuit of mystery. The special effects blew me away, but none more than the horrendous Mushroom Cloud. So close that I had to look up into it. It was beautiful at the same time, with the sun behind it! Not that it matters to me, but it had a monster memorial weekend, though Monday isn't quite up yet. Somewhere in the 120million range I hear, which is second behind Pirates for biggest Memorial Weekend take.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008) was a mixed blessing. This Indy movie takes place in the 1950's and Dr. Jones(Harrison Ford) must stop Soviet Russians from getting their hands on a powerful Crystal Skull. This is the first Indy movie to be packed with CGI! The scene where Indy survives a nuclear explosion was laughed off the screen and it coined the phrase, "Nuke the Fridge". Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen) from Raiders is back, thank goodness. The subplot with Indy's backstabbing friend is just plain confusing. John Williams' music score is decent and he writes a good music cue for Mutt Williams(Shia LaBeouf).<br /> Crystal Skull got some bad reviews, but it still made money at the box office. Teenage kids in a muscle car listen to Elvis Presley's 'Hound Dog'. This could be an homage to George Lucas' American Graffiti(1973). The scene where Indy escapes from the warehouse is the best action scene in the film. One of the fun moments is where a statue of Marcus Brody flies through the windshield of a car! There's a picture of Dr. Henry Jones Sr. on Indy's desk. Indy tells Mutt that Pancho Villa took him hostage in 1916. This happened in the pilot to The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles(1992). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has many flaws, but it's still worth watching with a bucket of popcorn and some soft drinks.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Like the other great classic heroes of the 80's, Indiana Jones makes an awesome comeback! I thought the movie was really good and had the classic look of the 1950's! It was cool that the Ark from the original had a brief appearance! It was also awesome to see Marion from 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' back and helping Indy against Russians who are after the Crystal Skull. Shia LaBeouf does an awesome job as a greaser named Mutt Williams who is Marion's son that helps Indy on his journey too. There are some jokes about Indy's age throughout the film which is pretty funny! If you are a big INDIANA JONES fan, then you'll love INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I hope they do make Indy 5!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>It's 1957; Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is still an archeology professor and still in harm's way.  It seems the Russians, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), are searching for a crystal skull believed to have magical powers.  They want it for their army and believe Jones knows where it is, so they kidnap him, he escapes, and the chase is on.  Along the way he meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who needs Indy's help to find his mother, Marion (Karen Allen).<br /><br />I have mixed emotions about this fourth installment in the Indy series.  It was better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Temple of Doom</a> (but not by much), but it had way too many characters in it and the plot was so complicated I honestly didn't know what was going on most of the time.  Happily, it  IS Indiana Jones; the excitement is still the same, the music is great, and when they slow down every once in a while, it's still fun.  Director Spielberg went way overboard on the CGI stuff, though, and put so many death-defying stunts (which Indy walks away from with nary a scratch) that much of it is cartoonish.  I wish they had concentrated on character rather than action.  Ford is still in good shape; it was lovely to see Marion brought back from the first movie and LaBeouf made a pleasant, though unnecessary, sidekick for Indy.<br /><br />It's an exhausting movie to watch and I drifted off to sleep a few times when it became too taxing to try and follow the plot.  I liked the nods to the characters of Indiana Sr. and Marcus Brody and the quick glimpse of the long-forgotten ark from the first movie.  Action fans who can overlook the convoluted storyline may well enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>This one got pretty trashed by the critics, so maybe that lowered my expectation. But I ended up enjoying this more than I thought I would, and actually liked it better than the other two sequels - it seemed closer in spirit to the original. Sure, there were some incredibly silly parts (the fridge, the waterfalls), but it moved along quickly enough that I didn't get bogged down in the inanity. Plus the appearance of Karen Allen helped pick things up immensely.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>There is plenty of action to keep anyone entertain throughout the whole movie. But it has the sophistication of a "Tom & Jerry" cartoon. Example, Indy survives a nuclear explosion while on ground zero. A series of ridiculous scenarios as such takes away from an otherwise entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>In the year 1957, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has been captured by a group of KGB agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and taken to Area 51 in the Nevada desert to find one particular box in a warehouse full of government secrets.  While that box does fall into enemy hands, Indiana does manage to escape.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are the days of the Red Scare, and the fact that the Soviets now have that box means Indiana is now on a government watch list.  Just as this is making things hard on his day job as a professor, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) finds Indiana.  Mutt quickly tells him that Indiana's old college friend Ox (John Hurt) has been captured and needs Indiana's help.  So it's off to South America on the trail of the fabled City of Gold and the crystal skull necessary to open it.  Irina is only one step behind Indy, however.  Can Indy figure out Ox's notes and rescue his friend while staying one step ahead of the Soviets?<br /><br />I never watched the Indiana Jones movies until I hit college, watching the second one earlier this year for the first time.  I think that helped my perspective.  While I enjoyed the movies, I was able to see (and overlook) their flaws.<br /><br />And that's what you have to do here, too.  Yes, there were some slow parts, but there was still plenty of action and humor.  And I loved those blink and you miss them references to the earlier films.  The emphasis here is on stunts and action, keeping the special effects to a minimum until the climax.  What special effects we did get did show how far we've come in the last 20 years.  The acting was great, especially Cate Blanchett who managed to steal some of her scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the biggest moments of the film was spoiled early.  It was still great, but it would have been so much better as a surprise.<br /><br />The only real problem I have with the film is the climax, which was pretty out there.  And considering the original films, that's saying something.  I've mellowed a little over time, so it's not quite the disaster it once was in my eyes.<br /><br />On the whole, I'll be able to accept where they went with the ending and enjoy the film for what it is, an escapist action movie that entertains.  This isn't serious movie making, but Indiana never has been.  This is definitely a movie to consider the next time you want some escapist action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong, I love Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford.  I like this movie but I don't love it.  Sean Connery was 53 the last time he played Bond and Roger Moore was 57.  They both looked too old for the part.  Ford is 65.  The last guy to punch out bad guys at a similar age was John Wayne.  There are some nice touches : bring back Karen Allen, acknowledging the passing of Denholm Elliot.  Rosewell?  Crystal Skulls? Worth having as part of an overall Indy collection.  It's better than the three turds Lucas calls his chapters I-III of STAR WARS saga.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Overall, if you go into the movie with the right expectations, you'll be in for a good thrill, a lot of fun, a one helluva sense of nostalgia. Unfortunately, a very poor story, less than thrilling characters, and incredibly over-the-top action keep this one on the ground. I'd rank it third in the series, only in front of Temple of Doom, which it shares a lot of problems with.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5<br /><br />Warning, if you have not seen this film, and have tried to avoid all spoilers thus far, you'll be well served when you see the film, because this movie is chock full of very important spoilers. It's darn tough, but I made it through three weeks of release without hearing anything totally major, and the experience was better because of it. From this point, be warned: HERE BE SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />Indy: Ahhh, since riding of on the Jordanian sunset, the good doctor has been very busy indeed. First, he fought in World War 2 (wouldn't you pay to see THAT movie???), and when the aliens landed in Roswell, he was there too, for some strange reason we're never quite privy to. The good doctor can still kick butt, and do incredible stunts, once again proving that like cows, Indiana Jones gets tougher with age. Whether you like this fact or not, since let's face it, Harrison can get the senior discount at Disney Land, right? Really, he hasn't changed personality wise since the last film, he's the same old professor, stressing old. You'll get giddy when he puts his hat on, and let's face it, you love seeing the icon again, right?<br /><br />Mutt: First off, what kind of name is "Mutt" for a potential future action hero? And what kind of iconic weapon is a pocket knife, which I believe is was lost in the movie? This could have been a great character, and in some senses he is, but he could have been a helluva lot better. He has a great personality, but he didn't really show he could be the next Indy like Phoenix did back in 'Last Crusade.' And I was very disappointed that Indy didn't pass the torch to Mutt. I mean, are we supposed to deal with old Harrison for another movie, kicking butt in a wheelchair? There's one scene where Mutt almost puts on Indy's hat, which would have been a great ending, but instead Indy takes it away. Very disappointing Spielberg.<br /><br />Other Characters: I found a bunch of characters in this movie just plain uninteresting. Marion, Mac, Oxley, the new dean, and the supporting baddies just didn't interest me. Not to say they were bad characters, I just didn't care for them. Bad character development. And Oxley could have been easily written out in favor for a more interesting plot-mover.<br /><br />Villain: Cate Blanchett is possibly the most overrated actress today. Which isn't hard, when she's almost single handedly dominated the best actress nominations the past few years. Her character could the poorest developed character. Nothing like Belloq, or that rich white guy from 'Last Crusade.' I mean, she pops up, and we're supposed to go, 'Ooohhh, she's real evil.' Not really, I mean, she's more freaky than evil. She's fascinated by psychological warfare? Really, that just doesn't pack any sort of a interesting punch. The character was also stereotypically Russian baddie, in a bad way. I mean, could the character be any more cookie cutter?<br /><br />The Action: Now, Indy has always been about action, so if you don't have action, you don't have an Indy movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem nearly as fun as it was back in the 80's, and it seems a bit forced, and at times uninteresting and unoriginal. Sure the motorcycle chase is fun, but the whole "Hangar 51" sequence seems a bit forced, although it does have some of the best moments of the movie. The whole chase sequence in the jungle on the other hand straddles the Hollywood line between believably and just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />CGI: One of the things that George and Steven wanted to do with this movie is keep down the CGI in most cases. However, on which sequences to use the CGI, they chose poorly. CGI BDA (CGI Big Damn Ants) are really testing that Hollywood line, and I really could have done without them. On the other hand, in the overall worst scene in the movie, Mutt swings Tarzan style through the jungle with a bunch of monkeys, and when you watch the background, either somebody forgot their CGI, or somebody needs to go back to computer school. I mean, that was absolutely pathetic, and reminded me of the terrible action background from 'Temple of Doom.'<br /><br />Over the Top: Let me count the ways...<br /><br />1. BDAs scaling each other to get to Cate Blanchett.<br />2. Mutt's Tarzan aforementioned Tarzan sequence.<br />3. Our heroes fall down 3 huge waterfalls with only a scratch to show for it.<br />4. The fact Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion inside a refrigerator. Did it have airbags?<br />5. The fact Harrison Ford can take down hefty men twice as young and twice as strong.<br />6. The Aliens. Why Steven, WHY?!?<br /><br />Which brings me too...<br /><br />The Story: What bothered me the most was this: the reason it took so long to get another Indy out was because George and Steven wanted the perfect story, and it took them almost 20 years to find it. And THEY CAME UP WITH THIS????<br /><br />Let me set it up this way, Indy searches for El Dorado, the supposed city of gold with Mutt, who seeks his help to save his mother. Now I must admit, I heard this spoiler, since it already was the worst kept secret in Hollywood, and not hard to figure out. Mutt is Indy and Marion's son. So the family races the evil Russians to find the city of gold, which they find with the help of a half-crazed loon who looked into the eyes of the crystal skull too long, which looks strangely like an alien head. When they finally find the city through strange happenstance, they find a room with not surprisingly, a bunch of alien figures. These aliens by the way helped the Mayans build pyramids and invent technology, which of course they couldn't have figured out on their own, so of course it must be alien.<br /><br />The Aliens soon reveal the temple they've been living in as a large cover for their very large spaceship, which is a page directly out of Stargate. The Aliens then leave, taking all the baddies, and giving Cate an overwhelming amount of knowledge, which promptly causes her to explode. The aliens then take the whole valley with them, and leave no trace. Indiana Jones then explains that El Dorado was not the city of gold, but rather the translation of the city of knowledge. Indy and Marion then get married.<br /><br />I blame David Keopp for this utterly lazy and stupid story, and I blame Steven and George for not realizing it was as bad as it was. I mean, the aliens still look the same as they did in the Spielberg movies years ago. They just don't change their look. Now, I could rail more against the story and aliens, but it appears I've almost written a book here...<br /><br />Anyways, we now can add what to expect with 4th movies from now on. 1st movies in classic series are usually classic and groundbreaking. 2nd usually isn't that great, and is bitter disappointment, and a scar that the director will never live down, they're the ones that ruin the series. The 3rd one may not be as good as the first, but it comes pretty darn close, usually dealing with something besides the action, although that's still there, but it just adds a bit more heart. We can now say that the 4th movie is a crapshoot, and you never can know what to expect. The 4th may not be as good as 1 and 3, but it beats 2, and still retains the aspect of what made the series good in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>It was a risky move returning to the Indiana Jones series.  With Star Wars, George Lucas set the story an entire generation earlier.  With the Indiana Jones series, even the series is named after the star, and such a film would be virtually unthinkable without Harrison Ford.  I like Harrison Ford, but he's getting on in years, and there's nothing more pathetic than 60-year-old men trying to act like they are 30 years old.  So instead of changing the character (or the actor), George changed the story - the year is not 193x, it is 195x. The bad guys are not Nazis but Soviets.  The B-movie template the adventure is grafted onto is not the 1930s serials but science-fiction masking as cold-war paranoia.  And in this George Lucas was absolutely correct - this is the way Indiana Jones could be pulled off 20 years later.  Unfortunately, this great idea is not carried off successfully and the film just isn't as good as I would expect from an Indy film.<br /><br />Prof. Henry Jones Jr. is still teaching archaeology at a liberal arts university, and still moonlighting as a "collector of rare antiquities".  He is kidnapped by Soviet agents and forced into the very warehouse that houses the Ark of the Covenant.  The Soviets, however, are after the Crystal Skull - an artifact of great power (potentially, at least) and that generates an impossibly strong (by modern science's understanding) magnetic field.  Thus Indy is off with a few others in tow to find the origin of the crystal skull.<br /><br />There are many great parts about this film.  Some of the action sequences rival the best (many are non-CGI!) sequences from the previous films.  Marian Ravenwood returns, and she is just as spunky as ever (and, remarkably, looks to have aged far less than Indy).  There are flashes of humour - I especially liked the student asking Professor Jones a question in the middle of a chase scene through the University library.  Sure, it sounds cheesy and contrived when written in a text review, but all of Indiana Jones is designed that way, the fun is the new ways in which the same contrivances are presented.  And the addition of Shia Lebouef as a younger, brash sidekick is not as annoying as you'd think - in fact, I grew to quite like young Mutt.<br /><br />But, but, but.....  Ultimately, the film descends into a giant CGI-fest that wears out its welcome in the second half.  The snakes, bugs, and rats in Indys 1,2,and 3 are real critters, and therefore creepy - you know Willie is sticking her hand into an alcove of creepy crawlies, or that Marian has fallen into a pit of vipers.  In Indy 4 we get CGI ants that ooze homogeneous pink goo when squished and who apparently have a hive intellegence.  Worse yet, the climax of the film mostly consists of the main characters staring at a blue screen.  I was reminded of Richard Dreyfuss's famous comment to Spielberg about Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind - "Have you decided what we're staring at yet, Stephen?"  But worst of all, Indiana Jones is neutered by the end because of the introduction of Oxley, the expert on the Crystal Skulls.  All Indy can manage is to ask Oxley, again and again (and again!) "what do we do now?" "How did you get through here the last time?" "Where do we go next?" "How do we defeat this guardian/lock/trap?"  This is not the Indiana Jones who can read heirogliphics, knows the legends of the Thugee cult, and who can "fly? yes. Land? No!" but proceeds to fly the plane anyways.<br /><br />So I am all the more disappointed that such a promising premise degenerated by the end into mush.  I'm not sure wherein the problem lies - certainly it's not with Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen or Shia Lebouef.  It's not even with Harrison Ford (at least, not his acting).  They do the best they can.  No, ultimately, I guess the blame must be laid at one (or both) of Lucas and Speilberg for not being able to pull it off.  It's a shame, too, because I really wanted to like this film.  Finally, I can't get over the title.  Why "Kingdom" of the Crystal Skull?  Why not just "Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"?  Or "Indy and the search for El Dorado"? or "the City of Gold"?  Worst name ever.... except for "Attack of the Clones".<br /><br />This Blu-ray edition has some nice extras in it, mostly making-of stuff.  But, as with Lucas's other films, the making-of stuff has clearly been edited and presented in a form that makes it interesting and informative, rather than the haphazard extras most DVDs and Blu-rays include.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>In terms of film trilogies, the original three "Indiana Jones" sagas are about as good as they come in terms of action, adventure, drama, and even comedy.  Unfortunately, this film goofs up the classic Indy formula and instead creates a lackluster, plodding effort that will only please those enthralled by much movement on the screen.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" sees Indy (Harrison Ford) battling a group of 1950s Russians, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), for possession of an ancient "crystal skull" artifact that holds the key to the ancient Mayan civilization.  Along the way, Dr. Jones runs into one old friend in Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), as well as a potential child prodigy Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf).<br /><br />The #1 problem with this film is readily apparent for fans of the Indy series up to this point: In the other films, Ford's Jones was always the "straight man" in a world that seemed to be crashing in on him either due to dramatic or comedic circumstances.  He was a guy who could be counted on to get the job done and do the right thing, and viewers can identify with that.  This time, though, Ford's Jones is nothing more than a goof (the tongue-in-cheek play on Ford's age only comes off as trite, not relevant), and thus difficult to root for.  We WANT to see him be that swashbuckling hero again, but that's just not the way his character is developed this time around.<br /><br />It doesn't help that the supporting cast isn't really given enough to do.  Allen (in what could have been a grand return) is little more than a bit part, while Mutt's entire character devlopment is undermined when the film finally concludes (in a final scene that will have you rolling your eyes instead of clapping your hands).<br /><br />Director Steven Spielberg never wanted to resurrect the franchise to begin with, but enough pressure from Ford and George Lucas persuaded him to helm the project once again.  From his own mouth, Spielberg said he never intended this film to be as grand as the original trilogy, but I think that is part of the problem.  As a filmmaker, you can't just go from explosive to average...you either do a great job, or leave it creatively in the past.<br /><br />Thus, unless you are the largest of Indy fans and can overlook this film's many flaws in favor of the simple images of the whip and explorer's cap, you can skip this one.  Just remember, instead, the classic trilogy for what it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>In the special features of this DVD, Steven Spielberg remarks that when Harrison Ford first ran the idea of a new Indiana Jones movie past him, he told the actor that he had *moved on* beyond this series of films. It would have been infinitely prudent had Spielberg remained steadfast in this profoundly clear assessment.<br /><br />I've seen better fight scenes in a 1930s B-western film... but I'm getting ahead of myself. The point is that Harrison Ford wasn't precisely a young man when he made his first three Indy films. And as this movie unfolds for the viewer, it becomes notably apparent that he was far too old and rickety to be making yet another in 2008. What in the world were they thinking about?!?<br /><br />This film is little more than a fairly heinous and unashamed re-write of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a>, even to the point that the producers clung to the now-hackneyed John Williams *Raiders* theme/filmscore, with not the slightest hint of an update. In *Raiders* this soundtrack was uplifting and triumphant -- but here it comes off as dated and silly.<br /><br />In *Raiders* the stunts and events were just plausible if one allowed his or her imagination to joyfully stretch just a bit for the sake of completing the Hollywood magic... totally acceptable. In this instance, however, Indy survives unscathed a full nuclear blast by leaping into a 1950s vintage refrigerator. Through a repetition of similarly moronic gags, the film takes on the flavor of a *Bullwinkle* cartoon minus the great humor of the latter. These antics are openly slapstick but they suffer from clich&eacute; and familiarity and the overall story, a tenuous one at best, breaks down as a result.<br /><br />For me though, the greatest insult was to one of my favorite actors who was grossly mis-cast here into an inappropriate role: Cate Blanchett [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>]. She plays a stereotypical ruthless Bondish-type Soviet scientist. Even though she yields a valiant effort, even she cannot surmount this witless dialogue and artless direction. Thus the role served only to diminish her sterling career.<br /><br />The film-makers also shamelessly re-introduced a wrinkled and aged *Marion Ravenwood* [played by Karen Allen]... unforgivable.<br /><br />No, this movie isn't exactly hateful. It just comes off as a lame idea and equally as Hollywood good-old-boy senility. It's clearly the worst idea that Lucas, Spielberg, and/or Ford ever spawned and represents a direct slap to the previous three Indy movies, all of which were really First-Class..<br /><br />WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! So, what does this yarn involve? Well, it's actually all about a discovery by one of Jones' associates of advanced aliens having invaded an ancient South American tribal culture -- but they don't call them aliens. The producers felt that it would be a superior approach to assert that these beings came from another *dimension*, even though the beings ultimately exit the planet in a flying saucer!<br /><br />The tale transpires in the 1950s and Indy (who discovers along the way that he has a grown son, vignettes of Captain Kirk in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000683DH">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>) faces the Red Menace of the Soviets rather than his former pre-World War Two nemeses -- but it's still the same story. Even *The Ark of the Covenant* garners a flash of a cameo appearance, (which is perhaps the only really humorous moment during the entire film.)<br /><br />I see that used copies of this DVD are being hawked for ninety-seven cents plus a fiver for shipping and handling on Amazon. Thus, I highly recommend that you check out your local public library's copy before you lay out that sort of cash for this slug of an action flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>Doubters doubt no more. Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls is funny, highly entertaining and surprisingly exciting! Personally I think the best entry into this series was, is and always will be Temple of Doom so I really wasn't expecting this to top that in any way, which it didn't, but it did however come awful close to topping what I felt was the weakest entry, The Last Crusade. Not by all that much though. Both had their strengths and weaknesses, both are exciting but Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls had the benefit of falling back on CG environments and action sequences, The Last Crusade did not.<br /><br />It was great to see Karen Allen return to this entry and, despite not being the biggest fan of his work, I felt Shia LeBeouf really did do a decent job as rebellious greaser Mutt Williams but ultimately this is all about Harrison Ford, am I right? Ford's presence was 100% necessary to make or break this film and thankfully I feel the film worked quite well without actually upping the ante. He came, he saw, he kicked ass and that appears to have been the intention all along, give the fans what they want and give `em lots of it. We weren't offered much of a glimpse into Indie's between film relationship with Marion, just a failed engagement, but there is indeed a shocker awaiting those of you that don't see it coming the first 25 minutes of the film.<br /><br />I've heard a few complaints about this film ranging from the CG gophers to the outlandish story, and I certainly agree with the goofy gophers, but I'll be damned if this concept isn't any more or less outlandish than a magical box, magical stones and a magical cup. C'mon folks, withdraw that stick from you know where and have fun with this entry! This was entertaining as heck and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. Perhaps it "could have been better" but what film couldn't be?</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>I've enjoyed the first three Indiana Jones.  Sure some fans feel the second was a bit weak, others feel the third was the weaker.  And everyone felt that the first one was a classic. But for sure most everyone will agree that this fourth installment is awful - although the opening 5 minutes seemed promising.<br /><br />Clearly this movie has the paws of George Lucas all over it, in an effort to establish a franchise with the Indiana Jones' son taking over and before it becomes Indiana Jones and the search for Geritol.<br /><br />Also another sign of George Lucas's interference is in the indiscriminate overuse of special effects.  I guess his effects company, Industrial Light and Magic needed some more work.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Harrison Ford et al. riding off into the sunset is a fitting end to the series.  Definately won't be buying this episode to "complete" my set.<br /><br />This movie is utter  cash grabbing garbage.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>The first two thirds of this movie were pretty fantastic and very gripping. It delivered the goods for everyone waiting to check back in with the rough-and-tumble Dr. Henry Jones, (junior ... ahem). But having grown up with Indiana Jones, I've already gotten past the Lucas Factor of being let down long ago. I hung my head in shame after I scurried home from the theatre after seeing '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">The Temple of Doom</a>' back in 1984. I wish I had missed that film altogether, even to this day. Needless to say there is a section of this film which I find down-right embarrassing and the Cthulu call for George Lucas.<br /><br />Crystal Skull takes a nose dive during the 'Jungle Chase' scene which seems to be action filler so Cate Blanchett and Shia LeBeouf can rack up some screen-time minutes or perhaps fill a quota or a  contractual agreement with the producers. Whatever it was, it was not just the slowest part of the movie but also the most unnecessary and the biggest reminder, or throw back to The Temple of Doom, thus far. Going over cliffs was well covered in parts two and three, but now we have to revisit it again just so we can add to the run time.<br /><br />I do realize that it was just framework to the very interesting fight-action sequence with the ants which was cool and had a nostalgic feel to it. I think that kind of action is what people tuned in for, but what came before it in the ten minutes previous and the next ten minutes after, should have been left in the editing hard-drives.<br /><br />The 'Jungle Chase' scene though, more directly is classic Lucas faire. He's probably covered this same ground in almost every film he's ever done. A lot of people have complained loudly about just this sort of thing spoiling the Star Wars franchise. So why bother to do it again? The scene of a young fighter precariously hanging on to some shaky edifice, fighting for his life with legs splayed akimbo, desperately trying to fend off his enemy and move the story forward with some type of sword fight. Sigh ... please.<br /><br />How many times did we see this stuff in Episode I, II and II? Too many. It only seemed that Lucas began to learn his lessons by the third film, which was already too late as he had alienated his core audience and even most adults. His interest in his Lego Land contracts and peddling to toddlers always looked to interfere with his real filmmaking, unlike Spielberg who never pandered or bowed full-bend to the marketing aspect of these productions never forgetting that the reason for the film was not the toys.<br /><br />So why Spielberg would let this kind of element creep in and slow down such a good movie is beyond me. Maybe he just can't tell the guy, his good friend, George -- that what he's 'seeing' isn't that great after all. We saw this same element in Jedi, which killed the movie and now he pulls it out once more. At least you can see that Spielberg learned a few things over the years with some of his other movies, by using the absurd to insert his heroes into history like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA2">Forrest Gump</a> in the 'Doom Town' sequence.<br /><br />In all honestly, this film is a perfect candidate for fanedit dot com. A place where film editors, some professional, some work-man, anonymously re-edit films removing certain scenes or offending elements, tightening them up and making them better movies in most cases. A good example of work done through fan edit was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V6ITE">Blade III</a> (retitled 'Kill The King'). All instance of Hannibal King, aka Ryan Reynolds is completely removed. Having seen the movie, I can tell you without doubt it's leagues better than the studio release.<br /><br />I thought I had seen everything in film, but watching Dr. Jones step into the refrigidaire and close the door on himself in order to avoid a nuclear blast was pretty riveting to say the least and very inventive. It's exactly this kind of chess-playing in the writing that most people are hoping to see. The scene where Indy crests over the berm and is face to face with the mushroom cloud is a great piece of film-making. For the last two years I've been seeing artificial CG renderings of atomic and nuclear bomb blasts showing up on blogs and littering youtube, now I know why and where they came from. Some people were put-off by this and cried foul, but every element in this franchise is over the top. Trying to ground it in Christopher Nolan workman-style realism is foolish. Are you paying attention?<br /><br />Upping the ante at this point in the film was pretty genius as well as wiley, making room for excellent long-range planning. Immediately after the radioactive scrub down, we learn that Dr. Jones, is ... gasp ... an Army General ... and then a member of OSS ... gasp! ... and later a double-agent within the CIA. The back story that was built up lends this whole franchise to now be reinvented and the older adventures of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDVE">Young Indiana Jones</a> to be forgotten and revisited, probably picked up as Dr. Jones runs through a secret trap door from Hitler's Bunker with a smoking gun, not played by Shia LeBeuf, but possibly some as of yet unknown. The writers scored a big plus here and I'm sure Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were very happy when they read that portion of the script.<br /><br />The ending of the film where the mantle doesn't pass, yet, is probably the question both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have been batting around themselves. Who will take over my life's work, when my hair is too gray, too thin, my time too short and my interest in the job too waning? You have to wonder who exactly has been groomed to carry on all those unfinished projects, the war adventures of Indiana Jones being apart of that probably massive pile.<br /><br />The Fifth and likely conclusion to this franchise in this era is already being discussed, planned and will probably be announced sometime in March of 2009. Harrison Ford is close to 70 now so time is of the essence in every aspect. The directors are older, too as are the producers. The question of handing his whip & pistol over is a tricky one. Edging out the hero from a franchise has proven fatal before. Yes, back to Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer we go.<br /><br />There was a time in Hollywood when studios no longer wanted to bankroll and produce comic book action movies because a long string of failures that had almost bankrupted several studios in the mid-nineties. A few actually folded. Then along came Wesley Snipes and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780624890">Blade</a>. It's no secret that Blade reinvigorated the genre and thus the current generation, singularly, owes him a debt of gratitude greater than his IRS burden or the value of Ed McMahon's home. Blade made a lot of money and gave both the confidence and greenlight to other movies that in turn did well and made money.<br /><br />But one day, David Goyer disagreed with Wesley Snipes like a bad episode of House MD and broadcast it unfairly from the rooftops, thus Alienating our favorite Vampire Killer. Wesley didn't think Vampire Hunters teaming up with him was a good idea or that the Vampire Hunters should be teenagers. It sounded good, because after all Vampire films started off with stuff like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHOK">Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter</a>, again -- it sounded good. But, Wesley openly disagreed with the direction of the franchise and was ignored. It didn't go well, neither did the movie. But I mentioned this already, didn't I? In this scenario, with Harrison Ford, there is no disagreement, but the problem is the same. The studio needs to extricate its hero and find a way to continue without being a clich&eacute;. All I can say is: Good luck, folks.<br /><br />Overall, this story covers a lot of ground, and perhaps in retrospect, maybe too much. Maybe the flaw of this film was giving the audience too much to chew on. I was happy to see Cate Blanchett in something other than a period costume drama of either Elizabeth or a depression era redressing of Katherine Hepburn. I felt the film time that she was given was adequate (minus the 'Jungle Chase') and  her character was more than fleshed out for the escapist action drama that we were all sinking into. Sometimes not overstating a character gives the character more power. Look at Julianne More as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AEF6D6">Maude Lebowski</a> who has little screen time compared to Walter or The Dude, but she has one of the most memorable modern film roles in recent history. Who doesn't remember the line: 'Do you like coitus, Jefferey?'<br /><br />You don't need to beat a viewer over the head in order to make a point. I think we all got the evil persona that she was after the Area 51 scene. Doctor-Professor was a nice touch. Look for it soon in the next Pixar flick. Blanchett's period costume though left much to be desired as she looked more like Lara's work-camp daughter from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9M">Doctor Zhivago</a> than she ever did as a female version of Dr. Evil in her gray and unappealing jumpsuit. Trying to work us on a seductive Madame Blavatsky angle was good and quite interesting and probably factual to period maniacs of the time, but they overplayed her hand and dashed the project into the rocks that they thought were heading for, all in the drama.<br /><br />Also, as much as I like Ray Winstone, (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UV33">Sexy Beast</a> is a masterpiece), I felt that his addition was overwrought and unnecessary. Somehow his whole presence seemed very last-minute, maybe his role had something to do with the script leak. Maybe. Maybe not.<br /><br />The ending is quite good. The whole story arc of Roswell, Area 51, General Jones comes together nicely and is probably one of the few times in blockbuster cinema where the subject matter is dealt with in an interesting manner and not treated as an off-handed joke. Knight's 'Signs' was an interesting mix of fundamental religion versus new-age lore and was treated well there. It was handled with equal skill here.<br /><br />Maybe, with a few more viewings and a couple of sit-downs with the commentary track (ahem ... next DVD version of course, as this one doesn't have one), my thoughts will develop and change, but until then, I think I've gilded the Lilly to the point of wilting.<br /><br />.... ....</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings to the screen Hollywood's most well known archaeologist in his latest adventure.<br />Twenty years after his legendary run-ins with the Germans while on archaeological digs, things have changed quite a bit with WWII coming and going, and the Soviets having made their appearance. So it is during the Cold War era that Indiana Jones embarks on a journey to Peru, South America in an effort to uncover the secret of a mysterious crystal skull which legend has it holds the secret to unprecedented power.<br />Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, John Hurt, Karen Allen, and the rest of the cast, have carried out their performances very well, though, Shia LaBeouf was a poor choice for the role of Mutt Williams (just as he had been in Transformers).<br />Regarding the specifics, Harrison Ford's age really shows and naturally enough he is rather frail compared to his old self which is difficult to swallow. Moreover, it is not that easy to adjust to a post-WWII setting without the Germans around and with 1950's fashion and Rock and Roll all about. Finally, laying the foundation for a younger adventurer to replace Indy is a good thing in keeping the saga going and quite sad for seeing the end of an era approaching.<br />The acting, the setting, the plot, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful and along with the mystery that accompanies this film will keep you on your toes throughout the entire movie.<br />In short, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, though it will probably produce a lot of nostalgia for the younger, more sturdy, Indiana Jones that we have grown to know and love, and the years gone by. 4.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>So, based on some reviews I've read and comments I've seen from viewers on TV...apparently INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDON OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is supposed to have been a life-changing movie.  At least a groundbreaking film sure to vault to "all-time classic" status.  Because there sure are a lot of disappointed viewers around.<br /><br />If, however, you have the more reasonable expectation of a highly-entertaining, highly-implausible action film that hearkens back to the "cliff-hanger" brand of old-school adventure...but gussied up with all the modern technology can bring...then you'll be fairly well satisfied.<br /><br />Let me get to the "bad" stuff first...the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  Without giving too much away, let me just say that the quest Indiana Jones finds himself on is not terribly interesting on its own.  The bad-guys are Soviets (led by a hugely over-the-top Cate Blanchett as Irina) are in the US to snag a crystal skull from the same storage warehouse that the "Lost Ark" was hidden at the end of that film.  This unusual artifact can apparently bestow some great powers when it is returned to its home in a lost kingdom in the Amazon.  Naturally, the Soviets want to do that.  Indiana, for various reasons, is compelled to thwart their efforts.  At the end, when all the key characters are assembled in this hidden temple...the payoff is actually unexciting.  You just don't quite understand what is happening, and it feels, quite frankly, like the final scenes of either NATIONAL TREASURE movie.  Overblown sets and not much excitement.  I was disappointed that these scenes were all the movie was leading up to.<br /><br />Here's the good stuff:  the movie has several truly outstanding action sequences...including a lengthy chase scene through the jungles of the Amazon.  It involves trucks, jeeps, machine guns, fistfights on the backs of these vehicles, much leaping from jeep to another, giant ants, playful monkeys, wild rivers, waterfalls and more.  It is wildly unbelievable yet I found myself laughing in delight, cringing in anxiety and marveling at the technical skill.  All the while, Harrison Ford served as the droll centerpiece...agile yet admitting his age.  I was so delighted by this long scene that I nearly burst into applause...but I was certainly smiling in gratitude for such a breathless good time.<br /><br />A motorcycle chase is loads of fun too, as is Indy's initial brush with the Soviets, which leads to a very funny scene involving an atomic explosion (don't ask...just see for yourself).<br /><br />Harrison Ford is certainly older, but he's as wiry as ever and if anything, the age has made his world-weary irony fit him even better.  Shia LaBeouff is Mutt, a young man who enlists Indy's aid is funny and makes a nice foil for Ford.  Blanchett is probably a little broad with her characterization, but it fits the tone of these movies.  Ray Winstone is Indiana's long-time friend and partner...and he's adequate but the script isn't really all the interested in him either.  John Hurt is fun, and even Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood...and she and Ford have instant and convincing chemistry.<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a classic because it melded so well the cheesy action movies of the `40s with modern filmmaking technology and a well-conceived central character.  Subsequent entries in the series are merely extensions or enhancements of the original amazing achievement.  They are loads of fun too (some more than others), but only RAIDERS will ever have classic status.  CRYSTAL SKULL is a worthy partner to the original three films, and I hope you'll set your expectations at the correct level and just go enjoy the heck out of the film!</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>5 of 5 stars for the action-adventure movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Really nice to have Indiana Jones back after two decades. Older, smarter and a bit slower, but, still the Indy we all know and love. The movie opens with the Russians (oh, we're in the 1950's now) trying to break-into Area 51 to recover an artifact. They've brought Jones as a hostage and to find the artifact in the storage warehouse. From there, we're on a typical Indie quest. I can tell you that there is a Crystal Skull (or two) involved. We do see the return of Marian (Karen Allen) as Indie's lost girlfriend. There are other surprises in this movie.<br /><br />Expertly crafted and on par with all three previous Indie movies.Richly photographed, great sets, great action and fun chases. I have added this movie to my list of favorites and highly recommend it! This is a two bag-of-popcorn feature movie! Let's hope for more adventures in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>As Steven Spielberg observes in the bonus matter, the fourth Indy film almost never got made at all, and we probably have Harrison Ford to thank for the fact that it did.  Ford, 66 when the movie came out, is a little heavier now, a little softer around the jawline, a little grizzled, but he clearly shows that he still has what it takes to recreate one of his most beloved characters.  The year is 1957, and Indy, after a distinguished career in World War II (he served in the OSS and attained the rank of Colonel) and several "years spyin' on the Commies," is kidnapped by a task-force of Russians headed up by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett in an inky-black Prince Valiant haircut) to help them find a set of "mummified remains" which he helped study 10 years earlier (most viewers will guess at its connection to the famous "Area 51" case, and indeed the warehouse the gang crashes is so emblazoned; one wonders if the Ark of the Covenant is in there too).  Though he's unable to prevent them from getting away with their swag, Indy soon finds himself drawn back into the case when a motorcycle-riding youngster who calls himself Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) approaches him and explains that his foster father (John Hurt), an old schoolmate of Indy's, has disappeared into the jungles of South America in a bid to return a mysterious artifact to its proper resting place.  Mutt's mother is also among the missing, and he fears she and Prof. Oxley are in danger.  Which they are, because Spalko and her followers aren't just looking for remains.<br /><br />Reuniting Ford, Spielberg, George Lucas, Karen Allen, John Williams, and various other key figures in the Indy saga, this may be the best of the entire series.  There are so many fantastic scenes I can't even begin to decide which was my favorite, yet none of them have the grue of Satipo's death or the melting Nasties, I mean Nazis, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a>.  The pace barely lets up for a moment--there are just enough quieter moments to give you a chance to catch your breath between crises--and the SFX are, of course, incomparable.  You may also want to read the novelization<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545007011">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a> and buy the soundtrack CD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171MNM4">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the ending for you but If I do with my ramblings then I apologise. The year is 1957 and a group of soviet soldiers break into a secret military base with an aged Indiana Jones. They want him to lead them to a box containing a mysterious mummified corpse which will help lead them to the powerful yet mysterious crystal skull. When they manage to locate the crystal skull and return it to its original resting place, unknown powers will be unleashed that if returned by the leading soviet lady Irina Spalko, it could mean a drastic turn in the cold war for the west.<br /><br />Now myself, like many others were doubtful that a fourth Indiana Jones film could work just as well as the originals. Not to sound ageist but the age of Harrison Ford was one of the main concerns when playing such a role. Literally from the first few scenes starting with the warehouse, my doubts were squashed. Harrison seemed on form with his action sequences, although I'm sure the stunt double played a particularly larger part in this instalment. Accompanying Indy on his missions this time around is a young, cocky, motorcycle riding 60s clich&eacute; called Mutt (LaBeouf). Don't worry though because this instalment isn't just starring one original cast member as an old Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Marian Ravenwood comes back to reclaim Indy's heart. Oh and she's also Mutts mother, see the connection there?<br /><br />The action for this film is easily the best I've seen from any Indy film and that's including the classic boulder scene. Of course the CGI was destined to play a big part in a new Indy film and it really does. That doesn't take anything away from it, however, as the CG really is flawless and presents the environments with a genuine rapport to them.<br /><br />Overall it's a genuinely good film, the ending is a bit random and in some ways disappointing. It keeps the classic humorous moments in over the top situations, I have a genuine respect for Harrison Ford for what he's done in this film. He's shown that he can still hang with the young action stars of today and it definitely had its passing of the torch moment in relation to LaBeouf. I would recommend it to any film lover and wouldn't separate it from the entire Indy series as it's definitely kept the trend of being a satisfying action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Yes the movie has some humor but as for a proper completion of the original Jones series it's a disappointment. It took far to long to come to fruition. For years we drooled over the rumor mill of an Atlantean adventure amongst others, but in the end it's as though they threw something together to finally get it done. Not the clever dialogue, suspense, or exciting action we hoped would end the series. The question now is, will it be carried on by a young "Mutt" played by Shia LaBeouf? Is Mutt a reference to the another dogs name Indiana took? After all perhaps they felt like father like son using dog names. The younger audience may feel this is the same kind of fun that the previous movies offered, but it is doubtful the original fans will be so forgiving. It was nice of them to give a nod to the "Pancho Villa" episode of the "Young Indiana Jones" series.  If you enjoyed this movie, catch the more enjoyable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NSCRQ">The Librarian - Quest for the Spear</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J58GU">King Solomon's Mines</a> with Patrick Swayze.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>Honestly, I was dragged to this film.  So, how surprised was I that I loved it.  I was concerned about Ford's age and how he would play the character of Jones.  They found the perfect balance in the film for him.<br />The movie was filled with action and humor like the first.  Le Bouef was a great attribute and will hopefully continue on with the films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053TWVA0">House II: The Second Story</a>for a more entertaining story about a crystal skull. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't exciting and the plot is a failure of the imagination that did not connect with audiences. Yet again people were let down by mastermind of the Star Wars prequels. And Indiana is an old dog now. Old Baby Boomers like Lucas know how it is not having the energy for adventure and risk taking like they did 40 years ago. Time to settle down professor. So they marry him off to one of his former conquests and make him take care of his basterd, Mutt, played by the undeservedly big role landing Lebuff or however he spells it. Next Indiana will be in a retirement home and sort of rip-off the plot from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LQJMQ">Bubba Ho-Tep (Limited Collector's Edition)</a> and doing commercials like Dennis Hopper before he finally left the spotlight. Harrison Ford looks soo tired.<br />Actually Spielberg had much more to do with the creation of Indiana Jones and of course with the style and creation of the classic first film, Raiders of the Lost Arc, which made Indiana Jones a household name and movie icon. So Lucas gets unfair credit for Indiana Jones. Instead, when thinking of Lucas think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWUWU8">Howard the Duck</a>.<br />A resentful but filthy rich Lucas told Spielberg that people will call them a word that begins with the letter "a" and hate the movie... Now having the ability to predict his own future through his use of the Force the prophecy mostly came to pass.<br /><br />Some indulgent comments: I recall Quintin Tarantino saying directors do not improve with age and you have to think there is something to that. But no, this doesn't apply to the creator of Indiana Jones*. I'm not sure George Luca$ ever had much talent in the first place at this point. He was lucky! Imagine if they'd given him more money and he had better "special effects" technology... those movies weren't the movies Lucas wanted to make and he has repeatedly said so. And his least favorite is...The Empire Strikes Back. And Spielberg..well has he gotten better? I look forward to Spielberg's biopic of Lincoln with the great Daniel Day Lewis playing the part..</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford and more star in Steven Spielberg's 2008 adventure sequel.<br />In 1957, Indiana Jones locates an ancient artifact that Russians want<br />to use as a weapon.

I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>I saw "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in the theater when I was 10.<br /><br />That's probably the best disclaimer I can issue regarding my reaction to the worst-titled movie in this series, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."  Indy has been a part of me for as long as I can remember and no movie hero will ever mean as much to me.  How many tedious days did I sit in fourth grade, gazing wistfully out the window as John Williams' perfect theme music played through my head?  I'd imagine myself battling Nazis and searching for fortune and glory, and life was good.  I'd do the same thing in high school, college, grad school . . . I'm half-amazed I didn't become an archeologist.<br /><br />And so it is that I cannot be objective about this movie - I simultaneously love it and regret it.  I love it because it's Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford may a bit long in the tooth and a a trifle thicker around the waist, but he's still the perfect action hero.  I see his shadow wearily don his trademark fedora, and I feel 10 years old again.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what happens in this movie - there's something about the Russians, Cate Blanchett, a punk greaser (Shia Lebouef), John Hurt, and the welcome return of Marion.  There are thrilling chases. There are eye-popping visual effects.  There are carnivorous ants - hooray! And there is Indy, swashbuckling through it all.<br /><br />And yet it is so much less than could possibly be expected - we waited 20 years for this?  If Tolkein came back from the dead and wrote another "Lord of the Rings" novel, it wouldn't be as eagerly anticipated as Indy's return.  While that may be unfair, that's the price you pay for creating a defining character in film history.<br /><br />If you love Indiana Jones, get this movie.  You will love it and hate it, and you'll probably watch it again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>totally fun nostalgia. the entire cast is great, and what works best is that Spielberg takes elements from all 3 films, plus, the topic he knows the best- sci-fi, and adds it all together into a terrific action adventure. a fun film all around. and a...(read more)s a plus, Ford and Allen still have that spark from years ago!</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>I missed out on seeing this at the theatre but the DVD version was okay. It was your typical Indiana Jones movie with all the excitement and the chase scenes which to me is one of the hallmarks of this series. Harrison Ford did it again. I wonder if he will continue this at the age of 70? Anyway I thought it was okay!</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I don't get why people are so hard on this movie. I guess it didn't live up to their expectations based on the previous movies. Well, I was never an Indiana fan and I never watched any of the previous movies. At least, not all the way through. So this was really my first movie to the series and I thought it was a lot of fun. The alien thing was kinda weird but it didn't stop me from liking the movie. So stop hating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>I do not rate this one as highly as Raiders but certainly better than Temple of Doom and Last Crusade. The storyline was great, even if a few plot devices were less than believable (a defect with all the movies) but for sheer entertainment you'd be hard-pressed to beat Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull. I wish the movie had made the Soviets more obviously evil, perhaps making the male colonel out to be an ex-labor camp chief or something. One of the things that made you root for Indy in the original movies was just how BAD the protagonists were. But still, an excellent film and one I look forward to watching many, many times!</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>I've always been an Indiana Jones fan and always will be so of course I'm a little bias with this movie but I don't think by much.  The one thing people have to remember is eighteen years have gone by so Indy can't still be fighting the nazis any more so we come up with the Soviets during the cold war era.  I also think the movies story quest about the crystal skulls was also pretty good and I think it depends on the person points of view whether or not the crystal skulls were truly alien in origin.  I don't want to give away to much so you'll just have to see the movie and see what I'm talking about.  The one downside I think was the actor who played Indy's son I'm not saying he was a bad actor but he just seemed a little lame to be Indy's son not to be cruel.  It's to bad we cant go back in time a little because if you've seen the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles I think the actor Sean Patrick Flannery would have been great to play Indy's son in the movie.  I do also like that they brought back the original actress who played Marion in the first Indy movie that brought a little nostalgia back for me. The blu-ray dvd does do the job the video is superb and the audio is incredible a great job done for the blu-ray dvd.  So if you're like me and have the Indiana Jones movies as well as the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles set finish your collection and get this final incredible movie for yourself right away...</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULLS has all the elements of the series: the whip, the sarcasm, the heroics, the cobwebs, the puzzles, Karen Allen, but at the same time, shoots itself in the foot with over-the-top stunts (even for Indiana Jones) and surprisingly enough... a lack of creativity.<br /><br />There were great things about THE CRYSTAL SKULLS. The opening moments in the warehouse were top notch Indiana Jones. Cate Blanchett was phenominal. In fact, the nuclear city and the diner were interesting, funny and good leads in to an adventure movie. Karen Allen's return put a smile across my face. The graveyard scene was excellent as the skeletons seem to emerge from the dark crevaces of the multi-layered cemetary.<br /><br />Yet, then there were the moments that were so ridiculous, even for Indiana Jones, that the stunt and effect had the exact opposite effect that the Directors intended... at least on this viewer. The first... was the motorcycle sliding under the tables in the library. Then the kid apparently didn't hear the motorcycle or the commotion looks up from his book. Wow. That was bad.<br /><br />The waterfalls... 3 of them. Everybody just crawls back into the boats and goes on with business. Silly. A swordfight as Mutt Williams stradles 2 jeeps racing through the jungle. Yet, the biggest turn off of the entire film was a scene where Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) decides to drive off a cliff. I know that the point was to show that she has just as much balls as Indiana Jones, but... she drives off the cliff as if she had it planned ahead of time that the tree branch 100 feet down would catch them... lower them down to the water gently and then swing back up and hit the soldiers climbing the cliff wall. The whole thing was ridiculous as it gets.<br /><br />Then of course there was the ending that was way too similar to RAIDERS. Couldn't they have thought of something new?<br /><br />I guess my biggest gripe is that names like SPIELBERG and LUCAS would be so shameless as to stoop to the cheap thrills level that EMMERICH, BAY and WISEMAN do with their summer movies. Lets just throw in some OVER the top stunts to please the popcorn popping crowd.<br /><br />Note to movie makers: Stunts aren't exciting when people can't imagine them being pheasible. They're just ridiculous and forgettable. More is not always the best option.<br /><br />INDIANA JONES IN THE CRYSTAL SKULLS is a 3 star movie. It's okay. Yet, I give it just 2 stars because SPIELBERG and LUCAS... should have known better. After nearly twenty years... you'd think that the story would have been more thought out and they wouldn't have had to coat their movie with ridiculous over the top stunts to cover it up.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>[SPOILER WARNING]<br /><br />The movie opens up at a desert base in US. A group of soldiers arrives and shoots the guards. Surprise. They are KGB agents,  lead by a bob-wearing, rapier wielding villainess. They open the trunk of their car, and voila, Indiana Jones and his friend are inside. Together, the villains force Indiana to locate a mysterious relic that they think will give the Russians advantage in the cold war.<br /><br />Soon Indiana is embroiled in a mystery that takes him to South America after the mysterious "Crystal" Skull. Joined by a greaser named Mud and his Harley Davidson motorbike<br /><br />I felt this film had some potential and it 'almost' worked' for me, but at times it was just plain silly and jumped the shark. Mud swinging through the trees hanging from vines like Tarzan, the giant ants, and, worst of all, the scene with the refrigerator, and the Indians who seem to have nothing better to do other than to hang out in graveyards, and hide in ancient tombs... Yeah right.  It watched like a video game, and unlike the first few films... I never really got the sense that Jones and his family were ever in jeopardy. Wherever something didn't make sense, or lacked direction, the screenwriter seemed to just throw in an action scene. It was just... Well... A bit silly.<br /><br />This was a rather obvious, predictable film that the kids might enjoy. While I didn't hate it, I didn't love it either. 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>I saw this in the theater with my family and was blown away by it. I love this film. I am a big fan of the first three, and while this is not as great as it's three predecessors, it totally rocks!

If you don't like it, that's all right, as we all have our own opinions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 11/08<br />Rate: 1<br /><br />11/08: I feel like I went blind after seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull (sheesh, what a long title or perhaps there are just too many syllables). Granted, this fourth installment should have not been made in the first place, and it's best to let the series die because Harrison Ford is just simply too old. Another reason is that, of course, a film made in 2008 would mainly involve a lot of CGI crap. That's just killing the feeling of the picture &aacute; la Live Free or Die Hard (or simply Die Hard 4). Basically, everything of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is anti-Indiana Jones, and that's the worst part of the movie. I am not sure if the DVD is defective or that's the way how the producers wanted the film to be viewed, but I gotta say, my eyes felt like they were being forced to be crossed due to its ultra sharpness of the picture. That really gave me a headache after some period of time, and I had to turn the movie off to take a break. Again, because of the CGI crap, the action and everything that was going on in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull felt completely artificial. Having typed that, I felt a huge yearning to see again any of the three films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. All of the characters in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull sucked to the nth degree, and I never felt like I was having fun like the other three films, which is a major disappointment. The biggest question of the movie is: why? Obviously, like I've said before, money had to be made. It's so disappointing to see quality being compromised to satisfy greed. Much of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is recycled scenes, ideas, concepts, actions, and tidbits from the previous three films, so that's a strong indication that nobody could come up with anything so original. What's with the fake animals? How hard is it to shoot a real animal with an actual handheld camera? As for the plot of the film, what plot? I was like, "Oh okay...whatever," by the time Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull ended. It was like a great big...nothing. What happened to the good, true old fashioned filmmaking that I love? What happened to the good, true old fashioned stunt work that I love? What happened to the good, true old fashioned explosions that I love? Man, The Road Warrior and Mad Max are great examples of once lost art examples of what I am talking about. Who cares if they cost money? At least, be realistic as possible. *sighs* What's the point anymore? All in all, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is 100% pure crap.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>First off, there is a lot of disagreement among the reviewers.  Please, if you're reading these reviews to make up your mine, read some of the other reviews as well to have a balance of opinion.<br /><br />In this movie, there is an immediate plunge into action, followed by an introduction to folklore and an object for Indy to retrieve.  After betrayal, capture, dealing with icky creatures and letting you know he doesn't like snakes, Indy fights a strong man who meets an unpleasant end and is involved in an exciting chase before the final confrontation when the main villain gets what's coming.  Some people think I'm revealing too much of this movie.  Others will realize that I've described not only this picture but the other movies in this series as well.  Indiana Jones is a formula series, and it meets the formula requirements very well.<br /><br />Okay, this is not the most original movie.  There are some scenes that made me think of "Temple of Doom", while others reminded me of "The Last Crusade".  But first, I think it is hard to have a completely original plot oriented action adventure, and second is it made you think of other Indiana Jones movies as opposed to making you think of James Bond for example (though there was an "On The Waterfront" moment).<br /><br />Personally, this was my second favorite of the series, just edging out Temple of Doom, with Raiders being my favorite.  This has everything you expect -- great sarcastic lines from Indy; effective character introductions by Spielberg (nobody does better at making you notice a key character), a lesson against greed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull" is excellent!

I wound up buying two copies of the Double disc edition, one from BEST BUY which has the Crystal skull mounted on a model form in a gift box, and of course I have not opened it... yeah I know, very geeky. But I got the second copy from Amazon and<br />watched it.<br />THE DVD: Pretty well perfect, except that disc one has no commentary. Disc two has some promo for the absurd game "Lego Indiana Jones".

It seems like Hollywood had found another way to find box office gold when it decided to do "reunion" films for Rocky, Rambo, John McLain (Die Hard) and now Indiana Jones! It hasn't been a total loss as I did enjoy Rocky Balboa and the new Die Hard films, Rambo only had one good film to begin with, but Indiana Jones had a good run until this new feature film.<br /><br />The film is certainly watchable, but it's so over the top, it's more of a self parody, than a sequel. It just doesn't have the magic of the first three films. This is one time where "bigger is better" does not apply. I'm glad I found this in a bargain bin, because I'm sure I won't watch it very often. For Die Hard fans the DVD transfer is very good and there is a short making of documentary on the single disc.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>What a mess!  This movie is just totally ridiculous, from start to finish. Bad dialog, lots of pseudo-science, over-the-top acting -- "Crystal Skull" has it all. The CGI special effects are often impressive, but fail to make up for a weak, choppy story line and unbelievable action sequences. As just one small example of how implausible the action gets, the main characters often toss around the titular crystal skull as if it were a football, when a quartz object that size would weigh about 70 pounds! And then there are giant ants, gunpowder that is attracted to magnets, and a whole slew of other improbabilities. And the "happy ending" where Indy and Marion get [*******] is just too corny and contrived.<br /><br />I really wish they hadn't made this movie, as it cheapens the reputation of a great 1980s action trilogy. Just one more example of Hollywood sacrificing art for cash.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>I don't know why people complain about his one but it must be the even numbered Indiana Jones movies that nobody likes (very similar to how fans and others respond to the odd numbered Star Treks). This was a great adventure from start to finish and I couldn't have enjoyed it better. Ford steps back into the role seamlessly. Though a little older, he still handles the action scenes just like he did back in the 80s. The Russians are now the villains of the picture and Cate Blanchett plays Spalko brilliantly, bringing Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb from James Bond to mind (right down to the bob hairstyle). And it was enjoyable to have a female villain (Elsa from The Last Crusade doesn't really count in my opinion as she just didn't scream "evil" to me) and, other than Mola Ram from Temple, the only villain to get into the fights. And she was a step up from Donovan, who also just didn't seem villainous enough. Shia Labeouf I could've done without. I didn't like him in Transformers and I don't like him in this. Action doesn't seem to suit him and I didn't like the fact that Lucas/Spielberg made him Indy's son, which I was hoping throughout the film that he wasn't but I was disappointed. Karen Allen makes a welcome return and I enjoyed the bickering that she and Ford did. The rest of the supporting cast is also well played. The references to Connery, Elliot and other people/artifacts from the previous films were enjoyable (especially the Ark). I didn't mind the aliens at the end as it was set in the 50s and the sci-fi tone fit in well enough (Indy locking himself in the fridge was also something that didn't bother me). I don't why people think that its implausible/impossible for aliens to make an apperance, I mean the character did go up against a guy who could take your heart out and still live so extra-terrestrials aren't that far-fetched. Action sequences are excellent but everything just seems to be CG now and I blame Lucas for that. And finally, this will be the last time (for now anyway) that I have to praise (well I guess I don't have to but he's so good) John Williams, who brings in excellent new material while working in some of the old themes as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST.html">A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST</a><br/><p>The fourth film in this legendary franchise is old-school fun, with great action scenes that oftentimes go over-the-top and almost out of this world.<br /><br />In a nod to the late-1950s era science fiction thrillers, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., is in a desperate race with evil agents from the Soviet Union for a psychic alien crystal skull.

It's great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>I have read most of the reviews on this one good & bad, & most are well defined, so I will try to give an honest viewpoint, first off, I don't hate this one, but I couldn't help but feel that it was trying too hard, below are my Pro & Cons on this one<br /><br />The Pros...(Good stuff)<br /><br />Cate Blanchett was a good villian, a step up from Allison Doody's Elsa in "Last Crusade"<br />The Area 51 sequence in the opening moments were fun, the blink-you-miss-it shot of the Ark was played for laughs no doubt<br /><br />Shia LeBeouf as Mutt & his appearance was accurate to the time (the 50's)<br /><br />Harrison Ford as a aged Indy was no different than a aged Obi-Wan or Captain Kirk<br /><br />The feel of the previous films was there...<br /><br />The action was definately on par with the previous films<br /><br />Now for the Cons...(Bad stuff)<br /><br />The return of Karen Allen was a bad idea, I have nothing against her as an actress, & loved her in the original, but, I just didn't see the point of bringing her back, she really wasn't attuned to her character in the first film, nothing about her in this one reminded me of her in that one...& why not bring back Willie Scott & Short Round too...<br /><br />Indy's sidekick constantly switching sides, if Short Round or Sallah had done this, Indy would have shot Sallah, & left Short Round in the "Temple of Doom", here he just goes with flow in the hope that his sidekick is on his side....<br /><br />The hypnosis scene involving the Crystal Skull.....what was that all about??...did I miss somthing?..<br /><br />The alien angle did seem out of place a bit, but not inconceivable considering that the Mayans were said to be super intelligent, & that many of the world's ancient places such as the Pyramids in Egypt are still a mystery, Lucas & Speilberg apparently are fans of the film "Stargate" with Kurt Russell, because they borrowed this aspect from it...<br /><br />Overall, I liked this one, but I feel that it could have easily ended with "Last Crusade", It is pretty clear that Lucas, Speilberg, & Ford all had different ideas here, & at times I felt that they might have been trying to accomplish different things, whereas in the previous 3 films there was a continuous flow, here, the flow seems to be going in different directions,<br /><br />& why end it with Indy & Marion getting married, you can't reconnect that fast, can you?<br /><br />This one to me is a mixed bag, after repeated viewings, these minor points are starting to bug me, I hate it when films I like do that to me, overall, this one is just as fun, but given Shia LeBeouf's recent comments about him & Ford being a bit displeased with it, you have to wonder if Lucas, Speilberg, Ford, & Shia are even speaking to each other right now...</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>How in the world did they get this wrong?  The casting was good, the poster looks about right - but the story was non-existent.  I knew I had a problem with this movie when I could watch all three Indy movies as a kid and not have to figure out what was going on.  And ironically, as an adult, I got lost in the plotting of this meandering mess.  For those Indy fans who got their kicks - great, but this was lame.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Let me be very fair by stating that this film is beautifully recreated in Blu-Ray with all the special effects and sound seemingly amplified!  It's a beauty!<br /><br />However, the fourth installment of "Indiana Jones" is a disappointment.  The entrance scene with Indiana and his fedora in a silhouette is a nice start, but the film's plot quickly disintegrates into implausibility.  Now, I do understand the Saturday `Flash Gordon' type stories where credibility is stretched for entertainment, but this film stretches and breaks.  Marion is back (Karen Allen) and her entrance is so very welcome, but she soon disappears into a one-dimensional character.  Indiana's new side-kick (Shia LaBeouf) misses his mark and only annoys when constantly slicking back his hair (thanks to George Lucas).  John Hurt is such a great actor, it hurts to see him delegated to barely speaking, but his face tells a lot more than the dialogue around him.  Cate Blanchett is thoroughly believable as the commie villain, but her character is also `dumbed-down'.<br /><br />The action scenes are not as inventive as previous Indiana Jones films (remember the first 15 minutes of "Temple of Doom" from the dance number, "Anything Goes" to jumping out a three-story building to a car chase to jumping out of a plane in a raft to sliding down a snow peaked glacier to dropping off a cliff into a wild raging river and on and on...?)  There is nothing like that here.  There is a floating car with our heroes that goes over numerous gigantic waterfalls and no one gets hurt (only a little wet).  The car chase scene on the cliff never gets too exciting and to see LaBeouf swinging on vines ala Tarzan is just TOO much to have the audience believe.  Do I need to add the scene where Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator that is blown a mile away?  And finally, I apologize, but the "Close Encounters" ending is fairly dramatic, but with all that torrential water gushing, mountains collapsing and the winds hurling around the characters, why don't their clothes or hair move at all?  It is the most egregious CGI overlook since George Lucas ("Return Of The Jedi") had Mark Hamill fly through the redwood forest on the air-scooters and the ferns didn't move at all.<br /><br />Like I said, I tried to be fair.  It is still a great film compared to most that is out there.  But when Lucas and Spielberg set the bar SO high with previous works, they can't top themselves and that hurts - kind of like growing up and realizing your heroes are really ordinary people.  But it's still worth watching (or owning), if only for its historical significance and the beautifully filmed scenery (in Blu-Ray!!!)  Get the first three in Blu-Ray as well (when available).  The difference will make the films seem like new!</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>It is nice to get a new Indiana Jones movie.  Despite his age, Harrison still manages to impress with his physical presence.  The movie itself has some shining moments that really feel like you are back 27 years ago in Raiders.  But sadly a lot of the movie doesn't shine as brightly.  Shia is okay in his role, though he doesn't seem to give much to the overall movie.  He is mostly overshadowed by the other actors in the movie.  Cate is decent as the Russian villain.  Some of the action scenes were very over the top tot he point of being unbelievable.  The story is good, but not a great one.  I thought the last two National Treasure movies had better plots.  The reviews aren't going to stop anyone who grew up watching Raiders from going to see this movie opening weekend, most likely dragging a kid or two with them.  But aside from them, I am not sure if this movie will make a young person a fan of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The film does not need a long commentary because the character is known by all and he is just the same as before, equal to himself. The film is funny because it reinvents the KGB, the Soviet Union, Stalin and the whole cold war just for fun. It is true that was easy in those days to have an enemy. After all he had the Nazis in one film, so why not the good old Soviet communists. But what is rather surprising is how Spielberg merges some influences in this new film. Amazing how his search is based on riddles, like Harry Potter's adventures. Amazing how E.T. finds his way into Peru and the old Incas, even if they seem to speak Maya. But that's just a Detail of course. But I find this not as creative as we could have expected. To attribute human culture, human civilization to the coming of an extra-terrestrial species of intelligent beings that looked like plain terrestrial human beings, to teach the very primitive human beings how to grow potatoes or corn is slightly trendy but banal. To bring together Siberia, the Pharaohs and the Incas, Mayas and why not Aztecs is rather easy and founded on so little. It is true there is also the theory that everything came from Antarctica with extra-terrestrials and all the paraphernalia of that sort, but that had been used by Aliens and Predators. He apparently preferred Stephen King's approach and his Tommy-knockers but without the cruelty, the vampirism of King, just the subservient gullibility of human beings who believe in a legend and that these strange beings were ready to share. Why not, since they officially did it before. That's one of the big contradictions of this film. These extra-terrestrials are not logical: they don't share their knowledge and they even try to destroy those who help them to move to that twilight zone lying (two meanings) between two universes. I must say Anne Rice's rewriting of these myths and legends is a lot more convincing and creative because she remains essentially human and her beyond belief idea is to bring in both witches and vampires. But these are human somewhere, are our everyday neighbors and friends, not the distant extra-terrestrials, and Anne Rice remains within the scope of human feelings, passions, derangements too but human all the same. The most attractive element is of course the third generation of Joneses. The dear Indiana Jones is finally provided with a son and that son is the one who takes him into the adventure. Hence he is the sequel of the old aging Indiana Jones who repeats he is old and aging so many times that I lost count about 20 minutes after the beginning. And it is true there are a couple of slower moments. But after all it is extremely moral and ethical since the younger Jones is provided with a married couple of parents at the end. Charming. Too charming for Indiana Jones. But we will have to do with that small detail. After all Harrison Ford had to step down in style, that is to say in church.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>Contrary to what Mr. Spielberg thinks, there is no real McGuffin--the Crystal Skull really doesn't do it--and that's just one of the many drawbacks of the new Indy film. Furthermore, it's marred by overstuffed action sequences and Indy's lame one-liners which becomes obvious during the first ten minutes. The story stumbles so badly in the first half-hour that you can't help wondering how bad the final result will be.<br /><br />Early in the film, when HARRISON FORD's usually witty one-liners come across as lame and lifeless (as well as few and far between); and later,  when John Williams' music over the end credits is the only thrilling moment you've really had, you know your expectations were never met. This Indy movie tries hard to approximate what went before--and even brings KAREN ALLEN back for a few laughs--but the story is a dismal thing about the desperate search for a Crystal Skull that gives the possessor all the knowledge he'll ever need. Somehow, it fails the McGuffin test that Steven Spielberg thinks he solved. The goal is never well defined.<br /><br />And yet, the world has such a hunger for another Indiana Jones movie that it's cleaning up at the box-office no matter how negative any of the reviews are. I wanted to like it because I miss a good Indiana Jones story as much as anyone--but this isn't it.<br /><br />CATE BLANCHETT remains one-dimensional throughout, although her make-up is good and she looks the part of a Russian adventuress. SHIA LaBEOUF, in his black leather jacket, looks like he stepped out of a James Dean movie but never quite fits into this one. He and Ford have some good byplay but it's all so pat. And then we have JOHN HURT wearing a wild-eyed stare and the year's messiest male hairdo in what might have been an interesting role if we could figure out what he's all about.<br /><br />HARRISON FORD is still afraid of snakes and there's a bonus scene where he has to hang onto one if he wants to get out of quicksand, but other than a few reminders of the Indy of past films, he looks a bit hardened and tired, lacking the zestful playfulness that characterized his earlier way with the part. The script makes concessions to his age, especially from him, to make sure we get the point.<br /><br />Of course, he's not entirely to blame. It's an impossible comic book sort of story that needed a lot of re-working before they decided to go ahead and film it as is. All the story really does is serve as a sort of map on which to plant all the familiar action clich&eacute;s--explosives, rapid machine-gunning, wild chases through the jungle, man-eating ants, waterfalls that fill the screen from one end to another, and comic book villains that survive every punch with little more than a flinch as Indy swings at them from every direction while he remains relatively unscathed even without using his whip. Despite the strongly realistic sound those punches make, nobody suffers a broken jaw--just minor bruises.<br /><br />The chase scene at the end is almost numbing in its wildly overdone mishaps. There's no satisfaction to be had at the end except for the wind-up that has him tying the knot with Marian Ravenwood after all these years. That and the brilliant but familiar John Williams score that sounds wonderful over the end credits without all the explosive action drowning it out.<br /><br />Better luck next time, Mr. Spielberg. And a better McGuffin. You can cry all the way to the box-office gold.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This flick is helped immensely by diminished expectations.  Going into it I felt this was going be a cynical effort seeing that the series promised to conclude twenty years ago with "The Last Crusade".  I was ready to tag the movie "Geritol Jones".  That said, messrs. Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford have revisited the series and have delivered a wholly satisfying entry.  While not as fast paced as "Raiders of the Lost Ark" it has slowed down rhythms probably in deference to Harrison Ford's age.  Though not as quick with the whip as he once was Ford floats by on his familiar charisma.  It was great to see Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood, the only femme fatale worthy of Indy.  Allen doesn't seem to have aged in thirty years.  Cate Blanchett is deliciously villainous as a Russian baddy recalling Beloque from "Raiders".  Great closing shot that suggests the direction the series may or may not go.  Only sin is it doesn't reach the heights of the original but in the spirit of the season I'm giving it the full five star treatment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Damn you, Steven Spielberg! You've ruined my day, hell, my whole damn week! Thanks a lot for f***ing up Indiana Jones, you dumbass! I was left shocked and horrified over this failure, I didn't want to believe this had actually happened. Why God, why? What did Dr. Jones do to deserve this?! This movie has hit the feared sequelitis, and it sucks. Now we'll never get the triumphant return Indy we were hoping for.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Year: 1957. When Dr. Jones is kidnapped and taken to a military base in Nevada by Russian soldiers, he is asked to find a box containing a body he had discovered ten years earlier. When it's found he makes a grand escape from the Russians. After his masterful escape he is investigated by the FBI and loses his teaching job. When he is on a train to leave for Europe, he is stopped by a Greaser kid calling himself Mud, who shows him a letter mailed to him by his kidnapped mother in Peru and a map to some long-lost city. During their search in Peru they discover an artifact called a Crystal Skull and must find the lost city and return it. They don't go without being pursued by the Russians and even meet up with some old friends (The return of Marion. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!). I know I shouldn't spoil the rest of the story, but I'm going to so you'll stay far away from this disaster. It turns out the Crystal Skull was from an alien and has the ability to hypnotize and control people (LAME!) and the crazy Russian chick wants that power. There, I ruined it for you, now don't ever watch it.<br />MUSIC: Oh my God! What the hell happened here?! Even the musical score is bad. How did this get messed up too? The music from the old movies was fantastic, but this film's music sucks...<br />ACTION SCENES: You know Indy for being in over-the-top action scenes, but this film contains perhaps the worst action scenes I've seen in film in years. They are covered in more cheese than a woman covered in water at a wet t-shirt contest. Sword fighting on two cars? Random Peruvian savages who attack people who enter graveyards using martial arts? Big ants that eat people? Indy being able to survive a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator that gets tossed like a mile away? Cheesy hand-to-hand fighting scenes? Dear God, it was like these scenes were scripted by Jean-Claude Van Damme himself. Just when you think Indy is about to rise back to former glory with action scenes and save this movie, he doesn't. Instead the action falls flat on its face and leaves you with your jaw dropped in horror. Good job, guys!! Some action scenes are cool, but those moments are rare and difficult to come by.<br />ACTING: Shia LaBeouf does a good job at playing a teenager as usual, but the rest of the cast just sucks and what makes it worse other than the fact Marion comes back, is the fact that the dialogue sucks (I don't care if Indy has daddy issues, move on dammit!). Marion sucks just as bad as she did in Raiders of the Lost Ark, not to mention she's not even good-looking anymore (At least her sexyness in that movie that made her more bearable). The story doesn't do anything special and it goes nowhere at all. It's rather stupid and there is very little that is enjoyable about it. Not mention it focuses less on action and traveling this time around.<br />OVERALL: Don't buy or rent. If you loved Indy's past excursions it will only bring pain. Go watch the original trilogy instead, or go play Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb (Xbox, Playstation 2), a game that should have been the movie instead. Come on, let's go play that game and watch the old trilogy to savor the memories and forget the pain, it'll make you feel better.<br />THE GOOD: Some action scenes are cool, Shia LaBeouf is fairly good actor in the movie.<br />THE BAD: The rest of the action scenes are incredibly cheesy, all the actors suck (Why the hell was Marion brought back?), crappy music, and an uninteresting story.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>(The review below is what I wrote after seeing the film for the first time.  Since then, I've seen it again and I have to say...it plays better a second time.  I think 20 years of anticipation really stokes up the expectations so high that no film can live up to it.  And this one didn't, at first.  Having already seen it once, I have to say that I could sit back and really enjoy it better the second time.  Weird).<br /><br />I'm sure opinions are going to be all over the place for this movie--it made over $300 million worldwide its first weekend so obviously a lot of people saw it!<br /><br />I saw it with a midnight movie crowd the night before it was supposed to open and most of the crowd were high school kids and two guys dressed as Indy.  There was no applause at the end and everyone shuffled out.<br /><br />Something seemed missing.<br /><br />They certainly threw enough onto the screen.  The opening sequence in Nevada set a good pace as a team of Soviet spies use a kidnapped Indy to storm Area 51 and retrieve an other-worldly artifact from the warehouse we last saw at the end of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The shot of Indiana Jones' silhouette walking up a hill as an atomic mushroom cloud fills the desert sky shows us the world has certainly changed since our hero battled Nazis all over the world.<br /><br />But the fun energy of the first film was missing.  It just wasn't fun after that.  And I don't mean that the filmmakers should've gone for cheap laughs or even ridiculous camp...but that spontaneous thrill from RAIDERS was gone.  It was never in TEMPLE OF DOOM and there were flashes in LAST CRUSADE.<br /><br />Although the whole extraterrestial angle was new and different, there were too many elements too closely tied to the earlier films.  There's no getting away from lost cities in jungles because, well, this is an Indiana Jones movie, but the finale felt like a rehash of RAIDERS.  The Ark of the Covenant was sufficiently explained so everyone could follow that ending.  But this time?  I'm guessing I know what happened and why, but did anyone lose count of how many crystal skulls were in play here?  The Russians nabbed one in Nevada and Indy got one in South America...but there was only one missing from the El Dorado temple, right?<br /><br />I also didn't care for the young guy character, Mutt.  He didn't look like James Dean or Marlon Brando, he looked like Screech from "Saved by the Bell" dressed up like Marlon Brando.  And his instant transformation from 50s punk to vine-swinging Tarzan nearly derailed the whole movie (I suspect that terrible CGI shot of him swinging with the CGI monkeys was only included in the latest round of ads is meant to take the sting of incredulous laughs from otherwise unsuspecting moviegoers).<br /><br />Very cool to see Karen Allen back.  (Now if we can only find out what happened to her character in ANIMAL HOUSE....)<br /><br />I remember reading how Spielberg assured everyone that the action wouldn't rely on computer special effects...but it looked like a LOT of computer special effects were used anyway, a real momentum killer for me anymore.  Most of the thrill of stuntwork was always the stunned belief that SOMEONE REALLY JUST DID THAT!  Until computers can trick us better, it's going to be hard to get us as excited as we used to be in movies.<br /><br />Some of the special effects shots were great though.  Since it's Spielberg and Lucas, you know you're seeing the best that money can buy.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't as bitterly disappointed as a lot of people were but I wasn't as excited and blown away as I was when I saw RAIDERS in the summer of 1981.  We were all a lot younger then.  And I can't blame this new production for trying.<br /><br />I'd rank them this way: TEMPLE OF DOOM was the worst, hands down.  Then this one.  Then LAST CRUSADE.  And still way out ahead, safely sitting way up on top is RAIDERS.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>First let me just say that if you've never seen any of the Indiana Jones movies (what are the chances?...slim to none?) that you should see them before you dive into Crystal Skull. Why? Because if Crystal Skull is your first Indy experience, you'll wonder what all the hype was about. Crystal Skull is a fairly good adventure, but it's mediocre at best when compared to its Indy predecessors.<br /><br />In Crystal Skull Indy's on a mission to return a stolen relic to its rightful resting place (familiar, no?). But unlike the first three Indy movies, Steven Spielberg has gone wayyy over the top with the "yeah right" moments and the CGI special effects...to the point of distraction! It seemed like almost all of the action was noticeably filmed in front of a green screen....Which wouldn't have been too bad if wasn't so darn noticeable.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...Crystal Skull was a fun story and I was thoroughly entertained watching. I just found myself rolling my eyes a bit too much in disbelief. So I'd recommend starting with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE">the first three movies</a> before you jump onto the Blu Ray train to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />It certainly isn't necessary to see the first three movies in the series in order to fully enjoy Crystal Skull. But it will give you some history prior to jumping into a 4th in a series, and it won't be time wasted as they are all excellent films. Here's a little bit on each:<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark was stunning for its time (1981). No surprise with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg at the helm. Raiders holds up as one of the best action movies to date. Indiana Jones searches for and tries to protect a powerful relic from getting into the wrong hands. Viewers get thoroughly entertained with a fast moving, suspenseful and thrilling ride.<br /><br />In Temple of Doom (1984) Indy inadvertently finds himself thrust into village overrun by an evil cult that commit human sacrifice and child slavery. Ironically, while the themes in Temple are much darker than its processor, Spielberg actually 'dumbed it down' a bit (with a good amount of slapstick and other silliness) in order to keep the film attractive to wider audiences and also to attain the first ever PG-13 rating (instead of an R).<br /><br />The Last Crusade (1989) brings in the great Sean Connery as Indy's dad, and together they fulfill a lifelong dream (more the Dad's dream than Indy's) of finding The Holy Grail. Strangely, Last Crusade got hit with a PG-13, but it was much lighter than Temple of Doom, and it went back to a more Lost Ark kind of action film.<br /><br />So my recommendation is get familiar with (or brush up on) the Indiana Jones movies that made Indiana Jones a household name before you venture to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>Imagine in 1935 a couple of maverick filmmakers made a B movie called Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, but, being young & inexperienced, the movie was barely released.  Not too daunted, and, being Jewish, getting angry at the rise of Nazis in Germany, they made Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Having learned from their mistake the first time around, this one got a much wider release, and a year later, they re-released Temple of Doom.  Still angry at the Nazis, in 1939 they kept them as the villains when they made Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.<br />Then, their political passions got the better of them and they went to war.<br />Afterwards, they came back , did some other movies independently, and their Indiana Jones movies seemed all but forgotten.  With the advent of television however, their movies found a new audience.  This inspired the filmmaking team to do an updated modern day adventure.  With rumors of a flying saucer crash in Roswell, the Russians as a new threat to national security and some odd paranormal skulls one of the writers read about, they thought they had the makings of a pretty decent plot.  With the threat of nuclear war & multiple bomb tests taking place, it worked in some more contemporary action sequences.<br />This is the attitude Lucas & Spielberg had when they made this movie.  It is a mock period piece like Tarantino's & Rodriguez's Grindhouse and the earlier Indiana Jones & all of the Star Wars movies.  The biggest difference is that those movies all seem firmly set as movies which could have been made in the 1930's, while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a period piece of the 50's.Fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Arthur Conan Doyle and H. Rider Haggard will recognize this as being a reflection of the same type of literature which they used to produce.  Burroughs tried to have Tarzan pass the torch of adventure to his son, which never quite caught on, Doyle eventually had Sherlock Holmes retire to beekeeping where he would still eventually find himself in an adventure or two.  These authors kept the heroes going a bit past their prime, let them get older.<br />In this era of having franchises get rebooted (Batman, Bond) in order to reflect current sensibilities, Lucas & Spielberg have decided to let their hero, and the world around him age, not to the present, but to where things are becoming increasingly familiar.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Well, the long awaited return of Indiana Jones is finally here. Even with the absence of Sean Connery, it was an entertaining and enjoyable film from start to finish with plenty of Indisims. Karen Allen reprises her role as Miriam from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and that is really all of the real connection with the previous films.<br /><br />  Shai Labouf appears as a kid out looking for Indiana as he receives untimely news of his employment status at the university he teaches. Indiana's latest escapades put him in the crosshairs of the FBI and on a new mission at the same time, to find the item of interest to the Soviet Union.<br /><br />  Although I am a great admirer of Kate Blanchett, I found her character kind of silly, especially when sinking her teeth into that bottom lip for all of those wubble U's. I'm not sold as a Shai Labouff fan. I personally found his character annoying, and he really isn't that great of an actor unless he is displaying "distress".<br /><br />  He plays the panicked teenager well because of his previous roles (just watch Disturbia and Transformers, neither of which are spectacular). I think he needs to go back to acting school and stop delivering his lines like he's be shocked in the A!$^&*%^? by a cattle prod. His unfortunate Disneyification while helpful in getting him roles in Hollywood has unfortunately (again in my opinion) limited his ability and is sort of type cast as the panicked/nervous mental wreck type character.<br /><br />  Anyway, not meaning to get off track (and I don't want to give too much of the film away), Indiana Jones 4 was a great film and deserves to be seen on the big screen. You are really cheating yourself if you don't. It was great to see Harrison Ford again in a role that was made from him.<br /><br />  There's plenty of action (not to mention wise cracks) and you pretty much just have to sit back and let Indiana take you along for the ride. Despite some of the flaws (and there were some) it's a good note to end the Indiana Jones films on. Hopefully Spielberg or Lucas won't get a mid life crisis or hair-brained ideas of developing another T.V series (especially with with Shai Labouff). I honestly can't handle that kid's acting...its painful to watch and experience. Maybe he should go back to the Mickey Mouse Club?<br /><br />  So, on a final note, let the trumpets sound as Indian makes his appearance, with guns blazing and bull whips cracking for another Indiana Jones adventure, fun for all and for sure one to own. Hang on tight! Indiana is back fighting the bad guys and taking names-enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />*spoilers*<br /><br />Looking remarkably hale and fit for a man in his 60's, Harrison Ford returns as everyone's favorite archaeologist/adventurer in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," the fourth installment in the series that started with "Raiders of the Lost Ark" way back in 1981 (before Dr. Jones had sufficient notoriety to get his name placed in the title).<br /><br />It's 1957 and Indy's off on his latest adventure, hacking his way through the jungles of Peru in search of a mysterious crystal skull that may be a relic from a race of extraterrestrials who visited the area several millenia ago.  He is joined in his quest by Shia Labeouf as a cocky, motorcycle-riding teenager who may have more in common with the old codger than either of them can imagine; Karen Allen in a fun return as Jones' old flame from "Raiders" who's been kidnapped by some Russian agents; John Hurt as a fellow archaeologist who may already have fallen under the spell of the mysterious ancient artifact; and Cate Blanchett as an evil Soviet scientist intent on getting her hands on the object as a means of giving her country a strategic advantage in the escalating Cold War.<br /><br />"Crystal Skull" is not a great action flick by any means but, like its predecessors, it has a comfy old-fashioned quality that has us rooting for the good guys and against the bad guys in the best Saturday-afternoon-matinee tradition.  Director Steven Spielberg manages to get the adrenalin pumping with his exciting, if frankly preposterous, action sequences (ably enhanced by John Williams' made-to-order score) and the funny bone twitching with a series of smart-alecky one-liners, many of them aimed at Indiana's obviously advanced age, which the writer, David Koepp, in his wisdom, has chosen not to ignore but rather to make the object of some entirely good-natured joshing.<br /><br />These factors alone compensate for the over length, the occasional bog down in the action, and a finale that feels more appropriate to "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" than to the Indiana Jones franchise.<br /><br />More than anything else, perhaps, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" proves that you don't have to be in your 20's or 30's to be a robust, whip-cracking, action movie hero.  That's encouraging news for all of us regardless of age.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>1957 - jeeps are driving up to a military base.  There's a sign warning of a bomb test shortly.  A Colonel requests entrance on the base and is denied.  His men open fire on the sentries and storm the base.<br /><br />Their goal--the soon to be detonated bomb? Nope, the dusty storage facility.<br /><br />The men, who turn out to be Russians, open the trunk and drag out a hostage.  Guess who?  If you guessed Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) you are correct.<br /><br />That's the opening to this film...<br /><br />It's twenty years after we left Indy.  He's a little bit greyer, but he's still going strong.  This time, he's teamed up with Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a motorcycle riding, leather wearing college dropout who needs his help saving his father Oxley (John Hurt) and Mom, Mary (Karen Allen) from the Russians who are holding them captive.<br /><br />What the Russians want is a Nascan Indian relic, a crystal skull of legend that some say was the manifestation of a god. If they don't get it, Mutt's parents die.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this film:<br /><br />There may be some wear and tear on Ford, but he can still pull off playing Indy.<br /><br />Karen Allen is back reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood. She's always been the best of the female leads in this series and she still can deliver 26 years after "Raiders."<br /><br />Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) a Russian research into psychic phenomenon and the supernatural is the lead villain and she plays her part superbly. My favorite part of this film is the typical car chase with an Indy twist that every action and adventure fan should love.<br /><br />Plus, I think the themes in this story tie together a lot of elements that people who love the Indy series are going to appreciate.  I will definitely be buying the DVD when it becomes available.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, May 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>whine, whine, whine. all you people do is whine.

Critics loved the movie, but ardent fans of the franchise were dissapointed in the script and the finalized film. However, being one of Indiana Jones' biggest fans I loved the movie. Action-packed with a great script, I enjoyed the movie the four times I saw it in theatres and I was extremely satisfied by what I saw. In this version Indiana is teamed up with his first love Marion from the original movie, played by Karen Allen. They also have a son who teams up with them in their battle against a beautiful evil agent, played by Kate Blanchett, who wants the rare crystal skull. The movie would ultimately gross nearly $800,000,000 at the boxoffice becoming the second most popular Indiana Jones movie of all-time. The DVD contains am informative featurette entitled "The Return of the Legend".</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is unfortunately quite a disappointment. Disappointing to the point of embarrassing for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, the duo have taken a character of extreme popularity and a trilogy of great admiration and added an additional chapter of unnecessary absurdity. During an early scene, our capable hero survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, which is catapulted from the blast zone with deadly force. This momentarily excessive lack of realism is forgivable because he's Indiana Jones. But the rest of the film becomes even more ridiculously farfetched and cannot as easily be brushed aside. Indiana Jones is no longer a man of reason, who could be traversing the world right now hunting for lost treasures. He is complete fiction.<br /><br />It is 1957, and Professor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is once again in the midst of peril, this time at the hands of Russian radicals led by Stalin's Austrian psychic scientist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). Forcing him to lead them to magnetized remains of some obscure creature in a government warehouse, Indy manages to escape to the safe-haven of a nuclear blast testing zone. Shortly thereafter, he is returned to the comfort of his classroom, to teach the seemingly boring topic of archeology.<br /><br />Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) catches up with the legendary adventurer to inform him that a colleague, professor Oxley (John Hurt), has been captured by Spalko, and is being pressured to lead the Soviets to the location of El Dorado, the city of gold, where a crystal skull has been stolen. The legend places the city in the Amazon, and claims to grant the retriever of the artifact unimaginable powers. Soon enough, Jones travels across the globe to South America to play a vital role in fulfilling the legend, and making sure to encounter every danger and every adventure imaginable along the way.<br /><br />Kingdom of the Crystal Skull makes countless references and pays nonstop homage to the original Indiana Jones trilogy, and even brings back familiar characters such as Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Indiana can still take a beating (more than any of the previous films), creepy crawling bugs frequently inhabit his locales, tons of comedy relief peppers the nonstop action sequences, and riddles, puzzles and buried treasure abound. Yet for all of its attempts to make this fourth outing a faithful addition to the already resolute Indy saga, too much of it is unfamiliar. Indy is older and noticeably more weathered, but what feels the most inconsistent is his ability to continually achieve more and more outrageous feats. While most of the action scenes are standard high-speed pursuits, his endeavors to brave raging waterfalls, nuclear blasts, and armies of ants, (plus an even more far-fetched conclusion) just doesn't feel like the flesh and blood Indy we grew accustomed to in the original trilogy.<br /><br />Everyone's favorite archaeological adventurer has tackled everything from the Nazis and their steel beasts to booby-trap-filled temples of doom and lost arks of unimaginable power; so what's left for him to do? Unfortunately the creative minds behind Dr. Jones's escapades seem to have run out of ideas and reverted to both the ridiculously unbelievable and to creations extremely alien to Indy's regiment of religious history. The Russians have replaced the Nazis, the outlandish has replaced the reasonable, and the extraterrestrials have replaced Jesus.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I was 1st in the door opening day for the first 3 Indy film.<br />I was unable to do this for this film.<br />The 1st film I waited to see since "Revenge of the Sith".<br />The last days of filming were done in my home town.<br /><br />It is a very good film but is the least favorite of the 4 films to me.<br />Why?

It is 1 of those you have to open 1 end to get the package/DVD's out the other side.  TOO MUCH WORK.  2.  No chapter search list.  3. No bloopers or deleted scenes<br /><br />Good extras on it.  GUESS GEORGE WILL PUT THAT ON THE NEXT RELEASE OF THE FILM TO DVD.

He has a innocent humor which makes the story hum.<br /><br />Marion is back and just as gutsy as ever - and boy what a shocker she unloaded on Jones.<br /><br />The colour, the scenes, the action [without pulling any of it apart] make for a fascinating, entertaining trip into enjoyment.<br /><br />Lucas - Speilburg - Ford make the most entertaining movies worth watching.<br />Hey, what happened to Han Solo and his offspring?  Jones beat him to it.<br /><br />Come on guys give us one more with Jones showing the ropes to Jr. on finding the lost treasures.  Mom can stay home with the twin boys and the baby daughter. [grin]  He must still be horseback riding - howabout setting out west and Indian territory.  Some body must have lost something.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie and will be watching it over again many times. I love good, clean action adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>A few years have passed since we last saw him. He's a bit gray around the muzzle, and the bad guys aren't the WWII foes any more, but the Cold War Soviets. It's not clear that all the Americans are good guys either, with the commie witch-hunt in full swing and government investigations looking ever more like mafia shakedowns and intimidation. (Any commentary on current events is wholly in the mind of the reader.)<br /><br />We got past Indy's "cute" phase. There's a kid again, but this one's a 1950s greaser with a shiv, who'll stand against anything as long as his hair looks cool. As with Sean Connery, he's more a colleague in this adventure than sidekick. And there's the babe too. This time it's Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen - again. Indy's aged since the first movie in this franchise and so has Marion. She's a strong and handsome figure again, in more than one sense. Seeing the two actors genuinely age, as well as skipping forward in story time, adds a charm to the pair that really can't be synthesized. The reunion makes for some nice points in the plot, which I leave you to see for yourself. Oh, and Indy's hat gets a few really good scenes.<br /><br />Summer movies like this tend to be commodity entertainment, but this is a very fine commodity. The heroes stand tall, bad guys (including Cate Blanchett as the baddest of the bad) fit all the stereotypes they need to, chase scenes thrill and amuse, and the effects become increasingly grand as the story reaches its crescendo. There's lots of ineffectual gunplay and some really bad science, but the violence takes on a comic edge just before it would have turned realistically bloody. The plot wears thin enough that I had trouble avoiding spoilers, but hey - that's not why you're watching this movie. You signed up for a roller coaster ride, and you get one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>I have refused to pay to see anymore sequels, threequels, remakes or franchise films!  However, in this particular case, Steven Spielberg (my favorite living director) is a solid exception.  Having viewed the trailer, though, I can't help but wonder if this is going to be another weak, badly-acted story like TEMPLE OF DOOM, which I consider to be one of Spielberg's worst films.  The further thought of Indy having a silly sidekick named "Mutt" only makes me cringe to the memory of 1984's "Short Round", whom I personally wanted to strangle back when I first saw the film.<br /><br />The clock ticks...</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>We are now in the 21st Century! Isn't it about time Hollywood puts racist, 19th Century "savage" stereotypes into the dustbin of history? Why are we still exposed to this kind of crap? It's sickening to pick `on the most vulnerable people in the world. From the Amazon tribes deep inside the rain forest, to the Mbuti (formerly called "Pygmies") who reside in the vast Ituri located in the Congo, to the aboriginal inhabitants of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands - tribal people are quite real, and they have rich cultures with incredible wisdom & survival skills.<br /><br />They also own, collectively, very valuable land and other natural resources! Something huge transnational corporations and various occupying governments covet to this very day! Even more unbelievable,  in this modern day and age, "Survival International estimates  there are around 100 UNCONTACTED tribes in the world,  of which more than half are in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon."  Uncontacted means these tribal people have NEVER been face-to-face with a so-called "civilized" Western Man or Women, like you, or me!<br /><br />In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the tribal people are obviously guarding their own territory (nation). It's obvious to all concerned, a sacred location! - And it's so ironic! I can only imagine how the Civilized American Man would be portrayed if he was attempting to protect New York's Saint Patrick's Cathedral, or the Lincoln Memorial from the intrusion of grave robbers (thieves), like Indiana Jones, or a heavily armed foreign mercenary force out to do no good. He would be portrayed as heroic! But when a tribal person (Red, Yellow, or Black) tries to do the same exact thing, he's an inept, scary buffoon!<br /><br />Unfortunately,  these perverted Hollywood stereotypes are the only contact many people have with tribal people. To help change that perception,  I highly recommend two international, non-profit organizations: Cultural Survival in the United States & Survival International in the United Kingdom (England). It's about time the American public no longer tolerates this disgusting form of racism!<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007J71S">Cultural Survival Quar...</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303402461">Ishi - The Last Yahi</a>,</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2008's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" resurrects our favorite archeologist and adventurer for another final mission.  Harrison Ford reprises his role as Professor Henry "Indiana" Jones.  Karen Allen returns as the Miriam Ravenwood of "Raiders of the Lost Ark."  Shia LeBeouf debuts in the series as an angry young man who seeks out Indiana Jones' help in the case of a missing professor (a shaggy John Hurt in a nicely demented turn).<br /><br />The movie opens in the Nevada desert of 1957.  A group of Russian KGB thugs disguised as U.S. Army soldiers breaks into a warehouse at a secret base.  Their leader, a female KGB Colonel with paranormal abilities (played with icy disdain by Cate Blanchett) is in search of a crate containing a mysterious item.  To help locate the item, she has kidnapped Indiana Jones, who makes a perhaps suitably semi-dramatic entrance.<br /><br />At gunpoint, Indy is forced to help the Russians find the item, a crystal skull, before staging a dramatic escape through what looks like a museum of Cold War artifacts.  Indy will improbably survive an atomic test during his getaway.<br /><br />After a brief narrative bow at Cold War paranoia and the missing characters from the last Indiana Jones movie, Indy links up with Shia Lebeouf's Mutt, an angry young greaser on a motorcycle who needs Indy's help to find his kidnapped mother and a Professor Oxley, an old friend of Professor Jones.  Professor Oxley had apparently discovered a long-lost, semi-legendary City of Gold in the Amazon jungles, a city holding a secet the Russians want for themselves.  Mutt carries a letter from Oxley, written in code in a dead language that only Indiana can make sense of.  The two are off to Peru in an improbable partnership, just steps ahead of the Russian KGB.<br /><br />The ensuing treasure hunt pays homage to all the plot devices of previous Indian Jones movies, with creepy tombs, nasty bad guys, archeological puzzles, and several breathless chase scenes.  Along the way, Indiana will be reunited with an old flame and one old friend and survive betrayal by another. The climax of the movie is as thrilling as an overload of CGI can make it.<br /><br />The good news for fans of Indiana Jones is that Harrison Ford is entirely credible as the older and creakier but still sarcastic and savy adventurer.  Bringing back Miriam Ravenwood provides an intriguing love angle, although Karen Allen isn't given a lot to do.  Shia Lebeouf picks up a lot of the action chores for Indy, and there is just the slightest suggestion at movie's end that he might pick up the franchise.  The bad news may be that the franchise is now competing with younger and fresher versions of itself such as "National Treasure."  Less attention is given to character and story development and rather more to over-the-top special effects.  Fans of Indiana Jones will appreciate the movie and the ending; newcomers may wonder what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is highly recommended as good entertainment for fans of the Indiana Jones franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>An older Indy (Harrison Ford) and his companions (Shia Lebeouf, Karen Allen, and John Hurt) are on the trail of a hidden city, where they plan to return a crystal skull to its rightful resting place.  In keeping with the Cold War milieu of the 50s setting, they are pursued by a beautiful Russian military scientist who specializes in psychic research (Cate Blanchett).  This iconic 50s window dressing, along with UFOs, A-bomb tests, McCarthyism, and greasers, adds to the fun of this entertaining movie.<br /><br />A lot of people hate this film, as evidenced by the surprisingly low average rating of 3.5.  I'll admit that I was disappointed, too, but it's probably next to impossible to meet expectations that have been building for nearly twenty years.  Some of the action goes way over the top and the sci-fi elements don't mesh well with the Indy universe, but I'd say that this film still comes out ahead of "Temple of Doom."  I liked the way they handled Indy's age, and it was fun to see Marion Ravenwood return.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>They might have gotten a little lazy with this sequel but this film was alright. The opening scene is incredible, as we return to the warehouse last seen at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Here we see Indiana Jones for the first time since Last Crusade: Older, Wiser, and more mature. But the man can still use his whip. The thing with Crystal Skull that I really loved was that this is a different Indy. If you go in to this movie expecting to see some crazy stunts like in the previous films then you won't be satisfied. Indiana has settled down. He is in his 60's. We know what he is capable of. We know how tough he is. They didn't have to show him be the tough as nails archaeologist that we came to love because we are so familiar with him. What Spielberg did this time around was have an Indy that is more in the role of Henry Jones Sr from Last Crusade.<br /><br />In a way, we have watched Indiana grow up over the course of the four films. We've seen him as the young hero and now we see him as the older hero. Spielberg said that he was making this movie for the fans. He didn't come out to make this better than Raiders. He came out to bring us Indy one last time. To show that just like all of us, Indy has grown up with the times, but he still has it in him for one last adventure.<br /><br />Shia Labeouf was great as Mutt. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing a spin off with just him (maybe). Marion is always great and the chemistry between her and Indy is perfect. Cate Blanchett did a great job as Irina Spalko, she was beautiful, and a great choice for the part. But the true star of the movie is again Shia LeBouf. He so far does well in every movie he is in, but in this movie he does even better. He is funny, entertaining, and is believable as the slightly soft kid pretending to be tough. The whole alien plot was a bit much, but had a great moral at the end, the true treasure was knowledge. Though this is base on 1950's everyone was talking about aliens, and little green men, and the race to space around this era. It was nice to see Indy go after something different this time around.<br /><br />For all the complaining about the CG and the impossible sequences, again, this was Spielberg and the crew having fun probably without much effort. They weren't trying to win an Oscar. They just wanted to bring back Indiana Jones. Throughout the whole film, Harrison Ford seemed like he was having a blast and so was I. All in all, even though it didn't feel like the original three, it was a "O-kay" addition. As long as you come in just wanting to have a fun time at the movies, then you will love this movie. Beside that the action sequences is decent and the story is very original. This will probably take you one watch for you to like it or not. Cheers Jones.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>First, I must tell you that as a child I loved the Indy series. They had action, adventure, light romance, and simply tickled the imagination. I also realize that in these times of "special effects", a simple story of action and adventure may not appeal to the masses. Here in lies my dilemma, I liked the series as a child (not to mention several others like Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Knight Rider, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Murder She Wrote, Remington Steele, Moonlighting, The Goonies, The Gremins, Star Wars, and other 80S, 90s TV shows and movies...I could go on and on and on, but you get my drift) and therefore knew, when compared to what sells today, this would be a hard sale. A continuation of a much loved story, with an older star and special effects to an old theme. Compared to Matrix and the recent Star Wars movies, this seemed to be not as exciting, but for those who love the traditional action adventure movies, they will be able to watch it and have no other expectations but to be entertained. While I do not think this is the best Indy ever, I wasn't as disappointed as other reviewers seem to be.<br /><br />Now the review, which will be short and sweet. Indiana Jones (Professor by day, Adventurer by night) is still an adventurer who is able to use a whip better than those half his age. Captured by those "dastardly Nazi's" who are searching for the remains of an alien, who crashed in New Mexico, Indy must find the crystal skull which will lead to the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull and the City of Gold. Of course during his search, he encounters more Nazi's (including Kate Blanchett who sports a mean bob), double agents, old friends, old loves, a possible son, is the victim of nuclear testing, aliens and so much more. So, with all that said, I give this latest Indy adventure a "3". I wouldn't purchase it, but as a rental on a Sunday, with nothing else to do, I would give it a whirl.</p></br></body></html>

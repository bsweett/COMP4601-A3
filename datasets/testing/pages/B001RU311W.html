His performance in "Milk" was incredible.  He's one of those few actors who totally immerses himself in the parts he plays, much like Daniel Day-Lewis or Robert De Niro.  He's been doing this for quite some time now.  Even his fellow actors from "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" said that he was in character of Jeff Spiccoli during the entire shoot.<br /><br />I was just a kid during the time and events that this film covers, so I enjoyed learning about Harvey Milk and the influence he had in San Francisco poltics, California politics, and even the influences he had nationally as well.<br /><br />"Milk" tells the story of Harvey Milk, a gay man from New York who decides that it's time for a change.  He's just met his new love interst, Scott, whom he tells to "keep a lid" on their relationship.  They both move to San Francisco, and Milk quickly deduces that in order to effect the changes he wants to see, he can stay in the closet no longer.<br /><br />He runs for City Supervisor several times, only to lose each and every time.  However, he finds that he's quickly gaining support of the local gay community, and that the number of votes he's receiving during each election is on the rise.<br /><br />Finally, he wins the position of City Supervisor, and Milk finds himself in the middle of every cause he can think of...not just the rights of gays, but any discrimination that exists whether it be due to color, age, or race.<br /><br />Granted, each battle seems to be an uphill one, but Milk is filled with a resolve, and he won't quit, even when his partner, Scott, has had enough and leaves him.<br /><br />The pinnacle part of the film is Milk battling against Proposition 6, which repeals many rights for gay people.  He challenges his rival, Senator Briggs who feels that gay people shouldn't have any rights at all, and is even on a crusade to expose each and every one of them.  Milk holds several memorable and poignant debates with the senator throughout the state of California.<br /><br />I've always found it interesting that when there is a cause to fight for, a champion comes along to spear-head it.  Milk is that champion for gay people, even though he's actually fighting against all forms of discrimination.<br /><br />The movie is narrated by Milk who is recording his life story on tape, already seeming to sense that he won't be around much longer.  Ironically, Milk tells Scott that he doesn't feel that he'll live to be 50.<br /><br />There are great performances all around in this film, not only by Sean Penn, but also by James Franco (Scott), Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and Josh Brolin.  Brolin plays Dan White, a fellow City Supervisor and the instrument of Milk's death.  What I didn't forsee, was that Milk's assassination was politically motivated as White had lost his job and felt that Milk and the Mayor were responsible, rather than it being a hate crime against Milk's sexual orientation.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about the movie was that it focused on Milk's cause.  People who might be uncomfortable about the possibility of sexual scenes needn't worry.  The movie isn't "in your face" and nothing is depicted really, beyond some kissing. (Course, if that bothers you than you may want to take a pass on this film.)<br /><br />Gus Van Sant is a terrific director; one who brought us great films like "Good Will Hunting," and "Milk" is another testament to his abilities as a director.<br /><br />There are some movies that are simply important to watch, because they give us a sense of where we came from, where we are going, and how important it is to be tolerant and accepting of people, regardless of their differences.  "Milk" is such a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Don't fall in the easy trap of the parallel with the recent proposition against same-sex marriage. Little to do. On one side a politician who knew what he was doing, on the other side amateurs who thought the battle could be won without real canvassing. Don't fall into another trap: the parallel with Obama's campaign on hope. Those two dimensions exist but they cannot be considered as the essential meaning of this film and certainly not the most important element about the story and the character, the real man behind this character. What is the main theme of this film? Though it speaks mostly of homosexuality, it is not about homosexuality, or at least not only. It concerns us all: it is about the freedom of each individual in our world to believe in, think as true and practice the life styles they want, the religions they want, the cultural, political, social, philosophical and all other imaginable orientations they want. This is written on The statue of Liberty and at the very beginning of the Declaration of Independence, and, though the film does not say, in the first amendment to the constitution. This is universal and this concerns some countries like France for example where some beliefs are supposed not to be expressed publicly in institutions like schools or public administrations by students or personnel. That universal freedom is one of the most denied freedoms in the world. Even today in advanced developed countries various orientations, and always in the name of privacy or private life which makes it an obligation for minorities to hide or be victimized, be they sexual or religious, or whatever. We can trust the human species to be segregative always and on unforeseen and unforeseeable subjects. The human species is fundamentally segregative and equality is a constant and never irreversible battle. The second important element has to do with political activism. A political campaign can only be victorious if it does not concern a narrow group and its privileges. It has to concern a fundamental right that may then concern the vast majority of the people: if that right is denied to one person in the whole social order, then that right is endangered for everyone. The only way to convince the vast majority of the population that this is so is to come out and show everyone that they have lived with some of these people all their life, as neighbors, colleagues, schoolmates or whatever. A right can only be won if the people concerned get out of the closet, cupboard or cabinet in which they lock themselves and start canvassing, provided this right they're going to canvass for is a right that everyone can claim or enjoy, not the privilege of the happy few, like retiring at 50 with a full pension. Canvassing requires courage and dedication, because it has to convince people and not force them into doing this or not doing that. The last element is that in the American society there is a very much privileged minority, the police. The situation is a lot better today with guaranteed diversity, when it is guaranteed, but still the spirit of being over the law because of the uniform or the gun is still very present in their minds. The latest of such events in France was the release by a cop of a piece of evidence against some accused people before these people had had the opportunity to defend themselves in court. In this film, the ex-cop kills the Mayor of San Francisco and a City Supervisor out of cold blood, after having broken into the city hall, and he only got five years of prison for manslaughter and not murder. That was practically an accident if we follow that line pr approach. But the film is very clear about the use of violence in politics: it creates a political backlash and even at times a social backdraft and not progress.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Howard Milk is certainly a very admirable character, but I didn't find him to be very likeable. He seemed selfish and somewhat grandstanding. But then, maybe that's the point of the film, to show him as he truly was - an individual who was a hero to the community, while being a normal, fallible human being at the same time. And on that level, this is an amazing success. Sean Penn completely disappears into and shines in the lead role, and James Franco should also be noted for his strong supporting role. In fact, the only disappointment isn't with the movie itself - it's with the realization that 30 years later, gays are still fighting to assert and keep their civil rights.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>In a previous review I coined Eagle Eye as one of the best of '08, well Milk isn't just one of the best, it is the #1 film of 2008. Sean Penn does it again and easily delivers one of his best performances bringing to life a character and a man we no longer have, and may never see again. This is a cast filled with genuine legends like Penn & Brolin, and up and coming megastars such as Emile Hirsch and James Franco. Each and every cast member seems to give it their all in keeping loyal to their played roles character in order to play an honest homage to this legendary figure. Gus Van Sant, is a relatively unknown Director and I'm hoping that this picture is one that makes him a household name.<br /><br />Personally, I'd never heard of Harvey Milk nor would have had any idea just who the man is, where he was from or what he stood for. When I heard about the film I thought nothing of it until I saw the trailer and then I was drawn in. Political activism is something I'm a strong believer in, I'm one for liberalism and the basic rights of man being upheld. I've always found it quite hypocritical that America, a country which swears allegiance to its constitution on a daily basis has such a history of prejudice and bigotry. You would think, looking at their constitution that politicians would fight to uphold its core values of "all men be created equal" rather than fight to rob certain minorities of their rights, but looking at Harvey Milks struggle and other struggles like it, I'm genuinely shocked.<br /><br />I would put Harvey Milk in the same league as such men like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. They too were men who saw the persecution of their people and sought to put an end to it and fight for the core constitutional values to be upheld. Close to the end of Harveys life, America was going through a vote on Proposition 6. This was a vote which saw all homosexuals be removed from their jobs and focused its main attention on teachers. The reasoning behind this is that homosexuals recruit children to homosexuality and under "gods law" are simply "immoral". I've always been shocked by these claims by politicians and their justifications behind them are laughable, claims like this are even being made today but I'm glad to know that such prejudices aren't held in such wide regard as they once were. All history needs now is another champion for homosexuals that would have a bigger impact on the world stage.<br /><br />The film tells of the history making chapter in the story that is of American Gay Civil Rights. Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man elected to a public office in the entire United States history and possibly the first in the world. The film is set during Harveys mid 40s when he first moves to San Francisco with his partner Scott Smith (James Franco). The heterosexual community don't agree with Harvey and Scott setting up business in the neighbourhood and try to make it difficult for them. Because of this Harvey decides to become an activists and increases the gay presence within the neighbourhood which force those companies who tried to make it hard for him out of business.<br /><br />Over time, Harvey starts to realise that in order to truly stop the persecution by police and other bigotted residents Harvey must run for Supervisor of District 5. He knows it will be a difficult fight but he knows that it's the only way to truly make a difference for the gay community. The first 4 years he runs for the office, he's met with disappointing defeat yet every year he's defeated by a less and less margin until in the 5th year he manages to pull off the win and makes history. During his time in office, he finds a conflict with fellow supervisor but of district 8, Dan White. Harvey first wants Whites support in order to win votes, but due to a few conflicts Dan ends up being Harveys biggest opponent.<br /><br />I think telling you more about the story would give the whole thing away, so I'll leave it there. What I want to say about this film simply can't be expressed in words. The only way I can put across my love and appreciation of this picture is to simply recommend it to the masses. It's incredible, one of the best things you'll see this year if not ever and even if this doesn't get massive worldwide advertising campaign, it's a film that will go down as a favourite amongst many. This film has also won my love thanks to the excellent acting by Emile Hirsch, I've always been a fan and is one of the reasons I chose to watch this.<br /><br />Go see it, buy it or just get on a plane and watch it on your trip, but the message is loud and clear, SEE THIS MOVIE.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>In 2009, the film "MILK" based on the powerful and inspirational story of San Francisco's Harvey Milk, a man who fought for human rights won the hearts of critics who raved that the film is one of the year's best.<br /><br />The film went on to receive eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay. The result was Sean Penn winning "Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role" and Dustin Lance Black ("Big Love", "The Journey of Jared Price" and "Something Close to Heaven") winning "Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen".<br /><br />The film was directed by Gus Van Sant ("Good will Hunting", "Psycho" and "Finding Forrester"), music composed by award winning composer Danny Elfman ("Terminator Salvation", "Batman", "Spider-Man", etc.) and cinematography by Harris Savides ("Zodiac", "Finding Forrester" and "American Gangster").<br /><br />The film would be known for its talented cast which include Judd Hirsch ("Taking Woodstock", "Speed Racer", "Lords of Dogtown"), Josh Brolin ("W.", "American Gangster" and "No Country for Old Men"), James Franco ("Spiderman" films, "Pineapple Express" and "Nights in Rodanthe"), Victor Garber ("Eli Stone" and "Alias"), Dennis O'Hare ("Brothers & Sisters", "The Proposal" and "Quarantine"), Lucas Grabeel ("High School Musical" films), Joseph Cross ("Smallville", "Untraceable" and "Flags of Our Fathers") and many more.<br /><br />The film is about Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the first openly gay man to be elected to public office. The film details the life of Harvey Milk living in New York and moving to San Francisco in 1972 with his boyfriend Scott Smith (James Franco) in the Castro District. During that time, there was political unrest as homosexuals were being beaten and killed and one man decided to make a difference and inspire thousands to also stand up for themselves.<br /><br />"MILK" gives us a glimpse of the life Harvey Milk had. From running for political office (unsuccessfully) three times but eventually, won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977 and make changes not only for the city of San Francisco but his aim was fight for gay rights, civil rights in the state and inspired many in other states.<br /><br />We get to see the personal side of Harvey Milk as he was passionate about his role in politics but at the same time, knowing it would cost him his own personal relationships. By running for office, we get to see those close to Harvey such as Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) who was a young man that Harvey saw potential for fighting for gay rights, especially California's anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 his campaign manager Anne Kronenberg (Allison Pill) who was very good at what she does and worked for Harvey Milk with no pay, Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber) who was open to working with Harvey and knew the importance of the gay vote for his upcoming re-election, Dick Pabich (Joseph Cross) and Michael Wong (Kelvin Yu) who worked with Harvey during his campaign and campaign photographer Danny Nicoletta (Lucas Gravbel) and many more.<br /><br />But the film also shows us the tragedy that took place on November 22, 1978 but how his legacy has helped breakdown some of the gates for many gay men and women. The film celebrates the life of Harvey Milk and reminds everyone of the many people who fought for their rights during that turbulent time.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"MILK" is featured in 1080p High-Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and for the most part, it's a pretty good looking film that tends to be creative with its use of older San Francisco video footage of Castro Street back in the 70's and meld it with today's modern film.  For the most part, there are times where the film looks colorful but at the same time, there is an intentional washed out feel towards the picture quality of the film.  From the production and set design to recreate that Castro Street 70's feel, there was a good amount of creative experimentation with the film.  But overall, cinematographer Harris Savides and editor Elliot Graham did a pretty solid job of piecing together the various video pieces and photography to the film.<br /><br />The film is not washed out in the DNR (digital noise reduction) type of way but more towards achieving a classic, vintage look that works perfectly for the film.  Noise is evident and giving the film that film-like quality via Blu-ray.<br /><br />The audio is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and although the film is dialogue driven and utilizes the front/center channel, there are occasional scenes that take advantage of the surround channels especially during crowd scenes.  I noticed also a bit of LFE not just in musical segments but in one scene, you can hear the thunder boom just a little.  So, there is a hint of other channels being utilized throughout the film.  But for the most part, it is a dialogue driven film.  And dialogue is clear and understandable.<br /><br />Subtitles are provided in English SDH, Spanish and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"MILK" comes with the following special features in 1080i High-Definition with English Dolby Digital 2.0 audio:<br /><br />  * Remembering Harry - (13:21) Those who worked with Harry such as former San Francisco Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, campaign writer Frank Robinson, campaign photographer Daniel Nicoletta, campaign director Anne Kronenberg, Coors boycott organizer Allain Baird and historical consultant Cleve Jones talk about working with Harry and remembering the day Harry was killed and the march that was done afterward.<br />  * Hollywood Comes to San Francisco- (14:32) Interviews with the cast and crew about being part of the film, working together and also some of the talent getting to meet their real life counterparts.  Also discussion of the casting of Sean Penn, how the director was found and filming the march scenes. And much, much more.<br />  * Marching for Equality (7:58) - Recreating the street march scenes (marches done after what took place in Dade County and in Wichita, Kansas).  Getting thousands of  volunteers to take part in the march and those who were around back then reminiscing about Harry and how the march and the set production reminded them of Castro Street back in the 70's and more.<br /><br />JUDGMENT cALL:<br /><br />"MILK" is definitely a magnificent and powerful film! Sean Penn did a remarkable job playing that role and almost getting down the look and characteristics of Harvey Milk. But you also have to give credit to the cast and crew for capturing that moment in time. From the look and feel of 1970's San Francisco but also the costume design, the hair styles and it was great to see the original friends of Harvey Milk also have some involvement in the film.<br /><br />The overall style of the film is also quite fresh and for those of us who know of San Francisco now, getting a chance to see older footage of Castro Street back then was quite intriguing. But the most intriguing aspect of this film was to learn about Harvey Milk and what he stood for and the rights that he and others have fought hard for. And for those who have forgotten or have never heard of Harvey Milk, to know of the man and what he did for gay rights but also his belief in fighting for civil rights.<br /><br />As for the depiction of Dan White and also the whole political process, I know there is probably more to the story than what we saw in the film. The film did prompt be to further research what had took place at that time, especially with the Coors boycott, who is Anita Baker, the marches and the what took place at that time and of course, the death of Harvey Milk.<br /><br />But the screenplay written by Dustin Lance Black is solid, the recreation of this era was ambitious and the direction by Gus Van Sant and the performances by the various talent was quite solid.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, I have been very pleased with Universal's Blu-ray releases thus far.  Picture quality are solid and for the most part, the lossless track for "MILK" is clear and understandable.  I wish there were more special features, possibly even commentary included but for the most part, all three special features were quite intriguing and enjoyable.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed "MILK", you really can't go wrong with the Blu-ray release.  It may not have the large amount of special features as previous Universal BD releases but for the most part, "MILK" does look and sound great in High Definition.  Definitely recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>A very straightforward, by-the-books biopic of Harvey Milk, San Francisco city supervisor and gay rights martyr. Political biographies are tough in that they always seem to have a clear agenda, and even though I happen to agree wholeheartedly with the message behind this one, it's still a very one-sided telling. The two factions at the center of the film's central argument are presented as sharply black and white, with few figures outside of Harvey's inner circle given credit for the reforms that were passed during his brief public career, and that seems to stand at odds with the core values of unity and equality that the film keeps talking up. Sean Penn deserves credit for his bold portrayal of the titular activist and politician; Milk's character arc is clear and powerful as we watch him grow from a shy, closeted New York businessman into a well-spoken social rights figurehead. That evolution is joyful but slow moving, and it often gets lost amongst the hustle and bustle of his increasingly active social and sex lives. It's an important story that's every bit as relevant today as it was in 1978, but the film translation lacks the punchiness and fresh identity I was looking for. Good, perhaps even very good, but no better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This film is just exceptional, accomplishing the difficult task of teaching social history without preaching, of exploring character and courage from a perspective of lived reality, and communicating to gay audiences the historic struggles of the gay rights movement while communicating to straight audiences the motivations that moved the gay rights movement forward.  The cast is superb, with Sean Penn offering a perfect performance of power and grace, humor and courage. James Franco does a wonderful understated calm performance as Scott Smith, the lover who follows Harvey to San Francisco and emotionally supports him during his rocky rise in the local political scene. Gus Van Sant may have been the perfect director for this script since he is sensitive to the subtle dynamics and evolution of the gay rights movement while also making a credible effort to explore the character of Harvey Milk and his lovers. The film reminds us of the terrible violence and discrimination those in the gay community experienced from the police, media, and courts.  This reference back to these days of harassment and attacks is important in grounding the work and philosophy of Harvey Milk. Placing this story within the history of the Castro neighborhood in San Francisco helps give the narrative a time and place as well as makes reference to a major social movement. The historic films, including the films of Anita Bryant's bigoted campaign against gay men and women, give all viewers a feel for the hatred, bigotry, violence, discrimination, and lack of civil rights that gay men and women experienced. The film is very educational in that it firmly places gay rights as in the same group with civil rights for African Americans and women. Yet Harvey Milk is a critical piece of this history, not just as an activist but also as the first open gay person elected to public office in the United States. Harvey Milk is fully characterized as a multi-dimensional, resilient, courageous, transcendent human being. His resiliency, as portrayed by Sean Penn, is inspiring. Milk had a broad and objective view of the condition of gay men and women in the United States and the political skills to move forward in the fight against discrimination. He loses a handsome young lover in his political fights and then adopts a damaged soul as his second lover. It is the loving, protective way that Harvey loves and supports his emotionally and mentally fragile lover that echoes his love and protection for all of those in the gay movement.  In other words, Harvey was willing to take a partner who was damaged goods, and in so doing, personifies his philosophy that the gay community is full of persons who are damaged and deserve protection. Harvey loses three consecutive elections but finally with his vision and resiliency, he prevails and is elected to the San Francisco board of supervisors.  The rise and tragic fall of Harvey Milk makes for wonderfully moving drama, even more penetrating, because it reflects a significant time in our history.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I first heard the name Harvey Milk about a few years ago when a new high school for gay teens was being opened in Manhattan and stirred a lot of controversy.  That school was named after Harvey Milk.  The news said that he was an openly gay politician from San Franscisco.<br /><br />I was a little remiss at the time because when I hear somebody mentioned who I know nothing about, I usually research them at a minimum on Wikipedia.  I failed and the name Harvey Milk was filed deep in my brain until this movie starring Sean Penn won critical acclaim and an award for best actor in 2008.  I still failed to do any research.<br /><br />The other night I finally saw this film and it was a fascinating tale.  It shed a lot of light on things that I vaguely heard about but never really thought about.  I remember Anita Bryant from all the orange juice commercials she did but nothing about her crusade against the gay community.  When we look back today, she definately looked ridiculous.  Her time could have been better spent on doing something more productive with her time.<br /><br />The movie explains how the gay movement began in San Francisco, where Harvey Milk opened a shop that catered to a mostly gay clientele.  Pretty soon other gay run shops started opening on his street (Castro) and pretty soon many gays started moving to the area.  Many of them had very sad stories of being abandoned by their families because of their preferences.<br /><br />Eventually Harvey is encouraged to go into politics and crusade for rights to protect people against discrimination based on their sexual orientation.  It is a fascinating study and we also see a lot of the dirty end of politics where favors are bought and traded.  Josh Brolin is excellent and one of Harvey's political peers who keeps requesting favors from Harvey but does nothing to help Harvey's cause.<br /><br />James Franco looking much different from his Harry Osbourne/James Dean look, plays Harvey's friend and lover (Scott).  Scott puts a lot of pressure on Harvey to give up political ambitions and causes Harvey to have to make several tough decisions.<br /><br />One can easily see why Sean Penn was an easy choice for his Oscar in this role. A first rate movie that should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Sean Penn won an Oscar for his outstanding performance in this 2008 film.  No wonder.  He is simply magnificent.  And, in my opinion, the film is a winner in every category.  Not only does it tell the true story of the man himself, Harvey Milk, who, in 1977 was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and was the first openly gay elected official in America, it is the story of a movement and a time and a place in history that defined a watershed of change.<br /><br />Bravo to the filmmakers!  The casting is perfect with James Franco playing the long-time boyfriend of Harvey Milk and Josh Brolin cast in the role of a troubled fellow city supervisor, who in an insane frenzy, brutally murdered both Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco, George Moscone in 1978.<br /><br />We first meet Milk, a 40-year old New York businessman, who changes his life dramatically by embracing the counter-culture movement and moving to San Francisco in the early 1970s with his young lover.  They live in the Castro district, which is fast becoming a Mecca for gays, opening a camera store and fighting the establishment.  Soon, Milk becomes political, running for public office.  He loses, not once but twice, but, finally, when he changes his hippie appearance and starts to wear suits, he eventually is elected.  He fights vigorously for gay rights, influencing gays to unite and "come out of the closet" and mostly, because of his activism and his strong  personality, a proposition to keep gays from teaching in public schools, promoted by the gay-bashing activist, Anita Bryant, was defeated.<br /><br />Sadly, Harvey Milk served a mere 11 months in office before he was assassinated.  But the changes he brought about are living on as the concept of inclusion is a reality in our culture today.  The cinematography and direction are exceptional and there is not a dull moment in the film.  I loved every minute of it. Hooray for Harvey Milk!  And Hooray those who brought his inspiring story to the screen!<br /><br />This film gets my highest recommendation.  Don't miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>This is an extremely good film (on a four-star scale, I'd give it 3.5), but not the masterpiece it's been called.<br /><br />As with virtually every biopic ever made, the writer is obliged to create artificial-sounding dialog that sums up what's been going on prior to the current scene, or clumsily reveals a character's thoughts. "Milk" is better than most, but it still has its share.<br /><br />One of the script's good points is its refusal to demonize Dan White, who's portrayed as a thoroughly confused and unbalanced human being. (It's not surprising he eventually committed suicide.) Though obviously a queer-hater, one gets the feeling that White's murder of Milk and Moscone was primarily more to his being politically thwarted and "humiliated". Even had the conflict not been over gay rights, he probably would killed whomever he thought had harmed him. (Moscone wasn't gay.) He did not understand the nature of politics.<br /><br />Harvey Milk seems to have understood, though. He's willing to say what White wants to hear, then reverse himself, which did not endear him to White.<br /><br />My only gripe is the obvious fiction of presenting what was going through Harvey Milk's mind when he was killed. It's more silly than anything (he apparently associates his murder with Tosca's death), and it hurts the tone of a film that gives at least the illusion of accuracy. It also comes dangerously close to portraying Milk as a martyr.<br /><br />Fine performances all around, especially Penn's and Brolin's. I don't know why people dump on Sean Penn. In this film, he quite disappears into the role. What more do you want from an actor?<br /><br />For those straight viewers uncomfortable not only with men kissing each other, but with male effeminacy... There are all kinds of homosexual men, ranging from transvesites and swishes to men of ordinary (sometimes hyper) masculinity who are not easily recognized. Thirty years ago, the latter tended to remain invisible and not take part in politics. Which is why you don't see many of them in this film.<br /><br />Highly recommended -- especially to those people who ought to see it, but will refuse to.<br /><br />Beautiful Blu-ray transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I enjoyed 'Milk' because the performances by Penn and company, but the film as a whole just didn't reach greatness for me. The story is very sad and even though I was around in those times I was too young and preoccupied with my youth to understand what it was like then.<br /><br />The film gets a big boost from Penn, Franco and Brolin, but some characters portrayed seem cartoonish. The film starts out strong, sags in the middle and gives us the sad ending. It's a film worth watching, but I doubt I'll give it a second look. It is certainly a story worth telling.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Harvey Milk is a man not afraid to challenge social norms and bigotry of his time.  As he opens camera store in San Francisco with his partner Scott, they soon realize that in order to be successful in their new business, they will have to merge their alliances with other businesses who supported gays from the neighbrouhood.  What starts as a business plan turns into an artform of social activism.  Harvey and his social network become powerful national presence in fight for gay rights.<br /><br />It is needless to say that Sean Penn fully deserves his Oscar win for the Best actor role in a film.  His supporting cast is great.  Story itself, true to its core is a testament that determination of one man can become an inspiration to many generations that follow.  His tragic end is a constant reminder that for every noble cause there is a fanatical disgruntled maniac incapable of reconciling their personal beliefs with the ever changing world and social norms.<br /><br />Delightful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>This rating would be a 4.5 if it was available.

Aside from pacing issues, every aspect of this film was spot-on:  direction, acting, writing...  It was interesting to see San Francisco presented in a light progressed beyond the idealistic haze of the 60s, yet not having quite reached its hippie goals.  The cultural transition presented in the wider picture of this film is as extraordinary as the depiction of Milk's life.  While Penn is a great actor, I did find that some of the mannerisms he fused into Milk were ones I've seen him do with other characters.  This distracted my spell several times, but his ability to express the gentle kindness of Milk at any given point made up for the unoriginality of physicality.  The film is, of course, terribly sad, for far more reasons than the obvious untimely demise of Milk.  The personal drama that he gave himself over to in creating this revolution is well documented.  A stern reminder that this was not so long ago, it is a must-see film.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Watching "Milk," with its historical footage mixed with acted scenes, made me realize just how far we've come since the 1970s and 1980s regarding gay rights and tolerance.  Director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black provide this context through their telling of the life of Harvey Milk, a gay man who moved to the Castro in San Francisco during the time when its gay population was first exploding.  Even viewers not familiar with Milk's story will know within the first few minutes that Milk will be killed; however, the suspense in this film is not how that will happen, but how Milk will manage to transcend it through his decade of activism.<br /><br />Sean Penn plays Milk so convincingly and lovingly that it's easy to forget that the role is acted.  Penn's Milk is never stereotyped and instead comes across as a passionate, courageous man who has decided that he has no choice but to fight.  Other standout performances include James Franco as Scott, Milk's true love; Diego Luna (Y Tu Mama Tambien) as wacko, flamboyant, needy Jack;  Josh Brolin as repressed and lonely Dan White;  Emile Hirsch, as Cleve Jones; and Alison Pill, as Anne Kronenberg.  Anita Bryant, in news clips that seem laughable today, comes across as a dangerous force of her time.<br /><br />Although both gays and lesbians continue to face obstacles on a daily basis, this film drives home just how difficult it was in the years following the otherwise liberating sixties and seventies.  The characters in "Milk" yearn to be treated like equal members of society, and their actors imbibe them with such humanity that I would be surprised if their performances don't open a few eyes.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>While Sean Penn has gained the lion share of the praise and his second academy award for his portrayal of the slain gay politician and equal rights leader Harvey Milk, the rest of the cast and director Gus Van Sant are right there with Mr. Penn with their level of excellence.  Mr. Van Sant does a superb job of showing the persecution and struggle for equal rights the gay community faced without getting overly preachy and self-righteous.  He superbly weaves archival footage into the film and his use of footage showing Anita Bryant spouting her anti-gay rhetoric shows her icy malice with far greater impact than any actress could convey (George Clooney used the same technique with Joseph McCarthy in his film Good Night & Good Luck).  Mr. Penn, as he is apt to do, dives completely into the role and transforms himself into Milk while James Franco, Josh Brolin and the rest of the cast provide him with strong support.  Milk succeeds in being both informative and entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>When the Oscars were announced, I have to say that Sean Penn deserved it. Mickey Rourke was certainly solid, but Penn has proven again that there isn't much he can't do; the new Dustin Hoffman? Researching his roles? Penn is excellent in this role, aided by one of the best supporting casts ever assembled. Credit to director Gus Van Sant, but mostly to the flawless script of Lance Black. The story of Harvey Milk had been attempted by many, but with Black's script, it finally found fruition, so to speak. Bravo to all involved.  AFTERTHOUGHT: The Indie Spirit Awards honored Mr. Black and James Franco, but no nomination for the Film, nor for Mr. Penn & Mr. Van Sant. Bad feelings? How objective is that? Doesn't seem fair to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This biopic by Gus Van Sant gave me some info on Harvey Milk, his rise to political power, his activism within the gay community, and his untimely demise.  Penn, Hirsch, Pill, and Brolin were all well chosen for their parts, and they even physically resemble the people they portray.  It's also a look back at the turbulence and fashion of the 1970s, with disco, wide ties, funny hairstyles, and big cars.<br /><br />There are some loose ends that left me wanting a bit more.  Who was the young fellow in the wheelchair that we only saw a couple of times?  Was he a real person or some kind of symbol?  Why didn't the James Franco character stay with Milk?  Why did Jack choose to exit in a very dramatic and upsetting way?  Since the Twinkie defense makes no sense as a motive for killing someone, what was Dan White's beef with Milk other than his political rivalry and losses?  Was Dan gay and in the closet and therefore jealous of Milk in more than one way?<br />I also found some of the music rather distracting, but that's more of a personal quirk.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Who would have thought that Sean Penn would have been able to pull off playing Harvey Milk so well? By and far, it is Penn's Oscar winning performance that propels Gus Van Sant's Milk, which manages to recount Harvey's struggle to lead the way for gay civil rights while also paying loving homage to the man as well.

It chronicles the career of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician, and his struggle and triumph against bigotry.  The script, by Dustin Lance Black, is one of the best in recent years; Black earned his Oscar and all the acclaim he's garnered.  Van Sant's directing is something to behold; the film is a seamless flow of "archival" footage and "new" footage, interlaced to tell the story of the struggle.<br /><br />It is the acting, though, that really ropes in the viewer.  Sean Penn won a Best Acting Oscar for his portrayal of Milk, and he earned it; he sinks into his role, disappearing behind Milk's persona, creating an iconic film character, a modern day Atticus Finch.  Josh Brolin, as Milk's political adversary (and eventual assassin) Dan White, turns in another great performance; he exudes a sense of unease and self-loathing, and would surely have been a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actor had it not been for the late Heath Ledger's iconic performance in THE DARK KNIGHT.  James Franco shows yet again that he is a genuine talent; following a string of second- and third- rate roles, he showed his talent in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, and now here again, in a moving, powerful performance.  The other primary supporting roles--from Emile Hirsch, Alison Pill, and Diego Luna specifically--are all well cast.<br /><br />MILK is a movie for our times.  It is powerful, persuasive, emotional, funny, romantic, and entertaining; in other words, it's everything a film could hope to be. Watch it and be moved.  Watch it and learn something about true humanity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Doing film biopics can be very tricky. You can either come out with a tremendous success or an overconvulted film. With Milk, thankfully, it falls into the latter catagory, with a great script, masterful directing, and talented cast, it rises up as possibly one of the greatest film biopics ever.<br /><br />Havery Milk was the first openly gay man to enter public office and is considered an icon in the gay community. What he accomplished in the short span of his politic career could fill volumes. The film begins with Milk recording his life story, from his meeting with longtime lover Scott Smith, to their move to Castro street in '72, his run for office, the numerous people he meets, and of course his untimely death at the hands of a fellow politician.<br /><br />Out of all the award films that I have seen this year, Milk is really the only one that I felt really lived up to all the acclaim. Slumdog was great, so was Benjamin Button and The Dark Knight, The Reader was alright, as was Frost/Nixon, but Milk was truly that one film that really satisfied me. I would gladly say that Milk is hands down the best picture of 2008.<br /><br />Gus Van Sant has made arguably his best film, perfectly balancing all the emotions, sensitivity, and humor that everything just sort of flows across the screen and nothing feels to rushed or to slow. The screenplay by Dustin Lance Black perfectly encapsulates who Milk was as a person, warm, funny, stead fast, someone that you looked up to, no matter if you were gay or straight.<br /><br />The cast, in particular, does a great job, with the obvious standout of course being Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. Now I will admit, I am not a Sean Penn fan. There has just always been something about him that I just did not like. But with this role, he has really turned my opinions on him. The whole time I was watching the film, seeing him gave me nothing but joy, with no animosity or hatred at all felt towards him. He emobied so much of what Harvey Milk was as a person that you cannot believe that this tough as nails actor could play someone so opposite of who he normally potrays. Each of the supporting actors are also great as well, with Emile Hirsh, James Franco, and Josh Brolin being standouts. I will say that I don't agree with Brolin's Oscar nomination. Out of all the supporting roles, I think his is the most underwritten. If it were up to me, Hirsh would get the nomination and not Brolin.<br /><br />This is really a film that everyone should see, no matter what orientation you may be. And in the wakes of the recent Prop 8 vote in California, this film couldn't be even more relevant then ever. If there is any award movie you must see this year, Milk is that film. It will have you leaving the theater with a skip in your step and light in your heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Frankly, this movie is a long time coming, it's amazing that an industry full of gays, it has taken this long to get a film made of arguably the most important gay man in American history.  Gus Van Zant does a fantastic job getting a spectacular performance out of the singular Sean Penn and I applaud the man in full disection of Milk.  The film has a nice pace and show's how this mild mannered, East Coast Jew, hardly the sterotype of the stylish, WASP, that most think of when they think of gays, took San Francisco by storm.  I thought Van Zant being gay, really got to the heart of what made Milk tick, and I thought Penn's relationship with Franco in the movie felt genuine, not contrived, like Hanks relationship with Banderas in Philadelphia, though like Hanks and Banderas you wonder, in what gay planet would these people every be together, but I digress.  I especially liked how the film began with a sort of an omage to the gay right's struggle, I just dont think many Americans have a clue about what it is to be gay in this country, nor do many care, maybe somebody will force them to watch this film, to understand, what he he## we are fighting for...frankly, to the person who found this review unhelpful..i have a feeling, either you didnt see this movie, or were never going to see it anyway..so to you..i say..peace out, yo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>The producers really did a great job picking actors who looked like the people they were playing.  I felt like I was watching a documentary and not a film based on a true story.<br /><br />Sean Penn should have won an Oscar for his heartwarming portrayal of Harvey Milk, the gay activist who made history before his untimely and violent death.<br /><br />Great film and very educational - shows how history is relevant as gay rights are very much in the news right now.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>Many people thought that Brokeback Mountain would be the first gay-themed film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Alas, it was not meant to be. Now Milk has taken its shot but despite it earnestness, it too has fallen short.<br /><br />Milk had a bit more going for it than Brokeback in terms of public acceptance. Its principal advantage was that Harvey Milk (very well-played by Sean Penn) is an extremely likable character who championed a cause that most Americans were in favor of (we find out in "Milk" that even Ronald Reagan was opposed to the bigoted Proposition 6). Brokeback, on the other hand focused on two closeted gay characters, one who ends up consorting with male prostitutes. Despite the tragic murder of Harvey Milk, the film's theme is a positive and uplifting one; Brokeback on the other hand was more tragic and downbeat.<br /><br />The film's screenplay relies on actual tape recordings recorded shortly before Milk's death. Much of the story is held together by Milk's posthumous narration. Some critics objected to the use of this device but I thought it worked well along with director Van Slant's creative use of old documentary footage from that era.<br /><br />The film begins with Milk at age 40, just as he is about to leave for San Francisco. (Check out Wikipedia for his earlier biography--believe it or not, he supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 elections!). While Milk's private life is examined in some detail, most of the film focuses on his political activism.<br /><br />Milk is most successful when it avoids (as one critic puts it) "agenda-driven agitprop". The best scenes are the most historical and revelatory: Milk's rejection of established gay leaders (the leading gay newspaper, The Advocate initially supports straight candidates when Milk starts running for office), the initiation of a blacklist of businesses that are hostile to gays and his ability to control angry crowds of gays during emotionally charged street demonstrations.<br /><br />The strongest part of the film involves Milk challenging the proponents of Proposition 6 and successfully defeating a bill that had the potential to erode constitutional freedoms (Milk has the courage to go face to face in hostile venues with John Briggs, the California State Senator, primarily responsible for championing Proposition 6).<br /><br />The film is less successful in the depiction of Milk's failed campaigns for political office (basically due to the lack of a primary antagonist such as an Anita Bryant/John Briggs character introduced in the film's second half).<br /><br />Milk's personal life revolved around three main characters: his first lover Scott Smith (a character I remember little about); Cleve Jones (a flamboyant street activist who helps Milk on his campaign and who's a prominent presence throughout the story) and Jack Lira (Milk's second lover, emotionally insecure, who commits suicide after feeling that Milk is neglecting him). Some critics questioned why Milk stuck with Lira for so long. It's explained simply during the film: Milk needed someone who wasn't involved in politics who he could relax with after a grinding day at the office.<br /><br />Milk is bolstered tremendously by an extremely strong performance by Josh Brolin as Dan White, Harvey Milk's assassin. Brolin looks like White and conveys the deep contempt and menace under the surface. Ironically, Milk predicts his assassination by anti-gay fanatics. But White's anger toward Milk is much more personal: he's a disgruntled, jealous colleague who not only murders Milk but shoots the straight mayor as well!<br /><br />Milk has a great look to it. It has a simplistic but strong message: intolerance is unacceptable. While most of the characters that revolve around Milk are not depicted as saints, they basically all have hearts of gold (that's perhaps Milk's principal weakness). Furthermore, the activists weren't as well-behaved in real-life as the film suggests (anti-Proposition 6 proponents sometimes reacted violently during street demonstrations).<br /><br />Now that the The Academy Awards are in, I must confess that I believed 'Milk' had a chance for best picture. But looking back, it's obvious that it's a picture that wasn't big enough in scope to take the top award. Nonetheless, Director Gus Van Sant managed to avoid turning 'Milk' into a hagiography and admirably eschewed the kind of sentimental plotting that has sunk other biopics in the past.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this was a very good movie. I like the way it was shot. Sometimes it almost had a documentary type feel to it. All the actors were excellent and it was a very interesting story that I knew very little about.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Sean Penn certainly deserved his Oscar for his performance as early San Francisco gay rights activist, politician and social gadfly Harvey Milk. Moreover, for a commercially done effort this one is not too hagiographic or heavy on the dramatic episodes when they are not called for. The only thing that I would add is something of a historic note. In the year 2008 one could reasonably expect to be nominated for and even to win an Oscar for playing a homosexual, a taboo subject for most of mainstream cinematic history. And that is to the good. What I would note is the distance that has been traveled since the 1984 film documentary "The Times Of Harvey Milk". That film (an Oscar-winner), a more sober retrospective of Harvey Milk, made on a shoestring, played in, at best, art houses. One can argue for the virtues than a wider circulation of well-done commercial has but I will say, after a recent renewed viewing of that documentary, politically and socially it presented a much better picture of the real Harvey Milk and the real struggle for gay rights, including the underestimated backlash then and now.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>Sean Penn does a fine job impersonating the assassinated San Francisco politician Harvey Milk here, but the film itself is less than perfect. I needed a bit less of the gay personal relations drama, and a bit more about Mayor George Moscone, who was also killed, and Dan White, the emotionally disturbed fellow city supervisor who shot both men. Moscone is almost totally absent from the movie, but in my recollection of the events, he was as  important an irritant in Dan White's mental crisis as Milk. And White's decision to go to City Hall with a pistol that day is not presented coherently here. I don't care much for Penn's radical politics or apparently real-life personality, but it is hard to deny his talents. And Mr. Milk, by most accounts, had courage and political integrity, and did not deserve his fate any more than Moscone did. In this version of the events, Milk's political rise is much more interesting than his personal life. A question that has not been answered fully is which part of Milk's life was, to Dan White, a more compelling reason to shoot him too?</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Milk (Gus van Sant, 2008)<br /><br />When I started watching Milk, Gus van Sant's biopic of San Francisco city supervisor, I wasn't quite sure about it. The film opens with Milk (Sean Penn) dictating, essentially, his memoirs onto a series of cassettes in case he is assassinated. I wasn't quite sure how van Sant was going to work the time factor into this (given how the movie ends--and we all know how it ends, right? If not, be warned, this review may contain spoilers), but he ended up doing it quite well. One can never be quite sure what one is going to get with a Gus van Sant film, but Milk is far closer on the sliding scale of quality to Drugstore Cowboy than it is to Psycho. (And as Captain Peacock was wont to say, "Thank Heaven for that.")<br /><br />The first half of Milk traces the final years of Harvey Milk's life, from his relocation to San Francisco with partner Scott Smith (An American Crime's James Franco) through his days as a political activist to his election as city supervisor. The second half zeroes in on the final weeks, as Milk tries to play politics with rabid antigay conservative Dan White (No Country for Old Men's Josh Brolin), elected supervisor for the next district over on the same day Milk rose to power. Along the way, we get to know the backstories of a number of others instrumental in Milk's rise to power, including Cleve Jones (Speed Racer's Emile Hirsch), who would go on to create the AIDS quilt; Jack Lira (Y Tu Mama Tambien's Diego Luna), whom Milk dated after Smith left him (and who was, in many ways, the impetus for the events of Milk's final days); and Anne Kronenberg (Allison Pill, recently fo Dan in Real Life), who is still involved in San Francisco politics to this day.<br /><br />While the movie does have a plot (and a more compelling plot than a lot of recent movies not based on true stories), it never fails to remain aggressively character-driven, and because of that the movie lives or dies by the performances of the actors involved. Every time I've seen Sean Penn offscreen for the past decade or so, he seems more and more like a personal train wreck (his Oscar speech accepting the Best Actor award for this film was horrifyingly incoherent), but it's been impossible to deny his power as an actor for close to thirty years now. I've loved many of Penn's performances, from Fast Times at Ridgemont High to Mystic River, but for me his landmark performance has always been in the 1983 prison drama Bad Boys. This is the first time I've seen him eclipse that. He absolutely, positively nails this role to the wall. On the flip side of the coin is Josh Brolin, whose career has been the polar opposite of Penn's, from the woeful The Goonies through some of Hollywood's worst disasters in recent memory (Hollow Man, The Mod Squad, Into the Blue). No Country for Old Men was a revelation where Brolin was concerned, and Milk just ups the ante. While saying Brolin has never given a performance this good would be damning with faint praise, I don't mean it like that at all; he is almost as powerful as Penn here. The rest of the principals are equally good at making us love or hate them, depending (Diego Luna is just loathsome here, as he was meant to be). The main cast are helped out by a slew of phenomenal performances from actors in minor roles; 21 Grams' Dennis O'Hara reunites with Penn here as John Briggs, Milk's biggest public nemesis, while Legally Blonde's Victor Garber couldn't be better as George Moscone, the mayor of San Francisco. And they're just the tip of the iceberg; this isn't Cecil B. DeMille, but it's at least a cast of hundreds, and everyone with a speaking role is fine here.<br /><br />The direction is equally stunning. Van Sant's passion for the source material is evident in every frame (he's been trying to get an adaptation of Randy Shilts' biography, The Mayor of Castro Street, off the ground for almost twenty years; it looks as if that may actually happen now). People often say that attention to small details doesn't make a difference in a movie. Maybe in some cases they're right, but I think in this case it's indicative of Van Sant's dedication to the source material; his use, for example, of the real Castro Camera and Harvey Milk's actual apartment may only contribute to the film in an intangible way, but I think those intangibles are reflected in the performances of the actors. (As well, a number of the actual people portrayed in the film have cameos, including Dan White's son Chris, Cleve Jones, and Danny Nicoletta). That has to have some effect on what happens behind the scenes, don't you think? In any case, it's hard to argue with success, and whatever the reason, Milk gives us both a director and a stable of actors who are all on top of their collective game here. Almost unanimously named by critics as one of the best movies of 2008, and I'm inclined to agree. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Every decade, Hollywood has an actor that takes the tough roles and turns them into great movies.  For the past 10 years, this would probably be Sean Penn.  With classics such as 21 Grams, Mystic River, and now Milk, Sean Penn has progressed far from his bad boy days and is now one of the best American actors.  Milk is Penn's portrayal of the political career of Harvey Milk, one of the first openly gay men elected to public office in the USA.  Starting in NYC and ending in the Bay Area around San Francisco, this movie shows how the closeted gay Mr. Milk became openly gay, and then a gay rights crusader who took on big political honchos in California and the US national scene.  All the major characters from Milk's later life are included in this movie, though the movie does not mention anything about his family.  I would normally give this movie 5/5 stars, but the inclusion of numerous gay love scenes was quite gross, and quite have been easily excluded without taking away for the movie.  Hence the 4/5 stars instead.  But overall, a good portrayal of how local politics works, the gay rights movement, and good commentary on American society in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Milk"  stars Sean Penn in the title role of Harvey Milk, a closeted gay man who moved from New York to San Francisco in 1972.  There he came out of the closet and opened a camera shop in the Castro District, an area experiencing a huge influx of gays and lesbians.  He ran for political office unsuccessfully several times on a platform that included workers' issues and education as well as the rights of gays and other minorities, and finally won an election for city supervisor.  He led several battles against anti-gay initiatives in California.<br /> Penn presents Milk primarily as outspoken activist, community organizer, and champion of civil rights for gay Americans.  Director Van Sant combines actual news and archival footage with footage of his actors to illustrate seamlessly the 1970's era that saw the birth of the gay rights movement in the United States.<br /> "Milk," however, is more than just the tale of a firebrand working up the populace into action.  It's a movie about one person spearheading a movement to give voice to a minority that had been forced into hiding.  By fighting for the right to live without persecution, the gay community became a visible, political force that voted its mind at the polls.  Milk worked to organize and inspire his constituency out of complacency and acceptance of intimidation to active protest and demands.  It started in California, but quickly spread across the country.<br /> Mr. Penn does some of his finest work in "Milk." From his slicked down hair to his softly Brooklyn-tinged voice to his self-assured swagger, Penn provides an amazing characterization of a man who, in his 40's, finally found a purpose and the wherewithal to achieve it.<br /> There is a self-deprecating facet to Penn's performance.  His Harvey can make jokes at his own expense while taking his cause seriously.  Mr. Penn captures the folk-hero quality of Milk while never losing sight of Harvey the man.  We see him as a flawed individual, not happy in his previous pursuits and as terrified of discovery as most gay people of the time, but ultimately inspired by injustice to be the voice of protest and change.<br /> The movie shows how that change comes in stages.  What starts as periodic clashes with the police leads to grass-roots organization for the purpose of declaring themselves to the larger society and persuade the world that they are entitled to the same rights as anybody else.  Milk recruits average folks -- mostly gay -- who can summon a crowd of 1,000 protesters on a moment's notice or get endorsements from local newspapers.<br /> Among these associates are Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill), and photographer Danny Nicoletta (Lucas Grabeel).  We're also introduced to two of Milk's boyfriends, Scott Smith (James Franco) and Jack Lira (Diego Luna).<br /> Scott seems to be the inspiration for Harvey to embark on a more meaningful course.  Franco is entirely believable in some intimate scenes with Penn.  It's in the early scenes, in his conversations with Scott, that we see Harvey's frustration at approaching his 40th birthday and not really having done anything significant.  He's ready for a change.  They leave New York together to resettle in San Francisco only to find a not-too-welcoming introduction to the Castro District's businessmen.<br /> Josh Brolin plays Dan White, a fellow city supervisor, who shares an unusual collegial relationship with Milk.  Staunchly in favor of preserving "family values" and blocking any pro-gay legislation, White is an enigma.  As portrayed in the movie, he doesn't have many friends, appears uncomfortable at the inroads the gay community is making in California, is dissatisfied with his job as city supervisor because of its low pay, and ultimately is jealous of the media attention Milk is getting while he remains anonymous.  Brolin continues to associate himself with top-quality motion pictures.  Excellent in "No Country for Old Men,"  "American Gangster," and "W.," he continues his winning streak in "Milk."<br /> Rated R, "Milk" won the Best Actor Academy Award for Penn, and was nominated for Best Picture.  The script by Dustin Lance Black moves quickly and presents the events of Milk's life in dramatic, fascinating fashion.  The film is extremely timely in light of California's passage of Proposition 8, which bars same-sex marriages.  Though Harvey Milk fought vigorously thirty years ago for gays to receive the same rights as all other Americans, it seems the fight isn't over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I am so glad that this story has been told and done such justice<br />by the great Sean Penn as Harvey Milk, a true pioneer &<br />sacrificial lamb in the ongoing struggle for gay rights in america!<br />Gus Van Zant's direction was great, Josh Brolin perfectly<br />captured the tortured, angry & confused Dan White, who<br />murdered both Milk & Mayor Moscone and got off with basically<br />a slap on the wrist for it!

Such matters were just not revealed or discussed, except in bad-taste jokes. My parents and other adults seemed not at all inclined to yield any information about the subject, nor did they point their fingers at any known suspects. I grew up almost totally ignorant and it wasn't until I went to college and graduate school (Boulder, CO, and Seattle, WA, in late 50s and early 60s) that I even became aware that there was such a thing as a gay community (not called gay at the time).<br /><br />Flash forward to the present. I've now attended three San Diego area Gay Pride parades, large festive gatherings attended by thousands of open gays in amusing and outrageous get-ups and gathering thousands and thousands of interested and generally supportive spectators along the way. Oh sure, there are the preachers, angry people carrying placards and police ready to go into riot mode at an instant's notice, but that just adds to the charm and festivity of the gathering. It's a fun annual event. If your community has one, be sure to take it in. It's highly educational and very worth while.<br /><br />Well, the difference certainly marks a radical change in our society and one I never would have anticipated. The change has been gradual over those 60 years and punctuated by killings, beatings, court orders, protests, voting on propositions and what not all. Cultural changes are not easy and this one has been an especially difficult struggle. I've always been on the outside looking in and it represents an extremely interesting period of cultural change.<br /><br />Last night, my wife and I viewed the movie "Milk" on DVD. The story involves Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the US and the people he was surrounded by and the context of the time they were in. The story took place largely in the Castro District of San Francisco where Milk was elected as a City Supervisor. The movie is stunningly well done. Kudos to director Gus Van Sant. It's done up as a semi-biography in a subdued documentary style. To me, as a total outsider, I would say the movie was fair and balanced. If you have strong views one way or another, you may have a different interpretation. Sean Penn and the rest of the cast do a marvelous job with the acting. The whole story is very believable. I can clearly remember many of the events and people of that time, and I appreciate seeing them put in this context. To me, the movie "Milk" presents an astonishing view into the events of that time.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Universal / Region Free<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />VC-1 BD-50 / AACS / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 2:08:18<br />Movie size: 34,05 GB<br />Disc size: 42,94 GB<br />Total bit rate: 35.38 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 29.42 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4040 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 4040 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 20<br /><br />#Featurettes<br />--Hollywood Comes to San Francisco (HD - 14 minutes)<br />--Remember Harvey (HD - 13 minutes)<br />--Marching for Equality (HD - 7 minutes)<br />#BD-Live enabled</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>I came into the film knowing absolutely nothing about Harvey Milk.  Penn is as good as everyone has said; most of the time, due to his acting, I felt like I was watching a documentary.  Unfortunately, a documentary would probably be more interesting than the film.  It draaaaagged in spots and was mostly just unremarkable.  Giving away the ending up front didn't make any sense, and while the building of the movement was fun and interesting in spots, a bit more attention to the assassination would have been nice (or at least have it played for shock).  Some bits were fun, some bits were informative (e.g. the actual footage of gay bars around the U.S. being raided was pretty interesting), some touching...but mostly it's not something I'd recommend.  I think they should have cut some of his relationships out for example, I don't know, just get it a bit more brisk would be nice.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>MILK is a biopic about Harvey Milk, a homosexual political activist who moved back to San Francisco in 1972 and after several losing campaigns was eventually elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California.  The film is a pasteurized biopic that begins on Harvey Milk's (Sean Penn's) birthday and his move to San Francisco with his then lover, Scott Smith (James Franco).  Upon arriving in the city, the couple opens a camera shop on Castro Street., which eventually becomes the headquarters for the local gay community as well as Milk's campaign headquarters for the various political offices he would run for.  MILK loosely follows Harvey's life through his political campaigns until after several failed attempts at other offices, he is eventually elected as one of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.  In the movie, upon being elected Milk forms an alliance with fellow Supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin).  White agrees to support Milk's city-wide gay rights ordinance if Milk will support his attempt to keep a psychiatric hospital from opening in the neighborhood he represents.  White is true to his word and is initially supportive of Milk's initiatives, but then Milk betrays White by not supporting him and voting for the establishment of the psychiatric hospital in White's district.  White is dismayed and becomes Milk's adversary and nemesis, voting against everything he supports and voting for everything that he is against.  Milk doesn't seem shocked at all by White's behavior and seems to take a sadistic joy in tormenting him.  It is White who ultimately kills both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Mascone (Victor Garber).  The movie basically ends showing the streets filled with people in a candle-lit march in honor of Milk and Mascone.<br /><br />The best thing about MILK is the acting, particularly the supporting cast.  James Franco does an excellent job portraying Scott Smith, the man who came back to San Francisco with Harvey Milk and was later abandoned by him.  Josh Brolin, portraying Dan White, continues to amaze with his chameleon-like abilities to almost become the characters he portrays.  Also notable is Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, a follower of Milk's who becomes a gay activist leader himself.  There's been a huge hoopla about Sean Penn and his portrayal of Harvey Milk, cumulating in his win for Best Actor at the Oscars.  I don't know what the hoopla is all about.  Penn's performance is passable, but in all honesty it's not great.  In fact, the whole time I was watching MILK in my mind I kept thinking all he was doing was a variation of Sam Dawson from I AM SAM; a performance Penn almost lost his career over.<br /><br />The uberexuberance over Penn's performance also seems to carry over to the movie as a whole because even though MILK is a decent movie, it's not a great movie.  Don't get me wrong. I didn't hate the movie, but I just don't think it's as good as it is being marketed.  MILK follows the same clich&eacute;-ridden pattern that countless other biopics before it set forth.  Everything from the movie's score, to the arc of the story structure, to the overextended final images Milk sees at his death, to the triumphant candle-lit march at the end of the movie are ripped from the playbook of the biopic.  The film displays very little originality and offers nothing new to the medium. Not only that but it glosses over or ignores the more interesting parts of Milk's character and portrays him in a far more positive light than he really was.  Towards the end of the movie, Harvey Milk is talking to Mayor Mascone and the Mayor says, "You know who you sounded like just then? Boss Tweed." The statement is meant as a compliment but shouldn't be.  Boss Tweed was an evil and ruthless man and is someone we should be trying to avoid being like and not emulate.  The same could be said of Harvey Milk and the movie about that version of Harvey Milk would be far more interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film begins with news films of police arrests as part of a crackdown. Then it is November 1978 and a man is recording his thoughts about fear of an assassination. [Guilt feelings?] The film shows Harvey Milk's personality through a flashback to his earlier life in New York city. Milk relocates to San Francisco as if he would be welcome there. Businessman Milk makes plans to take over the neighborhood, and it seems to work. [A group that is organized has advantages over ordinary people.] Milk wants an organization to protect its members, like other groups. He runs for city supervisor on a platform of vague promises and loses. Even with a three-piece suit he loses again and again. What is he for?<br /><br />The singer Anita Bryant becomes politically active. A redrawn political boundary creates a new opportunity. [Was this an accident?] Anger is channeled into a parade. A man who can manipulate a crowd and control votes is a politician. Milk blames Anita Bryant for causing this reaction. Milk gets a new campaign manager, one with experience who can get newspaper endorsements. [How much did they have to pay for this? They don't explain how it works.] Milk gets elected by appealing to a wider range of people. Milk wants a state-wide referendum for "gay rights" and a city ordinance. Newly elected Dan White wants to keep a psychiatric center out of his district. A new law is proposed to purge homosexual teachers "and their supporters". Its purpose is to prevent perversion of students. Milk has problems with his boyfriends. There is a conflict over the plan to defeat Proposition 6. Is there enough state-wide support to defeat this bill?<br /><br />Milk reneges on his promise to vote against that psychiatric center. [Why put it in a residential neighborhood?] Cities vote against laws that control rental housing. The film shows how people are manipulated for political ends. Will the plan work? [Is there a hidden agenda behind low salaries for elected politicians? Yes.] Does Milk handle his personal life correctly? Why did his boyfriends attempt suicide? Is there some hidden fault? Milk the politician talks rhetoric to a crowd. He has a debate with another politician over a state proposition. Could that tragedy have been prevented? The advice from national politicians may show their control by corporate rulers. Could the "gay rights" movement be designed to foster a reaction among voters to back corporate political candidates? Proposition 6 passes, Dan White resigns. Milk threatens Mayor Moscone with political reprisals if he allows Dan White to return. [Is that opera meant to be symbolic?] Dan White enters City Hall through a window. There is an ending like some operas, but without music and singing.<br /><br />This film could be edited for quickness. Did it really explain what caused this tragedy? It seemed like an accident from a personality clash rather than political rivalry. Could a "lone gunman" actually be working for hidden interests? Could sugar-rich "junk food" really be a cause for murder or just be an excuse for something that was omitted from this film? Political assassinations are rare, most murders are the result of love or money (lust or greed). The film does not mention "Jim Jones" and his organization. I think Anita Bryant was right to object about school teachers who push their homosexual agenda.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Probably the best thing Sean Penn has ever done in his acting career, "Milk" is a film everyone should see, not just the gay audience. While watching the picture ones get a glimpse as to what gay people went through, back in the 1970's, as far as recognition and respect is concerned. If we think things are tough now, the world was more difficult 30 years ago.<br /> Sean Penn plays Harvery Milk, who was the first openly gay person who held a position in public office in the history of the United States. He was on the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco, and he was determined gay men and women would obtain the same rights as heterosexuals. Harvey  was not only a gay hero, but a hero for all those who didn't have a voice. His bravery and determination is something that is rare in mankind. After watching "Milk" we could learn many things as to what makes people want to obtain that status that we all should have as God's people. The message in this film is clear- we homosexuals are no different than anyone, and when it comes to equal rights we will not stop fighting until those rights are obtained by us. Harvery Milk's work is still felt today, as we have come along way, but there is still work to be done, as homosexuals still cannot marry in America.<br /> Again, this movie wasn't made just for the gay audience- straights could learn a lot from watching this film. After viewing it people get a very good understanding of the hatred and bitterness felt towards gays from our heterosexual counterparts.<br /> The movie really works. The best part of the film is how we are actually put back to the late '70s, in which the producers use actual news footage from the American netwoks documenting the events of Harvey's plight as a poltician, and his work for gay rights. Anita Bryant, probably the biggest hater of gays, is seen in newsreels venting her anger and venom against people who are different.<br /> The picture also dramatizes Harvey's love life as well, as we see how he balances his work and personal life, sometimes often ending in tragic results.<br /> The cast is perfect, and Penn was made for this role. Josh Brolin is also impeccable as the man who untilmately destroys Harvery's life. The other roles too are performed by first-rate actors.<br /> "Milk" would go on to receive 8 Academy Awards nominations, winning Best Actor for Sean Penn, and one for cutie Dustin Lance Black for Best Original screenplay. The picture is also a boxoffice hit and sold millions of DVDs in the first few weeks of release.<br /> The DVD comes with a lot of bonuses, including deleted scenes, and documentaries on "Remembering Harvey Milk", "Hollywood Comes To San Francisco", and "Marching for Equality".<br /> There is also an excellent documentary on Harvery Milk, that came out in 2004 called "The Life of Harvey Milk", that is available on DVD. I would suggest watching that DVD first before watching the film, as it gives an insight into what made this man who he was.<br /> Focus Features, who produced and marketed "Brokeback Mountain", also released "Milk", and they should be applauded for the work they have done in releasing not only a well-dramatized film, but a great educational tool.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There is no denying that `Milk' is a very good film; a biopic that is engrossing and at times very moving.  Thanks in large part to some stellar casting (seriously, there is rarely a sour note when concerning the performances) as well as Gus Van Sant's surprisingly graceful direction (he's always `graceful' but this is truly a different side to him) the film is at the very least entertaining and insightful.  That said; when the film credits began to roll I didn't really feel anything.  I turned to my best friend and said "well that was good", but that was exactly how I felt.<br /><br />`Milk' was good.<br /><br />I guess maybe I was expecting too much, I don't know, but I don't find this the utter masterpiece that a lot of people are claiming it to be.  I felt that it was slightly (or maybe not so slightly) manipulative, and this took away from the raw feeling of honesty in Van Sant's direction.  The films primary focus was constantly on politics and so we are never truly given a chance to connect emotionally to the characters and thus when each and every major character (aside from White) appears to be flawless we are left rather apathetic.  I'm not going to get into a huge debate (with myself or with those who so chose to comment on my particular thoughts) about the need for biographical flaws, because each and every film is different.  Take the Oscar winning `A Beautiful Mind' for instance.  The entire weight of the film hinged solely on our emotional connection to John Nash, and so to expose his supposed flaws (sporadic flings with men while he was married to Alicia) would have only lessened our view of him and may have tampered with the desired resulting effect on the audience.  With `Milk' though, I feel that making Harvey Milk a flawless martyr took away from what made him human.  In the battle for equal rights one has to feel as though they are equals, but `Milk' showed almost no equality.<br /><br />It felt very one-sided to me.<br /><br />This isn't a major flaw, but it is a flaw to say the least.  In the end I didn't feel like I got to know the real Harvey Milk but more or less a biased view of the `hero' he was.  I'm not saying he wasn't a hero to a certain community (I find it rather insulting that this site won't let me use the three letter word that starts with a G and ends with a Y even though I see it on plenty of other reviews) but in order to make this film translate to everyone their needed to be a larger sense of genuine (believable) humanity.  Again, I go back to the fact that the film is largely a very political film, and so we aren't given a very detailed look at Harvey's personal life aside from a few trysts and work relationships.  Those relationships appear to be more subplots and thus seem less important, where I feel that the whole point of a biopic is to come to know the real man, and that requires knowing his life away from the spotlight.<br /><br />I don't want to seem like I'm tearing the film apart, because like I said, it is a good film and at times it is very good.  The acting is such a huge highlight that it helps cement the film and thus keep our interest glued throughout.  Without that strong personal connection though, the acting seems less like a fluid progression of character and more like a series of dramatically constructed scenes.  Take Dan White for instance, the films central villain.  I never felt like I got a true sense of who this man was.  He appeared to be nothing more than a selfish and ignorant man who had anger issues.  Sure, Brolin's portrayal was brilliant, especially the drunk confrontation scene, but there was no genuine character development in the script.  Thus he felt more like the `token bad guy' to me than a real person.  Same with Scott, Franco's character, who felt more like the suffering spouse than anything else.  Again, what he did with what he was given was amazing (talk about adding notes to a one-note character) but in the end the character felt unfinished.<br /><br />I think that `Milk' would have been aided by a longer running time, because then maybe we would have had the chance to truly flesh out the man inside of Harvey and not just the goal he had in mind.  His aspirations were admirable, but I wanted to really know him, warts and all.  Beings that the films primary focus was on the message then exposing Milk's flaws would have only deepened our understanding of the man, not take away from the message.<br /><br />So, my feelings on `Milk' are this; the film is good (I give it a low B), but it could have really been wonderful.  I thought that Van Sant's direction was inspired (he definitely went commercial, but no where near the `sell out' kind of commercial he went with `Good Will Hunting'), especially the effortless additions of raw footage, and that murder scene is probably the single best scene in the film, and possible the `scene of the year'.  I also thought that all performances stood out and elevated their material (while I was totally rooting for Rourke, Penn's complete transformation here was a very worthy Oscar win), but the script in my opinion was lacking.  It was one-sided and manipulative and, while it gave us an insightful look at the political stance of this man, it failed to really uncover who he was.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Sean Penn does his usual first class acting job playing Harvey Milk.  He is also given great competition by Josh Brolin playing Dan White. Directed by Gus Van Sant, this film is the biography of Harvey Milk, a gay rights activist decades ago in San Francisco, who rose to considerable political power.  Milk and the mayor of San Francisco were assassinated by Dan White, a conservative straight man who was also on the board of supervisors along with Harvey.  I couldn't help compare this film with the documentary made about Milk in 1984, "The Times of Harvey Milk." The problem is that the film does the same job as the documentary.  It covers in literal and linear fashion, the ascendance and destruction of Harvey Milk.  The film does not try anything new and visionary in telling a biography like Oliver Stone did with "The Doors."  Still, Van Sant does nothing wrong telling the tale and also has first class actors to play the tale.  One thing the film does convey is the hope that Harvey Milk brought to gay people for gay rights in this country.  It seems in retrospect a lot more innocent time for gays, a time when there was hope for coming out and being accepted in the not so distant future.  One cannot say that about present day.  It is amazing  how close California came back then to being the first state to fully accept gays. Today California just rejected these very same gays in a statewide proposition on the ballot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Director Gus Van Sant brings the political career of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk to the screen in "Milk", following Milk from his discovery of political activism at age 40 to his murder in 1978, 8 years later. Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) sporadically narrates the film through a recording which was to be played in the event of his death. He begins with the day he picked up Scott Smith (James Franco) on a New York subway platform. The men became lovers and moved to San Francisco, where they became hippies and opened a camera shop in the Castro district. Milk's successful efforts to mobilize the gay community into an economic and political force didn't translate into successful runs for public office -until redistricting and a new campaign manager gave him a better shot.<br /><br />Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States (there was one lesbian who preceded him). His political activism in San Francisco came at a time of violent clashes between police and gay citizens, who could genuinely claim that they were being persecuted and feared for their physical safety. It was also a time of social upheaval and political unrest due, in part, to the stagnant economy of the 1970s. A man could grow a ponytail in middle age, stand on a box on a street corner, and try to make a cohesive community out of a diffuse group of people who normally preferred to hide their identities. Harvey Milk created the "gay community", and his charisma and tireless activism turned them into a political force that spearheaded the campaign against California's Briggs Initiative.<br /><br />Other powerful gays in San Francisco presented themselves as ordinary citizens who happened to be gay, with the idea that that was a more inclusive image and smarter politics. Milk was more hot-headed and had a feel for the times. He would make the gay community a self-identified socio-political faction. Of course, there is the possibility that emphasizing their differences instead of their commonality with the average San Franciscan would ultimately be alienating. It makes me wonder how Milk, who openly approved of the pick-up culture, would have coped with the AIDS crisis had he lived to see it. Harvey Milk had his own way of doing politics, which "Milk" presents as heroic. That's not indisputable, but it was certainly effective, and Sean Penn's performance really conveys Milk's passion and charm.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009): Bonus features are 3 featurettes and some deleted scenes. "Remembering Harvey" (13 min) interviews people who knew Milk, many of whom are represented in the film, about their memory of him, his death, and his legacy. In "Hollywood Comes to San Francisco" (14 min), the screenwriter, producers, and cast talk about making the movie and their characters. "Marching for Equality" (8 min) interviews Cleve Jones and others who participated in several real marches in San Francisco that were recreated for the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Harvey Milk was an American politician, a visionary, and, in 1977, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office - as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He was also a staunch and effective activist for the civil rights of gays, lesbians, and consequently, for all Americans who deserve equal rights under our Constitution.<br /><br />Forty-something Milk, (played by Sean Penn in an Academy Award performance), an insurance salesman, and his companion, Scott Smith, (James Franco), moved from New York City to San Francisco in 1972. The couple set up house in the Castro District, a mecca for gays and hippies, where they opened a camera shop. This was before the AIDS epidemic descended upon the community and so tragically decimated their population. Harvey and Scott observed, and were subject to, increasing bigotry, attacks and physical intimidation, as more homosexuals came out of the closet. This vicious behavior took place not only in San Francisco but all over the US. Anti-gay sentiments were fueled by the likes of gospel singer Anita Bryant, known for her strong views against homosexuality and for her prominent campaigning in 1977 to repeal a local ordinance in Dade County, FL, that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Also, California State Senator John Briggs saw an opportunity in the Christian fundamentalists'  movement to attack Milk and all homosexuals, calling his hate mongering, "just politics." Milk organized not only the homosexual community, but other groups as well  - blacks, Hispanics, and Teamsters - to form coalitions against those who would oppress them.<br /><br />Tenacious to the cause, Harvey Milk ran for election numerous times, experiencing disappointment after disappointment. Ever optimistic, however, even after Scott left him due to an overdose of politics, Milk claimed, rightly so, that in each election his numbers went up significantly. Finally he won, serving as Supervisor, along with Senator-to-be Diane Feinstein, and Dan White, (Josh Brolin), a conservative from a neighboring Irish-Catholic district.<br /><br />After a series of personal and political conflicts, the increasingly erratic White shot and killed both Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk in their offices at City Hall in 1978. White was trying to rescind his resignation as supervisor and blamed the mayor and Milk for blocking his reinstatement. Harvey Milk, during his career on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, promoted larger and less expensive child care facilities, free public transportation, and the development of a board of civilians to oversee the police. He sponsored a civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, Milk's most important achievement was in helping to defeat Proposition 6, initiated by John Briggs. The proposed law would have made firing gay teachers - and any public school employees who supported gay rights - mandatory. Milk campaigned his heart out and debated Briggs on several occasions. One can only wonder what Harvey Milk would have accomplished had he lived just a few years longer.<br /><br />"Milk" is no ordinary biopic. It is a most powerful, stirring and intelligent film that ditches the usual docudrama format. Director Gus Van Sant, along with the extremely talented Sean Penn, and an outstanding supporting cast, have brought to life the energetic, charismatic, optimistic, loving, talented, extraordinary character who was Harvey Milk. Penn movingly reveals the vulnerable side of Milk, as well as demonstrates his self-deprecating humor. Harvey Milk's struggle to make people see what is wrong and do what is right is extremely moving, and his fiery oratory electrifying. The use of real historical footage infuses a sense of authenticity to the story.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie. I also recommend seeing the 1984 documentary "The Times Of Harvey Milk" directed and written by Rob Epstein.<br />Jana Perskie<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Y4LDW">The Times of Harvey Milk 1984</a></p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Milk" is one of the best and most devastating movies I have seen in this decade. Harvey Milk is beautifully portrayed by Sean Penn in an absolutely flawless performance. The film is photographed with great sensitivity and power using some footage from the period. An activist who changed the gay world forever, Milk had a personal life that was severely challenged by his public political stands. The movie spends a great deal of time filling in the details of Milk as a person and a lover. It doesn't shirk from showing his erotic gay side.<br /> The movie makes him a martyr, but so was Martin Luther King, Gandhi and so were many others who defied contemporary morals and ethics. The film is very good at portraying the organization of political lieutenants that Milk built up. It makes Milk funny, vulnerable, driven, sympathetic, and has examples of the oratory he used to sway his advocates. If there is a villain in the piece it is Anita Bryant who had an agenda of prejudice and hate that motivated Milk and his allies. White, Milk's killer, is portrayed as a deeply troubled man who was predetermined by destiny to cut down his rival.<br /> The movie depicts the birth of the Castro in San Francisco as a gay area. Milk was one of the first merchants there with his camera store. He learned the power of organization by starting a gay owners' association which rivaled the straight merchants' groups.<br /> This film gives everything a sense of urgency and intensity which adds to its power. You feel as if you are living his life with him.<br /> For those who did not live through the Milk era this is a history lesson, but it also does a fine job of delineating any kind of political activist. It may seem to some as too sympathetic a portrayal, creating a picture of a man that was almost too "good" to be true but his failures in personal relationships and single-mindedness correct that view of a man without flaws. Sean Penn has, in a series of difficult roles, developed into a fine screen actor, versatile, protean, and capable of conveying great emotion and power. A superior movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Milk' is the story of Harvey Milk who was the first openly gay man elected to political office in America. Set in the seventies this film explores gay rights issues in San Francisco and America in general and the opposition Milk experienced to his candidacy and the issues he fought for. With a great cast and another amazing performance from Sean Penn, this film quickly draws you in and keeps you watching until the shattering conclusion. Penn's acting seems to get better with each film he makes and from once being the bad boy of Hollywood he is now a credible and highly respected actor/director and rightly so in my opinion. This also has note worthy performances from Emile Hirsh and Josh Brolin. Milk's development from Haight area hippy to vocal activist and politician is shown excellently and makes for fascinating viewing even if you aren't interested in politics or gay rights issues. For a powerful storyline, that is all the more potent for being true, this film is well worth considering. It is well acted, well directed and has a crushing conclusion that you will leave you speechless and affected.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>A great story of how a gay person in the 1970s gets elected to political office in San Francisco, and the hard times gays endured to get their voices heard.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Movie based upon the true story of Harvey Milk.<br />  Story begins in 1970 when Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) meets Scott Smith (James Franco).

He decides to make a list of gay people that go to the shops and banks and call them to let them know about their new shop where gay people are welcomed.<br />  Harvey becomes business-friendly.  Some shop-owners like him, others do not.  The shops that liked gay customers "thrived", the shops that didn't--went out of business.<br />  After their was a riot in San Francisco because of the hatred towards homosexuals, Harvey, one day, announces his candidacy for City Supervisor.<br />Finding it hard to get a sponsor, he lost the election. He tried a second time in 1975, this time with a make-over, a haircut and a new suit. He lost again, but received more votes than ever before. In 1976, he ran for State Assembly. He lost. Very disappointed, he was talked into running for City Supervisor again, however, this time, he did not have the support and love from his boyfriend, Scott. He leaves him.<br />  With the help of a new Campaign Manager, Ann Kronenberg (Alison Pill) and the pleasure of a new boyfirend, Jack (Diego Luna), in 1977, he finally wins.<br />  He does what he can to pass the first gay rights law.<br />  This is his ture story.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Emile Hirsch, Joseph Cross, Stephen Spinella, Lucas Grabeel, Brandon Bryce, Howard Rosenman, Kelvin Yu, Mark Martinez.<br /><br />  The real Cleve Jones, Carol Ruth Silver, Tom Ammiano, Danny Nicoletta, who know Harvey Milk personally, make cameo appearances in the movie.<br /><br />  Real archive footage of Diane Feinstein, Anita Bryant, Tom Brokaw, Walter Cronkite, Ronald reagan, Jerry Brown, President Jimmy Carter and they way the Castro looked back then is used.<br />  The actual building that was "Castro Camera" was re-dressed and used in the filming, as well as, Harvey Milk's actual apartment.<br /><br />  Nominated for 8 Academy Awards, Best Picture, Directing- Gus Van Sant, Editing, Costume Design, Music, Supporting Actor- Josh Brolin.<br />  Sean Penn won for Best Actor.

Over 30 years later, gay people are still fighting for the right to live, to be able to work without discrimination and to have insurance and benefits. The right to be a home-owner. Gay people, male & female, can be productive human beings in society too, regardless of who they choose as a life partner or what they do in the privacy of their own home or out in public socially with someone.  Even in 2010, gay people are still being discriminated against.<br /><br />In 1975, Willie Lewis Brown Jr, authorized the bill that legalized homosexuality in California.<br /><br /> You might also enjoy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Y4LDW">The Times of Harvey Milk (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a> (1984).</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Wow!  I had my doubts about this, especially with Sean Penn, but I have to say that I was really surprised.  Not only does Penn become Harvey Milk, but the whole cast is superb.  Every performance is excellent particularly Emil Hirsch, Josh Brolin and James Franco. (the only odd one is Dieago Luna who, for some reason reminded me of Stephen Rea in Interview with a Vampire).<br /><br />VanSant does a spectactular job incorporating the historical footage without disrupting the flow of the film.  He manages to pull together a moving and inspiring portrait of people in a time when complacency was not the answer.<br /><br />I hope this does a bit to inspire more people to action today.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>How fortuitous a thing is timing.  Released only a few weeks after the passage of Proposition 8 - a ballot measure that took away the rights of same-sex couples to marry in California - Gus Van Sant's Oscar-nominated film "Milk" turns back the clock to another, similar struggle in American civil rights history and to the iconic figure who most helped to wage it.<br /><br />Harvey Milk was, of course, the San Francisco supervisor and gay-rights pioneer who, along with Mayor George Moscone, was gunned down in city hall in November 1978. The perpetrator, Dan White, a disgruntled fellow board member who had recently resigned his seat, was found guilty of manslaughter (using the now infamous "Twinkie Defense" to get the lower charge), sent to prison for a mere five years, then released in 1984, only to take his own life two years later.<br /><br />Dustin Lance Black's Oscar-winning screenplay traces Milk's meteoric rise from an obscure, still largely closeted Republican businessman in the early 1970s to the de facto leader of the gay-rights movement that began to take shape during that decade.  He became the first openly gay man in the state to be elected to public office and, in 1978, he was instrumental in helping to defeat Proposition 6, which, if passed, would have made it illegal for homosexuals - and even straight supporters of homosexuals! - to teach in California public schools (could this really have been only thirty years ago?).  Throughout all this, Milk managed to develop a large, highly charged grass roots organization, the purpose of which was not merely to combat bigotry wherever it reared its ugly head but to win over the hearts and minds of the people in their own community and the nation as a whole.<br /><br />There has been some criticism leveled against the movie that it is too reverential in its treatment of Milk, that it paints him too much as a saint and not enough as an ordinary human being with the requisite number of weaknesses and flaws to make him truly viable as a character.  Even if one were to accept that charge (which I do not), it still doesn't take into account the very special quality that Sean Penn himself brings to the role.  With obviously heightened mannerisms that he is careful never to allow to slide over into caricature or camp, Penn makes Milk both charismatically larger-than-life and recognizably human at one and the same time.  Whether he's in front of a crowd rallying the troops with his megaphone or enjoying a tender moment with his longtime boyfriend, Scott Smith, Penn allows us to see the many facets of this obviously complex man.<br /><br />In a movie chock full of outstanding supporting performances, James Franco as Smith, Josh Brolin as Dan White, and Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones, a rootless young man inspired by Milk to become a lifelong activist, are the obvious standouts.<br /><br />As a director, Van Sant keeps things moving at an almost whirlwind pace, beautifully balancing the "big" scenes of rallies and marches with the more intimate moments depicting Milk's relationships with those around him.  At times Van Sant brings an almost documentary-style immediacy to the film, seamlessly blending actual footage from that era (much of it of Anita Bryant and her anti-gay crusade) with convincingly staged re-enactments of events at that time.  Obviously wanting to end on a positive note, the movie mentions but does not dramatize the "White Night Riots" which took place in the city following the assassinations, instead focusing on the enormous candlelight march that wended its way through the shocked and devastated city.  Thus, the ending, like the movie itself, is a necessary and deeply moving reminder of how the courage of one individual to stand up for what he knows is right can inspire others to follow in his footsteps - and change the world in the process.<br /><br />By opening with file footage of men being arrested at a gay bar then carted off in paddy wagons to be booked as "sex offenders," "Milk" makes the viewer realize how very far society has come in the time since the events depicted in this story - and, with the recent passage of Proposition 8, how very far it still has to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>MILK is one of those hot-button topics that divides our great country. The Evangelical Right sees it as their duty to dictate God's word here on Earth. The Leftists see any form of censorship or denying of rights as an affront to all things human and a threat to the Constitution. What's tough about this particular film is that it's a political minefield, rife with ideologues that want to press the issue of human rights. And why not. Many films have done this. But coming off the heals of Proposition 8 (California's ban on gay marriage) this subject is ready to boil over into a full-on war amongst the two opposing sides.<br /><br />The big question now is how to view this movie (and it is a movie, not a documentary) without blasting one side or the other, and thus falling into a political tirade. That's a challenge. And I've seen many film reviewers fail (Hell I might even fail! But I'm going to give it a shot anyway.)<br /><br />Harvey Milk (Sean Penn, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017APPSO">Persepolis</a>) moves to San Francisco's Castro District in early 1970 with lover Scott Smith (James Franco, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J9KJ2U">Pineapple Express</a>) and sets up a camera shop, where neighboring business men shun and threaten their gay lifestyle. Harvey, after witnessing the brutality of the local police force on gay men, decides to run for office. After three failed attempts and losing lover Scott, Harvey finally wins a seat as a city supervisor. Beside him is the down-on-his-luck supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011BE3K0">No Country for Old Men</a>). The two squabble and eventually - as history tells us - White kills both Harvey Milk and Mayor Moscone (Victor Garber).<br /><br />Harvey Milk's ability to rally friends around him that were dedicated to the cause of bringing the gay lifestyle out of the closet was shown with exceptional care and grace (perhaps too much since I've read some of Milk's past and this film glorifies him as the "Patron Saint of the Gays"). Without a doubt, Sean Penn deserved plenty of accolades and his Oscar win for Best Actor was both applauded by me and a bit of a letdown (I was rooting for Mickey Rourke in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOD9VI">The Wrestler</a>). Still, I'm happy that Mr. Penn's performance got adequate notice. He really pulled off a stunner.<br /><br />Likewise, the supporting cast were amazing. I didn't even recognize Emile Hirsch (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GMH8SI">Into the Wild</a>) as Cleve Jones! And Diego Luna's portrayal of the unbalanced Jack kept me uneasy about what he might do. Josh Brolin, of course, must get some notice as the failing Dan White. And Alison Pill as Anne Kronenberg was simply splendid.<br /><br />Director Gus Van Sant (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZXTS4">My Own Private Idaho</a>) did a great job of whisking us through Milk's early political failures and on to his successes. The incorporation of archival stock footage of the times added a surreal quality to the film, making it seem almost docu-drama in nature.<br /><br />Now, what to say about the politics of the film. It certainly wants you to empathize with the rights (or lack thereof) of gays in the U.S.. That is, after all, the message Harvey Milk was trying to get across. So if you're of the "let no man lay down beside another man" mentality, don't say you haven't been warned. This movie is about the life of one man who's entire existence was dedicated to giving equal rights to gays, so that's the message that gets spilled. But if you're in to great stories about interesting figures, this one will certainly please.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>The Mrs. And I viewed "Milk" last night and we both liked it, but I think with different degrees of appreciation and for different reasons.<br /><br />We wanted to see all of the films nominated for major Academy Awards before the awards were announced, but we missed "Doubt", "The Wrestler" and "Milk".  We both thought Sean Penn was good in the role of Harvey Milk, but the Mrs. Opined "I'm not sure he deserved the Oscar... now we have to see The Wrestler. (To see the acclaimed performance of Mickey Roarke)"<br /><br />I'm not so certain, although I'll reserve personal judgment until seeing The Wrestler as well.  About thirty minutes before the ending of Milk I'm watching Sean Penn in a scene wearing a T-Shirt, meeting Denis O'Hare as California State Senator John Briggs.  It occurred to me "I can hardly believe this is the same actor from Mystic River.  Or Bad Boys.  Or Dead Man Walking."  You get the idea.  With the same body and face Penn was a completely different person.  The body language and voice even made him appear markedly different. I've seen reviews saying Penn becomes unrecognizable in this role as Harvey Milk.  I was always aware that I was watching Sean Penn - but I saw no flaws in this performance.<br /><br />Penn is ably supported by the almost all-male cast including Josh Brolin as fellow San Francisco Supervisor Dan White, James Franco as lover Scott Smith, Victor Garber as Mayor Moscone and Emile Hirsch as cruiser turned Gay activist Cleve Jones.  Alison Pill has the only significant female role as Anne Kronenberg, a political operative who is brought in after Milk fails a couple of campaigns because she is more macho than Milk's previous inner circle.  She obtains Harvey's first newspaper endorsement - a significant step.<br /><br />I was a child during the time this film was set, and the thought occurred to me "why should there be a politician whose entire political agenda is based on a non-majority sexual preference?"  Put another way - if a heterosexual person were running for office, would it be pertinent if their entire platform were based on their heterosexuality and their only agenda were the rights of heterosexuals?  The answer, of course, is that no serious political attempts have ever been made to remove the civil rights of heterosexuals.  If politicians are trying to take away your jobs, and even threatening people who support you, you have to fight back.<br /><br />(A side note: I think about the recent avalanche of laws trying to prevent same-sex marriage, and I wonder how far universal civil rights have advanced.  I recently voted against a measure in my home state that passed - defining marriage as only possible between one man and one woman.)<br /><br />We have come, perhaps, a few steps forward.  A few years ago I heard local radio talk shows paint "Brokeback Mountain" as the Gay Cowboy movie.  This year I don't recall a single discussion about the Gay Politician movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Milk begins with the death of its main character (de rigueur for every film in the genre since Gandhi), goes back to when he was a nobody, charts his rise to power and the unfortunate effect it had on his personal relationships (though this time the "long-suffering wife" character is a man!) and then sends him to heaven with the wings of martyrdom on his shoulders; this reluctance to rise above the formula of the execrable biopic genre (it even follows the tradition of naming the film as simply the character's surname) dooms the film to mediocrity despite good performances by Penn and a terrific Brolin.<br /><br />2.5/4</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This magnificent film follows the public career and private life of Harvey Milk, America's first openly gay elected official, from his decision to change his life at the age of 40 through his rise to national prominence until his assassination less than ten years later.  Through all of this, Gus Van Sant's film remains warm and intimate so that we never lose sight that at the heart of this movement were real, feeling, fallible, uncertain, often frightened human beings who rose to the challenge of insisting on their humanity in the face of overwhelming condemnation and persecution.  Much of the credit for this successful presentation goes to Sean Penn and the rest of the wonderful cast, notably including James Franco and Emile Hirch.  Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black also deserves praise.<br /><br />Like another recent film, "The Wrestler," much of its interest comes from the vivid depiction of its milieu, a world that will be very unfamiliar to most viewers--in this case, the evolution of San Francisco's Castro Street area into something like a gay Zion.  This is a powerful and important film.  If viewed with an open mind and open heart, one can hardly fail to be moved by our common humanity and saddened that so many are so cruel because they cannot recognize a kindred spirit.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>Great movie with Sean Penn and a bunch of other well-known actors acting as gay '70s men.

Not just as a great example of gay cinema done right, though it certainly is that. No, it stands on its own as a movie showing the portrait of a man who didn't intend to become political, wound up doing so, and ended up paying the ultimate price.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Milk and his boyfriend (James Franco), moving to San Francisco and promptly running into the kind of evil prejudice against gays that one would these days expect to see only at a CPAC meeting. This energizes and angers him to the point where he starts to get involved and begins his efforts to run for office. Initially his biggest enemies are the other prominent gays, but soon he's able to overcome and get elected, right in time to start a major fight with Anita Bryant and her crowd.<br /><br />Sadly his promising political career is cut short as another member of the San Francisco government guns down Milk and the mayor. He later plead not-guilty due to reasons of insanity, using the famous "Twinkie Defense", but it's pretty clear from what we see here that, no, he wasn't nuts; just another bigot who couldn't stand the gays and was really ticked when one of them, Milk, broke a political promise to him.<br /><br />Sean Penn gives the performance of his career as gay activist/politician Harvey Milk. He completely disappears into the role. At no point was I "aware" that I was just watching someone act, as often happens with films. No, he is extremely convincing and does an incredible job worthy of the Best Actor award he received for the role.<br /><br />The writing and directing are quite effective as well. This is the sort of movie that could've very quickly wound up being nothing more than a preachy screed in favor of gay rights, but thankfully it instead is something far more entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />Further I, as someone who is bisexual, gained new appreciation for the gay rights movement. I'm too young to remember what it was like during the 1970's for gays, but from this movie I now have an inkling, and I'm glad there were people like Milk who were around to fight against the monsters like Bryant and her bunch. Realistically the worse we face these days is fights over same-sex marriage, gay adoption and the right to serve in the military. What was fought for back then was a simple right to exist and this movie really brought home that point.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Penn does a great job, but the movie is no grabber.

Harvey Milk, the man honored by this superbly crafted film by writer Dustin Lance Black and directed by Gus Van Sant, is brought to life by Sean Penn in his most skilled performance of his fine career.  Not only is this movie an homage to Harvey Milk, but it is also a shaking reminder of the ferocious ongoing battle for Civil Rights.  Few viewers will come away from this  film untouched.<br /><br />The life of gay activist Harvey Milk is well known, as is his assassination as he finally reached a platform where his voice could be heard.  Black and Van Zant have wisely started the story with some black and white footage of the abuse of the gay population across the country and then ease into the biography by showing us Milk in New York, approaching his 40th birthday and  discovering Scott Smith (James Franco) as the beginning of not only a  tender partnership but also a change in Milk's drive to make a difference.  The climb to importance from his migration to Castro Street in San Francisco and the 'recruiting' of his clan (Emile Hirsch as Cleve Jones et al) and the struggles he faced in gaining acceptance of a minority group is the stuff of legends.<br /><br />Penn is extraordinary, but Franco, Hirsch, Josh Brolin  as Milk's assassin, and Diego Luna as the kinky Jack Lira turn in excellent performances.  Van Zant is unafraid to show the tenderness among his characters: it is satisfying to see prominent male actors take on roles that include same sex intimacy.  This is a film that deserves to enter the archives as one of the 'greats.'  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, March 09</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"That Harvey's questing spirit not only lives but soars in this movie is a gift from Sean Penn, who plays him for real instead of for show. Penn is a lion of an actor, but the tenderness he radiates here is revelatory.  His physical transformation is nothing compared to the way Penn gets at the core of the man, finding the source of his joy and pain. He disappears into Harvey with the artistry of an acting virtuoso. There's one word for Penn's performance: phenomenal." Peter Travers<br /><br />I remember hearing about the death of Harvery Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco-and I watched television with all of the Gay marches. But, somehow, I missed much of the Gay movement. I support Gays and their rights. I was married and stating to have children and it passed me by.  Sean Penn as Harvey Milk brought it home, up close and personal. I cannot say enough about Penn's extraordinary performance. He truly deserved the Oscar for best male performance. This film should be seen by every adult in America for a full understanding of the life and times of our Gay brothers and sisters. I cannot forget the film, it resonates within me.<br /><br />Sean Penn became Harvey Milk. His every movement, fleck of his hair or tug of his smile. James Franco as Scott, Harvey' lover is superb. Emile Hirsch, who played the lead role in Sean Penn's directing debut 'Into The Wild' plays Clem Jones, anactivist in the making. Alison Pill is the Lesbian campaign manager, and she is perfect in this role. Josh Brolin plays Supervisor White, and not for one minute would I have guessed who he was, if I had not seen the credits. Josh Brolin is an actor destined for big roles.  Gus Van Sant directs this phenomenon, he interjects footage from the real times in 1978 with present day filming of Harvey Milk in San Franscisco. And Anita Bryant- I was waiting for the pie in the face. She so perfectly personifies the sueprcilious and pompousness of the extreme right and their hatred and misunderstanding of homosexuals.<br /><br />'Milk' is a fitting Memorial for Harvey Milk. For all the generations who have walked the walk and fought the good fight, kudos to you. For those of you who missed the Gay Rights, start here and get in line. This is a film not to be missed.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob 03-10-09<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K0DQ">Dead Man Walking</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JMTI">The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MVWFAO">W.

This is the soul and essence of Harvey Milk, and of the times he lived in San Francisco. I lived there then. I remember it all so well. This is a fitting memorial to a courageous man.<br /><br />Sean Penn IS Harvey Milk, and Josh Brolin does a good job of depicting Dan White, he of the sugar neurosis/psychosis. The Twinkies Defense. Only Victor Garber does not look like Mayor Moscone. Sort of sounds like him, and does a credible job in the role for anyone who did not live in those times. Rather violent times, they were.<br /><br />The story opens with Harvey preparing to celebrate his 40th birthday. He's living in New York, selling insurance I believe it was, and thoroughly closeted. A handsome young man gives him a close brush in the subway stairway, and they strike up a conversation. It is clear that this encounter is one which functions as a signal for closeted gays, as they neither one have any doubts of the others intentions. Scott, the young man, helps Harvey celebrate his 40th birthday, and then decides to go with him to San Francisco to escape from his closet. (Apparently Scott never had been in one.)<br /><br />San Francisco, 1970. Homosexuality was still illegal, but a tolerance was traditional, and the Halloween night parade on Polk Street was famous for its flaming queens -- the only day of the year it was legal to wear drag in public. But Harvey rented a small store in the Castro, and helped the Castro neighborhood emerge as a gay haven. He ran a camera shop, but it was also a hang-out and eventually got deeply involved in Harvey's political campaigns.<br /><br />Harvey's politics were liberal, of course, as they would necessarily be. But that does not mean he had the backing of the Democratic Party, or even that portion of the party that was known to be gay. The editor of the Advocate, a gay rights newspaper, was not exactly closeted, but he down-played his gay life. Wore classy business suits and hob-nobbed with the Democratic Party elite. They couldn't handle Harvey's up-front, out-of-the-closet style.<br /><br />Harvey believed that gays should come out of the closet in order for people who thought that queers were some sort of dreadful monsters to learn that those who they worked with, the members of their families, churches, neighborhoods, included gays. One line he used all the time which was not much used in the movie was "We Are Everywhere," although the idea certainly was.<br /><br />He ran for city supervisor two or three times before the city changed to district voting for supervisors instead of the prior city-wide elections, where the top eight vote-getters throughout the city became supervisors. Harvey and his supporters also worked very hard on the campaign to change to district voting. That was the first I had heard of him. I lived near Polk Street, the older gay neighborhood, and was not very political. But when district voting began, we were all startled to find that the Castro was already well organized and had their candidate in place. And he won.<br /><br />The big fight at that time was the Briggs Initiative, Proposition 6, as I recall. Or perhaps 9. Anyway, the idea was to allow school boards to fire anyone who was gay OR anyone who supported a gay in the school faculty. Briggs was heavily backed by Anita Bryant, who was making a name for herself nationwide in her anti-gay campaign. We didn't know it at the time, but her husband had left her because he came out gay.<br /><br />Harvey organized the No on 6 campaign, and challenged Briggs to public debates. He was well informed, charming, amusing, and unflappable. Briggs was a stuffed shirt prude. His understanding of the gay community was much what was popular at the time: that since gays don't reproduce [oh, really?], they have to recruit. In one famous scene, Milk points out that he was raised by heterosexual parents, taught by heterosexual teachers, and lived in a straight world. How then did he become gay? He explained that if children really emulated their teachers that much, there would be a heck of a lot more nuns in the country!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dan White became the mayor of the middle-class Catholic neighborhood just to the south of the Castro. He was not only conservative, he was pretty religious, and an ex-fireman and ex-cop. He was also in over his head in accepting the position of supervisor, intellectually, emotionally and economically. He hated Harvey and everything he stood for. He asked Harvey to support an ordinance to raise the salaries of the supervisors, but would not trade a vote in favor of anything of importance to Harvey. Harvey thought the salary increase would be a bad idea, because they would be up for re-election and people would feel they were too greedy.<br /><br />Finally, when Dan White's ordinance for a pay increase was defeated, he resigned. Just after he handed in his resignation, the Police Union had a conference with him. After that, he asked Mayor Moscone to re-appoint him to the seat on the board he had just vacated, effectively rescinding his resignation. When Moscone refused to do so, White crawled in a window in the maintenance area of City Hall with a gun in his pocket. The rest you know; it was in all the news.<br /><br />The movie is based around a set of audio tapes that Milk had left with his effects, marked to be opened if he was assassinated. He knew he was a target, and frankly, may even have known that White was that unstable. He had gotten threats so many times during his political career that he simply accepted the idea that his was a risky position. He was right.<br /><br />This is a five-star movie, not only for its authenticity, but for its heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>The assassination of Harvey Milk and the mayor of SF happened in the late 70s and is a somewhat forgotten, though shocking, episode in the gay rights movement. This Sean Penn vehicle nicely brings it all back, and the result is high quality all down the line. Penn's performance is very good. He seems to be making a little specialty of these politically minded bio-pics. I also liked his "All the King's Men," though not everyone did. It's hard to remember just how rough gays had it only a few years ago, and in San Francisco, of all places.</p></br></body></html>

To think of the hapless aliens who mistake the televised adventures of the crew of U.S.S. Protector for actual deeds still makes me smile!  Tim Allen gives an inspired performance as the shoot-from-the-hip Kirk-like commander who mistakes the enemy they must face for a character in a fictitious scenario presented by fans of their canceled TV show.  Sigourney Weaver is charming as the sexy but operationally superfluous female officer.  Allen Rickman is hilarious as a British Shakespearian actor chafing under his ridiculous role as the obligatory (and latex-crowned) alien member of the crew.  An amusing minor character is the high school kid sci-fi geek who ultimately provides them with the essential details for their starship needed to triumph over their galactic enemies.  Don't miss the crash landing of their starship at a Sci-Fi convention--or Sigourney Weaver's new, improved, and cleavage-enhancing uniform!</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>One would expect that a movie like this would be bad, but it honestly isn't. I especially liked Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman in their roles. This movie is a mix of 'fake' sci-fi, as Tim Allen and his cast are actually just actors in a Star Trek-esque show, but there are real aliens in here who view that show as historical documents and thus seek out the Galaxy Quest cast for aid. Overall good movie with a fun story, two thumbs up!</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>Some actors think they are acting in a scenario where they fight some baddies but actually its real! Robert Downey Junior pretends he is a black character and Martin Shortt is a former childstar with a famed "quick draw." Ok, well, its Tropic Thunder and 3 Amigos which features the same plot, but this spoof out does them both. The humour is dry and the character observation spot on. I wonder if Bill Shatner has seen it and if he recognised himself in it. Rickman is wonderful as cynical "Dr Lazarus". The whole film is a little lads' fantasy and one that I'm sure appeals to us chaps in our adult world, who wouldn't want to be suddenly in command of a real star ship tasked with saving the Galaxy?<br /><br />What I particularly like is the reluctance of most of the actors to be associated with their work. I remember attending a conference and hosting Blackadder star Tony Robinson some years ago. The PR people had one word of instruction, we were under no circumstances to refer to him as "Balders" or "Baldrick" as he is particularly un-humorous when it comes to being associated with one of the best comic creations of recent times. Well, what else are you going to say to him?  Its true, je doesn't like being called Balders! He should have got a job on a checkout if that is his attitude! Humph.<br /><br /> This is one of those brilliantly watchable films you can safely add to your dvd collection as it can be watched many times and still be funny. Would highly recommend a double bill of Galaxy Quest and "Mystery Men" for an enjoyable "beers in/wife out" evening of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Galaxy Quest opened around Christmas 1999 against a lot of high profile movies. It never set any records, but it ran and ran and ran, eventually doing better than many of its competitors. It's easy to see why. It's mindless and daffy, yet also amiable and funny. It's the gentlest of satires. It does not aspire to greatness. It aspires to entertain, and that it does. <p>The title refers to a fictional TV show about space travel and conquest, and it seems suspiciously like Star Trek. The movie opens with the has- been cast of the show, which ended twenty years ago, at a convention of fans. Most of the actors are there for the money and not for the geeky, obsessed fans. The exception is Jason Nesmith [Tim Allen], who played Commander Peter Taggart. Nesmith tries hard not to ruin the fans' fantasies. One group actually tells him they are there to enlist the crew in saving their planet, and he atiently plays along. Later, in the men's room, Nesmith overhears two kids talking about how sad and stupid the cast and the fans are. Crushed, he flees the convention and goes home, where he promptly consumes a great deal of whiskey. The next morning finds him passed out on his living room floor. Outside the sliding glass door, the same weird group that wanted him to help them is knocking on the glass. In a fog, he lets them in. One thing leads to another, and he discovers that they really ARE aliens. They think that the TV show is real, a historical record of real events. Apparently these aliens have no imaginations, and when they recorded the show's TV signal, the idea that the information might be false never crossed their minds. Oh, how earthling advertisers would love this crowd!<p>It isn't long before Nesmith and the aliens have enlisted the rest of the stars - Lt. Tawny Madison [Sigourney Weaver], Dr. Lazurus [Alan Rickman], Tech. Sgt. Chen [Tony Shalhoub], and even an extra, Crew Member 6 [Sam Rockwell]. This group of very earthbound people suddenly finds itself in outer space aboard a craft that is based on their old TV show sets. What are they supposed to do? How can they work instruments that never really existed or combat monsters and aliens which are not actors in costumes? The answers they come up with help make this one of the funnier comedies in recent memory.<p>Allen and Weaver are perfectly cast, for who would be better in this parody than the fumbling star of Home Improvement and the heroine of the Aliens movies? What could be funnier than to have Alan Rickman basically reprise his role as Col. Brandon in Sense and Sensibility, only this time in space? What could be more clever than to include an extra, who spends the entire movie knowing he's going to die in the next ten minutes because that's what happened on the TV show? And the aliens? They are hysterical to watch. Theier actual body shapes resemble giant squids, but they have the ability to transform into human-looking beings. Only problem is that they can't quite get the body movements down right, not to mention the voices.<p>I think it must be hard to make a movie that's just plain fun, but Galaxy Quest succeeds nearly all the time. Frankly, I was never much of a Star Trek or a Star Wars fan. I appreciated their appeal but never got caught up in the fantasies. I enjoyed this movie immensely, even though most of the in jokes were lost on me. I can only imagine how appealing it must be to people who are more informed about the things it parodies than I am.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>Wow, a sci-fi spoof that not only pokes fun at sci-fi/space opera shows, but also takes aim at the fans and conventions! It even goes after the actor's love/hate relationships with each other. Much like the original Trek crew's general dislike of William Shatner, the broken-down thespians of "GalaxyQuest" don't particularly care for the attitude of the `captain' (Tim Allen). Then there's the `crushy, chompy things' scene that rags on space opera shows' more implausible plot devices &amp; gimmicks used to add suspense to the adventure. There's even a `Thermian' language track (a very annoying language to listen to after 30 seconds, BTW), which I'm sure is a take-off of the unbelievable popularity of the Klingon tongue; a language that's actually taught at some colleges no less!<p>Although `Star Trek' is never mentioned in the movie or `making of' documentary, its influence can definitely be seen, especially by one who's immersed him/herself in the sci-fi/space opera culture, and has hit a few geek conventions. The con clips of the "Galaxy Quest" show had the exact look and style of the original series episodes. The cardboard bridge, the paper-mache rocks that made up the `planetbound' scenes- it's all too familiar to the hardcore Trekkie. They even take a shot at the NextGen show, with a (then) twelve-year-old flying the ship a la Wesley Crusher! And the NSEA Protector looks like it could fit right in with any other ship in the UFP's Starfleet. All in all, "Galaxy Quest" is a really good poke at `Trek's look and style, yet done in a way that also pays tribute to the show and its subsequent space-opera competitors &amp; spin-offs.<p>I was also amazed by make-up/creature FX designer Stan Winston's work on this flick. Winston combines the various E.T.s' other-worldly `realism' with a just a smidge of cartoonish Muppet-style silliness to make them look real, yet unreal at the same time. General Sarris and his minions exemplified this look to a T: threateningly deadly, yet yet a tad silly-looking, too. The pig-lizard thingy and the Thermians' `true' appearances also displayed a neat combo of strange and ridiculous.<p>As for features &amp; extras, this offering has all that one would pretty much expect from a big-budget digital video release. The picture &amp; sound clarity are top-notch. And of course it's in widescreen so you can see the whole thing without missing what's on the right and left. Then there's the usual theatrical trailer &amp; cast/crew career bios &amp; production notes thrown in. Of course, ther's also those things that aren't always present in every DVD release, such as outtakes, cut scenes, and a secondary dialogue track (the aforementioned Thermian dub). I found most of the cut scenes rather amusing, and I was disappointed that many of them weren't restored to the movie itself. Some of them, however, had incomplete CGI effects, and a few were alternate scenes with different outcomes from what was shown in the movie, which likely made it hard for the DreamWorks powers-that-be to pick &amp; choose between what should be restored and what should not. Oh well...<p>`Late</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>Sometimes when I write a review and give five stars I pause. After all 5 stars makes a picture equal to THE GODFATHER or GONE WITH THE WIND, and BEN HUR etc. Thus when you have a light film such as GALAXY QUEST I think, &quot;Can I really make this movie equal to them?&quot;<p>The answer is easy: Most people don't watch movies for artistic merrits (Stop fainting you cultured ones) we watch it to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, in fact if you are not a SCIFI fan you will find it even funnier.<p>The plot is classic, every American knows somebody who goves a little overborad with their fandom (on any subject.) We joke about the actors who are typecast so we know this movie almost before we see it.<p>The characters are great, and the performances wonderful.  (This is the closest thing to a sympathetic role that Alan Rickman has ever had.) Sam Rockwell almost steals the show with some great lines:<br /> &quot;Didn't you even watch the show?&quot;<br />They may seem harmless now but in a second the'll turn mean and they'll be thousands of em.&quot;<br /> &quot;I'm the crewman who always dies to show the problem is serious!&quot;<br /> Sigorney Weaver however has the best one, when confronted with something she has to do because it was on the show:<p> &quot;Well I'm not doing it this episode was badly written.&quot;<p>You can't help but smile here.  Even the actors must have been tickled by that.  She is also a parody of herself in the big chace scene near the end as her front zipper gets lower and lower.  It is unclear if it is a parody of that situation on every Sci-Fi series or if it's just to show her clevage which is still attractive at age 50.<p>In the end Tim Allen and crew of course as humans always do adapt and succeed. It's a fun journey, that actually reminds me of Gilligan's Island, (which of course gets a plug here.) it that its a story of Americans who can make it anywhere.<p>Its clean, its fun and will bring you up, buy it and watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A32DTCFBBB9WIV.html">A32DTCFBBB9WIV</a><br/><p>THis is what comedies are all about. This movie is an example of how a comedy can be really great. The cast is in top notch performance, the special effects are fantastic but not overwhelms the movie, God, everything is fantastic here. You can see clearly that all the actors,. the director, everyone involved believe in what they are doing and are havin fun doing it. Congratulations !!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I don't know why, but I didn't see this movie until after it had come out on video.  I certainly missed out on seeing it on the big screen.  It was by NO MEANS a masterpiece, but being a 'Trekkie' myself, it was easy to see the obvious similarities to Star Trek and how SOME (but by no means all) of the fans practically see the show as REALITY.  Not just funny, but if you consider yourself a pretty hard-nosed Trek fan, you will either find it hilarious or an incredible insult.<p>Tim Allen is absolutely PERFECT as the Captain from a Sci-Fi series from I would guess the late 70's to early 80's.  Since the cancellation of the series, he as well as the rest of the major characters from the series are herded from one sci-fi convention to another for a chance to sign autographs for the fans of the show that are, let's face it: so INTO it that they have memorized entire episodes and come dressed as their favorite characters.  These folks lives pretty much revolve around this show, and those who acted IN it.  But like the loveable James T. Kirk, Tim Allen is despised by the other actors because of his arrogance towards the supporting characters and nobody is more surprised than he when honest-to-goodness aliens arrive seeking help from him and his crew to save their entire civilization.<p>This group of advanced aliens are gentle, peace-loving squid-like creatures that have intercepted 'Galaxy Quest' as it was broadcast and went beyond the reaches of our Solar System and<p>being naive as they are, actually believe this TV series to be the REAL THING--even more so than the most hard-core TV fan on earth.  They ACTUALLY believe that the crew will assist them to battle an enemy who wants to destroy our peace-loving squids, well decimate the entire race, actually.  It all is full of laughs and incredible situations which they amazingly escape from (just like the characters from the TV show...imagine THAT!) and with tongue planted firmly in cheek 'Galaxy Quest' never takes itself too seriously.  If you are a Trekkie, you are in for a real treat.  If you just casually enjoy sci-fi movies, you should get a kick outta this...but if you totally dislike these kinds of films, you may want to check out something else--but I STILL think its worth a look.  All in all a fantastic and funny romp through the Universe.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>This is a delightful movie, full of the kind of overboard heroics, histrionics and mayhem that made STAR TREK as popular as it was.  Seeing the conventions with all the GALAXY QUEST questies is so incredibly ironic.  But what makes this movie work is the superb direction and acting that manages to bring such wonderful life and credibility to its pedestrian plot.  Although the idea of having actors forced to do the real thing is far above pedestrian, so forget that comment!  It's a good plot.  <p>Tim Allen is wonderful as the Shatneresque hero who uses his egotistical bravado to commandeer the Thermian's ship.  And yes, it's funny how he loses his shirt to the rock monster!  Sigourney Weaver, a simply amazing and versatile actress, shines as Tawny, the blonde airhead who repeats everything the computer says.  (She's quite dishy too as a blonde!).  Alan Rickman is wryly humorous as the serious actor who abhors his role, but comes through solidly when necessary.  A marvelous performance.  Sam Rockwell as the only non-series persona is hilarious as the actor who knows he's gonna get killed because he's just a &quot;guest star.&quot;  Tony Shalhoub is great as Fred, too.  The entire cast of Thermians is delightful in their innocence and awe of the actors who they think are the real thing!<br />It's a fun out of this world comedy and one of the best spoofs in a long time.<br />Relax and enjoy!!!!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I recently re-watched GALAXY QUEST after a roughly decade long hiatus.  I think it may have gotten even better with time.  If you wanted to make a movie spoofing the original STAR TREK series and the cultural phenomenon it has become...you simply couldn't do better than this film.  It pokes fun of the genre, the cast, the fans, the cheesiness and the conventions.  Often, rather pointed jabs.  But it's infused with real affection, and it even tells a pretty exciting and moving story of its own.<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest" was the name of a `60s TV series that looks an awful lot like STAR TREK, the original series.  You've got the handsome, womanizing captain whose shirt is often ripped off to expose a glistening bare torso (Tim Allen), you've got the token woman working on the bridge, whose only job is to repeat the things the computer is saying outloud already (Sigourney Weaver), the alien with the serious demeanor and no sense of humor (Alan Rickman), and even the guy without a name who always beams down to the planet and gets killed in the opening few minutes (Sam Rockwell).  And while Engineer Scotty isn't directly spoofed, you've got Tony Shaloub as the blissed-out, mellow actor who once filled that role.<br /><br />Twenty years later, these actors have little to do but make paid appearances at conventions, in costume.  Some absolutely hate it (Rickman), others tolerate it and for Allen, it's the highlight of his life...although at home, he's a hopeless lush.  These old cast members can barely stand each other, and lord knows they are pretty sick of never getting to do anything else.<br /><br />Turns out, though, that the broadcasts of their shows have traveled through space and been intercepted by an alien race on a distant planet.  These aliens, however, think the broadcasts are "historical documents" and they create the science needed to perfectly replicate what they see on the show.  And now these gentle aliens are in trouble and so travel to earth to enlist the help of their old heroes...the cast of "Galaxy Quest."<br /><br />I won't say much about the plot, except to note that it plays out much like a Star Trek episode...it's a legitimate adventure story, coupled with a great spoof.  Will our weary cast members rise to the challenge?  Will they find redemption?  Can you guess the answer?  And because you can guess...your enjoyment should actually be enhanced, because the film finds delightful ways to surprise you throughout.<br /><br />The script is very good.  The jokes aren't exactly Oscar quality...but neither are they cheap.  The film takes the time to develop real characters...and is careful to make the aliens quite unique themselves.  These aren't just cookie-cutter aliens designed to fill the needs of the plot.  We can actually see how these actors might actually take a liking to these aliens.<br /><br />And if the script is good, the cast is GREAT.  This is a modest film, overall (even though the special effect still look pretty good even today)...but these actors are clearly fully engaged in what they're doing.  Weaver is hilarious, really spoofing both Star Trek and Ellen Ripley.  Often, I find Weaver to be a bit tight as an actress...very good, but lacking a breezy quality.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's relaxed and having great fun.  Shaloub is a delight, stealing most of the scenes he's in.  Sam Rockwell takes his manic energy and puts it to perfect use...he's convinced that he's destined to be "that guy who dies on that planet."  Rickman is droll and understated.  At first, his character is seething with resentment at having to wear that awful makeup and say those stupid lines.  Watching his gradual growth is a subtle pleasure of the film.  And Tim Allen (outside of his great voicework in the TOY STORY films) may actually give his most credible film performance here.  He's not a great actor, nor even a particularly adept comic...but this role is almost custom-fitted to him.  He only has to be "serious" a little bit, and he can handle it.  He is called on to be glib and self-mocking...and is able to muster than quite readily.<br /><br />GALAXY QUEST was a real treat to revisit, and I heartily recommend it for either a repeat viewing or a first time adventure...particularly if you're familiar with what it is spoofing!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>A little disclaimer: I held a little prejudice going into this movie; I do not like Tim Allen as a general rule. When this movie came out, I have to say that I wasn't interested at all. I wasn't into Star Trek, which this movie largely riffs on, and the movie looked cheesy from the initial trailers I saw. Add to that the fact that Tim Allen received top billing, and you might as well count the movie down for the count with me. But after hearing great word of mouth and seeing great reviews, I decided to put aside my prejudices when the blu-ray of the film was released recently.<br /><br />Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) are the crew of a now defunct 80's sci-fi television show called Galaxy Quest. Relegated to appearances at fan conferences and the like, answering inane questions about the show, and repeating lines from the show they wish people would forget ("By Grabthar's hammer, by the sons of Worvan, you shall be avenged...") everyone is dealing with the fact that they are washed up has-beens living in the past and ready to throw in the towel. Just as their life seems meaningless a race of aliens asks for their help, thinking they are a real ship's crew, and the show is their "historical documents."<br /><br /> I definitely made the right choice in finally giving the movie a try. Like recent "spoof" movies like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Galaxy Quest mixes reverance and spoof with great characterizations and an amazing plot to create a hilarious and fun riff of the sci-fi genre. Written by David Howard and directed by Dean Parisot, Galaxy Quest utilizes homages to movies and TV series from Star Trek to Star Wars to get the feeling of real sci-fi films, knowing when, and when not, to take itself seriously. Not only does this help to amp up the comedy, but it also gives us characters we can believe when they're thrown into extraordinary situations.<br /><br />The casting is phenomenal, making for a diverse, funny, and well acted movie. The true stand outs in the film are Alan Rickman as a thespian who used to actually be a respected actor, but is now stuck spewing ridiculous catch phrases for fanboys and being upstaged by the Shatneresque Jason Nesmith; and Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, a throwaway former cast member who died on his only episode of the show that is consistently worried throughout the movie that he's going to die in real life because he died on the show. Naturally, though, the whole cast is stunning, as could be noted by the pedigree of acting included here.<br /><br />If I had one quibble with the movie, though, it would have to be the way the alien race is portrayed. I know they're not even humanoid creatures, but when they take the appearance of being human they could have been a little more natural, and not as stiff, or, dare I say it, annoying. They get better throughout the course of the movie, but they are still more or less caricatures throughout the movie and should have been just a little more fleshed out.<br /><br />All in all I have to say that the film was extremely enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, or well done comedy spoofs, you're almost guaranteed to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>In December of 1999, director Dean Parisot unleashed what is arguably the funniest sci-fi/comedy film of all time, "Galaxy Quest", which focuses upon the dissatisfied lives of five actors who had starred in a long-cancelled sci-fi television series of the same name.  Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) played ship's captain Commander Peter Quincey Taggart.  Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver, who is no stranger to sci-fi with her roles in the "Alien" films) played Lt. Madison.  Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman, also known for his roles as Hans Gruber in the 1988 film "Die Hard" and Professor Snape in the two "Harry Potter" films) played Dr. Lazarus.  Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) played ship's engineer Tech Sgt. Chen and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) played ship's pilot Laredo.  Following the cancellation of the TV series, none of the actors had found descent acting jobs. Instead, they were relegated to appearing occasionally as their former "Galaxy Quest" characters at fan conventions and infrequent commercials.  Especially frustrated is Alexander Dane, a trained Shakespearean actor who cannot escape the stigma of having said those immortal words, "By Grabthar's hammer, by the suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!"<p>The film begins at a "Galaxy Quest" convention where the quintet is preparing to appear.  Unbeknownst to them, not all of the conventioneers dressed as aliens are pretending.  A group of uniformed "aliens" approach Jason (dressed as Commander Taggart) saying that they are in dire need of his assistance.  Jason quickly agrees and assumes that the group is planning to pay him to appear as Commander Taggart at a fan-function.  Following a night of drinking at his home, the "aliens" arrive in a limousine (per Jason's request) to escort him to their function.  The "aliens", calling themselves Thermians, are Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees) and Laliari (Missi Pyle).  While en route to their function, Teb recites the lengthy history of Thermia to Jason, but Jason (who has a hangover) falls asleep.  (Jason doesn't take the Thermians seriously; instead believing that they are simply "Galaxy Quest" fans.)  Jason awakens to what he believes is a very elaborate set mimicking the NSEA Protector from the "Galaxy Quest" show. Mathesar (who always refers to Jason as Commander Taggart) tells him that the Thermians want him to negotiate a peace treaty with General Sarris (Robin Sachs).  Instead, "Commander Taggart" orders the Thermians to fire upon Sarris' ship.  Assuming that he has completed his performance, Jason tells Mathesar that he is ready to return home.  Mathesar escorts him to an empty room and leaves.  Jason, not understanding what is happening, is suddenly enveloped within a strange substance and raised to the ship's exterior where he sees millions of stars in deep space.  He is suddenly shot from the ship, then finds himself standing next to his swimming pool at home.  Jason finally realizes that the Thermians are real extraterrestrials, and that they mistakenly regard the "Galaxy Quest" show (which they received in deep space) as being historical fact.<p>The other four "Galaxy Quest" actors are busy filming a commercial for the opening of an electronics store and are disgusted because Jason isn't there.  Jason arrives late and tells them about his experience with the Thermians, but they think he has lost his mind.  Jason tells them that the Thermians want him to return and that he wants them to come also.  They initially reject it, but change their minds when they mistakenly believe that it's a paying job.  Gwen, Alexander, Fred and Tommy are whisked away to the Thermian's NSEA Protector, along with another actor named Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), who had played a bit part on the original "Galaxy Quest" show.  With that, the most important role for each of the washed up "Galaxy Quest" actors begins!<p>Dean Parisot, along with writers David Howard and Robert Gordon, created a brilliant and engaging spoof of the show "Star Trek", its conventions and trekkies with "Galaxy Quest".  Tim Allen equated with William Shatner (Kirk), Alan Rickman with Leonard Nimoy (Spock), Sigourney Weaver with Nichelle Nichols (Uhura), Tony Shalhoub with James Doohan (Scotty) and Daryl Mitchell with George Takei (Sulu).  Other sci-fi comedy spoof that predate "Galaxy Quest" (such as "Ice Pirates", "Pluto Nash" and "Spaceballs") are no where near as good, engaging or funny.<p>All of the actors in "Galaxy Quest" performed their roles exceptionally well.  Two actor who played significant minor roles were Patrick Breen, who played the Thermian named Quelleck, and Jeremy Howard, who played the young and very helpful "Galaxy Quest" fan named Kyle.<p>I highly recommend purchasing "Galaxy Quest" on DVD, which has superior picture and sound quality, and includes several deleted scenes, trailers, biographies, the feature "On Location in Space" and production notes.  "Galaxy Quest" is a film that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  Sit back and remember those immortal words, "Never give up! Never surrender!" as you are whisked away into the fantastic world of "Galaxy Quest"!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>When the entertainment industry pokes fun at itself sincerely, the results can be hilarious.  Such is the case with the cornball science fantasy movie "Galaxy Quest."<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest" was a science fiction television show with more than a passing similarity to "Star Trek."  As with the latter show, "Galaxy Quest" was cancelled.  Now the dispirited actors seem doomed to an endless cycle of overzealous fans at "Galaxy Quest" conventions.  Adding to the actor's torment is the attitude of Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the show.  Nesmith's cheery attitude and self-importance have worn thin on his fellow cast mates, Gwen Demarco as sexy Lt. Tawny Madison (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane as brainy Dr. Lazarus (Alan Rickman), and Fred Kwan as Tech Sgt. Chen (Tony Shalhoub).<br /><br />Interrupting their doldrums is a group of individuals who would appear weird to anyone outside a science fiction convention.  As members of the convention they appear to be about as strange, or normal, depending on your point of view, as anyone else.  However, Jason Nesmith soon learns that this strange foursome is more than they seem as they spirit him off to their genuine spaceship, NSEA Protector.<br /><br />At first Jason is somewhat excited at the opportunity to be on a genuine spaceship, and eventually brings the rest of the crew, including bit part player Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), back to the ship with him.  However, the aliens crewing the ship, the Thermians, have a very real, very ruthless nemesis to contend with, and the former crew of "Galaxy Quest" discover they are out of their depth.<br /><br />The Thermians brought the crew of "Galaxy Quest" on board because they discovered certain "historical documents" that were transmitted into space many years earlier.  The somewhat innocent, though highly intelligent and creative, Thermians were unable to recognize the television show "Galaxy Quest" as being make-believe.<br /><br />The movie moves forward with a number of creative and often humorous moments, alternating between hilarity and seriousness, with even a few moments of compassion.  Every clich&eacute; and stereotype from the original "Star Trek" is exploited for a laugh.  In the climax the actors rely on hardcore fans for their in-depth knowledge of the show to save them.  It is difficult to avoid enjoying the ending, even if you are not a fan of science fiction.<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest" is an excellent companion movie to the original "Star Trek" television series.  Even non-Trek fans will pick up on most of the gags.  There is a lot of action and you can expect the usual implausibilities that tend to accompany television science fiction.  However, the results are humorous and enjoyable.  You will find this movie worth more than one watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>In 1999, "Galaxy Quest" was a film that surprised many sci fi fans when it was released to theaters.  At first, many people were not sure if it would be a parody to "STAR TREK" but in the end, the film was actually paying homage to the popular television series.<br /><br />The film is directed by television director David Parisot (who directed shows such as "Curb Your Enthusiasm", "Monk", "ER" and many other series) and is based on a story by David Howard and a screenplay co-written with Ric McElvin ("Men in Black II" , "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events" and "Addicted to Love", etc.).<br /><br />The film has received praise from Star Trek alumni such as George Takei, Jonathan Frakes, Patrick Stewart and Will Wheaton and has received nearly all positive reviews from film critics upon its release in theaters back in 1999.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition" has been digitally remastered for this DELUXE EDITION/10th Year release.  I haven't done any comparisons to my original 2000 DVD version of the film but I could tell by watching it, scenes like the mission obtain Beryllium, this would shine on Blu-ray.  But for now, on DVD the colors look vibrant with the Earth tone colors and blue skies make things absolutely beautiful.  Video is presented in widescreen.  So, overall, for a DVD release, the picture quality and the new remastering looked great.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is presented ala English 5.1 Surround (as well as Spanish 5.1 Surround) and comes with a Thermian 2.0 Surround track.  I will say that watching this film again, I heard a good number special effects from the various channels.  Audio sounds very good, I was noticing small details such as the damaged spaceship, the Protector trying to use its remaining engines to move the ship and hearing it trying to move in space on your front channel and rear channels speakers.  I don't recall hearing those small details back in 2000.  I felt the audio seemed cleaner and clearer in this deluxe edition.<br /><br />With a new digital remaster for the DVD coinciding with the 10th Anniversary of the film's release, I can only hope that we get a 1080p High Definition transfer with lossless audio.  Knock on wood, I hope there will be a Blu-ray release coming soon!<br /><br />But for now, compared to the original DVD release, this is the better DVD version to own for now in terms of picture and audio quality.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition" comes with newer special features to celebrate the film's 10th Anniversary.  The original DVD released in 2000 had special DVD Easter Eggs (related to the Omega 13) and a "On Location in Space" featurette that are not included on this deluxe edition, so you may not want to throw out your original 2000 DVD.  But this Deluxe Edition comes with newer features recently created in 2009 and are very enjoyable.<br /><br />* Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest - (18:14) A new featurette with recent interviews with Dean Parisot (Director), Bob Gordon (Screenwriter) and David Howard (screenwriter).  Also, new interviews with the cast of "Galaxy Quest".  A fun and informative featurette of how the film came about, how the talent felt about being at a science fiction convention and being a bit weirded out by the experience and also certain segments that play homage to "Star Trek".<br />* Never Give Up. Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector - (23:25) This featurette goes into the casting of "Galaxy Quest".  The cast is interviewed and give their thoughts of their character and what they remember during the filming.  Interesting tidbits of Sigourney Weaver being in character once she had the blonde wig and attracting a lot of eyes.  How Alan Rickman was very cool and calm. Tim Allen and Daryl Mitchell always having fun on the set and really interesting situations that happened during the filming of "Galaxy Quest".<br />* By Grabthar's Hammer, What Amazing Effects - (7:03) How popular Stan Winston worked on special effects for the alien monsters and Industrial Light and Magic working on the CG effects.  How the camera work for "Galaxy Quest" was trying to recapture that Star Trek original series cinematography feel and much more!<br />* Alien School - Creating the Thermian Race - (5:23) How Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar) came up with the Thermian speech from vocal training they did at Yale.  How during "alien school", they would have to learn how to walk and move.<br />* Actors in Space - (6:11) In this segment, we learn how being in a popular series, an actor can get pigeonholed.  Tim Allen talks about people even today thinking he's Tim Taylor of "Home Improvement", Justin Long talking about despite his film work, he's still looked as "The Mac Guy", Daryl Mitchell known for his work on "House Party" and more.<br />* Sigourney Weaver Raps - (1:59) Sigourney Weaver's agent's birthday was coming up, so Sigourney asked Daryl Mitchell to help her create a rap for Sam Cohn and together with Sam Rockwell, Missi Pyle, Jed Rees, the five created a music video as a birthday present.<br />* Additional Scenes: Deleted Scenes (Used on 2000 release) - A total of eight deleted scenes.  Some of these features include commentary by the talent or Director Dean Parisot and David Howard.<br />* Thermian Audio Track - An audio track featured completely in Thermian.  Personally, even when this was on the original 2000 DVD, has anyone ever watched the film completely in Thermian?<br />* Theatrical Trailer (Used on 2000 release) - (1:54) Original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The slip cover has a front cover that features Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen in character, standing cool and collected (the image shown above on this review) and when you shift the front of the cover slightly, it shows the three firing their weapons.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition" is definitely a wonderful 10th Anniversary release.<br /><br />I have never grown tired of this film and for any Star Trek fan or science fiction fan, you can't help but enjoy and laugh and be thoroughly entertained by the various talent and the overall wackiness of the storyline.<br /><br />The new special features is what makes this film worth buying again on DVD.  To have everyone return for an interview and talk about their love for the film and how well it was received and how it has become a sci-fi classic was just fun to watch.  And the behind-the-scenes tidbits you learn about the shenanigans that went behind-the-scenes to the actual creation of the film, was also informative and entertaining.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I can hope for, that would be a high definition Blu-ray release of this film.  With its 10th Anniversary, I was a bit surprised that only a new DVD was announced at this time.  But with the film now receiving a new digital remastering, I can only hope for a HD 1080p transfer and lossless audio, to me, that would be the icing on the cake.<br /><br />But overall, this new deluxe edition was just fantastic and if you are a big fan of "Galaxy Quest", on DVD, this is the definitive version to own.  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I have been a Star Trek fan for the longest time &amp; for that simple reason, my girl friend never bothered watching the series with me.  But then again, unknowingly, Star Trek's culture has imbedded into our day to  day living.  If you say phrases like &quot;Beam Me Up, Scottie&quot;;  &quot;Live Long &amp; Prosper&quot; whilst displaying the V sign, your  friends just understand immediately what you're implying.  Anyway, my girl  friend came with me to the cinema reluctantly &amp; she couldn't help  shaking her head noticing that the cinema was filled with males especially  the geeky type, something like me!  Anyway, when the movie started, she  couldn't help laughing her heads off with the goofy storyline.  On top of  the mockery of the Star Trek series, what I'm finding this movie endearing  is seeing all those familiar actors from TV series such as Elliott in Just  Shoot Me, Mitchell from Veronica's Closet, Tim Allen in Home Improvement,  the taxi guy from Wings strutting their stuff.  What's even amusing is  seeing Sigourney Weaver playing a busty bimbo (a far cry from her Ripley  role in Alien &amp; sequels), &amp; Alan Rickman virtually playing himself  as an actor with English theatre background forcing himself re-enacting the  role of  this Spock character again &amp; again &amp; still, the spotlight  is always taken by Tim Allen who's potraying the role of William Shatner.  What's even more delightful about the movie is that in the end, good  prevails over evil. The underlying themes of the movies would be the  significance of teamwork, &amp; self belief. A wonderful film to be shared  with family members &amp; friends.  What's even more unbelievable is that  my girl friend can't wait for the sequel, if there's any!  On the sideline,  Stan Winston, the special effect guy who had brought us the Alien creature  is in his usual best. By the way, the space ship is as corny as ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>When Galaxy Quest was released in 2000, it was a modest success but it certainly didn't light the world on fire. Over the years, it has quietly amassed something of a cult following who delight in the film's affectionately satirical jabs at the Star Trek franchise and its fans, specifically the first incarnation with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. With this new Deluxe Edition DVD, it is about time for Galaxy Quest to be revisited and re-evaluated.<br /><br />"Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest" is a retrospective making of featurette that has key cast and crew members reminiscing about the experience of working on the film. They take us through its origins and we see how the original concept was quite different but was tweaked over time. In a nice touch, the main cast members return and tell all kinds of filming anecdotes, clearly looking back at this project with genuine affection.<br /><br />"Never Give Up, Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector" takes a look at the cast of Galaxy Quest and they talk about how they approached their respective roles. The filmmakers talk about why they cast the actors that are in the film and everyone dishes more wonderful stories.<br /><br />"By Grabthar's Hammer, What Amazing Effects" takes a look at the film's snazzy visual effects. They had Stan Winston do the aliens while ILM do the special effects. Winston speaks about his creations in archival footage.<br /><br />"Alien School: Creating the Thermian Race" examines the alien race that enlists the help of the Galaxy Quest crew. Actor Enrico Colantoni talks about how he came up with his character's voice.<br /><br />"Actors in Space" takes a look at how the cast made fun of their profession and their character archetypes.<br /><br />"Sigourney Weaver Raps" features a taped message that she made for her agent's birthday where the veteran actress raps with help from her fellow castmates.<br /><br />Also included are eight deleted scenes that feature more with Fred Kwan as he tours the ship's engineering section with his Zen-like calmness. There is a scene where the cast are shown their quarters based on their characters' personalities from the show. And we also get more of them bickering among each other on the alien planet.<br /><br />"Thermian Audio Track" allows you to watch the entire film dubbed in the alien language, which is actually pretty funny but I don't know if you would ever watch it more than once.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>From concept to execution, this film is a knock out comedy.  You don't have to be a space geek to enjoy this one.  Plus, Sigourney Weaver looks great as a blond.  Galaxy quest works because of the casting.  This movie could have gone either way, but I think it's the cast that makes this work.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Moviegoers who liked EVOLUTION, MEN IN BLACK, SPACEBALLS, MARS ATTACKS!, MYSTERY MEN or THE FIFTH ELEMENT will find something to love in GALAXY QUEST, one of my favorite films of the past fifty years.<br /><br />By now we all know the story, so it's hard to recall how difficult it was for most ordinary moviegoers to get their heads around the concept back in the year 2000: "They're actors in an old-time, cancelled TV sci-fi show and they get W-H-A-T?"  People were walking out of the theater in droves the way that they used to walk out of Antonioni's L'AVVENTURA, unable to take in the  slightest detail due to a mental fog having set into their brains.  You know what numbskulls the US public are, and how nobody ever went broke underestimating them.  Well, writer Dean Parisot somehow made us sit up and pay attention and for once a "high concept" approach to metafiction paid off in a big way.  Part of it was his concern for establishing the characters, the actors whom we come to love despite their general egotism (Tim Allen), narrow view of life (Sigourney Weaver), distaste for all things American (Alan Rickman), etc.  On top of that, like a celluloid gel, was added our memories of STAR TREK and other cult shows, and on top of that, our generalized knowledge of fan bases--for even if we're not uberfans ourselves, we like to poke fun at those who are.  However in this case, the fans themselves become heroic in a genuinely surprising and resonant way, led by the redoubtable Justin Long (so funny when his mother pressures him to take out the trash, while he's in the middle of saving an entire universe from slavery and collapse).<br /><br />The actors are all uniformly good, except that this time around I was sort of "not so great" about Sam Rockwell, who seemed to be hamming it up for no reason, though his part (as a bit player on the original show, "Crewman #2) was perhaps more shallowly executed than the others and he might have felt he had to make up for it by a trunkload of smirks and gapes.  Oh well, what would there be left to criticize if everything was perfect and everyone else practically was!  Poor Tim Allen, imagine knowing that you had once appeared in a great movie like GALAXY QUEST and now you're making WILD HOGS, though I'm sure he's crying all the way to the bank.<br /><br />And I didn't recognize Keith Mars until that spaceman makeup until the very last reel!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; gives sci-fi lovers a swift, but soft and loving, kick in the pants.  It is dead-on with its parody of sci-fi television, the actors involved, and the herds of loving fans who, admittedly, do take their science fiction just a little too seriously.  If your a fan of shows such as &quot;Star Trek,&quot; &quot;Farscape,&quot; or &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; you'll definitely identify with this movie.<p>What makes this movie so unique, however, is the fact that it uses the sometimes fanatic behavior of sci-fi fans who take their favorite shows too seriously and puts that passion in actual aliens who believe the crew of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; are real.  <p>It pokes fun at just about every stereotypical sci-fi fan.  From youngsters who argue over certain inaccuracies about the ship with the &quot;captain&quot; to average looking folks trying to mimic their favorite vixen from the show, it's all here.  Overacting, underappreciated and Shakespearian-trained co-stars fed up with miserable catch phrases, child-stars trying to break from the past, etc.  The stereotypes overflow.<p>As a science fiction film, &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; stands quite well on its own.  The special effects are brilliant considering this is plugged as a comedy.  The acting is superb, especially Sigourney Weaver, who pulls off being a dim-bulb blonde in great contrast of other characters she has played.  Tim Allen, Tony Shalhoub and the rest of the cast are perfect.<p>This is a fun film worth owning, especially if you love your science fiction with a great story and brilliant visuals.<p>Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I saw this film in theaters when it came out 4 years ago and I really didn't care much for it. At the time I was only 15 and did not get most of the numerous jokes sprinkled throughout the film. I watched it again for the second time last night and loved every single minute of it. I never realized just how entertaining and funny this movie was. The entire cast was great, especially Tim Allen and Sam Rockwell(the expendable crew member!). If you haven't seen this film and you love sci-fi or comedy spoofs, check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this movie when it came out, and I thought it was pretty funny, but seeing it again recently, I found myself liking it more than I did the first time.  The story is about the actors from a short lived sci-fi show and what they do to earn a living, surviving on faded fame.  Amid the sci-fi conventions, store grand openings, and internal squabbles, they suddenly find themselves thrust into senario straight out of their old TV show.  It seems a distance race of aliens has intercepted television transmissions from Earth and regards what they see as 'historical documents'.  They mold their lives and civilization around this old sci-fi show, right down to creating an exact replica of the space ship from the show.  As it turns out, the aliens are in serious trouble and need the assistance of the Galaxy Quest members to help them deal with another, hostile alien race.<br /><br />Watching the actors now having to deal with the reality of the situation, as it were, is extremely funny.  All do a great job, but my favorite is Sam Rockwell's character, Guy.  He was the actor who was one episode and credited as 'Crewman Number 6'.  In his episode, he died in a horrible fashion, and quick enough as to never have gotten a full character name.  With this extremely minor claim to fame, he milks it for all it's worth, following the mainstay actors around on their convention and store opening circuit, like a parasitic organism hanging tenously on to the best thing he has going for him.  Once the fantasy becomes reality, he provides some of the most memorable moments with his constant fears that he will die in some horrible manner due to the fact that he was such a minor character on the original show.  My favorite lines in the movie comes from his character when he's looking at a tatical display and they are about to be attacked by an enemy ship...<br /><br />Guy Fleegman: Hey guys, there's a red-thingy moving toward the green-thingy.<br />Jason Nesmith: What?<br />Guy Fleegman: Red-thingy moving toward the green-thingy. I think we're the green-thingy.<br /><br />Anyway, I think this movie did a great job in having fun with the whole 'Star Trek' fans while not ripping them to shreds.  This movie has a tendancy to grow on you, with its humor and the special effects are quite good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>Galaxy Quest, as I'm sure everybody already knows, is a send up of Star Trek. Tim Allen is cast in the William Shatner role, Sigourney weaver is the Uhura of the show and a dead pan Alan Rickman is the Leonard Nimoy of Galaxy Quest. Having had their show cancelled several years previously the cast of the now defunct Galaxy Quest make their living by doing personal appearances at conventions organised by their all too obsessive fan club. However their careers are given a new lease of life, and a definite change of direction, when they are enlisted by some very hapless (but genuine) aliens to assist them in fighting a war against a ruthless enemy who has been terrorising their `people'. The unfortunate ET's however do not realise that Galaxy Quest is merely a TV show and instead believe that each episode is a historical document. From this false belief the unfortunately dim-witted and naive aliens have modelled their whole ethical system on the show and created an exact replica of the Galaxy Quest star-ship to assist them in their quest for survival. <p>I love Galaxy Quest. There I said it. I think it is one of the funniest yet most under appreciated movies of the last few years. I own it on DVD, yet every time it is on satellite TV I still end up watching it again and again and laughing again and again. To put this in perspective I'm not even a great fan of comedies, I'm not even a great fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver (although they are both decent actors) but this movie just tickles me pink and has me giggling like a kid every time I watch it.<p>This movie is simply a joy. Unlike many spoofs it doesn't over egg the mix. It is told straight and there are no nudge nudge wink wink asides to the camera. Every joke pretty much hits its mark and there is so much fine observational humour that it perhaps requires a couple of viewings to completely appreciate its subtleties. Galaxy Quest is in many ways the sci-fi equivalent to the Scream movies, in that it sends up all the old clich&eacute;s of sci-fi movies and of course in particular, Star Trek. That said it is not done in a disrespectful manner. I grew up with the original Star Trek and as an adult have enjoyed The Next Generation immensely, which definitely added to my viewing pleasure of Galaxy Quest, which is absolutely choc-full of witty knowing dialogue. Much of the credit for this must go to the invention of writers David Howard and Robert Gordon for what is obviously an affectionate and extremely clever and knowledgeable spoof. Kudos also to Director Dean Parisot for his subtle direction and decision to play the movie straight. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, in fact the whole cast are just great. Galaxy Quest never misses a beat and I highly recommend it!<br />Five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>Is "Galaxy Quest" a movie I feel everyone needs to see?  No.  But if you like either comedies, Star Trek, or movies about people stepping up to responsibilities they were not sure they could handle, you will like this movie.<br /><br />I would divide what many call "science fiction" into three categories:<br /><br />1) "True Science Fiction", which is based on realistic speculation (e.g. "Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea," "Flowers For Algernon");<br /><br />2) "Science Fantasy", which has a space setting, but is more of a fantasy in space than something based on true speculation (e.g. "Star Wars"); and<br /><br />3) "Science Horror", which often leans more toward the first category, but in this case it is a horror story in a space/sci-fi setting (e.g. "Alien").<br /><br />This movie is clearly in the second category.<br /><br />I see parallels between this movie and two others.  One is "Three Amigos", another comedy about actors who are mistaken for being heroes, and finding themselves having to become heroes.  The other is "Space Camp", about a woman and several kids accidentally sent into space.  The "Three Amigos" parallel probably has been noted in other reviews; while this is more of a comedy, I feel with the size of the cast that there are a lot of similarities with "Space Camp."<br /><br />One thing I'll mention is that I am not really a Tim Allen fan.  I'm not a Tim Allen hater either, but for me, he was neither a draw nor, for the most part, a distraction from the movie.  I could never picture him being cast as a serious starship captain.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good, though I think Sigourney Weaver was over-qualified as an actress for her role.  Alan Rickman was excellent in his role, an excellent crumudgeon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>As a ravenous Trekker and fanatical SF fan, I was dubious about a spoof, however well-written. I was stupid. This is the funniest movie to be churned out of Hollywood in recent years--and it's only PG!<p>&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was a popular cult SF show years ago, but now the stars do little but appear at conventions and sign autographs. Delightfully Shatnerian Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) is approached by perpetually smiling aliens the Thermians, who believe that the adventures of the &quot;Protector&quot;'s crew are recorded real adventures. They ask him to help them defeat the hideous insectoid General Sarris--in a real, constructed starship &quot;Protector.&quot; Thrilled out of his pants, Nesmith brings along his initially unwilling friends to save the galaxy!<p>Tim Allen shows that he's an excellent actor OUTSIDE of sitcoms, so like Shatner that it's simply uncanny. The voice, the delivery of lines, even the rather inflated ego are all there.<p>Sigourney Weaver plays Gwen DeMarco, who is frustrated both by her small role on the show and the fact that all interviewers have ever asked her was about her bust size. A combination Counselor Troi/ Lieutenant Uhura, she basically repeats what the computer says. She explodes in frustration at one point: &quot;I have one job on this ship--it's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay! &quot;<p>Alan Rickman wears an alien head as Alexander Dane, a cranky actor who hates always being second fiddle and resents Allen and his role throughout the movie. Tony Shalhoub drifts innocuously through the movie, paying only marginal attention to the amazing events around him.<p>Daryl Mitchell plays a grown-up Wesley Crusher character, who was piloting the ship at the age of ten. Sam Rockwell plays a truly unique role--he was a redshirt who got killed on the alien planet of Episode 81, and now believes that he's going to die because his character doesn't have a name. Enrico Colantoni plays the leader of the Thermians, whose vacant grin and singsong speech patterns steal all his scenes... &quot;Weeeeee... need your help.&quot;<p>There are a million funny moments and in-jokes that Trekkers will notice: The ship scraping against spacedock, Nesmith rolling around in preparation for action, Guy freaking out because he's a redshirt and he's doomed to die, Nesmith losing his shirt during a fight to display his manly chest, Gwen yelling because of her small role, ridiculous obstacles in the bowels of the ship, and so on.<p>Perhaps the funniest part of it all is the Thermians, who have formed their culture around the adventures and friendships of the Galaxy Quest crew. Wouldn't it be great if that were true?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Galaxy Quest, brings to the screen the story of the cast of a Sci-Fi TV series that is down on its luck.  Things will become a bit more complicated when a group of genuine aliens arrives on earth and attempts to recruit the cast, believing that the show's episodes are actual historical records and that the characters are real heroes...<br /><br />Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />The only major setback is in relation to the "friendly" aliens being portrayed as morons.  Why?  What was the point of that?<br /><br />In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, the humor, and the music are all very good.<br /><br />Though not a masterpiece, Galaxy Quest is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>It wasn't so much that I wasn't a fan of Star Trek. It was more of a complete dislike for William Shatner in the lead role. I always found him a smug, arrogant actor that seemed to be giving the minimum amount of effort in order to garner a paycheck. The fact that he more or less has alluded to such over the years proves the point. The show itself was extraordinarily innovative for it's time, and it's too bad such a big presence had to bring it down. <p>Galaxy Quest captures everything I like and hate about the show perfectly. It begins by mercilessly slamming the situation of the former cast of the show, years after it's run on TV. The cast is reduced to getting paychecks by enduring fans at conventions who live and breathe what the actors gave up doing years ago. When not doing conventions, they have to endure fans who live and breathe Galaxy Quest as electronics store openings.<p>The most hilarious character at this point is Alan Rickman, who seemed to have a budding theatrical career that was put on permanent hold when the show's popularity became his destiny. The bad guy of "Die Hard" proves to be a great comedic actor as someone who would rather die than utter another of his Dr. Spockish sayings.<p>While I don't believe William Shatner ever showed the exuberance for conventions that Tim Allen does at the beginning, it does setup a temporary downfall that propels the rest of the plot. Allen goes into a deep funk when overhearing in a washroom how pathetic the whole cast is. This funk is only overcome when real aliens beam him up and he sees a chance to save the universe. Or at least revive his career.<p>The genius of the movie is how, once the rest of the cast is also beamed up, that we actually care deeply for the characters and start rooting for the good guys. Excellent special effects, especially with the unstoppable Rock Monster, take them deeper and deeper into a situation where they have to make serious decisions, while at the same time keeping their comedic edge. <p>While the veterans all do great work, my favorite is Sam Rockwell, who plays one of the superfans who happened to be an extra in one of the past episodes. At first he elevates himself to the stardom of the others by asking if he can sit at the autograph table with the main characters and get the 8 x 10's he has made of himself also autographed. But when the action gets fast and furious, he realizes that his role is usually to get killed off before the end of the plot. This anxiety is hilarious throughout the movie.<p>Oh yes, it's also great for all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>Pay no attention to the jerk whose review follows this one.  Check his other reviews; he gave the BIBLE one star, for goodness' sakes.  What an idiot.<br /><br />Well, "Galaxy Quest" ain't holy writ but it's not schlock either.  While it also ain't "Citizen Kane" or "Lord Of the Rings," it's a fun and sometimes clever takeoff on "Star Trek" with a few former inside jokes that will be familiar enough to almost anyone by now, but there's plenty of twists on the old themes to keep any reasonable audience interested.  It takes the simple idea of, "What if the bickering cast of 'Trek' actually found themselves in a 'Trek' plot in real life?" and builds on it to the terminally unbelievable conclusion of a plot with so many holes you could fly a few space shuttles through it, but hey, suspending disbelief isn't what this kind of flick is about anyway.  It's a hoot.  Invite some friends over, fluff up some corn, and fire it up with my best wishes.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>THE BIGGEST & BEST LAMPOONING OF STAR TREK THAT IS POSSIBLE IN OUR GALAXY!<br /><br />I must admit that I have seen virtually all of the Star Trek episodes and movies too many times. In fact, I had my own homemade federation uniform that I wore in the 1960s, especially when the "Original Series" was first running. Still, I appreciate "Galaxy Quest" and its mission, to put STAR TREK conventionalities upside-down. Wow!<br /><br />IT ALL BEGINS:<br /><br />The film opens in a "Galaxy Quest" convention now some 18 years after the show originally aired. The crew of "The Protector" are waiting impatiently and acting neurotically as they await their commander's entrance so they can all make their big entrance at the convention and get this gig over with. The comradeship which seems real on the surface is immediately seen as long-gone among the crew. These actors don't like each other and, most of all, they don't respect, but do detest their "scene-stealing hack" of a Captain, played like the perfectly imperfect backstage James T. Kirk by Tim Allen.<br /><br />BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENS:<br /><br />Captain Taggert is happily going through the motions and just soaking up all the hero worship and attention he's getting at the convention by his legions of trekkie-like uniformed fans while his crew just watches with envy from the sidelines. But then as he is making his way into the crowded men's room, Nesmith overhears a group of fans making very nasty comments about what a has-been he [Jason Nesmith] has become and how everyone can see that "even his friends can't stand him". It sounds kind of cliche, but the setting and Tim Allen make it really work and I feel very sorry for him. Jason Nesmith the actor suddenly realizes that his life "obviously" is meaningless and he wants to change this. With this EPIPHANY of sorts, the movie takes on a completely different and unexpected direction at light speed [literally].<br /><br />That direction is comedy. We have good naive aliens that look weird. We have bad "street-smart" aliens that look and act bad and we have sweet gently-cute little aliens that want to eat each other and Nesmith too. We even have some wonderful lampooning of the Star Trek Original Series episode "ARENA" where Nesmith fights monsters against impossible odds and does his customary rolling on the ground antics which never made any sense to me when I saw Kirk doing it almost 40 years ago.<br /><br />But there is more. We even have fans on Earth helping Nesmith get through some of his shipboard ordeals after he explains simply that everything about the show and ship are "all real". Then we have humor almost beyond belief as the logic is based on Trek logic and not what we take for granted as logic.<br /><br />To make a very long story short, Nesmith's goal, to discover real meaning in his life is achieved, but the meaning is something that he earns along with new admiration from shipmates, fans, and aliens alike. All of this is completely integrated with the fans the aliens the starship "Protector" and the TV show enmeshed throughout the film.<br /><br />To call this film thoughtfully made would be an understatment. The ending is very well done and replete with humor, drama and some twists and surprises. When it was all done I truly wished they would make a TV series called "Galaxy Quest" and include "this fine ship and this fine crew".<br /><br />ABOUT THE CAST:<br /><br />Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith who is Captain Peter Quincy Taggert [Capt. Kirk like] on TV's "Galaxy Quest" fictitious program<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco -"Lt. Tawny Madison - Repeats Computer"<br /><br />Alan Rickman  - Alexander Dane  - "Dr. Lazarus - Advisor"<br /><br />Tony Shalhoub  - Fred Kwan  - "Tech Sgt. Chin - Engineer"<br /><br />Sam Rockwell  - Guy Fleegman  - "Crewman Guy - Expendable"<br /><br />Daryl Mitchell  - Tommy Webber  - "Loredo - Helmsman"<br /><br />Enrico Colantoni  - Mathesar  - "Good Alien Leader"<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />This is perhaps the one glaring shortcoming of this film. It has very few features. It has a few deleted scene segments, a short featurette and some short abridged filmographies. It was in Widescreen and the transfer was flawless. Dreamworks could do much better for features as this type of film attracts the kind of fans that really appreciate "Special Features".</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Most times I think movies stand on their own and should not be sequelized. This movie however is a great parody of SciFi and Star Trek in particular. The cast is superb and will have you laughing throughout the movie. Top notch special effects and music. Directing can't be beat either. This winning combination made it a hit with most audiences, not just SciFi fans. So I ask again why no sequel? For fans of drama only, you may want to see something else since this is excellent comedy done by those that have done marvelous drama as well. THIS IS COMEDY, NOT DRAMA! I would be especially surprised if anyone that has gone to a SciFi convention didn't find this hysterically fun.<br /><br />If by chance you have not seen this movie the story goes that a group of actors/actress that starred in a series like Star Trek are appearing at a SciFi convention. At the convention a group of aliens approaches the Commander played by Tim Allen. He thinks they are just convention goers in costume that want him for a gig at another place. When he finds out they have have modelled their spaceship and lifes after the TV show, life gets weird and very funny. The cast must have had a blast doing these roles. Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub we expect in comedy, but Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman have usually played more dramatic roles. They all do wonderful jobs of making you laugh.<br /><br />The DVD quality is excellent and includes a documentary and deleted scenes you will love. Picture and sound were sharp and no problems with playing. Nice menu interface that matches the theme of the movie. I highly recommend adding it to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X27FQSHP418Y.html">A2X27FQSHP418Y</a><br/><p>Only the idea was enough to deserve five stars.

Which makes it a perfect family flick to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. <p>Apart from the spoof gags, what took me by surprise were the superb special effects, as octopodal aliens morph effortlessly into humans and back again in articulately designed space (the interior of the spaceship itself borrowed its staid cardboard looks from Star Trek of yore, perhaps as an intentional sardonic effect)<p>Overall, the film's affection for its audience (especially those weaned on Lost in Space, or The Next Generation, etc) and for the characters it parodies covers up for the gaping blackholes in its highly implausible and goofy plotline. <p>Great rental, and even a good buy because it lends itself easily to repeat viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>How do the actors in Star Trek behave when they take their costumes off and go home?  What do they do years after the series has been canceled?<br /><br />And just what DOES happen to those radio signals of old Star Trek (and Gilligan) shows escaping the Earth, and traveling outwards at the speed of light?<br /><br />The Thermians discovered these "historical documents" (unfortunately for the Thermians, they had not invented fantasy, lying, or acting), and develop their society based on the principles of "Galaxy Quest" (a mock version of Star Trek) and its crew.  But another race is now fighting the Thermians, and winning.  The Thermians need the commander of the ship, the NSEA Protector.  They don't need the Protector, however, because, based on the historical documents, they built their own.<br /><br />Thus the adventures begin.<br /><br />The similarities to the original Star Trek series are interspersed throughout, and done well.  The bad dudes are very bad, and the Thermians are really just lovable.  No wonder they are losing!  But the key element of this movie is the transformation of the Protector's crew from actors to space-faring adventurers.  The vital connection they have with their groupies back on Earth is also well done.<br /><br />Great movie!  The extras include the deleted scenes, which you won't find on the earlier VHS editions.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>GALAXY QUEST could have been the greatest STAR TREK film ever made.  I wonder if the filmmakers had bothered pitching it to the Trek franchise.  Can you imagine if Shatner had played the lead?  Shatner playing Shatner playing Kirk.  If the original Trek cast had been in this movie--and it would not have been tough to taylor it a bit back to its original source--it could've been a hilarious classic in the Trek canon.<br /><br />But I don't want to take anything away from the cast in the film.  Tim Allen really breaks out of his stand-up/sitcom persona and plays a Shatner-esque role.  I was really surprised as to how good he was in this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is almost too intimidating as a serious actress.  Depsite the blond hair and push-up bra, she's still Sigourney Weaver, Academy Award nominated actress.  In GHOSTBUSTERS, she played the straight gal to Bill Murray, an Academy Award nominated comedian.  In GALAXY QUEST, she's playing another washed-up sci fi actress...but I still see Sigourney Weaver!  Wasn't too distracting and she was very good.  (But when you think about it, how great could some of the typecast actors and actresses have been if they hadn't been pigeon-holed by a iconic role?)<br /><br />Alan Rickman is another incredibly talented actor (although best known as Hans Gruber, the slick German mastermind in DIE HARD).  If he hadn't been hidden under his silly alien makeup, his impressive talent might have been distracting as well--but it's not!  He's excellent.  The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Tony Shalhoub and Sam Rockwell.<br /><br />One of the reasons I waited to see this film was because I thought it would goof on the Trek fans.  With scenes at a sci-fi convention and fans as characters, I was afraid that the film would pile on to make fun of them.  Kind of like when Shatner did the "Saturday Night Live" sketch where he tells the Trekkies to "get a life."  Funny, but too easy of a target.<br /><br />Well, GALAXY QUEST doesn't take that easy route.  It doesn't poke fun at the fans.  In fact, the fans actually come out as heroes in some scenes.  It's a film that understands the fan's affection and doesn't insult them.<br /><br />A funny and fun movie!  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I am an Alan Rickman lover, and I do not watch Tim Allen anything. So Alan won over and I watched this film. It was kind of annoying at first, and well, any time Allen was on camera, but as soon as Sigourney Weaver and Mr. Rickman joined in, it was kinda fun. Sam rockwell had a great small part too. This is basically a spoof of Star Trek and science fiction films, which normally wouldn't interest me, but I must say, it definitley had its moments.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Take one short-run imaginative but low-budget sci-fi TV show from the '60s that has developed a huge but geeky fan base since its cancellation and a race of innocent hero-worshipping cephalopod aliens called Thermians, who think that the random electromagnetic leakage of episodes through Earth's atmosphere are "historical documents" beamed at them for the purpose of remaking their own culture, add an ALIEN-like genocidal alien named Saris dedicated to destroying the Thermians, toss in Tim Allen of HOME IMPROVEMENT, Sigourney Weaver (a VERY busty Sigourney Weaver), Alan Rickman of DIE HARD, Tony Shaloub of WINGS and MONK, and blend---<br /><br />You get not STAR TREK, but GALAXY QUEST, an affectionate and never patronizing comedic send-up of every Boomer's once-favorite Live Long and Prosper space soap, in which the sick-to-death-of-being-typecast cast are suddenly recast as true heroes after they are hijacked from a fan convention in order to save the galaxy.<br /><br />Laughter is not just an option, it's the only option. To enjoy GALAXY QUEST it isn't necessary to be a STAR TREK fan (the film is funny on its own terms), but the in-jokes are far more pungent if the viewer is or ever was, a fan:<br /><br />Allen plays the overdramatic and occasionally bare-chested Captain who veers between heroics and bemusement, fistfights good guys and bad guys both, seduces any available female, falls down an air duct with Weaver ("Why is it always an air duct?"), and somehow avoids being mashed in an antigravity pile driver of some sort.<br /><br />Weaver's cleavage-ridden female Deck Officer, Lt. Tawny Madison, is an homage to Grace Lee Whitney and every other pretty actress who was forced to pour herself into one of Gene Roddenberry's micro-mini maxi-mammary female crew costumes.<br /><br />Rickman's frustrated Shakespearean-actor-turned-crest-headed-Second Officer will be instantly recognizable, as will the dysfunctional matter transformer that reassembles lifeforms inside out so that they explode. The ship's secret weapon is something or other called Omega-13 (isn't that a vitamin pill?)<br /><br />The obligatory nameless crewman who dies before the intro sequence is there, and as forgettable as always, though he does refuse to do random thises and thats along the way, because, he is, after all, "gonna die" if he does anything.<br /><br />Shaloub, plays the Engineering Officer, but as the actor who plays the Engineering Officer he can't manage to sharpen a pencil without spraining his wrist: "I am not that guy!" He does successfully fall in love with a Thermian.<br /><br />Add to this the cast's constant collapsing of the fourth wall as they remember it's all a show---"Didn't we do this in Episode 16?" "There is no solution? Right?"<br /><br />A certain brand of self-serious Trekkie/Trekkers will probably not laugh at GALAXY QUEST, but since such individuals are usually too busy circling Uranus to get a life, they should be sent to that Convention Hall with padded walls, and left there to beam themselves up.<br /><br />For the rest of us, GALAXY QUEST is a charming parodious visit to that old familiar strange new world and new civilization we all know and love.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Never heard of this before and stumbled across it on HBO.

Things will become a bit more complicated when a group of genuine aliens arrives on earth and attempts to recruit the cast, believing that the show's episodes are actual historical records and that the characters are real heroes...<br /><br />Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />The only major setback is in relation to the "friendly" aliens being portrayed as morons.  Why?  What was the point of that?<br /><br />In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, the humor, and the music are all very good.<br /><br />Though not a masterpiece, Galaxy Quest is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>If you like Star Trek and think its a holy object then do not see this film.

The atmosphere and the attitude of the fans at some of these conventions are captured exactly by the director.<br /><br />In this movie, the actors from on old television series very much like Star Trek, attend a convention.  They are harangued by the fans and peppered with questions about the science in some of the more obscure episodes.  Tim Allen is the William Shatner like character of the series and he meets some weird "fans" that ask him for help.  Tim laughingly agrees.  What he doesn't realize is that these are not fans but in actuality real aliens that think Allen is his persona in the TV series.  On their planet they do not know what a lie or acting is so they accept Allen's "offer" of help and whisk him to a spaceship in another part of the solar system.<br /><br />Allen then has to convince his co-stars to help the aliens and they agree not realizing what they are up against.  They must battle an alien warlord who is ruthless as Star Trek's Khan.<br /><br />There are some hilarious scenes in this movie that literally had me splitting my sides, especially with the actor who plays the ship's engineer (he is the same actor from the Monk tv series).<br /><br />Much funnier and better conceived than Spaceballs!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was not going to be good, but instead I enjoyed it very much.

I cheered when they cast Alan Rickman. And after the years of waiting for this movie, it was all  worth it. The cast and director brought together a movie with heart, spirit and a lot of laughs. Tony Shaloub and Sam Rockwell nearly steal the show from their better-known co-stars.<p>A great comedy classic. Yes, a Trekkie/Trekker will probably get more out of it. But that is not a pre-requisite to enjoying this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>"Galaxy Quest" is a thoroughly entertaining homage to that wonderful universe created by one Gene Roddenberry. With a witty script and a marvelous blend of adequate special effects and action, this film is a comedy with its tongue-in-cheek humor affectionately administered. Tim Allen is good as the parody of James T. Kirk while Siguorney Weaver provides "ample" support as a communications officer with limited skills. Allan Rickman does a fine job in the "Leonard Nimoy/Mr. Spock-role as the actor forever typecast as a result of his character's popularity. Darryl Mitchell as the "token" minority "speaks" for the underused talents of Star Trek vets Nichele Nichols and George Takai. Most of all, it is Sam Rockwell who really steals the show as a "bit player" who accidentally gets taken on an adventure of a lifetime. One does not have to be Trekker to appreciate this film and the outstanding effort on the part of the moviemakers to produce a comic gem. Beam me up for the sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A group of dysfunctional personalities must learn to become more than a team.

They must realize the dangers in lies and deceit; then they must repent. There is death and destruction. This is a rare instance where revenge is a motive for a good outcome.<br /><br />They could not have picked a better cast. I have the feeling that they were playing themselves. And the chemistry that usually is between one or two people was between them all. Tim Allen plays the Commander that, while relieving himself, comes to the realization that the other actors consider him a joke. When he gets second chances visa-vie the intrusion of an alien war, he invites the other actors to join him on the "Galaxy Quest". After you get over the initial shock of Sigourney Weaver's appearance, she makes you feel that she is Gwen DeMarco. She takes the job that life has handed her and turns it in to a positive.<br /><br />Move over Gene Roddenberry.

Try not to be overly critical of the thin spots, because the vehicle works quite well on the whole.  I'm not sure if a sequel is warrented, but I guess they've earned the right to make one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>Disclosure: I am a Trekkie. Dyed-in-the-wool, through and through. So I approach this film from that perspective.<br /><br />The movie:<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest" does the impossible - it makes me enjoy something with Tim Allen in it. I place this movie in that rarefied category of "spoof movies that are equally entertaining as spoofs and as stand-alones." By this, I mean that you could never have watched an episode of Star Trek (shame on you!) and still enjoy this as a science fiction movie. Other films in this category include "Hot Fuzz" (Buddy Cop pics) and "Shaun of the Dead" (Zombie flicks). We are given a plot revolving around the cast of a Star Trek-like show, a few decades after their run on TV. They are stuck in a dreary cycle of conventions and appearances cashing in on their previous fame. Then, something strange happens: real aliens approach them, asking them for their help in an interstellar war.<br /><br />What is especially surprising is how emotional this movie made me. I think its loving depiction of fan devotion, mixed with the somewhat sad portrayal of middle-aged actors who are bitter over typecasting, really hit home for me. The happy ending was made all the more affecting. I was pretty much ready to check my brain and critical eye at the door by the time this movie was finished, however formulaic the resolution might be, objectively speaking.<br /><br />The cast is very good and the humor is dead-on target. Allen is perfectly cast as a self-important blowhard with an undercurrent of insecurity. Sigourney Weaver is also a standout, demonstrating fine comic timing. The alien characters are charming and quirky. The effects are also surprisingly good, equal to some of the later Star Trek films!<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The 1080p image presented on this disc is a definite uprade from the SD DVD, but it isn't exactly a "beat you over the head" HD image. It shows a bit of softness and a bit of Digital Noise Reduction (DNR). The movie was filmed in 1999, and this does look better than some images of that vintage ("Dark City" springs to mind as a DNR'ed mess from about the same year). It's just not a spectacular transfer, at the quality level of, say, 1999's "Fight Club." That said, the faces do not have the waxy look of the worst DNR, and certain shots show nice detail, especially in cloth. The effects shots also look very nice. The print is pretty clean, too. It's just somewhat evident that there was no major restoration work.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 channel mix that does a fine job. Dialogue is never overpowered, and some of the battles and explosions contain booming bass and rear channel surround information. Most of the track is pretty front-loaded, however.<br /><br />Extras include about an hour and 15 minutes worth of documentary features. The most interesting are a feature on the ILM effects (which were pretty good), as well as features on casting, production, and the like. Unfortunately, all the features are in SD. Only the included movie trailer is in HD. 12 minutes of deleted scenes round out the extras.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is great family-friendly entertainment. At the inexpensive Blu-Ray price, if you don't own it, and you love either Star Trek or Sci-Fi in general, you really can't go wrong. It would have been nice to have had a fancier set and a slightly better transfer, but even with its SD features, this is better than most bare-bones releases of "less successful" movies.<br /><br />I see this as a "love letter" of sorts to both Trekkies and the Trek cast and crew. I enjoy watching this more than the new Trek movie, for what it's worth. If you haven't seen it, you really should!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AVV9LV9UXT6F.html">A2AVV9LV9UXT6F</a><br/><p>The humor in this movie works on two levels.  First is the comedy that results from the movie's basic premise: a bunch of TV actors suddenly find themselves in exactly the same sorts of adventures they used to act out on screen, only now it's real.  But second, and even funnier in my opinion, is the humor derived from parodying the entire world of science fiction, and its all to often rabid, religiously devoted fans.<br /><br />It also showcases the darker side of being involved with a pop-culture phenomenon: actors who become so closely identified with their roles, they find they simply can't get work doing anything else.  I imagine the real cast of "Star Trek" could feel how close to the mark this hits (and George Reeves, TV's Superman of the 1950s, may have even killed himself in despair at suffering this fate).  The most memorable scene in the movie for me was Alan Rickman's delivery of the line "By Grabthar's Hammer, I've never seen such savings."  His rigid posture, hesitant speech, and stony facial expression are hilarious.  He's a classicly trained actor who's become pigeonholed in a role he considers beneath him, and he has been reduced to the humiliation of uttering childish drivel at store openings.  For all that much of the movie is made in the spirit of William Shatner's famous SNL "get a life" skit, the movie takes an affectionate look at fans, and two sci-fi geeks even provide indispensible help to the heroes in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Some movies can be watched once and enjoyed, but forgotten. Other movies can be watched repeatedly and only get more funny with each watching. Galaxy Quest definitely is a multi-watch movie!<br /><br />The basic plot is that the cast of a long-gone sci-fi series is living off the fan conventions. They are sick of each other but plod on for the cash. Suddenly, a group of space aliens - who thinks these actors are real spacemen - drag them into an interstellar war. The actors try their best to help out and to overcome their petty quarrels.<br /><br />The cast is stellar. Alan Rickman is hilarious as the serious alien played by a "British Actor". "I had five curtain calls," he complains while sitting at yet another fan convention. The tiny details he pulls are are brilliant. Tony Shaloub, now best known for his up tight detective "Monk", is fantastic here as the kick-back, relaxed engineer. In one scene, they land on a strange planet and he blithely sticks his head out and smells the air to see if it's safe. Talk about an anti-Monk!<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver, one of the most famous actresses in the "space world" because of her Alien series, is fantastic here as the blonde, busty "talker" who was only on the show for her looks. All she gets to do is repeat the lines the computer says.<br /><br />There are definitely jokes here that make more sense if you've watched shows like Star Trek. One of the guys is convinced he'll die because he's the "spare crewman" and those extras are always killed off on shows like this. In another scene, the captain wildly does shoulder-rolls to approach the enemy. The other crew-members tease him about his showing off. The "chompers" which make no rational sense on a ship, and which Sigourney complains about quite vocally.<br /><br />There are just so many tiny details that you pick up on subsequent watchings. The way all the "Thermians" walk with wiggly hand movements, betraying their octopoid origins. The way the watching Thermians try to be brave and stay in place even while Laredo nearly crashes the spaceship into them. There are lines I laugh out loud at no matter how many times I've seen the movie. "Rudimentary Lathe" gets me every time :)<br /><br />The DVD doesn't have many extras - but I love that they have an ENTIRE soundtrack in Thermian! You can watch the entire movie with the squeaks and squalks of the Thermian language. Just in case they're watching!<br /><br />One of my favorite movies, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>I have also watched this fun movie several times (all without my sweetheart who hates the idea of sci-fi) and I liked it because it teaches one of my favorite theories. It is impossible to pretend to be something for very long without in some way becoming that thing. The key is what do you pretend to be? Hopefully it is something more noble than what you may have been. I don't mean that it is good to be hypocritical, just that by stiving to be the man you would like to be is better than settling for the man you are. Maybe that is way too deep for this fun spoof of the Star Trecified shows.<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is a funny if a bit silly spoof that just might give you something to think about if you are in the mood.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>A very good DVD production of the movie.

It was more of a complete dislike for William Shatner in the lead role.  I always found him a smug, arrogant actor that seemed to be giving the minimum amount of effort in order to garner a paycheck.  The fact that he more or less has alluded to such over the years proves the point.  The show itself was extraordinarily innovative for it's time, and it's too bad such a big presence had to bring it down.  <p>Galaxy Quest captures everything I like and hate about the show perfectly.  It begins by mercilessly slamming the situation of the former cast of the show, years after it's run on TV.  The cast is reduced to getting paychecks by enduring fans at conventions who live and breathe what the actors gave up doing years ago.  When not doing conventions, they have to endure fans who live and breathe Galaxy Quest at electronics store openings.<p>The most hilarious character at this point is Alan Rickman, who seemed to have a budding theatrical career that was put on permanent hold when the show's popularity became his destiny.  The bad guy of "Die Hard" proves to be a great comedic actor as someone who would rather die than utter another of his Dr. Spockish sayings.<p>While I don't believe William Shatner ever showed the exuberance for conventions that Tim Allen does at the beginning, it does setup  a temporary downfall that propels the rest of the plot.  Allen goes into a deep funk when overhearing in a washroom how pathetic the whole cast is.  This funk is only overcome when real aliens beam him up and he sees a chance to save the universe.  Or at least revive his career.<p>The genius of the movie is how, once the rest of the cast is also beamed up, that we actually care deeply for the characters and start rooting for the good guys.  Excellent special effects, especially with the unstoppable Rock Monster, take them deeper and deeper into a situation where they have to make serious decisions, while at the same time keeping their comedic edge.  <p>While the veterans all do great work, my favorite is Sam Rockwell, who plays one of the superfans who happened to be an extra in one of the past episodes.  At first he elevates himself to the stardom of the others by asking if he can sit at the autograph table with the main characters and get the 8 x 10's he has made of himself also autographed.  But when the action gets fast and furious, he realizes that his role is usually to get killed off before the end of the plot.  This anxiety is hilarious throughout the movie.<p>Oh yes, it's also great for all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>I am, not a big Tim Allen fan, i did watch his show, I liked it this was funny for the family you'll like it.....</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This film is very funny.

You will be laughing all through this.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Galaxy Quest gets fulls marks for inventiveness, but misses out on being a true classic since it never really pushes its potential very far. This is mainly due to the fact that Dreamworks clearly cut the film down in post-production to make it a 'nice and safe' PG family film. It mostly feels like an extension of the meta-fictional show it is mocking than a genuine Star Trek parody.<br /><br />Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith, a mostly washed-up actor famous for only one role (a situation Allen himself should be familiar with) on the long-gone Galaxy Quest TV show. His life is nothing more than public appearances (in character) along with the rest of his disgruntled, weary co-stars. But an oddball race of naive octopus creatures called Thermians, from the other side of the universe mistakenly interpret the show as historical documents and beam-up Nesmith and his crew to an exact replica of their fictional spaceship to fight off the evil Sarris, a reptilian warlord dead-set on acquiring the mysterious 'Omega-13'.<br /><br />My biggest greivance with Galaxy Quest is that the production design is just so b-l-a-n-d. Most of the film is gray, gray, and more shades of gray. Give us something pretty to look at! David Newman, who seems to be the go-to guy for family movie scores, offers a very poor melody for the Galaxy Quest TV show (and therefor the whole movie). I didn't expect Goldsmith to parody his own Star Trek work for this, but SOMEONE better than Newman could have worked wonders.<br /><br />They had lightning in a bottle with Galaxy Quest but it fizzled out when they lost sight of any epic feel. As a TV movie it would have been great, as a theatrical effort it does indeed fall short of the mark. But I'll watch Alan Rickman in almost anything and Missi Pyle is also especially cute.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.35:1 1080p and Dolby TrueHD. A fair amount of self-congratulatory extras are included.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>Galaxy Quest<p>Score: 75/100<p>Galaxy Quest is a crowd-pleasing comedy which did surprisingly well with the critics and movie-goer's alike. It boasts a flashy cast and awesome set decoration, and is an original and watchable comedy that deserves the good-word it's got, and will continue to get.<p>Eighteen years after their sci-fi adventure show &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was cancelled, actors Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell), and Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) are making appearances at sci-fi conventions and store openings in costume and character. They're wallowing in despair and at each other's throats until aliens known as Thermians arrive and, having mistook the show for fact and consequently modeling their entire culture around it, take them into space to save them from the genocidal General Sarris and his armada.<p>Galaxy Quest is quite simply one of the funniest movies of recent memory, and although it is pretty much a forgettable movie, it remains a spot-on Star Trek spoof which gets better with every minute. The Thermian's are a laugh, and all the actors are great; especially Sigourney Weaver as Gwen, she really needed that spice, that enchantment and that suit. The make-up for Alan Rickman is stunning and the CGI effects are sometimes stunning.<p>Hilarious and continuously watchable, Galaxy Quest is a fun and adventurous movie which should not be missed by all audiences who just want to have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Tip one: never, ever go to a PG-rated film at 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon. I got spoiled by having empty theaters for the last few movies I went to. I haven't seen a theatre this full since Sleepy Hollow. At least the subject  matter was more appropriate this time. <p><p>Despite the presence of some  serious starpower, this had the potential to be a truly awful movie.  Thankfully, it managed to avoid that, although it took the easy way out.  The cast of an old TV show called Galaxy Quest are making their living  showing up at conventions. (Sound familiar?) They are approached by a band  of real aliens, who think that the reruns are actually documentaries, who  ask them to save their planet from the evil lizard-bird-alien-thing Saris.  The commander (Tim Allen), who thinks they're asking him to do a faked  appearance, goes along and discovers himself actually out in space, in a  real replica of the Galaxy Quest ship. He lures the others (including an  extra who was killed five minutes into his episode-- sound familiar?) into  helping him battle Saris. With, of course, the expected results. <p><p>This  could have also degenerated into simple parody. And it's good enough simple  parody of the first few crossover Star Trek films (while Tim Allen's  character is obviously modeled on Jim Kirk, Alan Rickman seems to be an odd  cross of Spock and Picard-- early on, he mumbles to himself, &quot;Why am I  doing this? I played Richard III!&quot;), with more than enough laughs to  stand, but what turns this puerile silliness into truly biting satire is  the second level of parody; if you see Star Trek itself as a self-parody,  something that was meant to be cheesy, then you can see a lot of Galaxy  Quest as parody within parody. The miners (you've seen the trailers, right?  The ones Sigourney Weaver says &quot;look like little children&quot;) bear  a more-than-passing resemblance to Teletubbies, carrying on the Star Trek  tradition of pop-culture cannibalism; jokes are made about Tim Allen's  character sleeping with everything that moves; etc. <p><p>All is well and  good with the last hour of this film. It's funny, smart (well, okay, in a  stupid way), well-acted, and cheesy as all get-out. It's the first twenty  minutes that I couldn't get my head around. The slowest of slow starts,  which usually spells death for a comedy; the strength of the movie's  remaining time is all that saves it. The cast are capable. The script is  stupid, but it's supposed to be (and intent is everything). Sigourney  Weaver still looks fabulous with half her clothing ripped off. <p><p>The  tagline is &quot;never give up; never surrender.&quot; I wish they'd  circumvented it long enough to give up the first twenty minutes of this  movie. ** 1/2</p></br><a href="../users/A27CFNHYZG6WS8.html">A27CFNHYZG6WS8</a><br/><p>I didn't really 'get' 'Galaxy Quest' because I've never seen 'Star Trek', and have no desire to (although my wife's a fan, and she didn't think this was very funny).  I'm not too enamoured of the actors involved either, although Sam Rockwell is splendid as the Everyman guiding us through the tricky switches between 'fantasy' and 'reality'.  <p>But 'Quest' is available to more than just Trekkies or Tim Allen admirers.  The (presumably) intentionally tacky set-designs yield some real flourishes (the berillium (sic?) island; the nightmarish climax).  Best of all for those who felt cheated by the 'Borges' comparisons thrown at 'Being John Malkovich', is a truly vertiginous conflation of time, narrative and identity, so that by the end, yuo're about as close to the Garden of Forking Paths as you'll ever be in Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>I saw this movie in the theater and loved it, but when I rented the DVD to  show my uninterested family I found it uninteresting myself. I wonder what  happened. One time I see it, I love it, the second time I'm board and want  to go play video games. Odd, must be a one timer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I've never really been a fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver, so I put off watching this movie for a good while.  I kept hearing and reading about how funny it was, though, so I finally gave in and watched it.  The stories I heard are true because this is really an excellent comedy.  I myself have some natural tendencies toward the type of TV show fans being lampooned in jest here, but we geeks have an amazing quality of laughing at ourselves when what we are seeing is genuinely funny.  The idea is actually just short of brilliant; take the cast of a Star Trek-like science-fiction show cancelled twenty years ago and put them in a situation wherein they have to become the characters they played in order to save themselves and an entire civilization.  The script is excellent, introducing great characterizations of the characters early on, keeping the action and comedy coming fast and furious, and maintaining the comedy at a witty and fresh level.<p>Tim Allen plays Jason Nesmith who plays Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, an obviously Shatner-inspired character who continues to hog all of the spotlight garnered from the old Galaxy Quest series, not realizing that his fellow cast members hold him in some disdain for his egomaniacal antics.  A surprisingly blonde and very funny Sigourney Weaver plays Gwen DeMarcol who plays Lt. Tawny Madison, and she has always been unhappy about the fact her character on the show was never taken seriously.  Then there is Alan Rickman's character Alexander Dane who plays the reptilian-human Dr. Lazarus; this formerly successful British &quot;real actor&quot; despises his rubber-headed character and constantly laments the depths to which his previously distinguished career has sunk.  The other characters are also great: the fairly weird Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) who plays Tech. Sgt. Chen, former boy actor Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) who plays Lt. Laredo, and even Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), better known as the expendable character whose lack of a last name makes him expect to meet death around every corner.  You absolutely have to love the odd alien Thermians who seek the help of Commander Taggart in a last ditch effort to save their people and culture from a ruthless menace, believing all of the Galaxy Quest shows they intercepted in space to be actual historical documents of the bravest ship's crew to travel the universe.  <p>The new adventures of the crew of the NSEA Protector, with the characters pretending to be the heroes they aren't, are rollicking good times interlaced with plenty of comedy and ruminations as to how our heroes ended up in this kind of unbelievable situation.  There are even a couple of poignant moments inserted into the story which complement the comedy quite well and provide further insight into characters who, quite impressively, never really become total parodies of themselves.  The special effects are also excellent, and that is another thing that Galaxy Quest has going for it.  In this type of comedy, the special effects would seem to be of secondary importance, so their impressiveness serves to keep the storyline from sinking into campiness.  Industrial Light and Magic handled all of the space scenes and some of the alien monsters, and the preeminent Stan Winston created some incredible aliens and monsters to fill this outrageous universe.  The DVD only makes a great movie even better, throwing in such extras as an enjoyably informative making-of featurette and a number of deleted scenes.  <p>You don't have to be a science-fiction fan to enjoy Galaxy Quest, although it will probably resonate more with those familiar with the Trek-like nature of the subject matter.  Underneath the laughs and thrills hides a decidedly human story that inspires as it entertains, and this kind of quality comedy should be easily recognized and enjoyed by just about everyone.  It would have been so easy to turn this kind of movie into something really silly if not insulting, but Galaxy Quest is nothing short of a brilliantly made comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>The stars of a cult television series are recruited by real aliens to help save them, in "Galaxy Quest," a top-notch parody from director Dean  Parisot.  For four years it was a hit show, the crew of the NSEA ship  "Protector" keeping the Universe safe on a weekly basis; then it was  canceled.  Now, twenty years later, actor Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), better  known as Commander Peter Quincy Taggert, and four other members of his  "crew" are on the convention circuit.  When he is approached by a small  contingent of aliens (they've taken on human form, or course) at "Quest  18," he understandably looks upon them as just so many more obsessed fans.  The next day, however, they show up at his home; soon Jason is aboard their  ship in deep space, where he discovers that their entire civilization,  apparently, is based upon the "Historical documents" (weekly episodes) of  "Galaxy Quest" they've intercepted over the air waves.  They also have the  real technology by which they are capable of inter-galactic space travel,  and have built an actual version of the "Protector."  What they lack is  leadership; a true Commander.  They simply do not possess the wherewithal  to oppose the aggression of the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) who is  threatening the very existence of their race.  Jason returns to earth to  gather the rest of his crew, and they're off to "negotiate" with Sarris;  Jason being the only one who knows that it's all real.  The others agree to  come along only because they think Jason has scored a good gig and they  don't want to be left out.  After all, work is work;  you take what you can  get.  It takes a number of things to make a movie like this work, not  the least of which is the right cast; and this one more than fits the bill.  Tim Allen lends just the right amount of bravura and ego to make his Jason  believable, while demonstrating the restraint needed to prevent him from  becoming overblown into a mere caricature.  Alan Rickman is perfect as the  dour British thespian, Sir Alexander Dane, who portrayed the Spock-like Dr.  Lazarus in the show, as is Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco), the actress who  had little else to do on the show but look good.  Tony Shalhoub (Fred  Kwan), imbues his character with a singular eccentricity which adds that  "something extra" that makes him so memorable, and Daryl Mitchell (Tommy  Webber) is engaging as the pilot who finally gets to do it for real (and  much to his chagrin, initially).  But the versatile Sam Rockwell (Guy  Fleegman) very nearly steals the show as the actor who only appeared in  "Episode 81" as "Crewman #6" (and was killed off before the first  commercial), and who is thrilled to finally be one of the "crew."  At least  until things start going for real much as they did in that fatal (for him)  episode 81.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Patrick Breen (Quellek),  Missi Pyle (Laliari), Jed Rees (Teb), Justin Long (Brandon), and Enrico  Colantoni, who does an especially fine job of bringing Mathesar, the leader  of the aliens, to life.  Parisot must be given credit for not  resorting to slapstick nor playing the comedy too broadly here, either of  which could easily have been an option with a project like this (and would  have been to the detriment of the film).  Instead he has taken an  intelligent (and very funny) screenplay and made the most of it.  The  timing is excellent, and the action tight.  Writers David Howard and Robert  Gordon have sprinkled detailed bits throughout the film, with which Star  Trek fans especially will be able to identify, and they have managed to  capture the look and "feel" of the original Star Trek series, particularly  in the scene which takes place on the alien planet.  "Star Trek" may have  been the main course, but now "Galaxy Quest" is the delicious dessert; and,  as such, it will keep you coming back for more.  This is a movie you will  want to watch over and over again, without ever tiring of it.  As Commander  Taggert would say, "Never give up, never surrender."</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a very funny movie and holds up very well under repeated viewings.  I think it is Tim Allen's best work. Alan Rickman is also great as the great stage actor wannabe stuck in rubber makeup repeating a signature line he hates.  Sigourney Weaver plays against type as the show's bubble headed computer-repeating eye candy.  She does this very well.  Tony Shaloub brings his special gift for characterization to this very laid back Tech Sgt Chen.  His performance is one of the most fun in the film.  <p>This was the movie I first noticed Sam Rockwell and his role as Guy Fleegman is memorable because it is done so perfectly.  The Thermians are wonderfully done aliens who believe the TV signals they picked up were historical documents and set about making the fake sets and space ships into real space ships and transporters.  <p>What a cool idea.  Enrico Colantoni brings surprising depth to Mathesar, who could have been a simple cartoon.  The same is true for Patrick Breen, Missi Pyle, and Jed Rees.  Robin Sacs goes over the top as Sarris and that is exactly what is required for ole lobster head.  And Jeremy Howard brings Kyle to life as a teen who is smart enough to know more about the Galaxy Quest show than the people who made it, but is still kid enough to accept the show almost as the Thermians do.<p>I just have to say that I find every scene in this movie a delight, including the continuity problems and plot flaws, just like the show it is parodying.  I mean, who cares when you are having this much fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A group of dysfunctional personalities must learn to become more than a team.

They must realize the dangers in lies and deceit; then they must repent. There is death and destruction. This is a rare instance where revenge is a motive for a good outcome.<br /><br />They could not have picked a better cast. I have the feeling that they were playing themselves. And the chemistry that usually is between one or two people was between them all. Tim Allen plays the Commander that, while relieving himself, comes to the realization that the other actors consider him a joke. When he gets second chances visa-vie the intrusion of an alien war, he invites the other actors to join him on the "Galaxy Quest". After you get over the initial shock of Sigourney Weaver's appearance, she makes you feel that she is Gwen DeMarco. She takes the job that life has handed her and turns it in to a positive.<br /><br />Move over Gene Roddenberry.

Basically this takes the concept of Star Trek (ST) and ports it over to Galaxy Quest, a cheesy version of ST on a lower budget, where after the show has been cancelled and years later the crew find themselves earning a mediocre living at conventions and fan clubs and at the same time falling apart as a group because their leader won't take the conventions seriously plus they are having some relationship issues. Suddenly things change when an alien race hijacks the actors, thinking they are really heroes who have engaged and won great battles based on historical documents (intercepted television transmissions of their television show) and ask the actors to save them from an evil galactic villain. It turns out to be much more enjoyable than what a comedy like this usually ought to be and just steals your heart throughout even when it is being corny. If you haven't seen it, then watch it. Galaxy Quest could be one of the funniest family orientated films of all time.

The star-studded, ironic (Tim Allen (voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Sigourney Weaver (from the "Alien" movies) lead the way) and burnt-out cast of the fictional sci-fi TV show "Galaxy Quest" find themselves on a real-life mission when aliens visit the earth.

In the film a group of washed up actors from the TV series `Galaxy Quest' are asked to help a group of aliens led by Mathesar (Colantoni) defend their people against the evil Sarris (Sachs).  In an attempt to have some `fun' Jason (Allen), the cocky jerk who was once the captain of their `ship' decides to agree and reluctantly the rest of the cast does too.  Along the way they learn to trust and care about one another, and they also get themselves in some pretty corny, yet funny, situations.  What makes this film even better than just a spoof of a series is that it spoofs a phenomenon by having our characters signing autographs at `Galaxy Quest Conventions' where `trekie' type fans have gathered, and in the end they must rely on a group of these fans to save them from peril.  If you want a good time full of laughs then `Galaxy Quest' is the ride for you.  The cast, including Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Sam Rockwell, Tony Shalhoub and Daryl Mitchell are great in their roles and add much needed comic relief.  All in all it's a great attempt at a parody.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>What happens when the only good part of your acting career was a show that was cancelled many years before?  Well, if it was a science fiction show, you can relive your character at science fiction conventions.  That is what has happened to the cast of Galaxy Quest and they are not particularly happy about it.  Then they get a second chance.<br /><br />Aliens far out in space have intercepted Earth's television signals.  As they have no concept of fiction, they believe the shows are reality.  They have decided to base their society on that seen in Galaxy Quest.  They are peaceful but at war with another species that is anything but.  They think their only hope is the crew from Galaxy Quest.  They have seen them defeat evil on countless occasions.  They have now come to Earth to enlist the crew.<br /><br />The cast finds themselves in a real life and death struggle deep in space.  While they know they are only actors, they get talked into helping.  Plot complications, humor, and plenty of action keep the ball rolling right to the end.  What could easily have been a movie based on one bad joke is really so much more.  Science fiction fans will get a lot of in jokes and cliches but non-fans can also enjoy the movie fully.

Both are masterfully presented through a brilliant screenplay, a clever script, and first class acting.<br /><br />The film follows the lives of burnt out TV actors collectively representing the actors and characters in Star Trek.  Tim Allen  plays Jason Nesmith who stars as Commander Peter Quincy Taggart;  Sigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco who plays Lieutenant Tawny Madison; while Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane who plays an alien named Doctor Lazarus.  Each actor is fed up with the convention tours but needs to make a living somehow.  Unbeknownst to them, earthlings are not the only ones who watch their show.  A group of aliens facing imminent peril from their galactic enemies are desperately in need of help and, unable to distinguish the show from reality, hope that Commander Taggart and his crew can come to the rescue. What follows is a side-splitting adventure for the hesitant actors who now have to pilot the fully operational replica of their TV ship built by their alien suppliants.<br /><br />This is really a great comedy the likes of which I had not seen in years.  The screenplay and script is brilliant in its combination of both parody and satire.  The acting by every single actor was hillarious.  The only comparable spoof on Star Trek that I'd seen was on SNL when the Enterprise becomes a diner.

The year 1999 has had some of my favorite movies, including &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;October Sky&quot;. &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is in that list.<br /><br />There was a TV series called &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; which is the story of the NSEA Protector and it's crew - &quot;Commander Peter Quincy Taggart&quot; played by Jason Nesmith (played by Timm Allen), &quot;Lt. Tawny Madison&quot; by Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), &quot;Dr. Lazarus&quot; by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), &quot;Tech Sergeant Chen&quot; by Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and &quot;Lieutenant Trek Laredo&quot; by Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell). But after four years, the show was cancelled, leaving the actors and actresses without any jobs. Twenty years later, at a convention center, they meet up with aliens Commander Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees), Quellek (Patrick Breen), and Laliari (Missi Pyle). They are from the alien race Thermians (or Termites! (you'll have to watch the movie to understand!)) and having mistaken the Galaxy Quest TV show for 'historical documents', they request the 'crew' to help them negotiate the terms with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs). But of course, things don't go they way they seem since the actors are now playing for their lives! And with the help of Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), if you could call him 'help', and Galaxy Quest fan Brandon (Justin Long), they set out to save the universe.<p>Witty and funny, this movie will keep you in stiches throughout the whole 1 hour and 42 minutes of it! Acting is marvelous with Tim Allen as the 'raving ego-maniac', Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Gwen (watching her you won't be able to believe that she's in her 50's!!), and Alan Rickman as the serious English actor. <p>Though there's nothing bad about this movie, there are some innuendos and some bad language henceforth the PG rating. But not only that I don't think kids will really understand it or even get most of the jokes. More likely teenagers and adults will enjoy this movie much more. I'm most certain by the time you've watched this movie a couple of times, you'll be reciting all of the funny lines from the movie (my family does all of the time!)</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Galaxy Quest was a very popular TV show from the late 70's, but the actors have not been able to move on with their careers and live on personal appearances.

Now, they must learn to deal with each other and technology they made up to stay alive and save the Thermians from the evil Sarris who wants to destroy them all.<p>This movie is a must for Star Trek fans, but non-Trekkies will enjoy the humor as well. It manages to make fun of every aspect of the series, including the fans, while still using these elements to further the story. The cast gives a wonderful performance as actors out of their element trying not to give away who they really are to the aliens they have befriended. I find myself laughing all the way through this movie every time I watch it. And the deleted scenes on the DVD are as funny as anything in the movie.<p>This is a pleasant comedy that should appeal to all ages.

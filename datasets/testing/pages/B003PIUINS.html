Whether it's totally credible or too gory, it packs a wallop.  Director David Ellis' choreography of the opening pileup is devastating.  I found myself cringing as each vehicle rammed into the other; the sound was incredibly realistic.  A damned good opening for a film that is far superior to its predecessor.  Why that works, at least for me, is that the deaths are staged so carefully, how one coincidence after the other, adds up to ironic fatalities.  Take for instance the scene where David Paetkau as the lottery winning Evan sets in stage his doom.  He almost falls over toys scattered in the hallway; he throws some old spaghetti out of his window; knocks a magnet into the remaining spaghetti; and it just goes on.  He gets his new Rolex stuck in the sink's garbage disposal; sets the place on fire, manages to get out the apartment on the fire escape...and then, well won't spoil what happens then.  The incident with the pigeons is likewise eerily staged.  At each point you expect something to happen, it doesn't, and when the final denouement occurs, you sit there with jaw agape, wondering how this could happen.  The cast while certainly not Oliviers or Streeps, is adequately embodied:  Ali Later returns as Clear River, the survivor from the first film; A.J. Cook is a strong lead as Kimberly--she uses her eyes very well; Jonathan Cherry as the cocaine addicted Rory is an affable, if somewhat of a loser; Lynda Boyd as Nora faces a grim scene in the elevator that is equally frightening in its tenacious grip on suspense; Keegan Connor Tracy as the somewhat dimwitted Kat finds out the hard way about airbags; and Michael Landes as the dashing young cop is effectively charming.  Although the &quot;Carrie-ish&quot; ending is predictable, it still packs an &quot;explosive&quot; finish.<br />This is a real treat for fans of movies where the suspense is laid out with signs and foreshadowings.  I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>As a horror film sequel, one of the great graveyards in the realm of cinema, &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; holds up pretty well.  Of course when you basis of comparison are to revisionist films like &quot;Halloween 2&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot; along with films that have no conception of what worked in the original like &quot;The Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,&quot; the bar is set pretty low.  The sequel to &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; had a good idea, but botched what to do with it.  The makers of &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; had enough sense to take what worked in the original and give it a slight twist.<p>On the first anniversary of Flight 180 there is the most horrible chain of highway accidents in the history of movies.  Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) is the last to die and then suddenly realizes it was all an instantaneous premonition.  Like the hero of the first film she is able to find confirmation that she has a glimpse of what is about to happen within arm's reach.  She takes direct action to spare the lives she had just seen lost and round two of this particular dance with death is underway.  <p>On the one hand all you really need to know is that if you liked the original &quot;Final Destination&quot; you will not be grossly disappointed by the sequel.  Once again you have Death coming after the people on his list by channeling the spirit of Rube Goldberg.  This sequel plays with its audience by constantly making you think you know exactly how the next victim is going to kick the bucket and then pulling a last second switch.  The other difference of substance has to do with the relationship between this final and the original, which turns out to be something more than the return of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter).  However, the biggest difference is that this time around the characters are hip to the constant foreshadowing that presages each gruesome demise (Death is apparently a frustrated movie director).  <p>You could say this is going too far in changing the rules of the game and off the top of my head I do not remember if there was as much foreshadowing as in the original.  A return visit to the creepy guy at the morgue reveals a new bit of information that comes under the &quot;Something I would have liked to have known earlier&quot; (like in the first film) category.  But if the alternative is rehashing the original film with a new set of exercises in creative killing, then these new wrinkles are acceptable twists.  &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; is not as much fun as the original, which is par for the course, but it is not an insult to the audience that liked the first film either.  You also have all the fun Infinifilm options on the DVD so that you can understand the meaning of every name in the film (e.g., Kimberly CORMAN as in Roger Corman, director of "Dementia 13" and other classic cheapo exploitation splatter flicks).  <p>Final Note: &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; meets my definition of gratuitous nudity, which is when the half-naked person is not one of the main characters but somebody who shows up just to provide the nudity (compare this with &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot; as an example of non-gratuitous flashing).</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>It is refreshing to see a film that innovates.  The last film to do that in the horror genre was "Scream".  "Final Destination" has introduced an inventive approach to the genre, giving it a supernatural killer rather than a lunatic slasher dressed up in some kind of costume.  Using "Death" as the killer opens up myriad possibilities for the method of death and choice of victims.  This film was excellent at presenting the supernatural stalker's manipulation of the physical world to find murder weapons in everyday objects.  While the concept of Death taking people from earth is hardly new in films, the idea of Death as a malevolent attacker that has a plan that can be outwitted is a novelty.<p>This film is the germination of an interesting direction, but does not bring the concept to maturation.  It is unsophisticated in its storytelling and the characters lack subtlety and realism in their reactions to their situation.  They are undifferentiated from their hollow horror counterparts in that regard, just fodder for the beast.  <p>Director James Wong, who has mostly TV credits on his resume, breaks into feature films with a vengeance.  From the standpoint of the photography and visual effects, the film was excellent.  His camera perspectives were creative and lent greater force to the suspense.  His crafting of the scenes was less effective.  The prescient clues to the next murder lacked nuance.  There were no surprises except perhaps the last murder.  The formula was always the same, Alex predicts a murder and then rushes frantically to prevent it with mixed results.<p>As is often the case in this genre, the acting had a broad range from terrible to very good.  Devon Sawa was excellent.  He gave his character much more range and depth than we are used to seeing from horror heroes.  He was the closest to having genuine human responses to the tragedies, at least in the beginning of the film.  Ali Larter was good as Clear, but her character didn't have much range and she did little to expand the envelope.  The same is true of Kerr Smith whose character had even less dimensionality.  On the awful side, there were Daniel Robuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the hapless FBI agents and Tony Todd as the completely implausible undertaker.<p>This was an entertaining film and a terrific story concept.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a must-see for horror fans, but still enjoyable for a broader audience.  Few films of this genre have the potential to improve in the sequel.  This may be one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>This was, a interesting movie well the things Alex saw were scary and he saw the future the plane it scared me, well this movie is worth watching! Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>I have never been so on the edge of my seat as much as i was while watching this movie....when it was finished, I felt pain in my hands and looking down I realized all of my fingernails were gone and I am not joking. This was the scariest film I have ever seen. I found myself yelling at the screen and screaming in terror, and I being a horror freak who has seen much worse. THe subject of death however is one that scares me and this movie was designed to scare....I seriously do not understand how people could not enjoy this movie...it was great and one I totally recommend....this DVD is a keeper!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I couldn't help quoting Sue Sylvester (pun intended) on this one.<br /><br />I'm such a gLeek!<br /><br />Anyways, onto the movie in question...I can't really recommend any of the ludicrous sequels (all of which feel stale and blatantly uninspired in comparison), but I can and will say that the original 2000 `Final Destination', while flawed, is a lot of fun, if by fun you mean a creepy, disturbing frightfest.<br /><br />Yes, that's what I mean.<br /><br />The story is pretty basic, if a little (or a lot) far fetched.  A kid has a paranormal vision of the plane he is on going down in flames.  When he wakes he panics and soon he, and seven others, is ushered off the plane.  Then the Paris bound aircraft takes off, and then explodes.  These lucky individuals have just cheated death, but death doesn't like being cheated and so, one by one, each of the survivors are picked off in eerily mysterious (and painfully manipulated) ways.  Soon, the kid with the vision (his name in the movie is Alex) starts putting two and two together and realizes that they are being killed off in the order they would have died on the plane (really?) and so they have to work together to continually cheat death and start the cycle over again.<br /><br />The cast is decent, but rather uninspired when you consider the genre and the casts of other films of this nature.  None of these `stars' went on to a noteworthy career.  Sawa all but disappeared (well, he did disappear) and Ali Larter may have done `Heroes', but then she did Beyonce, or Beyonce's husband ("I'll show you crazy") so, I mean, you get my point.  The cast is mediocre at best.<br /><br />When your most successful star is that pervert from the `American Pie' movies then you know you're in trouble.<br /><br />The film is propelled by the elaborately and ridiculously intense death scenes that layer the film.  Whether a boy is getting ready to take a shower or a teacher is preparing some hot tea, this film knows how to layer on the tension.  The deaths are all different, come textured, some shockingly sporadic (that bus came out of nowhere!) and they all hit their mark effortlessly.<br /><br />That's why you watch these `slasher' movies anyways, right...for the diverse death scenes.<br /><br />The ending (in the cabin) gets rather sloppy and a tad overdone, but for the most part this film is slick and unique.  I hate what it turned into (the sequel was decent, but the third and fourth films just feel like cheap reenactments of this film, with no real life to them), but I'm happy with this film as a whole.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it.  If you are a fan of the genre (this is no `Scream', but it's on par with `Urban Legend' or the original `I Know What You Did Last Summer') then this is one you won't want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>From the commercials, one could easily believe that Final Destination is simply a retelling of the first story.  In other words, a group of people cheat death and then are hunted down by death to set things right.  But that would be wrong.<p>At first it seems that this is true.  A young woman has a vision of a terrible highway accident and refuses to get on the highway.  The people stuck on the ramp behind her do not get caught in the accident.<p>Unlike the first movie, Death does not wait.  No one-month hiatus here.  Saved victims immediately begin to drop.  But again, this is not just more of the same.  These people share a secret that they don't know about.  A secret you will have to see the movie to find out.<p>Another difference is that there is more hope in this movie.  Two characters return from the first movie; the only survivor and the mortuary worker.  But there are more scenes of death not happening, of death happening in more unexpected ways and a little less of the Rube Goldberg style accidents (although I liked the pool ball and mousetrap).<p>Although the gore is a little more obvious (typical in a sequel) the plot is somewhat better due to the additional dimensions.  The main character is also a relief.  In the first movie, the hero sulked too much and never tried to explain things to the police.  This time we have a hero who really works at surviving and saving others.<p>A very good film for horror fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>FINAL DESTINATION is an imaginative, and thought-provoking film, a refreshing change of pace from the usual slasher films.  The movie has an incredibly ominous feel throughout and sets a mood that is sustained throughout the film.<p>Although some of the elaborately staged deaths are a bit overblown, they nonetheless are frightening and disturbing.  The scene in the beginning when the plane actually DOES blow up has an apocalyptic feel to it.  We saw what happened in Alex's pre-flight premonition, so that when the only thing we see is the plane exploding, it packs a pretty big wallop.<p>Devon Sawa does a commendable job as the accursed Alex, and Ari Lester is appropriately heroic as soulmate Claire.  It's one of the few teen movies where the actors actually looked and behaved like teens!  One death in particular, involving blonde Terry, comes out of nowhere so fast, we actually gasped when it happened.  It's been a long time since a horror movie has done that!<p>All in all, with its few flaws considered, it is a refreshing look at how death always wins.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This teen scare flick is a cut above most others. Here, it is not some crazed killer which does away with most of the cast but, rather, the fickle finger of fate that selects the next denizen of the great beyond.<br /><br />The movie starts off happily enough with a class of high school seniors about to depart for Paris. Once they board the plane, our main man, Alex, cannot quite overcome his fear of flying, as he has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up upon takeoff.<br /><br />His hysteria is such that he, as well as four other students, is escorted off the plane, accompanied by faculty members, one of whom returns to re-board the plane. No sooner does the plane take off, it blows up in mid air. It seems that fate has snatched these lucky individuals out of death's clutches...or has it?<br /><br />Their relief, at having escaped being blown up on the plane, turns to terror, as it appears that fate will not have them cheat death. The lengths that these young people go to evade fate, and the steps that fate takes to hunt them down one by one, makes for a crafty and clever thriller. Teens and adults alike will enjoy this flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Final Destination" is a pretty good flick considering that it's filed under the "Teen Slasher" title.  The concept of Death coming after those who have thwarted their fate seems fairly original to me.  I don't recall any other movie using this concept.<br /><br />As most of you probably know, the story starts out with a young man(Devon Sawa) having a vision of Flight 180, the flight he and his classmates happen to be on, exploding into a ball of flames.  He freaks out, gets himself and some of the other students and a teacher booted off of the plane and shortly thereafter, his vision becomes truth.  He's considered a prime suspect for planting a bomb on the plane.<br /><br />One by one, however, his classmates begin to die in some rather unorthodox ways.  The agents tailing Sawa happen to notice that he has been around when most of these deaths occur, further incriminating him.  Sooner or later Sawa, Ali Larter, and a few of the other surviviors realize that Death is hunting them down in the order that they should have died in the plane explosion.<br /><br />This is where the train goes off the tracks.  The plot gets a little bit loopy and things get rather silly as Death picks off the survivors one by one.  The death scenes are rather original, and some of them make you cringe for a second as Death narrowly misses his victims.  Of course, you have to wonder how Death can pull off a plane explosion, but can't manhandle a few puny high schoolers after they avert him the first time around.  Just don't take this movie too seriously, and I'm sure everything will be okay.  Look beyond the absurdities and you'll love every minute of it.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad flick.  The story, though somewhat absurd, is original and the pacing of the film is perfect.  The acting is solid, though Sawa seems a little bit stiff compared to the others.  Ali Larter does a fine job as the loner who is the first to believe in Sawa's character.  All of the death scenes are morbidly entertaining.  I'm sure everyone has heard about the scene with the bus.  If not, keep your eye out for it.  It's one of the quickest, most violent deaths I've seen in the past few years.  Also, look for the guy from "Candyman."<br /><br />Recommended to teen slasher fans who like gore more than actual scares and anyone who just wants a neat popcorn flick to kill a little time.  This one is entertaining enough to fill that need.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>While Final Destination 2 follows the plot of it's predecessor, the similarities between the films stops there.  The teen-melodrama and too good looking for their own good young stars are replaced (for the most part) with well orchestrated accident scenes and some very nice gore effects.  It all starts when Kimberly (A.J. Cook) has a premonition of a huge multi-car pile up and inadvertantly saves herself and a few others.  And then one by one, death comes calling with some over the top computer assisted and well orchestrated grisly deaths.  Ali Larter reprises her role from the first film as Clear Rivers, and Tony Todd returns in his cameo role as well.  Director David Ellis has crafted a purposely cheesy, trashy, and fun horror film that both outshines and pales in comparison to the original; and while it is very graphic and grisly for a mainstream horror film, it is never too mean spirited.  The Infinifilm DVD is another fine piece of product from New Line (although I personally like the Platinum Series of DVD's more), and the Bits &amp; Pieces featurette provides enough ample entertainment for horror afficiandos.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / New Line - Warner / Region Free<br />VC-1 BD-25 / AACS<br />Aspect ratio: 1.78:1<br />Running time: 1:38:02<br />Movie size: 20,306,337,792 bytes<br />Disc size: 22,792,510,156 bytes<br />Total bit rate: 27.62 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 21.30 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  1644 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 1644 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />Subtitles: English (SDH), Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 20<br /><br />#Audio Commentaries<br />#Deleted Scenes<br />#Featurettes<br />--A Look at Test Screenings (SD - 13 minutes)<br />--Premonitions (SD - 20 minutes)</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is a rather creative and fun film which showed scariness without relying on monsters, werewolves, or serial killers. Rather, it focuses on the scariest thing of them all - Death. How do you escape Death once he has his sights on you? How do you escape a force which no walls, key, or lock can bar away? Well... you could try to outsmart him, and that is exactly what this group of young people try to do when one of them has a premonition which saves his friends from an accident which they were destined to die (hence the title of this movie, which serves as a non-dirty double etendre)<br /><br />Overall a creative and imaginative horror movie which eventually spawned a whole series of sequels, but you simply cannot go wrong with the original Final Destination. A must-see!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I love FINAL DESTINATION (the crash of flight 180, Tony Todd as the mortician, Ali Larter! etc.) and FD2 (the interstate disaster, Ali Larter's return, Tony Todd again!). I also enjoy FD3 (the roller coaster catastrophe, Tony Todd's voice for the devil, Mary Elisabeth Winstead). I'm not a big fan of the cheeezy THE FINAL DESTINATION (FD4). I'm just sick of the whole cgi-laden, just-for-3D stuff! Enough w/ the debris flying at me!

I mean, all the scenes that are supposed to build to a dramatic tragic death because it's that persons time to leave this world according to death... these particular moments always felt rushed to me with not much of an interesting build up getting to them.  It's like the writers didn't feel like building to the suspenseful moments this time around.  Much lazier writing compared to the first Final Destination.<br /><br />Besides that, the graphic visuals of the deaths themselves are probably better than in the first one because they look so dang cool and violent, and the movie as a whole is right in between the first and third Final Destination movies as far as enjoyment is concerned.  The original will always be the best one because it had great atmosphere and a somewhat original storyline.<br /><br />Still, thinking aboug death and the big questions in life such as whether you are supposed to die at a certain time during your life will probably enter your mind as you watch Final Destination 2 and think about your own future.  I guess this is such a huge and mysterious question we can't help but wonder the answer to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>How does one follow a surprise low-budget smash? In Hollywood, when that makes a boatload of money, you make a sequel. In the case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780631684">Final Destination</a>, you clone it. Two years after the original, a whole new batch of teens and an adult or two narrowly miss kissing Death on the lips when one of them has a premonition. This time, it's a calamitous multi-vehicle pileup on an expressway, filmed with violent collision force. The premonition gets Mr Reaper all p-o'd and he comes back for round two.<br /><br />Did you see the first? Then you have a good idea where "Final Destination 2" will go. Ali Larter is back for a significant role as the counselor to the new crew of the walking dead. The cast of actors is the usual bunch of relative unknowns, so what you're really watching for is the creative kill scenes. FD2 delivers in that division, even with some bizarrely bent bits of humor. The plot is boilerplate (as is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2HS6">Final Destination 3)</a> and you get to play with the tension. Beach Blanket Reaper Bingo? Sure. It may be the lowest of the three movies (first, third then second), but if this is your way to waste your time on a weekend, it will be fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Final Destination starring Devon Sawa and Ali Larter is pretty far-fetched but enjoyable to watch.

The film is lot of fun and I can't wait to see Final Destination 4 in 3-D next year.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>The basic theme of the movie of the whole final destination franchise remains the same. The concept that death is an unstoppable force and inevitable law of nature, is well known to us but the final destination franchise brought to us in a big hollywood motion picture environment, the concept that if the plan of death is altered then death corrects itself by creating random and freakish circumstances to get those persons anyway who were doomed in the first place. All three final destination films play on the theme that if you mess with the plan of death then a very gruesome death is anyway inevitably in store for you. When it comes to final destination, it is more useful to compare all three movies in the franchise. In 2, the director is not the same as 1 and 3. But 2 is pretty dramatic of all the 3 movies but it lacks a strong and convincing ending. In all three films the plot idea is that there is a first act pivotal piece scene, where a permonition by a lead character saves the lives of people who were to meet certain death. Now these people who escaped death will now die in the exact order in which they would have died in the first place if Death's initial plan had not be altered. In 1 this pivotal scene was an airplane explosion, in  2 it is an amazing and very convincingly shot freeway pile up and in 3 it is a very realistic looking rollercoaster mishap. For the initial first act, of all three films I feel the freeway pileup in 2 was the most intense and convincing start out of all three films in the franchise. From a standpoint of gore, I would say number 3 had the most realistic looking bloodfest. From a standpoint of originality, 1 was the freshest being the first in the series. Final destination 2 had the basic weakness in its ending in trying to make the main characters survive, they came up with this unbelievable idea that new life cancels out the need for death to take life. This plot idea is inserted to give a good ending to 2. But the strongest movie of the franchise in terms of the original concept of final destination and which works is movie 3 because its gives the message we got in 1 that you cannot escape death. 3 has a number of set piece scene sequences. The roller coaster mishap, a festival fireworks display gone wrong and a final amazing metro train crash. In summing it up Movie 3 is better than movie 2 is better than movie 1. After 1, we all know the franchise plot, we know they will all die one by one, but the fun in the series is that given a set of props on the scene, we are kept guessing which freaky set of circumstance and permutations is going to mutate itself into creating a noose for one of our characters.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Final Destination 2 (David R. Ellis, 2003)<br /><br />The original Final Destination was a hackneyed, if clever, take on the slasher film-- what if the killer was Death itself? The surprise success of the movie, which gained an audience well beyond the usual slasher-film groupies, immediately had the studios hunting up ideas for a sequel. It should be no surprise by now that Hollywood + sequel = junk.<br /><br />In this one, one year to the day after the explosion of Flight 180, Kimberley Corman (Tru Calling's A. J. Cook) is on the way to Daytona Beach with her friends when she has a vision of a horrible accident on the highway, and refuses to budge from the on-ramp. Needless to say, the accident happens, and everyone who got stuck behind her on the onramp is now set to be stalked by Death. Kimberley and her new love interest Burke (Hart's War's Michael Landes), the cop who was trying to figure out why she wasn't merging, try to figure out how to cheat death, enlisting the help of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the sole survivor of Flight 180. (Yeah, that confused me, too. There's an Alien 3-style revelation about Devon Sawa's character about a quarter into the movie.) Clear gets our old pal Bludworth (Tony Todd) involved as well, and we're off to the races.<br /><br />I have to admit, I give the movie grudging props for not going where I feared it was going to go (Tony Todd battling it out with Death in a steel cage match), but man. I can almost see the board meetings on this one. "So we have all these ideas for how to kill people. Story? Who cares?" And that's basically what you get. I also have to say that the final scene in the movie is worth the price of admission by itself. Which is good, because nothing else about the movie is. **</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>If you don't come to this dopey film expecting anything more than some inventively gory deaths, you should have a good time.  The whole convoluted business about the need for Death to balance its books whenever someone is saved from their predestined demise is preposterous, but the Rube Goldberg nature of some of the killings is kind of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>(Don't look it up, a scythe is that big bladed thing the "Grim Reaper" claims lives with.  You can look up Rube Goldburg though; I don't feel like explaining him).<br /><br />So let's get to the point, "how can a stupid movie get 4 stars?  How can a stupid movie be clever?  I'm sure this has happened before, but let me explain why I like this stupid movie/DVD as much as I did; ** = mild spoiler.<br /><br />What makes it stupid?<br />-suspend disbelief very hard.  Psychic phenomenon is pretty well documented, but never in such an extreme or systematic way as far as I know.  I really had no problem with this aspect of the film.<br />-**A mortician who just happens to know way too much.  This guy appears in one scene out of the blue.  He basically is good friends with death and so, knows how everything works.  Oh, and he's a real nut job to boot.  This was the single most stupid and overly convenient caveat in the film.<br />-**Death as a shadowy entity was really not necessary.  This aspect kind of dumbed things down a little too much.  I expect some dumb stuff in horror films.  This was overt and lame.<br />-Some of these kids hate each other and we never know why.  This is probably my single biggest beef about the acting/script/story.  The whole rivalry thing was forced and over-blown (and otherwise unnecessary).<br />-The authorities, as usual, are idiots; Very clich&eacute;.<br />-One giant plot hole **(In what order did the other passengers die?).<br /><br />So, what makes it clever?<br />-**The entire concept of cheating death and the rules that go with it.  The mortician conveniently explains the rules and the kids go with it.<br />-**The methods of making people un-alive (here's where Rube Goldburg comes in).  One little act or defect leads to a ridiculous and entertaining chain of events.  Trying to stop death is like playing wack-a-mole the size of a pool table.  You had better be quick.<br />-Despite the "hate" thing, emotions and dialogue usually seam reasonably believable.  Different personalities react differently; Decent acting for a film of this type.<br />-Special effects are well done.  You may never again want to fly after seeing the opening sequence.<br />-Overall, a well made quality production.<br /><br />About the DVD:<br />-limited extras; lame deleted scenes, "when will you die?" game (always march 19th no matter what I put in), "are you psychic?" game, Good documentary about a psychic investigator in California.<br />-An insert.  No, really.  An actual paper insert.  These days; stunning.<br />-screened image on disk (again, stunning.)<br />-good sound, good image.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>After forseeing a massive car wreck teenager Kimberly prevents the accident by blocking the cars from merging with her truck, causing Death to take revenge.<br /><br />I enjoyed bits of the film. Not a big fan of teen scream films, but I thought Kimberly and the police officer character were entertaining and sympathetic characters. Also the scene at the dental office.... Yikes!<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it a 3. I guess I've outgrown watching films where seeing characters die in various different ways is the primary theme. This film needed more suspense and plot to really entertain me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Like music "scenes"; from hair metal to grunge to nu-metal to garage rock, films as well have their eras. 80's masked killers slashers (Halloween) to the 90's teen slashers (Scream) to the Japanese remakes (The Ring) to the current era which is the uber-gory films (Hostel). Final Destination plays with the teen slasher conventions a little bit (before they fell into the uber-gory camp with the sequels) but ultimately it still fits and despite some problematic script issues, it's still an effective horror film at times.<br /><br />Alex Browning is a kid in a French class boarding Flight 180 en route to Paris. Just after takeoff, the plane's side rips off and it explodes. Of course it wasn't real as Alex just had a premonition and his erratic behavior and rantings of planes exploding is met with hostility from 5 of his classmates, his teacher and the staff and they're forced off the plane. Imagine everyone's shock when the plane actually indeed explodes in mid-air. But Death is mad as the all-powerful beings grand scheme of when people die was disrupted so he's hunting them one by one.<br /><br />Main issue with the script is that the premise is intriguing but let's face it: it's still an oddball concept. Why would Death have flaws in its plan, even if we could see the signs? You'd think someone who has such a foresight and knowledge of fate wouldn't have things mess up easily. Alex almost becomes a gifted crime fighter with his know-how on how to beat death but it's a horror movie and it never makes sense. Plus he catches on incredibly quick to the idea that Death is playing hitman now that it seems kinda laughable he figured it out at all.<br /><br />In a way, Final Destination reminds me of the first 2 Jurassic Parks while its sequels are like the third Jurassic installment: there's a sense of seriousness with this one and the Spielberg films whereas part 2 and 3 basically made it a thrill-ride and the gore almost becomes the reason to see it whereas this film was based on atmosphere and it does have a sense of foreboding. Now the very environment is threatening and anything can bring about someone's doom instead of a dude in a hockey mask.<br /><br />Is it enjoyable? Sure. It's maybe not a great film through and through but as a horror film, it does its job well.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>In the first Final Destination a young man has a vision about an airplane crashing on takeoff.He and a number of his friends get off the jet and survive the crash.After surviving the crash they begin dying one by one.The character played by Ali Larter is the only survivor.She has<br /><br />been institutionized and has escaped her appointment with death.In the second movies Kimberly(played by A.J.

The way the characters die is just funny! My favorite has to be when the guy escapes the fire in his apartment and goes down the emergency ladder and the ladder stops before it gouges his eyes, he says Oh man that was close and he's smiling then wham! Right on his eyes, and the corpse is still smiling. Funny movie, too silly to be taken seriously, the sad thing is that I don't think they intentionally ment this as a comedy, and what about the end of the movie when they have an arm for dinner, if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, can that be really considered scary? It's stupid to take this movie seriously. Watch this movie if you want to laugh, because if you watch it for a horror fix like its intended, this movie just plain stinks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>Having enjoyed the first Final Destination film, I bought this one. I find this one is better than the first. This time, we see 8 strangers who barely escape a horrible vehicle accident due to a girl's preminition. Putting a rift in death's design, like in part one, these people now have something in common.... trying to figure out how to cheat death again. With cool death scenes and good gory, bloody effects, along with good special effects, Final Destination 2 is worth watching. Not boring, not silly but entertaining. I'd recommend seeing this film. I don't think you will be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Final Destination 2" picks up one year after the original flick ended.  By now, all but one of the original survivors of Flight 180 have died in freak accidents.  The only survivor, Ali Larter's character, is safely tucked away in a padded cell.  The movie begins with, and I know this will shock you, a huge pile-up on the highway.  Instead of a young boy having a premonition, it's a young girl this time.  She attempts to stop the accident and, another shocker, she survives, as well as a small group of strangers who have nothing in common except for the fact that they were still breathing even though Death meant for them to be pushing up daisies.<br /><br />What ensues is similar to the original.  The young girl seeks out the help of Larter and manages to gather all of the survivors from her premonition in an attempt to thwart Death.  One by one they are picked off in some rather original death scenes.  There are excessive buckets of blood, impalings, decapitations, and even a wicked fence.  The only twist in this flick is that the creepy undertaker from the original(the guy from "Candyman") leaks out that only new life can stop Death's cycle. Other than that, the victims attempt to determine who'll die next, look for warning signs, and try to stay safe.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first flick, you'll probably like this one.  In fact, I enjoyed this one more than the original because of the fancy and fiendishly funny ways that Death whoops up on his victims.  From pigeons to PVC, Death uses everything at his disposal to take out his prey.<br /><br />Like I said, you'll like this if you liked the first one, just don't expect to be taken away by the acting, effects, etc.<br /><br />Recommended to those who love gorefests and somewhat funny "horror" flicks(though there isn't anything too "horror" about this one).</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Having seen part 2 before i'd seen this one, i have to say, that the seaqull was much better IMO!

Before he enters it, he starts seeing visions, premonitions and strange allucinations that force him to believe that something is terribly wrong. That feeling is enhanced when he enters the plane, and suddently feels that it is about o explode. So, Alex goes hysterical and leaves the plane along with six people, and afterwars it (surprise!) explodes. This is just the beginning of the process, as Alex soon discovers that death will be back to take the lives of those who escaped the explosion.<p>The concept is interesting and, although most of the movie`s strenght relies in its more nightmarish/ paranoid first twenty minutes, director James Wong ("X-Files", "Milennium") still knows how to keep things going in a surprising way. The death scenes are not only creative and thrilling, but also darkly comic. The atmosphere is gloomy with some appropriate blue tones, the score efficient and the acting satisfying. The character development could be better, but it`s still decent, and the timing and suspense are good.<p>This, like "Scream", is an edgy, clever picture, that also goes for the tongue-in-cheek approach (especially in the second half) and a fine horror movie about Generation X (it even has a dark, unsettling, mysterious mood).<br />A good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>The original Final Destination was an interesting twist on the teen slasher flick:  instead of some standard masked killer picking off people one by one, it was Death itself doing the job, an invisible but definitely intelligent presence who is unbeatable because it cannot be directly battled.<p>As in the original movie, the sequel begins with a character having a premonition of a disaster and then avoiding it, saving her life and those of a few other people.  Death, however, will not be cheated, and starts picking off the reprieved.  Apparently, cause of death is important:  if you were meant to die in an accident, you will not die of natural causes.  Most of the movie is a series of killings and near-misses, with the cleverness coming in the way Death sets up the kills.  If Rube Goldberg had been a serial killer, the contraptions he developed would have fit right into this film.<p>Unlike the first movie, the characters are aware as to what is going on, having heard of the earlier story.  It doesn't really help; the only vague help they get points to cheating Death by having a new life that was unplanned for come into the world.  To me, the solution would be to have the male and female leads have a kid, but the film goes off in another direction.<p>For what is basically a slasher flick, the violence itself is rather tame.  The director seems to shy away from the gore, with the worst of the scenes almost flashing by.  Instead, the focus is on suspense...we know these people are going to die (except maybe the main characters), we just don't know how or when.  For fans of the first movie (which is the obvious audience of this film), this sequel should be an equally pleasing experience, and even if you have not seen the original, this one can be fun.  While not a classic, Final Destination 2 is clever and entertaining enough to rate four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>This is a &quot;killer&quot; teen movie with a new twist.

I mean the teen actors were ridiculous. Totally unbelievable. The death scenes (well most anyway) are scary because they are pretty realistic. But in the end it's a slasher film with nods at the FAR superior The Omen. But it's not to bad. The sequel is pretty lame, but the gore makes up for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>The gore is all this film has going for it. Okay well the crash scene is very unsettling, because it's so real looking, and pile ups happen everyday, but then it goes downhill from there. The hilarious and mean spirited ending is also a plus. The film unfortunately packs one cliche after another. It's another slasher film, and what's funny about it, is that it is trying to scare you, and at that it fails miserably. Plot? Well if you've seen the first, this is exactly like it, except this one has more gore. If you haven't seen the first, then you have no business watching this one then. Remember sequels are just a cash in and not a movie of itself. Sorry Hollywood, visuals and gore only produce chuckles, and not screams. Mess with our mind, and don't put us to sleep. But there are far worse out there so I have to say this one isn't that bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>While watching Final Destination 2 (2003) this past weekend I got the feeling the makers of the film just really didn't respect the first film all that much.  It's hard to explain, but the film had a feel of not so much complimenting the original, but trying to one up itself as if to say `This is how it should have been done' fostered by the sense of someone taking the parts they thought worth saving, tweaking them (i.e. adding a lot more gore), and then making up the rest as they went along.  And that annoyed me a little as I thought the first film was an altogether relatively thoughtful little film with a good dose of originality and just a whole lot of fun...directed by stuntman turned director David R. Ellis (Cellular) and written by the team that also did The Butterfly Effect (2004), the film stars A.J. Cook as Kimberly Corman, a young woman with a strange gift (or curse, depending on your point of view).  Also appearing is Michael Landes (he played Jimmy Olsen in the television show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman), Terrence 'T.C.' Carson (U-571), Lynda Boyd (Bones), and Jonathan Cherry (House of the Dead).  Reprising their roles from the first film are Ali Larter (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and Tony Todd, who also played the title role in the Candyman films.<br /><br />The story takes place about a year after the events that took place in the first film.  It turns out Kimberly (Cook), much like Devon Sawa's character of Alex from the original, is having premonitions about those around her, visions that foretell their impending demise which allows her to warn those doomed individuals allowing them to cheat death...but death doesn't give up, especially on those who escape its cold, bony grasp...in fact, those who manage to stay one step ahead with Kimberly's help invariably suffer an even worse fate than originally planned for them as death seems to hold a grudge against those who try to weasel out of their predetermined destinies.  Anyway, after saving a group of motorists from a fiery and twisted metal highway death, Kimberly tries to make sense out of what happened, but few are willing to believe her fantastic story and the relationship to the events of the past, specifically the freak accidents that killed nearly all the survivors of the flight 180 disaster a year ago...that is until they themselves begin getting picked off one by one in a series of events that would make Rube Goldberg proud.  This drives Kimberly to enlist the help of the one surviving member of the original group in that of Clear Rivers (Larter), who's currently a resident of the local mental institution, but that may not be enough as the Grim Reaper is a persistent, cunning little monkey who always gets the cheese...certainly aided a few times throughout the film by the compete stupidity of the intended victims (check out the character of Evan, the young man driving the Trans-Am...this Mensa candidate should have been drowned at birth).<br /><br />If I've learned anything from Final Destination 2 it's that if it's your time to go, then you should go...if you try to cheat death, it will still get you in the end, and when it does the mode of your death will be much gruesome and horrible than the way you were originally intended to die...and I also learned Apple Computers must have supplied some dough for the production of the film as their product placement appears numerous times (gee, strange how all the computers in the film are of the Apple variety...I don't mind product placement in a film, but next time make it a little less obvious so I don't get the complete sense of sleazy pandering as I did here).  Did I enjoy the film?  For the most part, yes, but I did make the mistake of expecting there to be a true, continuing development of the original storyline rather than a half-hearted rehashing featuring over the top death scenes lavished with gory effects...truly, it seemed like the death sequences were immaculately designed, and then the story created later to fill in the spaces between those scenes not leading up to another spectacular macabre fatality.  In terms of the actors, well, there weren't really any memorable performances as not long into the film you realize most of them are there in the capacity of gristle awaiting the grind.  I will say I thought the director did a good job leading us down the path towards certain events (including numerous false starts), as I did feel tension welling up prior to various characters getting their comeuppance (deservedly so or not) and he really kept the pacing of the film quick, resulting in a 90 minute run time, sort of like a pleasant enough acquaintance that doesn't overstay their welcome.  Also, the death sequences were creative and elaborate, almost more so than in the first, so if that's where your interest lies, you will not be disappointed.  This film also featured one of the most spectacular multi-car crash sequences in a film I've seen in a long time.  As far as the story the links to the original seemed tenuous at best, and became kind of convoluted with the emergence of some sort of `ripple effect' theory that didn't really stick too well especially since one could make the argument that every person on the planet can be linked together through their associations.  The comedic elements are given more weight here, probably due to the lack of meaningful relationships between characters as was seen in the original.<br /><br />New Line Home Entertainment gives this film their `Infinifilm' treatment, which means they pour on the extras.  The DVD features both the anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) along with the fullscreen version, and three, count them, three audio formats including English (DTS 6.1 ES), English (Dolby Digital 5.1 EX), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo).  Extras include a fact track, music videos, deleted/alternate scenes, a commentary track by director David R. Ellis, producer Craig Perry, and screenwriters J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, along with a couple of featurettes titled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back (18:10) and Bits and Pieces: Bringing Death Back to Life (14:00).  I think my favorite parts of the special features is when director Ellis talks about how much a role his assistant Tawny Ellis (notice they have the same last name?  Because she's his daughter) played in the creative process of the film, despite her general lack of experience.  Nepotism is certainly a fact of life, but I can't help but wonder if his regularly consulting with her on whether or not certain scenes work rubbed anyone (anyone not a part of the Ellis family) the wrong way.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />One more thing...there is a Final Destination 3 in the works, scheduled for a 2006 release...</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>If you watch this on a VHS tape then you'll miss all the really gross and funny parts.

Then of course since everyone on that road was supposed to die death starts to kill them one by one like in the first film. <p>  The death scenes are incredibly gory and detailed but also seemed like ways you would've seen Kenny die on South Park. They're silly and heartless at the same time. It's like the film is trying to make death out to be funny a lot of time.

Basically, the gang is marked for death - they know it and we know it.  The thrills come into play with the when and the how.  Wong TEASES us to death with this part of the film. Great, elaborate teases arise as each character meets his/her doom. Most of the tension comes from the set-ups and they are very well done. Fun, effective and eerie.

Once they board the plane, our main man, Alex, cannot quite overcome his fear of flying, as he has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up upon takeoff.<br /><br />His hysteria is such that he, as well as four other students, is escorted off the plane, accompanied by faculty members, one of whom returns to re-board the plane.

Writer/producer/director James Wong ("The X-Files" writer fame) with producer Glen Morgen has crafted a well made and very scary movie that takes you over the edge and right for the jugulear at times even with it's horrific gore. I also like how this approaches with a modernize version of the Stephen King book "The Dead Zone" with a little of "Scream" but without being ironic or comical. The acting is very good and the thrills never disappoint including the accident scenes, this movie is one of the best and most original horror movies of the new millenium and it's sequels are worth a look too.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray bring the movie to incredible picture and sound quality like never before with great extras like audio commentaries, isolated score with commentary by Shirly Walker the composer, additional scenes with alternate ending, 2 documentaries, a featurette and trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>I actually loved this movie because it was different, well written, and very innovative.I can can only speak for myself when I say that I have never seen anything like &quot;Final Destination&quot; .I didn't want to miss a moment of this movie because I just had to know who was going to die next. I love the whole &quot;Cheating deaths design&quot; theme. Devon Sawa was great in the movie, and I thought the whole movie was great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I personally don't think it was that bad still found it entertaining i've seen worst sequels than this....it was still sticking to the so call grand design of death i just found it entertaining seeing them trying to prevent it....</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>People don't watch films like this for the plot or acting.  Good thing.  The plot is tired and the characters only exist to become death fodder.<br /><br />People watch films like this because they think its cool watching new, novel ways to mutilate two-dimensional characters.  If that is what the viewer wants, that is what the viewer gets.  From the first scenes to the last, characters are cut, slashed, burned, squashed, and otherwise wiped out.  The director does a better than average job of filming the gore.  Even though I don't like this type of film, I have to admit I was impressed with the creativity.  I didn't know there were so many ways to film accidents.  I never suspected that an exploding barbecue grill could do so much damage.  In this particular cut and slash film the director gets to kill off the characters more than once.  Now that's a lot of bang for the buck!<br /><br />I have only two suggestions.  If you are watching the film with a group of friends, get some sodas and pop corn.  If you are watching the film alone, don't waste your time going through it in the usual, slow way.  It is quit easy to predict when the cool stuff is about to happen.  Keep a finger on the remote control and zoom through the film, only slowing down for the really neat stuff.  Then you can back up to slow motion and watch it all again.  This way you can see every body get killed four times and get it done in about an hour!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I'm about to get on a plane in about 2 weeks, for the second time only in my whole life, and boy, I shouldn't have watched this movie! The other night I was bored, and decided to compare my list of DVDs to my list of DVDs I've reviewed, and discovered there's about 50 that I have not reviewed! So to get the ball rolling, I thought I'd review the first ever DVD I ever got! (It was also the first commentary I ever watched, and apart from Miss Congeniality, I'll never watch one again!)<br /><br />I'd originally seen this at the cinema, and started to get into the whole DVD phenomenon, albeit a couple of years behind everyone else. 221 DVDs later - I don't smoke, rarely drink, or do drugs, so this is my vice, and a constant source of amusement among the people I work with! I also get very much teased about liking this movie when I started college.<br /><br />This movie still scares me four years on, even though I've seen it a million and one times. I get quite jumpy, and the thought of getting on a plane after seeing this sickens me (even if it is an hour long, internal flight). The extras also freak me out, especially the quiz, which tells you the exact date you're going to die. I can't remember the exact date now, but it was quite far away. It freaked me out so much the first time I did it, I've never dared do it again, to find out if the date changes. Apart from the usual generic garbage, that's the only extra I've ever truly hated on a DVD.<br /><br />There are quite a few great actors in this, although apart from the lovely Ali Larter, they haven't done too much else in movies, or set the box offices alight. I've seen a picture of Devon Sawa from his latest movie, and he's fairly lost his OK looks from this and starring in Eminem's "Stan". Apart from Dawson's Creek, the gorgeous (his cheekbones, his eyes, nice) Kerr Smith's only reasonable 'hit' has been Cruel Intentions 3, a straight to DVD sequel sequel!!! (Which I will probably get now I know he is in it) Tony Todd is also the evil mortician guy, who was originally in Candyman. Seann William Scott also appears in a small and insignificant role and he later ends up getting brutally decapitated.<br /><br />The only good thing about the commentary was that the amount of stuff the director points out, cool little facts & stuff. The whole 9:25 stuff is absolutely wicked, and I love how they managed to incorporate it all. The woman at the check-in desk at the airport tells Alex that the plane leaves at 9:25, which is the same as his birthday (25th September). When he gets on the plane he sits in seat I (which is the 9th letter of the alphabet) and the seat is in row 25. In scenes not shown in the final cut of the movie, but in the deleted scenes Alex and Clear's baby is born at 9.25. (Which can get confusing, as Alex & Clear's relationship suddenly turns from friendly, to a more intimate relationship, without explaining why, unless you watch the deleted scenes.) There's also a luggage cart, which has 666 written on the top of it and during the very dull opening credits, all of the deaths in the movie are foreshadowed. There is a hanging doll, a guillotine, and a picture of a knife in someone's chest. Continuously throughout, music by John Denver is played, who I'd never heard of until I 'watched' the commentary, and found out about him.<br /><br />I've never understood why some people don't like this movie, but prefer the second one. It's always strange when people do that. I found the second one good, but sometimes (like now, for instance), I find I can't remember a single stand out thing about it.<br /><br />This is a great movie, and it's terrific to see a teen slasher flick with a different concept for once. Sure, they all die in same ways to other teen slasher flicks: flying heads, a girl being totally crushed by a giant bus (you NEED to watch that scene frame by frame, cos it's fantastic), a woman getting caught by 'accident' inside a house on fire and much more. Just don't attempt to do the quiz OK?</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Anyone who knows me knows how much I loathed the first movie. It was truly wretched. Though this one was surprisingly good. It had better (or just less annoying) characters that you don't want to die (the first movie made the mistake of being populated with awful characters), more inventive death attacks and developed the idea of death having a design more interestingly.<br /><br />Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) is the only remaining survivor of flight 180 and has now willingly committed herself to a rubber room to escape death's shadow. But lets herself out into the world when learning of a new disaster. A teenager (AJ Cook) on a trip with her pals has a premonition of an incredibly violent freeway pile-up (so more inventive than a distant boom in the sky; the first movie's disaster) and stalls traffic in her lane. Sure enough the pile up happens and all the drivers who she stalled should be dead too. So death begins to stalk them. But no one has any time for the warnings Clear Rivers has to offer and so death offs them in increasing gory fashion.<br /><br />It's cheesy and pure popcorn fun but you'll definitely enjoy it. If only the first one didn't exist then this would be more unique experience. Still, buying this DVD would be cool because the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and the DTS 6.1 sound are incredible. Extras consist of Audio commentary, three documentaries, Deleted/alternate scenes, Infinifilm behind-the-scenes footage, and DVD Rom stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>James Wong IV's Final Destination is a kinetic highly explosive firecracker of a horror film that has overflowing intelligence to spare. Though even more implausiable than most other Dead Teenager Films (DTM)  including: I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (Ugh!), Jason Goes to  Hell: The Final Friday (Gag!), Bride of Chucky (Pinch me am I really  awake?) and Dangerous Minds (I've fallen and I can no longer watch! ).  Wong's poetically melancholic voyage regarding the teenage conception of  human mortality, the randomness of fate, and the human philosophical  pursuit of the existence of God has much more dramatic resonsence and  emotional impact than any other other traditional slasher film in the  Scream generation of horror films. Wong allows his characters to bloom into  real terrified people that have to deal with the possibility of death  during the age of presumed teenage invurneribility. There have been several  complaints  that Final Destination indulges on self-conscious campy humor  and the overuse of conventinal Slasher movie techniques. No offense to  horror movie junkies, but the Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street,  Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and Scream series have so ingrained  random teenage death into modern pop-culture that  audiences are so  conditioned to that presentation that anything similar is too convential or  petty for their viewing. As for the film's humor, it is needed to keep the  film's somber mood at bay. Get past your overdose of cinematic filth and  give this stellar movie a chance. The film is traditional in both its  pacing and conclusion, but the film's genuine interest in theology,  philosophy, and the unique design of fate transforms this movie into a  tremendously absorbing visit into the paranormal. Horror fans- If you do  not see this splendid gem in the theaters, definitely buy the DVD or  videocassete version when it becomes available.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I loved the first Final Destination. I got the sequel for Christmas, and watched it almost straight away; eager to find out whether it was better or worse than the first one. (I know someone who HATED the first one, but liked the second, so I wasn't expecting to like it.) I've watched the first one quite a few times, so I practically know it off by heart, and sometimes even get sick of watching it. <p>But the sequel - the deaths are gorier, bloodier, and every last possible death you can think of has been used. And talk about weird and unusual deaths. Forget being run over by a bus; forget being strangled in a bath. Those are old news. There's a lot more blood; the camera is focused more on the deaths, so you see what you least expect to see. I got the feeling that someone had been looking at those health &amp; safety pictures, where you have to guess what the danger is in the picture, and then a light bulb went off above their heads. And boom, you have a film.<p>The first Final Destination threw you right into the action, and you didn't know what was happening. With a sequel, you know what's going to happen, so you sit back and say, "bring it on". It took a few minutes for the film to get started, recapping the events of the first film, and then you sit up, jaw dropping. With the deaths being more imaginative and very, very, very graphic, you didn't know what was going to happen. You just knew a lot of the cast wouldn't be appearing in the next sequel. <p>We find out in this film that Alex Browning (Devon Sawa - there's actually a very good lookalike in this!) has since died (a very mundane death) and left Clear (the brilliant Ali Larter) locked up voluntarily in a mental institution. Ali Larter is the only cast member left from the original and is up against a whole lot of unknowns, which most of the original cast were - and still are. It was great to see at least one original cast member back for more, rather than just start with a fresh new cast with no links to the previous film - but you'll have to watch the film for yourself to find out whether that's true or not. <p>The premonitions are more realistic this time, and not a brief glimpse in a window, which none of the audience watching catches. This time, you have longer dream sequences (think the plane crash dream at the beginning of the previous film), and more drawn out premonitions, where you feel like you're in the premonition. This time round, you're trying to work out exactly what's going to happen before it happens on screen. <p>This is your typical slasher movie, with a twist, and you'll find out how if you watch it - I thought this "twist" was great, and it made it all the more better. Ali Larter is a great actress, although . . . Nah, we won't go into that! <p>There are two things I'm worried about - that the directors might decide to make a trilogy, which might not be a good thing, although they could go all out and bring back Devon Sawa. And the fact that the production designer is Michael Bolton . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Would a sequel to the original Final Destination work, when viewers already pretty much know what's going to happen?  Heck yeah, as long as you have a great cast, great writing, and a talented director.  Great special effects are just the icing on the cake - and this franchise can always be counted on to deliver some of the gnarliest deaths imaginable, from the simple to the most elaborate and cinematic.  Watching this film, you can't help but reflect on the fact that there are a bazillion ways to meet your death every single day, no matter how careful you are.  It's a wonder we live as long as we do.<br /><br />It has been exactly one year since Flight 180 blew up on takeoff - and all of those who accidentally survived began their twisted tangoes with Death, who doesn't like to have his plans altered by sudden premonition-based acts.  Only one of those survivors still lives - Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), secluded inside a padded cell.  Now another young person, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook), has a terrible premonition of her own while waiting to get on a crowded freeway.  Rather than being thankful, most of the people she saves with her actions complain about the whole experience and scoff at the obvious similarities of the events of last year.  Of course, these people soon begin dying in noticeably bizarre ways.  This time, though, Death seems to be working backwards - as if trying to find a way to cheat Death again wasn't enough, Kimberly and the others have to figure out what kind of game Death is playing this time around.  Kimberly seeks advice and assistance from Clear Rivers, the great Tony Todd ramps up the macabre atmosphere of the circumstances in a wonderful cameo, and the inevitable debate over free will vs. fate among the survivors becomes academic rather quickly.<br /><br />There is a nice level of complexity to what could have been a pretty simple storyline.  Those who escaped the freeway pile-up at the start of this movie are not as random as they would appear, as there is a very special link that ties them all together.  This sequel also introduces a new survival plan for those on Death's overdue appointment list - you have to have hope, you know.  Anyway, Death and the filmmakers would seem to have spared no expense when it comes to delivering little cinematic masterpieces of destruction that manage to impress even when you see them coming.  With the exception of one rather cheesy demise, the film showcases a number of a gory, ingenious, and (if you're as sick and twisted as I am) darkly comical deaths.  This really is a great series of films that could have gone south in a hurry with the first sequel.  Instead, Final Destination 2 is every bit as good - if not better - than the original film.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>At heart, all horror movies operate on the human response to mortality.  Your average horror fan gets a thrill from the films because they are a sort of spice for life, they are the seasoning that makes the mundane parts of life all the more richer.  Watch a bunch of people get sliced and diced by a monster or madman, and that adrenaline rush makes you feel as if, on some level, you yourself have cheated death.  For awhile or more, it's nice to be alive.<br /><br />The FINAL DESTINATION films utilize the same premise, but instead of creating a defeatable or relatable villain, it makes the very act of dying the villain.  Watching the movies, it's very much like they decided that the force of Death, after a millenia of ending lives, has grown bored and has decided to put some spice into his job.  In all of the movies, Death awards a young soul with a premonition of a huge catastrophe, and when that soul saves him/herself (along with a handful of others), Death gleefully sets up cat-and-mouse games with the survivors and watches as they scream and skitter.  The question is never Will They Die?  It is How Long Can They Hold Out?<br /><br />Because everyone dies, sooner or later, and it's rarely at the hands of a zombie or a Leatherface.  Car accidents are far more common.  Fires.  Mechanical failures.  The FD films make Death a snarky, sadistic force without ever showing his face.  Instead, Death operates basically through three cards -- wind, gravity, and passive human interference -- and with these three things, he orchestrates the deaths of dozens and dozens of characters.  These films are filled with pointless scenes of people screaming that they're in control of their lives, scoffing at the idea that Death lurks everywhere.  Then they die.<br /><br />The real fun in these films lies in the complex machinations that Death sets in motion with the leak of a pipe or the flutter of a bird.  If you're expecting interesting plots, complex characters, or realistic dialogue, prepare to be HEAVILY disappointed.  In fact, these elements of the films get steadily more and more wooden and cartoonish, until by the fourth installment, they are laughably bad.  The makers know that what you're really waiting for is to watch Death do his thing, investing everything from quarters to fishsticks with a sinister menace.  To that end, I have provided here a summary of the only thing about each of these films that is worth watching: the death scenes.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780631684">Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)</a>:<br />In the first film, Death's premonition is visited upon a young student on a plane.  The ensuing plane accident (5/5) gave me nightmares for a week.  When the student leaves the plane along with others, he then experiences more premonitions (most of them cheesy reflections in windows) indicating that Death is now hunting them down.  Of all the movies, this one features the most personified version of Death.  A dark mist accompanies each death, and you can even see Death pursuing some characters, especially in a tense bathroom scene (4/5).  Some of the deaths feature complex sequences of domino-like chains (there is a catastrophic house fire (4/5) and a menacing electrical storm (4/5)).  Others are less creative (the bus and train accidents are both unimaginative throwaways (2/5)).  The final death (by sign) is a cheeky nod at the movie's premise (4/5).  Notable in this film: Death has a soundtrack, which turns out to feature, over and over again, "Leaving on a Jet Plane."<br /><br />FINAL DESTINATION 2:<br />Death isn't so hung up on music this time around, but that's okay because he's a bit more creative.  This film's opening highway accident is by far the best beginning out of any of these films (5/5), and when the storyline later ties the survivor's lives to the events of the first film, it's actually interestingly done.  Not as interesting as the deaths, though.  You've got a tongue-in-cheek apartment fire (4/5), a crushing visit to the dentist (4/5), and an unusually persistent elevator (3/5).  In one case, the jaws of life have the opposite function (4/5), and in another case a flying fence executes a mortal ballet (5/5).  There are also three explosive deaths that are a little cheap (2/5).  The characters this time around all get premonitions (again, mostly just false reflections in windows), and they spend a lot of pointless time trying to cheat Death's plan (their ideas mostly centering around a "new life").  The final scene, just as in the first film, is an over-the-top nyuck-nyuck moment.  "It's all in fun," Death seems to be saying.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2HS6">Final Destination 3</a>:<br />This time around it's a roller coaster catastrophe (4/5).  The movie has a creative idea by putting the premonitions into poorly shot yearbook photos, and Death continues to get up in people's faces with ominous/ironic songs and smug little omens (before one death, characters at a drive-in watch as the word "control" disappears from the digital menu).  The first "catch-up" death in a tanning salon is perhaps the best of the film (5/5), although there's a nicely intricate set-up later in the film that involves a nail-gun (5/5).  A runaway truck and horse and a falling sign constitute some of the film's weaker executions (2/5, 3/5, and 2/5, respectively).  Elsewhere in the film, the movie's token "I'm Gonna Live Forever!" character battles death in a weight room (4/5).  The movie concludes with an intense subway scene that is kinda cool, but also sort of a rip off as far as endings go. (4/5)<br /><br />The Final Destination [Theatrical Release]:<br />The opener here is the weakest of the franchise.  It takes place at a racing track, and so all of the subtle connections and coincidences get lost in the sprawling chaos of the catastrophe (3/5).  The premonitions this time around are ridiculously aggressive hallucinations, and they forecast some rather uncreative demises.  One man is murdered by a tow truck in a way that almost makes sense (1/5).  Another character bites it at a hair salon in a rather unsatisfying fashion (2/5).  There's a clever little two-fer where two characters simultaneously battle watery deaths, although both are almost too cartoonish to be all that scary (4/5 - car wash; 3/5 - swimming pool).  The movie's real saving grace (aside from the 3D, which does its job without much fuss) is it's final theater/mall debacle, which is witty, self-referential, and fairly intense (5/5).  The close of the movie (and, ostensibly, the franchise) is an unceremonious vehicular accident that is only notable for the X-ray vision it is finally shot in.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>** 2000. Written and directed by James Wong. Six students and a teacher manage to escape a plane crash thanks to a premonition of Alex Browning, one of them. A few weeks later, Death starts to kill the survivors one by one. FINAL DESTINATION is basically a stupid movie about a good idea. There isn't here only one smart scene or idea, it seems that the director wanted to please the teen audience by delivering another pimply shocker and that's all. In these perspective, a film like Peter Jackson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASATYO">The Frighteners (Director's Cut)</a> which handles some of the themes of FINAL DESTINATION is a masterpiece! This one is unfortunately already forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>This movie has such a stupid concept.  It's about this group of friends who are all supposed to die, but they cheat death to stay alive.  The dumb part is that they end up dying anyway, one way or another.  While driving on the road with her friends, Kimberly has a premonition of a highway pileup.  She warns everyone in the car and tells an officer of what she saw.  The officer asks Kimberly to step out of the car.  Just then an automobile transporter comes whizzing by and hits the car Kimberly was in, killing all her friends.  The people who don't die in the pileup, die one by one in mysterious ways throughout the movie.  I will give you an example of a death that happens: a guy escapes his apartment that caught fire.  He manages to get out just in time when the apartment explodes.  He steps down the ladder and slips.  He's on his back, and the ladder edge goes straight in his eye.  Most of the deaths are totally fake looking; like when a guy gets his arm cut off, then his whole body falls apart like salami.  If you're the type who gets scared very easy and you like dumb horror stories (like me lol), then this is right up your alley.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>I love this movie. It is one of the best teen horror flicks ever! A worthy tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. Get yours now.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Horror movies experienced a huge comeback in the 1990's and up through today, with successful hits, such as, "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", even the recent 'Halloween' sequels have fared much better than some of their predecessors.  However, as good as many of the recent crop of horror movies have been, they are all pretty much the same due to the villain being a person of flesh and blood, the only difference between them is the method the killer uses to dispatch his/her victims.  To shake things up former "X-Files" writer James Wong, crafted a new kind of horror film, one with the smart, sharp writing of the the 'Scream Trilogy', with talented young actors, and very unique death scenes that relied more on shock than on gore.  The biggest difference between this movie, "Final Destination" and all of the other successful horror movies of late, is that the killer is not some twisted individual, but rather Death itself, so it's not just a straight horror film, it's also a supernatural thriller.<br /><br />"Final Destination" begins with a group of seniors in high school preparing to go on their senior trip to Europe, when one of them, a kid named Alex (Devon Sawa), experiences an intense vision of the plane exploding.  When the vision ends, Alex tries to write it off as just a bad daydream, until events in reality begin to match up with events in his dream, so Alex freaks out and is removed from the plane along with a small group of kids, some friends and the others are kids that are mad that Alex is being disruptive and were removed for their threats of violence.  After being removed from the plane, and witnessing the planes take-off occur without incident, the group believes that Alex was just crazy, but then the plane explodes and Alex's vision becomes frighteningly real.  Thinking they just survived a disaster and that their lives are now safe thanks to Alex, the kids begin to adjust back to their lives.  However, Death has a different idea for this group, it seems Death has a plan, and Alex has ruined it's plan.  Now, Death is on a mission to claim the lives of the kids that got off of the plane in order to bring balance back to Death's grand design.  Knowing that he can see when Death is coming due to premonitions, Alex and his soon to be girlfriend, Clear (Ali Larter) attempt to thwart Death and save their remaining classmates.<br /><br />Unique storytelling, solid performances from the entire cast, and a seamless blend of practical and CGI effects, allows "Final Destination" to rise above many other supernatural horror movies.  What really helps "Final Destination" is the fear of when Death will strike again, and since Death is an invisible force for the most part, in some scenes Death is foreshadowed by moving shadows on walls and other objects, this just adds to the thrills and chills.  Another wise move on the part of the director, James Wong, is to not use buckets and buckets of blood like most horror movies seem to do these days, instead scare the audience with the unknown, which is way more frightening.  While not everyone's type of movie, "Final Destination" should not be written off as just another horror movie in an already long list, but instead is more of a supernatural thriller that will at least deliver a scare or two to any viewer.<br /><br />"Final Destination" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Final Destination2 starts with one of the best action scenes involving cars,trucks,logs of wood you will ever see. The first few scenes are pretty much the only good thing about the film. There on, it's a film you can skip for 10 minutes and rejoin because it's rather predictable. Besides being overdramatic in a wrong way, it seems like the ultimate film for movie watchers in their teens to go and watch at the theaters. It's not to be taken seriously as the music of the film would allow you to believe once you've seen it. I liked the scenes in which the Lotto Winner was killed mainly because I am a huge Incubus fan(they play "Vitamin" full length during it) Besides the above mentioned, the film is rather boring. It seems like that a video game with six characters all of whom are trying to save themselves from the unavoidable disaster in the form of death.<br /><br />Watch this movie if you're a curious fan like me. Noone would ever watch this movie for a second time so there is absolutely no sense in purchasing the DVD.I still can't beleive some of my friends found this film scary.It's more yawn inducing.<br /><br />Overall Grade: 4/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>"Final Destination 2," like it's predecessor, is a scary film: scarily bad. With the people knowing what signs to look for before a death occurs, there's no sense of terror: We pretty much KNOW how people are going to die. The few jump moments are put in as almost an afterthought. And the death scene at the end felt like a Monty Python gag than an actual horror film element. The cast does a descent job with what they got, but it's not enough to save this horrible horror film. For straight horror-film fans only; the rest can skip it.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: D</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>FINAL DESTINATION 2 is the follow up to the first, original FINAL DESTINATION.  Sequels, especially in thrillers or horror movies, are often very subpar compared to the original.  Many critics weren't too thrilled with this sequel but I find that it far surpasses the original.  The acting is better, atmosphere and thrills are better and more importantly it serves a purpose.  We never actually find out why death needs to correct itself in this series but FD2 does contiue ther story from the first with fresher and more interesting faces.  As for the blu ray, the original was a diasppointment but here with FD2 blu ray is put to all its best use.  The video is crip and clear with vivid colors and a clarity that pulls the viewer in.  The clarity is what was strongly missing with the original on blu ray.  The audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and it will knock your socks off.  Dialogue is  strong and present throughout and all surround speakers are put to great use when the action kicks up.  Atmospheric music is creepy and the build up of each killing scene will have you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The opening sequence is a car crash and the visual and audio presentation on blu ray is quite stunning.  And the bar is raised for the rest of the film due to its superb presentation.  I give it 4 rather than 5 stars for the video is a little dark but believe me it still hits all the right notes.  Watching this excellent film in blu ray will have you jumping out of your skin and being pulled into very entertaining thrills and chills.  This film shows why blu ray was made.  Highly recommend this film and the blu ray far surpasses the dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The first Final Destination is actually a really good horror film.  It's significantly better than the third Final Destination movie (that's the one with the carnival and roller-coaster ride segment, right?  I like this one a LOT more).<br /><br />The only flaw with this film is that the first 20 minutes start off rather predictable, but give the story some time to develop and I believe you'll find yourself really getting into it.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I found it kind of disrespectful that they'd keep playing John Denver's classic "Rocky Mountain High" throughout the film.  The song plays whenever something bad is about to happen.<br /><br />It's disrespectful because, as you probably know, John Denver lost his life in an airplane accident a few years before this movie was created and released.  The writers should have honestly picked a different song.<br /><br />Now about the storyline.  Are you the kind of person that believes you can cheat death?  If so, do you believe if you happen to cheat death that death will rear its head shortly after in ANOTHER attempt to take your life?  These are the kind of serious and curious questions that many of us probably ask ourselves, and these same questions are the reason this kind of horror is a few steps above the generic slasher kind (and honestly, slasher flicks are the kind of horror stories have been done to the point of exhaustion by this point).<br /><br />I often wonder about these questions personally, though obviously it's important not to let these questions interfere with enjoying your life.  But it makes you wonder exactly what your destiny is and when it will happen, doesn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, great horror suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>Fans of the original FINAL DESTINATION will find a whole lot of the same in this graphic retread of the first film. Story is pretty much the same. Freaky premonition causes the would-be victims of a massive tragedy to escape death but death doesn't take the loss with pride and violently hunts them down one by one.<p>A.J. Cook is our protagonist, this time, as she hunts down the only original survivor from the first film, Clear Rivers, and attempts to understand how to defeat death. Also back for the second go-around is Tony Todd as Death's mysterious messanger.<p>The return of Larter's character is uneccesarry, done more for the marquee value of the sequel than anything else. Hell, she doesn't even color her hair in this one. One thing that does help is the uncomfortable forewarning of violent death which haunts each character. The closthrophic intensity makes for some excitement, even if the story is very predictable. If you've seen the first one, you will be able to pick this one apart from the opening credits. All in all if you enjoyed the first movie and you're looking for some cheap thrills, this is worth a viewing or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>they just don't make movies like these very much anymore. an above average slasher flick where i actually had to close my eyes in some sequences. if you have a weak stomach or bladder don't watch it because you'll be spending lots of time in the bathroom. otherwise this is the best horror movie in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>"Final Destination," directed by James Wong, has an intriguing concept and a strong start. High school student Alex (played by Devon Sawa) has a horrific premonition which is ultimately instrumental in saving the lives of himself and a number of others. But have they cheated death? Or is there an even more horrible fate in store for each of them?<p>I found "Final Destination" to be an oddly uneven film. Director Wong helps create a genuinely creepy atmosphere; I especially liked the way ordinary household items and actions are invested with an ominous weight. But some aspects of the film struck me as inappropriately humorous, leading me to wonder if I was watching an intentional spoof or if the filmmakers were just slipping up in moments of ineptitude.<p>I found the tone of the film inconsistent. Were they trying to create a serious psychological drama in which the viewer is meant to care about the characters, or rather should the viewer view Alex and the others as mere fodder for yet another "slasher"-style horror pic? I was also disappointed by the ending.<p>One of the best aspects of "Final Destination" is the strong work by its ensemble cast, which includes Kerr Smith and Kristen Cloke. Sawa in particular makes a sympathetic leading man. His solid performance carries much of the film; he is definitely a young actor worth following. Give "Destination" a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>The first 20 minutes of this movie had me falling off the edge of my seat, and did not let up. A very young, and relatively unknown cast brings to life what can only be seen as an inventive and very scary screenplay. Without giving too much content away, it deals with the premise that one's time to die if accidentally missed will catch up with you, and deals with a young group of friends - one of whom has premonitions about fateful events. Gripping, absorbing with more twists than a good roller coaster, you will not be able to stop watching until the end credits. A Great Movie</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A year later after the events of Alex Brown's deal with death, a young girl ( Ali Larter) has similar psychic powers like Browns's of predicting death before it comes, she joins up with eight survivors whom escaped from a freak accident on a highway. Only she with the survivors must come up with a plan to cheat death  before it's too late for all of them.<br /><br />This sequel to the instant horror hit of 2000 is probably even more better than the original. It's got plenty of shocks and creative death scenes smothered in gore and accident scenes that are very much realistic, literally killer special effects, good acting, a well done storyline and heck, even Tony Todd The Candyman himself from the original Final Destination returns as the mortician whom knows how to conquer death.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has a good high def transfer but feels the same as the DVD and the sound is terrific.

This sequel however just reworks old ground, and the lack of surprises make it rather ordinary viewing. The premise for both movies is the same in that when it's your time to die, if you somehow "cheat" death, it stalks you in an unseen malevolent form until your number is up. The first 15 minutes of this picture portrays a horrific multiple car accident on the freeway in very graphic and gripping fashion, and promises much in the way of tension and intrigue, as our young heroin Kimberly (played by A J Cook)witnesses the events in a premonition, and prevents a handful of characters from a scheduled date with the Grim Reaper. Too many references to the previous film ensue, and the sole survivor we are told from the last story appears briefly in cameo, to help our troubled band in their quest for survival. After the opening eye candy the movie rapidly spirals into a formula driven sequence of mini subplots concerning each character, but doesn't hold the viewer enough to make you really care about what's going on. Doing a sequel is always difficult, but when one thinks about those that are succesful, they usually have a storyline independent to their predessessor, whereas this is virtually a carbon copy with just the names and locations changed. This is an OK flick, but not much more - there are a few scary moments, and the picture will probably appeal to the 18-25 demographic, who are represented in character throughout the movie. Not bad, but not as good as the first, and too few surprises to really make it work well.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Final Destination" is a fairly creepy, moderately entertaining little horror film dedicated to the proposition that, although one may not be able to exactly "cheat" death, one may be able to beat it on its own terms fair and square - provided one can figure out the rules that is.  <p>The movie begins as a group of forty high school students and three of their teachers board a plane departing from JFK on a field trip to Paris.  Immediately before takeoff, one student receives a premonition that the plane will explode moments after becoming airborne, a vision that manages to get himself and several other passengers safely off before the inevitable occurs.  But as Alex and his fellow survivors soon discover, Death is not to be avoided quite so easily, as each becomes the target of a systematic plan of elimination.<p> If the details of the initial premise sound familiar, it is probably because they match almost perfectly those surrounding the downing of Flight 103 back in 1996.  Waving aside questions of taste and propriety - is it really right to use the details of a real life tragedy as fodder for a silly little horror flick? - let us concede that "Final Destination" taps into some pretty basic fears about the uncertain, random and arbitrary nature of Death.  The idea itself is enough to make us all stop and ponder the truth of our mortality and the truly tenuous thread by which we daily cling to this thing we call life.  But like so many horror films in the modern era, the premise is better than the execution.  The various deaths depicted herein become so choreographed and preposterous in their details that they actually end up diluting some of their own ability to disturb and terrify.  Indeed, the more elaborate and high tech the death scenes become, the less creepy they seem.  We become bemused and detached when we should be cringing and empathetic.  Death simply has to work too hard in some of these scenes and the strain shows. <p>Thus, for all its originality of premise, the film, by making Death seem like nothing more disturbing than a conventional special effects showoff, robs Man's greatest enemy of his awe-inspiring and overwhelming power and sting!</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>I loved the original Final Destination so I was naturally interested in how the sequel was going to turn out (interested enough to wait for it on video anyway). As I had expected, it wasn't as good as its predecessor, but in its own right, Final Destination 2 was entertaining at most. There are good things to say about this movie, but an equal number of bad things are to be said as well. First off, the opening death scene with the massive multiple car accident was just a wicked scene. My friends and me both watched with mouths and eyelids wide open. That scene was equally as good as the Flight 180 scene in the first. The following death scenes throughout the movie were all pretty good and left you on edge. I'd say the deaths in FD2 were much more elaborate, violent and more creative than those in the first. Besides that, I thought the plotline of the film started to get outlandish and muddy after the whole "Only life can stop death with the baby that was never to be born becuase her mother was supposed to be killed before its birth" .... And it seemed really funny to me when the characters would simply come up with complicated methods of surviving death after having a premonition. Overall, I thought it was a good entertaining and bloody movie, but it's outlandish story just makes the whole thing seem rather silly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>This demented movie made me laugh so hard, somebody had to save my life.

An elaborate and complicated car crash that involved people connected to the first movie's victims was a bit farcical. Barbecues never tasted so good. Pancakes have a new meaning.

Kimberly (A.J. Cook), the picture's generic brunette cutie-pie heroine, envisions the bloodbath, then deliberately blocks an on-ramp in a panic, thus saving the lives of the half dozen people that director David R. Ellis had just featured in her vision being splattered, decapitated and burned alive.<br /><br />With all the saved drivers in police custody for no legitimate reason after the accident -- which killed a bunch of other people instead, thanks to Kimberly -- the group comes to realize this day is the anniversary of the first movie's crash. Soon they begin to fear the same fate suffered by that disaster's survivors -- a series of subsequent "accidental" and fantastical deaths.<br /><br />After a couple of them meet gruesome ends, this cross-section of sorry clich&eacute;s bands together. The skeptical soul brother, the druggie, the low-life, the foxy power yuppie (who whines, "Oh, this cannot be happening! My career it at a peak, I just met the perfect guy...") all seek out the lone asylum-dwelling survivor from "Final Destination" (Ali Larter) for advice, and try to cheat their apparent fate, armed only with some cryptic crapola notion that "only new life can defeat death."<br /><br />Repetitive scenes follow in which much screen time is burned setting the stage for horrible catastrophes that the characters then avoid by the skin of their teeth -- only to fall victim to another accident the movie only hinted at in the background of the same scene.<br /><br />If screenwriters J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress had put half the effort into fixing the embarrassingly hackneyed dialogue as they put into Rube Goldberg killings, or if director Ellis had cared to do something about the terrible acting, "Final Destination 2" might have risen above the dregs of its bottom-scraping genre.<br /><br />But they all willfully fail, in every way, to build a good horror movie around their perfectly viable and chilling concept of Death trying to prevent a domino effect of unintended saved lives. Instead they squander the movie's potential, abandoning it to tiredest of formulaic claptrap -- right down to the idiotically obligatory, sequel-baiting it's-not-over-yet finale.<br /><br />How the movie-going public hasn't become bored senseless with such tediously low-standard, so-called scary movies is beyond me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>Four friends are going to Paris for a class field trip.

The great traffic accident was the best part of the entire movie (the way it was filmed and arranged that is of course). It's ok the first 30 minutes or so, but then things begin to be boring. Let's just say; the movie is not scary, not creepy, not well acted, not visually appealing, not interesting, not much of anything actually but 90 minutes long. Though I'm not the biggest fan of the Scream-series, well, those movies are so much better. What else can I compare it to, hm... Wrong Turn! Different story, same quality -other than that Wrong Turn has a much higher entertainment-factor. Trust me; if you're after the kick Sixth Sence, The Others or even Gothika (ever so butchered, but...) don't waste your time and money on this movie.

More important, the first film was able to create characters you cared about, so that their impending doom made for some great nail-biting moments.<p>Final Destination 2 goes to show that the concept in the hands of lesser talents pretty much falls apart under its own weight.  The scripting is just ridiculous, especially in the last 20 minutes when everything seems to happen with no orchestration whatsoever.  Characters make up conclusions that make no sense, and director David R. Ellis is so preoccupied with designing cool-looking visuals that fully three quarters of the cast look like they came straight out of their first week of acting school.  Lead actress A.J. Cook may be pretty -- she looks like a young Kimberly Williams -- but she spends so much of the film whimpering and crying that the character remains a blank, with none of her actions generating either character growth or catharsis.  Ali Larter brings some spark reprising her role as Clear Rivers, but the character is also a flatline after her first 10 minutes.  I'm not surprised that director Ellis' C.V. is filled with stunt credits.  Most of the stunts in this film do look pretty good, but without any character sympathy to speak of, there is no emotional stake to all the violence.  You see a lot of explicit gore (impaled heads -- two of them; a Robocop-style human pancake; incineration in a close-up; a human tri-section with intestines showing), but you never feel much threat because these aren't people you care about.<p>But I did derive some diabolical pleasure out of seeing these screaming, whining, cardboard-cutout characters chopped to pieces.  This film is so bad at times that you just have to laugh at the blatant incompetences and corniness.  If the filmmakers' intentions was for the audience to laugh *at* them rather than *with* them, then they've succeeded in spades.  &quot;You did it...you defeated death&quot;...that's got to be the most ridiculous moment I've seen in a major studio release in years.<p>Two stars for the wild stunts, the bad yet amusing humour, and Ali Larter.  Treat this movie with the contempt it deserves, and I think you'll be able to have some fun watching it.

Cast with a bunch of young actors in a twist on the old slasher formula, except this time, the mad killer is old Grimm himself. It makes this movie a minor classic, in that there's never anyone chasing these kids through the woods (so to speak). You don't need to set up a story about the killer that got killed by the angry mob or tormented by nasty classmates. Death doesn't need that kind of contraption, Death just is.<br /><br />Of the actors, only Sean William Scott (aka "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031WD9">Stifler</a>") and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024FAD9C">Heroes'</a> Ari Larter have moved up from this series starter. Then one of the kids - Devon Sawa - has a premonition that gets him and six classmates plus one teacher booted from the flight. Said plane then explodes upon take-off. This team of cast-offs realize they've cheated death...or did they? Seems Death's Design isn't to crazy about being disrupted, and comes back for the stragglers. This is where "Final Destination" slips back into formula, and became more inventive in the way the teens get killed off. This does sort of make FD a precursor to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> series, in that the kills had to be elaborately set up and executed (har har).<br /><br />Even with the beach-blanket-bingo of the FD plotline, the suspense is real. Who goes next and who beats the reaper? The concept was so successful that the Big D came back for two more sets of teens (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLZK">Final Destination 2</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2HS6">Final Destination 3</a>) with a 4th in the works with little variance in the formula.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I loved the first movie, so it isn't a big surprise that I like this one too.

"Final Destination 2" is one of the most electrifying movies ever made, and the scariest of its trilogy.<br /><br />  A similar 'premonition of mass death' to what set off the events in the first one occurs early, this time happening to a girl named Kimberly (A.J. Cook) as she and her friends are on the freeway.  Forseeing a mass car wreck (depicted terrifically onscreen with a gusto that probably outdoes any action movie car chase scene in history) she frantically tries to no avail to get a nearby police officer to close down the road, succeeding only in preventing her own group - and several cars angrily stuck behind her parked vehicle - from entering the traffic flow until after the disaster begins, as envisioned, moments later.<br /><br />  In the Final Destination mythos, Death is an entity or force that seems to have detailed plans on who it's going to claim, and when and how - and it doesn't take kindly to when its plans get thwarted by these premonitions that occur periodically.  So those who would have died in this latest disaster are targeted with a vengeance, dying in what would first appear to be accidents, and then in increasingly improbable situations as Death ups the ante and plays more recklessly.  The vicious endings met by those on Death's hit list really up the ante in imaginative mayhem and rank high on the jolt scale; sometimes it's reminescent of the insane kinetic energy in "Evil Dead 2", but without the blackly comedic edge.  The 'targets' band together reluctantly - some skeptical and hostile at first - to figure out what's happening, and eventually seek out the sole survivor of the first movie, living self-committed in an psychiatric facility, who gets involved partly to help the new group and partly to try and avenge the victims from the first movie.  "Final Destination 2" puts together an ideal, diverse group of characters, with Cook making a great central protagonist.  It defines 'high impact' through most of its running time but is fully capable of being mysterious and even emotionally subtle. (See the ambiguous but intriguing ways the character relationships develop in the background of the movie, and of course the continuing question of whether Tony Todd's undertaker character is really just an unnerving guy knowledgable in occult theories, or something more)<br /><br />  This is just done so well on every level - smartly written and directed, strong performances, outstanding special effects, high regard to production values, shot-perfect cinematography...  It's a memorable, multi-layered shocker of a movie that leaves one wanting more, and gets the highest possible rceommendation for horror fans.

Of course the inevitable sequel comes out and this time it's packed with what the first one avoided slightly: gore. Strange as it may sound, this is gore done right. Yeah it's dumb, campy and little redeeming value but somehow you're just entertained by the whole thing.<br /><br />Taking place a year after the Flight 180 disaster from the first one, we now instead follow Kimberly en route to a vacation when she has a premonition of a brutal multiple-car pileup on the freeway and prevents another group of cars from going down the freeway. The pileup happens and the remaining survivors, along with Kimberly find out what the first group had to deal with: Death is mad people lived and he's back, but he's gotten a little bit more creative, and way more gruesome.<br /><br />In the film after this, Wendy (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) says "can you feel how vicious it was?" That pretty much sums up the approach this film and that one have with dispatching its characters. Unlike the first one which were more like freak accidents in a way, this almost seems like Death playing Mousetrap with that knocking over this which turns off that and makes this do that until splat, something happens. It's silly but for some reason, it's dementedly fun. You find it strange that you're getting such a kick out of seeing a guy "Cube"d to death (it's a movie, check it out). The opening sequence with the massive pileup is probably one of the most tension-filled and exciting car crash scenes in recent memory, not to mention it's quite gory. But it's presented in a way that you'll turn very paranoid whenever a big trucker is on the road with you.<br /><br />Is the acting any better? Well, no. The leads are usually the more better but nowhere near great acting. AJ Cook though does an admirable job as Kimberly and proves a good successor to the vision seer role Devon Sawa had in the first one. The rest? Very cookie cutter. The stoner to the impatient bi*ch with things to do to the brash, insensitive man, it's obvious they're just meant to be fodder for Death's viciousness. Returning is Clear Rivers (played by Ali Larter) who helps out Kimberly and her situation. She doesn't really make the film any better but can't go wrong with an additional hottie.<br /><br />For those looking for a simple fun horror movie rather than a serious horror movie pretending it's fun, can't go wrong with this entire series. Yeah, FD2 is filled with a bunch of nonsense but where else can you get a kick out of this stuff for a change?</p></br></body></html>

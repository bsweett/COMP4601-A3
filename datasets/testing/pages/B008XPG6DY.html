This movie is an exception; Jennifer Anniston delivers on her promise of being a star again and again. I don't want to ruin the movie for the appreciative audience, so I will simply say, very much recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>2005's "Derailed" tells the story of a man (Clive Owen) who's obviously lost passion for his wife and is dealing with the stress of a daughter with serious medical problems. On the train to work he starts a relationship with a woman (Jennifer Aniston) which slowly veers toward adultery. Things go from bad to worse. Vincent Cassel is featured as the love-to-hate villain.<br /><br />I mainly judge films by whether or not they pull you in and hold your attention. "Derailed" does this in spades. I was also impressed with the writing. Although another reviewer panned the writing as "unbelievable tripe" and "horribly written" the story struck me in a totally opposite manner. Okay, maybe parts of the story are unbelievable, in particular the ending's prison surprise, but how many movies today are truly believable? Some have criticized the story as predictable but I was surprised and impressed by the turns the film takes. And I never saw it coming.<br /><br />I'm not going to say anymore because the less you know the better. Stay away from the reviews that (without warning) give away the entire plot!<br /><br />"Derailed" is a top-of-the-line thriller/drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>all i kept hearing about this movie is about how bad it was, and things like that. all negative, nothing positive not even about the actors, but i decided to let myself be the judge that way no one else to blame but myself. well, i'm glad i did. this movie was bangin. the script was great, the whole story line and all. kind of left me with my mouth open towards the end. i mean they really feed you the story and the actors do there job so well that you believe it all. i mean why shouldn't you, then BAM that twist and the end. did not see it coming i must say. very unexpected. it kind of makes you mad you know. you kind of start feeling sorry for clive owen, poor man, but he should'nt have been trying to cheat. kind of teaches you a lesson this movie does. it's hard to see who can you trust these days, and that you have to think of the consequences of your action. i really enjoyed it. clive owen is a great actor, and played it like a man in trouble to the T. as for jennifer aniston, well done, she was good. put all the emotions and depth to her character. as for the villian, vincent cassel, makes you hate him, but we must not forget it is a movie. very well done man. anyway in my eyes good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Very good thriller. Keeps you entertained and gives an EXCELLENT ending!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The twists were rather easy to figure out, but I wasn't bored one bit during the entire movie. The acting was pretty decent, with Clive Owen being the best of the bunch (as usual). It was good to see Jennifer Aniston in a different type of role as well. Derailed is worth watching for free on television, or maybe even a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Clive Owen (Sin City, Croupier) plays Charles Shine, a working man who has a loving wife, played by Melissa George (Tv's Alias, Amityville Horror remake) and they have a daughter who has diabetes and they have her hooked up to a dialysis machine because it would cost a lot of money to take her to a hospital. While on a train ride to work, Owen meets a beautiful nice mysterious woman named Lucinda Harris, played by a miscast Jennifer Aniston (Tv's Friends, Along Came Polly) and then they soon see each other again. They then go to a bar and then Owen wants to rent a hotel room so they do. They start then doing the deed but then a criminal comes in named La Rouge, played by Vincent Cassel (Brotherhood of the Wolf, The Reckoning) and beats up Owen and rapes Aniston. So, after this ordeal, they vow never to call the cops and that's when Cassel terroizes Owen for money and threatens his family in order to get what he wants. Clive Owen does some solid work here giving a great performance but he's tipped off scale by Jennifer Aniston who is very wrong for the role. Vincent Cassel is a very good actor and here he gives a scorching villainous performance. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito (Tv's Homicide: Life on the Street), RZA (Coffee and Cigarettes) and Xzibit (xXx: State of the Union).</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the movie. I found Ms. Aniston to be attractive and believable. At least I believed her. There seems to be a groundswell of reviewers who want to sink her. Reminds me of Cruise. Yet, they both do excellent work. Perhaps Ms. Aniston is seen as taking Julia Roberts place in terms of 'wholesomeness' and there's resentment afoot.<br /><br />I took away a star because Charlie Shine has everything going for him, beatiful family, true, a sick little girl, $700,000 dollar home, life is OK. So let's complicate life exponentially by hopping in the sack with an utter stranger you just met. Why is he so sad? What's wrong?<br /><br />If I'm going to go with something unbelievable, I'll take Michael Douglas sleeping with Glenn Close in FA. At least he made no bones about having a great life. Here, Clive Owen's marriage is in trouble but we never know why. It just didn't hang together for me.<br /><br />Victor Cassel. Brrr. Good villain. All in all, an enjoyable movie. It could have had more marketing muscle. There is one other thought. Is there something wrong with saying that possibly "rappers" lack acting skills?<br /><br />Way, Way back in the day, Hollywood would put the latest teen idol in a movie to act with John Wayne, Gregory Peck, whomever. We had Frankie Avalon in Navarone, Ricky Nelson in several of the Rio movies, and Glen Campbell in Rooster Cogburn. You know what? They were terrible. Frankie breaking into song at a Greek wedding surrounded by Nazis who want to slit their throats wasted the 60 previous minutes Peck and Niven worked for to make the movie suspenseful. So here's a caveat for the present. Rappers are great. They have a lot of followers. But they can't act. 4 stars.

In his native Sweden, he made Ondskan, which won worldwide acclaim. Hollywood imported him and, as Hollywood seems to do to so many of its imports, crippled him; the result of his first collaboration with the Hollywood regime is Derailed, a pale, derivative film that manages to take some of the best actors of its generation and utterly waste them.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays Charles Schine, a guy with a good job and a not-so-happy family-- his daughter suffers from a chronic illness. Still, he and his wife and daughter try to take things as they come. One day, he finds himself short of cash on the train, and is rescued by Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), a financial planner at a nearby banking firm. The two strike up a friendship that seems to want to progress into something more, despite their efforts to resist. They finally break down one night and head for a local fleabag hotel, where they're mugged by LaRoche (Vincent Cassel), a scruffy-looking guy who makes off with Schine's identification, using it to blackmail Schine.<br /><br />The plot should sound familiar, and it is; all the twists and turns here you've seen many, many times before. Both Owen and Cassel have done much, much better work in the past; Cassel is hopelessly adrift in this role, while Owen only manages to get his teeth into it on an intermittent basis. (Aniston, surprisingly, outshines them both.) But then, that may be less a fault of the actors than it is Stuart Beattie's anemic script; I don't know whether to place the blame for it being a second-rate David Mamet clone on Beattie or the James Siegel novel from which Beattie's script was adapted, but rest assured someone in the house is a big, big David Mamet fan. And, of course, you can't have a thriller these days without having a big, utterly predictable twist ending. Why I kept watching is entirely beyond me. * ?</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Someone somewhere in Hollywood is really trying their best to keep Jennifer Aniston's career alive.  This thriller is based in Chicago and it is fun to watch Metra Union Station, downtown and I believe Evanston sites.  But even fine actors like Clive Owens and Vincent Cassel cannot save this film with a predictable plot.  Female audience - watch this with your husband/boyfriend, just as a way to gently remind them that at all times they are bait for the con - even on their way to work.  Perhaps this movie can help them appreciate what they've got.  Otherwise, this film is really just not worth mentioning.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>"Derailed," a fairly standard adultery/blackmail/thriller sort of film, features some good performances in an otherwise predictable format. Clive Owen as Charles is the well-meaning, over-burdened husband who can't believe his good luck when he meets the lovely Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston) on the train. They barely get their clothes off in a seedy hotel when a crazed blackmailer bursts into the room, beats Owen up, rapes Aniston, and escapes with money, wallets, and the keys to the pair's personal lives. Lucinda begs Charles not to go to the police, and he rather inexplicably complies, putting his family and most importantly his sick daughter, at great risk. Unlike some other viewers, I found it hard to swallow Charles' failure to go to the cops and end the nightmare--why is he putting the wishes of a woman he barely knows above the safety of his family, whom he truly loves? Vincent Cassel as the blackmailer is truly menacing, and gives the best performance of the film.<br /><br />There's a twist about two-thirds of the way through that I didn't see coming and otherwise rescued this rather ho-hum story. There's lots of violence, and the rape scene was way too graphic for my taste; I suppose that would liven it up for some. But I think "Derailed" is a cable TV/rental-only sort of film, especially if you don't want to think too hard, but most definitely not for children or teens.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This film pretty much follows the book by the same name except that it takes place in Chicago instead of New York.  There are some parts toward the end that were in the book but were missing from the movie (I can't say what because it would be a spoiler) so it may be good to read the book after to understand how it led up to the ending.<br /><br />Charlie Shine an ad executive takes the train to work every day.  One day he meets a leggy Lucinda on the train through a mix-up with his train ticket.  The two start-up a conversation and pretty soon are meeting each other on the train.  Lucinda tells Charlie she is in an unhappy marriage and Charlie who is married himself debates having an affair with her.  Of course the temptation is too great for him so they schedule a daytime tryst in a downtown, shady hotel.  Almost immediately after they enter the room and begins some passion, they are surprised by a mugger who robs Charlie and rapes Lucinda.  Both of them not wanting their spouses to find out, decide to say nothing to the police.<br /><br />The mugger (Mr. Vasquez), aware that they will take no action against him starts to blackmail Charlie to get whatever additional wealth that he has.  The rest of the book is difficult to talk about without a lot of spoilers but let's say that Charlie gets involved with a murder and that things are definitely not the way Charlie perceives them.<br /><br />The tension mounts throughout especially when Charlies family starts to get involved.  A pretty good thriller!</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>After seeing this movie, one may not ever look upon Jennifer Aniston in quite the same way again.  It's obvious that she's trying to break away from being stereocast as an actress for comedies.  Looks like she's got her wish!  This is a remarkably different role for her, and she pulls it off nicely.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is how two people meet up on a train heading to work.  Both are married but end up fooling around anyway.  It turns out to be the biggest mistake they'll ever make, and not JUST because their spouses might find out.<br /><br />What ensues is a chaotic nightmare that seems to just get worse & worse. Things are not all as they seem, and the story scores very high on the guage of sadistic intent.  The story makes you feel like you're sinking in quicksand.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of erotic thrillers, this one is certainly worth a look.  I'll bet you'll pay your own fare from now on!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>The story in retrospect was one that has been done so often that I should have been able to predict the story in advance fortunately I did not, so I was able to enjoy the movie as it went though its twists and turns. Several times I found it quite unbelievable eg why a person with a wife that looks like the hero's wife would go with someone else, why the victim did not go to the police, the way the shooting scene in the hotel worked out, then the failure of the police to identify the hero as the killer, the accidental way he got his money back and the final fight in the jail and the police still cannot catch the killer.<br /><br />The acting I thought was poor to reasonably good. I did like Jennifer Aniston performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This movie isn't as bad as some say.  This is your typical thriller with a twist.  Many things don't work, but plenty of them do.  You have a talented cast, a decent story, and a fair ending that isn't the greatest, but is not a total dud.  It's hard to describe the movie too much without spoiling it.  So I will simply say that a married man decides to have an affair, and that turns out to be the biggest mistake of his life in more ways than one.  This movie is worth a watch.  I'm not sure about the replay value since it isn't a big enough twist that you want to go back and look at any clues you might have missed ala The Sixth Sense.  But it is not a bad film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>just rent this movie few days ago...real good thriller, Like it a lot & loved the twist in the end was kind of Surprising!!.loves this kind of  movies in the end shock the hell out of u and make u in edge of your seat!..Good thriller and suspense all in one I enjoy it!! Only I didn't give 5 stars to this thriller, because of her cast in this scrip!  J.ANISTON..Was wrong choice in this movie,She's "not" made for this kind of serious acting and this kind of scrip! She better stick with that comedy/drama she good at not this kind of scrip and movies...But CLIVE OWEN was a great and real good mach for this movie with his big gorges blue eyes and moves really grab u into to this thriller ride till end.

Aniston plays the bad girl, perfectly. Its great to see her get away from the comedys she does. She has the makings of a good dramatic actress.<br /><br />The script itself was alittle to unbelievable for me. Theres just to many unbelievable things that happen. I can believe a married man would make a few mistakes and get himself in trouble by cheating on his wife. But the more he becomes the victim of the Scam, the more the film becomes unbelievable.<br /><br />There were plenty of plot twists, so the movie kept me interested through out. It just needed more of a touch of reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Although I knew the plot before seeing the film, I have to admit that it still kept me on the edge of my seat.

I wasn't disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>I didn't even want to watch this movie but I am glad I did. Derailed is a pleasant surprise. Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry together. They play Charles and Lucinda, they meet on their morning commute and there is an immediate attraction which leads to a casual and brief affair. I don't want to give too much away but their is a twist so pay attention to that detail. Good movie to watch when you are bored out of your mind. Clive Owen is a cutie pie!</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Why two actors on their way up would agree to this is a mystery.  Besides being inferior to 52 Pickup in every way, there is no chemistry and Jennifer Anniston comes off colder than Chicago in January.<br /><br />And yes, the big plot twist is 100% predictable.  Even if its a surprise, so what?  If you like this sort of ugly little story (blackmail - revenge) by all means, see 52 Pickup.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>"Derailed" stars Jennifer Aniston(Lucinda) and Clive Owen(Charles) as two commuters who meet on a train one day when Charles misses his usual train.<br /><br />They develop an attraction and eventually take it to the next level. In the trashy hotel room they rent, someone breaks in and Charles' life is literally 'derailed'.  The guy rapes Lucinda, beats the crap out of Charles, and the plot thickens.  Believe me, it does, it adds texture to what could have been an otherwise drab imitation of a Hitchcock thriller.<br />It's a good rental if you are fan of the genre.<br />I thought the performances were fine and was intrigued by it up until the final frame of the movie.  Good twists and turns help this movie along.<br /><br />Eileen F.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>so irony comes in small packages right?  Right!

Very thrilling movie for the most part, with a lot of good plot twists!  Highly Recommended for Aniston fans!!</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>and this kinda story were told maybe hundred times. the screenplay is okay, the casting is a bit bad, jennifer anison was a very bad casting, not a bit attractive enough to make the guy sidetrack to have an affair with her, because she looked almost the same and similar type of this guy's wife. if you want us to believe that the husband would commit an outside marital affair, that woman you'd like to have an affair with should be at least look quite different from your wife, the looks, the personality, the chamistry..., there's not even one bit of possibility that this guy would and could fall for such woman played by anison. a very very bad casting job here.<br /><br />clive owen was also a not so good choice playing this role. his whole attire, attitude, body language didn't look like a successful corporate executive at all, but a struggling, uninsured, hesitant, shabby-look downstairs guy. his martin landau+woody allen's lame duck stoop, haunched walking stature was even worse in this movie.<br /><br />the whole script was a bit far-fetched too. the wife role was also too weak, the husband-wife, daughter-father interpretations were also too weak to look real enough but cardboard-like, although these shortcomings could only be originated and copied mindlessly from the original mediocre novel. another proof that hollywood is drained from good movie ideas but could only desperately grab from ready made novels, no matter good, bad, or ugly, or how mediocre it might be.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Things have really changed in Hollywood in the last decade.  I can remember back about 7 or 8 years ago, when the thriller/suspense genre was one of the most successful types of movie to make.  When Michael Douglas was in his heyday with films such as Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, A Perfect Murder, and others, those were the days of the Hollywood thriller.  Regretfully, since the genre was so popular, most original ideas have long since been done and redone.  Derailed is one of the best thrillers that I have seen since the "heyday" of Hollywood thrillers.<br /><br />To not give anything away, I will keep the summary to a minimum.  Charles Schine is a mid-level executive at a commercial marketing firm.  He has a strained relationship with his family due to outside, uncontrollable circumstances.  Charles meets Lucinda Harris one day on the train to work, seemingly an act of fate.  Everything is going normally, with Charles and Lucinda about to commit adultery, until they are interrupted by an armed man with extremely bad intentions.  After the initial incident, Charles is sucked into a game with the perp, otherwise known as La Roche, that involves giving away his family's life savings to keep his mistakes a secret.<br /><br />While the movie definitely goes by the classic thriller formula, that, in part, is what makes it so enjoyable.  It does a great job of making you despise the villain, and Clive Owen is great as the sad, yet well-meaning and genuine husband.  Jenifer Aniston gets second billing in the film, but her role takes a back seat to Owen once the bad things start to happen.  Not only does the film do a great job of getting the viewer involved and caring about the main character, but it also makes sure to make the ending as enjoyable as possible.  The addition of a couple of good twists only serves to make the movie better to look back on once you've watched it the first time.  In fact, I would say that the ending of the film makes it worth watching the movie a second time to see what you can catch that might actually clue you in as to what is actually going on.  In short, this movie was a huge surprise to me.  I wasn't expecting too much, but it turned out to be a great throwback to the amazing thrillers of days gone by.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Vincent Cassel's performance alone, jeez, the scary thing is there are probably worse out there in reality.  He was one evil man.  Clive O and Jen Anniston are his supposed victims, but he steals the show in a most chilling fashion.  NOT for young children, shouldn't even be on with them in the room.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I'm not one of those reviewers who only want to see Anniston cast in wholesome roles as some fans of this movie accuse.  Anniston wasn't all that wholesome in 'Friends'.  So that's a crazy statement all on its own.  Derailed-in a word is 'transparent'.  It was painfully obvious Lucinda was involved from the moment she uttered the words "Some people don't appreciate what they have."<br /><br />Plus how many Parisan thieves in expensive suits roam Chicago pulling hotel robbery jobs?  Plus Lucinda boast about her high-profile job and her being married to a broker--yet, the thief isn't asking money from her, too?  That was highly suspect.<br /><br />Charles' character was so weak I was stunned.  Plus, he was supposedly smart, but showed no ability to sit still for a minute and truely think about what was going on.  He was too busy reacting.  When his friend was shot, why didn't he flag down the police?  He didn't shoot the guy.  Any normal person would have gone to the police to report what was going on instead of giving up their sick daughter's money over protecting some skirt's (of which he didn't get a piece of)family.  The first pay off, fine.  The second--Lucinda was on her own.<br /><br />The final showdown at the prison was just silly to me.<br /><br />I think another review had it right.  Good actors-bad script.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>A very organized extortionist and his brutal partners dupe a family man who nearly strays by having an affair with a young woman he meets on a train.

After the initial character development and getting to know Charles Schine's (Clive Owen's) character and his family, the story unfolds and suddenly takes full speed.<br /><br /> Personally, Clive at times seems to be miscast in this picture because he looks like he could beat the crap out of somebody, when he isn't suppose to look that way. Jennifer Aniston gives us another showing that she can be a dramatic actress and sheds the "Friends" image that she has had for 10 years. Jennifer is very believable in this role. She handles her tough scene's very well proving to us that she's Oscar worthy, but not in this film. Vincent Cassell ("Ocean's Twelve") and hip-hop artist and producer RZA as Winston both done a great in this film as well as  Tom Conti (so brilliant in "Reuben, Reuben").<br /><br />There are a lot of unnecessary events in this movie that just don't give the plot enough leg to stand on. It's a pretty good mystery that provides a nice twist near the end, but clues and events leading to it (which is obviously the -point- of it) are badly placed, hence making the climax almost every bit anti-climactic. It's hard to believe that Owen's wife would put up with a lot of the nonsense that he pulls to save his skin. To add to that, how the drama ended in the movie was simply unnecessary and a complete overkill. Rome's conspirators might as well have killed Anthony with Caesar.<br /><br />This movie succeeds only on the level of the performances and the effectiveness of the tension in many scenes. It's got a lot of edge of your seat moments, but afterwards when you think about what's happened in this film, you'll be scratching your head.<br /><br />I do recommend this film and I appreciate the way it makes you feel. This helpless situation helps inspire you in the age of divorces and break-ups family that there's still something worth fighting for,and still something worth dying for....</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>Why does Clive Owen make these stinker movies?  I thought CLOSER was one of the absolute worst movies I ever saw with a really great star in it.  UGH.  Then I watched DERAILED and thought "well we have a little category here of really lousy Clive Owen movies".<br /><br />He is a really GOOD actor.  Why in the world does he get involved in these ridiculous films.  I didn't care for this movie at all because it was too far-fetched.  Jennifer Aniston was good as Lucinda, but not quite good enough as a bad girl type.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>The only thing wrong with DERAILED is that the overpromotion and intense media-barage touted this as the second coming of the suspense thriller... my god... HITCHCOCK LIVES!!<br /><br />The truth is. The movie was actually pretty good. There are some nice twists. There are some surprises. The performances are good. But, once you TELL EVERYBODY that your movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread... IT BETTER BE.<br /><br />DERAILED... is just pretty good. Nothing exceptional. But certainly not a waste of time.<br /><br />The story unfolds as a businessman Philippe LaRoche (played by Clive Owen) is bored with his life and his troubles and finds himself embarking on an extra-marital affair with Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), a stranger who he met on a train. At the hotel, things go badly and many secrets have to be regrettably held as the perpetrators seek to extort the wealthy businessman.<br /><br />Many of the twists are foreshadowed too obviously. Although there are enough twists in the film, that some WILL SURPRISE you. I would have liked to have seen a couple of the characters brought out more. Shown a little deeper. Specifically Philippe LaRoche's wife and daughter, Deanna & Amy Schine (played by Melissa George & Addison Timlin respectively). There were some stories that could have been told about them that would have made you care deeper for the family situation.<br /><br />Otherwise, the movie is just okay. It's a good renter. Certainly not a bad film. But certainly not the second-coming of Hitchcock either.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>All the hype around this movie was just that hype. It is slow paced, without any real suspense and the plot twist that was suppose to be so awesome was very obvious.<br /><br />I was a 'friends' fan and I would like to see Jen Aniston have a sucessful movie career (especially after Brad did her wrong) but she better pick better scripts then this one if she wants longevity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It was ironic that we watched "Derailed" tonight because we saw "Inside Man" this afternoon.  One is a Clive Owen movie where we could never figure out what was really going on and the other was one where things clicked into place early on and we were getting tired for the hero to catch up.  To be clear, Derailed" is the second movie.  It is not that this movie is predictable in terms of the action, but that the twist is rather obvious (so obvious that I was wondering if it was a red herring, but, no, it was not).  However, once Owen's character finally gets the big clue, this movie gets fairly interesting and actually end up redeeming itself more than I thought it would.<br /><br />All I remembered about this movie was the bit from the trailer about Owen betting Jennifer Aniston that he can kiss her without touching her lips.  So when I started to watch it I really had no clue what it was going to be about.  When we meet Charles Schine (Owen), he is having a bad time across the board.  His daughter, Amy (Addison Timlin) has the worst type of diabetes; her third kidney transplant has failed and her only hope is a drug the FDA has yet to approve.  At work he has lost a big account.  To top things off, when Charles gets on the commuter train he discovers his wife has borrowed money from his wallet and he cannot pay the $9 fare.  A beautiful woman, Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), pays for his ticket, and he goes from checking out her gams to engaging her in conversation on a train, in a bar (for the bet), and eventually in hotel room.<br /><br />Then something bad happens.<br /><br />If you do not know what the bad thing is you will be able to survive this review with your innocence intact (but if you watch the trailer on the DVD, forget about it).  Charles has to deal with the consequences of what happens and having made one bad decision he has to choose to keep making additional mistakes.  Now, for the sake of this argument forget about the film's obvious twist and just look at the situation from his perspective.  I insist there comes a point where the madness clearly stops because we are in that territory where a father would rather be dead then do what Charles does.  At that point I was extremely unforgiving of the character, screenwriter Stuart Beattie ("Collateral"), director Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m ("Leva livet"), and was thinking I might have to check out the original novel to see how culpable James Siegel was in all this.<br /><br />However, then we get to the part of the film where Charles goes from playing defense to going on the offense.  My immediate thought was that this was going to be too little, too late, but I was rather surprised.  What I appreciated was that Charles continues to make mistakes, so there is no sudden transformation from sinner to saint.  I also like the fact that this film recognizes that Charles is playing with such unclean hands that he does not deserve to walk away without paying a price.  By the time this one is over I was actually thinking that we were supposed to figure out the twist, because it is part of the set up for how the endgame plays out, because a lot of what happens is really playing with out expectations.  By definition, that is what a thriller is supposed to do.<br /><br />Final aside: It would be interesting to see this story played out from the aftermath of the bad thing without either the twist or the continuing series of bad things that happen.  It would not longer be a thriller, but it would still be a compelling story played out with these characters.  Certainly there was enough for Charles and Lucinda to live with at that point.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Charles Schine (Clive Owen) commutes every day into downtown Chicago, for his job at an ad agency. His wife, Deanna (Melissa George) and his daughter, Amy (Addison Timlin) love Charles, but life at home is difficult. His daughter has Type 1 Diabetes, needs expensive medication and constant attention. On the train, Charles realizes that his wife has emptied his wallet, leaving him no money for the fare. Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) offers to pay for him. The next day, Charles searches Lucinda out and repays her. They begin a relationship, having lunch, talking on the phone, and the mutual attraction grows. One night, Charles calls his wife and claims that he has to stay late and work on a new account. Just as Charles and Lucinda are about to stop at a hotel, she has second thoughts; she doesn't want to lie to her husband or daughter. Charles is about to hail a cab back when she decides to go ahead. Taking a room at a seedy hotel nearby, they make their way upstairs. Just as they are about to consummate the affair, Laroche (Vincent Cassel, "Read My Lips") breaks into the room with a gun, threatening to rob them. But he quickly realizes his two victims are married people are about to have an affair. Laroche threatens to tell Charles' wife unless Charles pays him off. The only money Charles has is the money they have been saving for Amy's new medicine.<br /><br />"Derailed" wants to be a cross between "Fatal Attraction" and any David Mamet film about a con. But the two types of films don't mesh. Here's why.<br /><br />In most of Mamet's films, like "House of Games" or "The Spanish prisoner", as the con progresses, characters may get killed, but in the end, these deaths are faked. Joe Mantenga walks in on the group of con artists and everyone, including the people who "died", is sharing a drink. The con men don't want to kill people, they just want the mark's money. This attitude is entirely consistent with the story's breezy tones, allowing the audience to chuckle at the final reveal. "So that's how they did it!" Then the mark sets about getting his money back, getting even.<br /><br />But director Mikael Hafstrom is going for something grittier in "Derailed". People get killed; people who are involved in the con and people who aren't. These deaths, and a particularly troubling act in the hotel room when Laroche enters, take the film to a darker place that it can't return from. Worse yet, none of the characters ultimately care that anyone was killed, making their deaths pointless. The violence only advances the plot in one way, to draw Charles further into the mess. Mamet's films accomplish the same thing by making the mark believe he is involved in a crime that never happened.<br /><br />Once the con is revealed, it doesn't prove to be all that interesting or original. So the next thing to grasp onto, as a reason for showing any interest in this film, is the two leads. Owen is okay, but his character is ultimately very weak. Really, he should have put up more of a battle against Vincent Cassel's character. They are more or less the same size and stature. Why didn't he land a good punch? I understand that Laroche has a gun pointed at him, but he simply cowers in the corner as Laroche torments Lucinda (Aniston). And Lucinda is fairly uninteresting. She claims that she never sees her husband, yet is concerned that he will find out about the affair. So why is she so interested in going to a seedy hotel room with Charles in the first place? Jennifer Aniston really brings little to the role. Initially, she doesn't even seem to be attracted to Charles. And after Laroche begins blackmailing Charles, Lucinda fades into the background becoming a secondary character.<br /><br />Cassel is over the top, showing far too much relish in the lines spouting from his mouth. It almost seems like he is exaggerating his own accent, for purely villainous reasons. Cassel is actually French, yet his performance reminds me of a bad American actor doing a bad impression of a French accent. A disappointing effort from this usually dependable person. And rapper, "Pimp My Ride" host, and burgeoning movie star (yes, I'm being sarcastic) Xzibit plays Laroche's henchman, complete with Peter Lorre stereotype, repeating things that Laroche says, simply to prove that he is a tough guy as well. "Yeah, give us the money Charles."<br /><br />The story of "Derailed" is filled with the main characters, particularly Charles, making bad decisions. If at some point, he said I have to go to the police anyway, despite what Lucinda and Laroche want, the troubles would probably go away. If he had bothered to say "maybe I shouldn't ask the ex-con who works in my office to come and help me scare Laroche" things would have been different. If he had bothered to make any sane, rational decisions, the story would, in fact, not exist. So, we have a story about a man and woman, filled with them making bad decisions. How interesting! Again, being sarcastic.<br /><br />In the early part of the film, much screen time is devoted to set up Charles' life at home. Yes, he has a hard life. His wife is busy and harried about all of the problems in their life. He has the sick daughter. We get it. But we also get the sense that he loves them and they return this love. Maybe not all the time. But there is reciprocation there. There are problems. But a lot of people have problems. So why does this prompt him to want an affair? By the way, they never get the chance to consummate the affair. So don't expect any shots of Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston getting hot and heavy. Just as they are about to get `busy', Laroche breaks in, putting an end to the tryst. As if that weren't enough, there are a couple of scenes with the family dog. These seem to be added for no other reason than to get certain people in the audience to ooh and aah. Oooooh, how cute. Look how cute.<br /><br />The production values of this film are also strange. More than a handful of scenes are set at the seedy hotel. The hotel looks like a set because it is so seedy and so over the top. Watching the end credits, there were a number of credits duplicated, listed between the US and the UK. I suspect that the scenes in the hotel were shot in England, on a soundstage. Why this was done, I'm not sure, but it gives the film a fake look which further detracts from any efforts to make any aspect of the film appear real.<br /><br />"Derailed" is a completely unsuccessful film. If you are caught in a theater and subjected to it, a number of the people in the audience may cheer at certain points. These are the same people who laugh at the cute shots of the dog, who think Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston going to a seedy hotel for an affair is romantic, and retribution is best served with a 6 inch long ivory shiv.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Okay, was this made before or after "Rumor Has It?" Jennifer Aniston continues to convince me that her acting is pedestrian. She [is] one of those actors who just don't work in the big screen. She may have been fine on televsion but....she wrecked this film. I was very glad that she (Lucinda Harris) got blown away in the big shootout; unfortunately, too late in the film. The big shootout was the highlight of the film.<br /><br />Clive Owen as Charles Schine played his part very well. That being of the person victimized in a blackmail scheme by the sinister La Roche played by Vince Cassell and his convincingly scumbag accomplice Dexter, played by the one-dimensional Xzibit; whom I was also glad when he was blown away. I also enjoyed the final scene when La Roche gets it "stuck to him." After all the pain he put Schine and his family through. Yeah, even though it all because of Schine's attempted affair with Lucinda Harris.<br /><br />Oh, the storyline? Please read one of the "long-winded reviews."</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I was expecting this to be absolutely dreadful. It got slated left, right & centre - the film also started a rumour that Clive Owen & Jennifer Aniston were having an affair while she was still with Brad, especially since she was out pictured not wearing her wedding ring. A couple of months later, her & Brad announced their divorce, but not because of her infidelities.<br /><br />Derailed is a sort-of thriller, not starring Jean Claude Van Damme, but instead the afore-mentioned Clive & Jennifer. I hate Clive Owen with a passion, but thankfully he was working alongside Jennifer in this. Who's cool. Everyone says she can't play any other character but Rachel, which yes, is true, but what do you expect when you're stuck playing the same character for 10+ years? In this, she's actually playing Rachel again, but this time a much darker version.<br /><br />The film is quite brutal, and you genuinely feel for the characters, especially Lucinda (Jennifer) during the rape scene. Even if it does turn out to be a farce in the end. I read the book, but it was about a year ago, when Derailed was actually being filmed, and I honestly don't remember much about it now, but I certainly didn't remember the twist! The twist completely threw me, as I wasn't expecting it, although I was expecting something to happen. But my problem with Derailed is Jennifer's character does disappear for long periods of time, and we're left with Clive's miserable, one expression face.<br /><br />The cast are quite good, although Melissa George is seriously underused. But it's nice to see someone escaping the Neighbours/Home & Away curse at long last. She's no longer known as Angel.<br /><br />This film shows that anyone will have an affair, all it needs is a little spark of chemistry to start it off. Really, following in the same theme as Fatal Attraction, just without the bunny boiling, it's a film that will probably be remembered (if at all), for it's characters, and not the storyline itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>After you watch this, you will believe that it has likely happened to people, Clive Owen, who is one of the better actors to come along in ahwile is an average guy who many of us could identify with, he is an advertising executive who has a pretty wife(Melissa George) & a sick child, but the passion in his marriage has gone by the wayside, he then has a chance encounter with Lucinda(Jennifer Aniston), who is very attractive, & they have a fling, only to be alarmed by an intruder(Vincent Cassel, who is downright nasty & intimidating) in their hotel room, he not only robs & beats Owen, but rapes Anniston, if that wasn't bad enough, he harasses Owen throughout the film, threatning to expose their secret if not paid off, Owen conveys the emotion of a man whose life has gone from bad to worse, forget "Fatal Attraction", this is every cheating man's worst nightmare!!, & Anniston is very good in a slightly different role, who has a secret all her own, A very good thriller that will not bore you, why this film didn't do better is beyond me, the message is simple, "dont' fool around"!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is a married man who has an affair with Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), a woman he meets on a train, who is also married.

Soon, Charles is caught up in a frightening game of cat and mouse between the movie's resident bad-guy, LaRoche (Vincent Cassel.)<br /><br />"Derailed" is the movie that truly turned me on to the talent of Mr. Clive Owen. In my humble opinion, Clive Owen is the best actor of his generation because he is thought-provoking and not afraid to get his hands dirty so to speak because he gladly plays multi-faceted roles. Clive reminds me of a young Clark Gable.<br /><br />I have never been crazy about Jennifer Aniston (am I the only person that has never seen "Friends"?) Because she's never done anything that I liked; although I was able to sit through "The Object of My Affection." Jennifer Aniston is the perfect example of one of today's "stars" that coast by and do as little as possible but are able to rise right to the top. In any event, after I saw this movie I had a new fondness for her.<br /><br />The movie has some very fascinating twists and turns, up to the very end. This is one of those movies that will give you chills. So sit back, and enjoy the ride with Clive Owen.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>I could not take my eyes off this film.I had to watch the DVD again to see if I missed any clues,and I did.Everyone in the movie is fantastic.I can't understand why this picture wasn't a huge hit.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>I've always loved thrillers, that "who done it" mentality, and wondering what will happen next.  Perhaps the best thing about these movies is guessing who really is the villain and what the bigger plan is.  For me, I guessed the ending about halfway through the movie and left the remainder to unfold.  Still, this was a good movie.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays Charles, a well to do, average guy in a Chicago suburb who is living a somewhat boring and somewhat troubled life.  His marriage is not exactly happy these days, and he has a sickly, diabetic child who is taking a toll on him.  On a train to the city one day, he meets a clever, cheerful Jennifer Aniston.  They go from casual aquaintences to friends, then, thinking this is going to turn into a Fatal Attraction-esque movie, he decides to have a tryst with Aniston in a sleazy hotel room.  Their encounter goes terribly wrong when a mugger breaks in, and soon he is being terrorized literally and figuratively by his own guilt and the mugger's continued harassment of him and his family.<br /><br />How many little moments of insanity have cost us things?  Adultery, wanting to steal that pretty little item, greediness, and jealousy have always motivated us to do things we wish we hadn't.  And we wish we hadn't given into those little wants or needs that ended up costing us things.  It is part of life's learning experiences.  None of us are perfect.  This is an extreme example of what happens when we don't think about the consequences of our actions.  A good movie, a tad predictable, but still a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>*** 2005. Based on James Siegel's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044661372X">Derailed</a> and directed by Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m. Two married people, Owen and Aniston, meet in a train and plan to start an affair but they are attacked by Vincent Cassel in their hotel room. Later, Cassel blackmails Owen. Between Hitchcock and FATAL ATTRACTION, the film is agreeable and belongs to the Hollywood paranoia and guiltiness sub-gender. Note among many, the reference to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PP8">Psycho (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a> when Owen tries to make an incriminating car disappear. Already forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Stephen Colbert has included Clive Owen in his list of "Things That Are Trying To Turn Me Gay," and indicates that Mr. Owen is only a little less successful than baby carrots.  I sympathize with Mr. Colbert.  I'd buy and watch anything Clive Owen has done, even that series of high-octane BMW commercials he did back in 2001 and 2002.  There's something about his snarly amiability, his capacity to take the conventionally wry Leading Man attitude and give it a dose of sheltered vulnerability that plays like snarky ambivalence.  But mostly I just want him to hold me.<br /><br />Ha ha ha.  Eh.  Okay, well, all of that having been said, this movie?  Not very good.<br /><br />"Derailed" is, indeed, a clever little thriller, but it's too big for its britches.  The story sprawls so much that its contrivances seem awkward, and its twists seem more like flow-stopping kinks.  Penned by Stuart Beattie after the man had already given us "Collateral" and the first "Pirates of the Caribbean," "Derailed" lacks the tight plotting and character-driven nuances of either of those movies.<br /><br />Our story follows a fellow named Charles Schine (Clive Owen) who chances to meet a lovely stranger named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) on his train ride to work.  The two flirt with that sort of soft-toned abrasiveness that comes so easily to the executives of the World of Moviedom (both Schine and Harris' jobs are your typically ill-defined filmic pablum; what they do never matters as much as the fact that its lucrative).  Before they know it, they're slumming it in a moth-eaten motel room and gettin' it on, as they say.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only one who gets it off, as they say, is the guy who breaks into their room, robs them, and then does unspeakable things in the interim.  The encounter is, indeed, hard to watch, stomach-churning, even if the robber (Vincent Cassel packing his chops with as much cheese as he can) keeps uttering the sort of unimaginative drivel that most movie villains utter in the midst of their bad behavior.  Ah, but can I blame a low life like this for being uncreative?<br /><br />Yes, I can, actually.  Our low life, LaRoche, is actually pretty smart, because the hotel room is just the beginning.  LaRoche, realizing he's attacked a couple of very soft, very wealthy targets, cranks things up a notch, turns the screws, puts the pressure on, ups the ante, hits close to home, ADD METAPHOR HERE.<br /><br />What really ruins "Derailed" is its schizophrenic pacing.  Owen is at his greatest when his character has reached an interlude, when a decision must be made.  You can see the dark calculus of his thoughts on his well-angled face, and when he reaches his conclusion, the actions he takes are just an extension of those ruminations.  However, in "Derailed," those moments seem to last forever.  Furthermore, Owen's character is so stupid, so weak, and so spineless, it's hard, by the end, to care what happens to him and his wife and his Dying Daughter (who could be cured by a miraculous new drug that costs as much as Tanzania, apparantly, and for which the Schine's have been saving for seven years; this is known as an Emotional Plug-in).<br /><br />It's great that Owen plays against type in this movie; I'm not faulting him for that.  I am, however, faulting the film for the character it has chosen to place at its center.  Schine's transgressions are understandable, I suppose, and so is his habit of burying all of his problems under a pile of money.  But his actions at the end, the logical leaps he makes in the interim, it's all choreographed inconvenience.  From the cops who inexplicably berate him for not buying a hooker, to LaRoche's perpetually-scowling partner-in-crime (Xzibit, who uses the same facial expression in every frame of the film), to Schine's mail boy, Winston Boyko, an ex-con who still steals from time to time and even has, as a keepsake, the first shiv he ever used to stab someone with (played with companionable charm by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan): it's all hokey and eye-rolling.<br /><br />Of course, the entire movie would fail to exist if Schine would do the one sensible thing and go to the cops, but the script takes great pains to explain why he shouldn't, wouldn't, and doesn't do this.  I never really bought it.  In fact, the further along the film went, the less I bought.  Too much of the movie tries to be clever, tries to circle around into itself.  Its a pile of plot-threads, a tangled mess of consequences and coincidences, and even the great Clive Owen can't save it.<br /><br />But he can still hold me whenever he wants.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>While you watch it you think to yourself is this a  good or bad movie am I entertained or not.

Thriller fans will enjoy this movie, as it has a slick, polished sensibility and a plot that just races along, but don't expect it to be without fault.<br /><br />Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is having a rough time lately. Charles and his wife Deanna (Melissa George) are stressed in their marriage. Both have been working constantly to save extra cash for their ailing daughter who has Type 1 Diabetes requiring her to have a home dialysis machine and undergo other expensive treatments. One confusing morning, after leaving home Charles forgets to take enough money to pay for his train fare.<br /><br />Lucky though, there is the generous and sexy yuppyish Financial Advisor Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Anniston) to buy a ticket for him.  Soon they develop a train riding relationship, and benign pleasantries turn into having lunch, which turns into drinks after work. The accelerated flirtation eventually culminates in attempted infidelity. Soon they find themselves making out and going to a seedy hotel for a secret romp.<br /><br />Their tryst is thwarted when a French-accented thug breaks into their room and enacts, with theatrical relish, the worst nightmare of guilt-ridden, well-heeled adulterers. Blaming the whole thing on getting mugged Charles tries to put it behind him when he gets a call at home from his attacker, Philippe Laroche (Vincent Cassel), who begins a game of blackmail needing $20,000 or things will be taken further.<br /><br />Directed by Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m from a vaguely familiar screenplay by Stuart Beattie, the film ushers in every twist and turn with a kind of unsubtle foreboding, but that's half the fun of the movie. The shocks and plot twists come with a shocking intensity with H?fstr&ouml;m accomplishing the difficult task of making Owen seem ineffectual and lumpish and Anniston sharp and grim, he's also made Vincent Cassel's slick, versatile, multilingual arch-villain LaRoche improbably florid and cartoonish.<br /><br />Rather than nail its characters to the bed they've made, Derailed spins off into reprehensible mastermind territory, all the while slogging through a predictable rehash of the cinematic dangers of cheating on your wife - especially if you happen to be an upper-middle-class executive, your wife a gorgeous blond schoolteacher and your daughter a vulnerable, sickly waif whose fourth kidney transplant you've scrimped and saved for.<br /><br />Yet the film is always compelling, and imminently watchable and it's interesting seeing Owen and Anniston together; they have the type of relationship that achieves a pulpy, darkly driven passionate intensity that commands an equally hammering denouement for them both.

While on a train ride to work, Owen meets a beautiful nice mysterious woman named Lucinda Harris, played by a miscast Jennifer Aniston (Tv's Friends, Along Came Polly) and then they soon see each other again. They then go to a bar and then Owen wants to rent a hotel room so they do. They start then doing the deed but then a criminal comes in named La Rouge, played by Vincent Cassel (Brotherhood of the Wolf, The Reckoning) and beats up Owen and rapes Aniston. So, after this ordeal, they vow never to call the cops and that's when Cassel terroizes Owen for money and threatens his family in order to get what he wants. Clive Owen does some solid work here giving a great performance but he's tipped off scale by Jennifer Aniston who is very wrong for the role. Vincent Cassel is a very good actor and here he gives a scorching villainous performance. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito (Tv's Homicide: Life on the Street), RZA (Coffee and Cigarettes) and Xzibit (xXx: State of the Union).</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>This is quite a good movie.  I love Jennifer Aniston, but let's face it, she's not the best actress.  Having said that, she does very well in this movie.  You probably know the storyline by now; she meets a guy on a train, they have an affair, someone is blackmailing them.  It's not a total foreign concept for a plot.  It's what happens after the blackmail starts that makes this interesting.  I had a fair bit of it worked out already and so some didn't come as a surprise, but toward the last 10 minutes, there was another twist that you don't see coming.  I love these type of psychological thrillers.  I love how they mess with your head.  This movie does and and does it well.  You really should check it out.  It's never going to be my favourite movie, but it's definately a good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>"Derailed" takes the viewer on a thrilling journey through the perils of adultery, love and deceit. The movie has a great feel and fantastic flow of plots and subplots. Call it a thriller but not a puzzle muzzle like the "Saw" series<br /><br />Charles Schine (Clive Owen) has a so-called chance train meeting with the very lovely Lucinda Harris. (Jennifer Aniston) Both are married but succumb to temptation. But the mirror image is not what it seems. Catch a glimpse into happenstance.<br /><br />The plot thickens as an unexpected encounter is interrupted by would be robber Phillipe LaRouche. (Vincent Cassel) LaRouche takes what him wants and then leaves. But is LaRouche satisfied with want he got? Of course money is the root of all evil. Blackmail is a powerful tool for keeping secrets. Is paying the ransom Charles's only option?<br /><br />This DVD is worth a look or two. Maybe a purchase if you're a fan of Jennifer Aniston or Clive Owen.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I actually read the brilliant novel Derailed by James Siegel before going to see this movie. The movie stays fairly true to the movie but changes some aspects. The book and the movie are both excellent. The problem I am facing right now is that I am at a loss why everyone dissliked this movie. For all of you that say that you saw the twist coming, well good job, because I have no idea how that is possible. You might as well join the FBI and hunt down killers' next moves if you're that bright. Sure, when I saw the movie, I saw it coming..but only because I READ THE BOOK FIRST! I thought that the plot twists were ingenious and really made the movie so much better.<br /><br />Derailed's plot for one is outstanding. It's kind of like a hitchcock movie..only a newer version. Charles (Clive Owen) is a good guy. He's a good worker with a wife and a little daughter. His daughter has diabetes which makes his life sad at times but still wonderful. His daughter is wonderfully cast.<br /><br />He misses his regular train to work...gets on the next one but figures out that his wife has taken all of his moeny. So a sexy woman named Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston) pays for him. She is also married and has a daughter. They are infatuated with each other and start breaking their vows. They go to a hotel room to do you know what until a man named La Roche (Vincent Cassel) breaks in, steals their money and rapes Lucinda before the helpless Charles who's been beating up. This man decides then to blackmail them, figuring that they don't want to telly their spouses what they have done. He figured right. What comes next is an unpredictable thriller with a brilliant finale.<br /><br />Don't listen to people, this movie is unpredictable and really awesome. I've also had enough of people saying that Clive Owen's character is too weak in the movie. First of all, he's not Arnold. Secondly, it's realistic...he's getting the crap beaten out of him and is scared. That's his character for the movie and he develops throughout.<br /><br />The cast for one is outstanding notably Vincent Cassel who brings Laroche to life with extreme vivacity.<br /><br />After having read the book, this movie trully brought it to life and the cast was just as I pictured. The two leads are good and RZA surprisingly is really good.<br /><br />So please watch this awesome thriller with some huge twists that is a new kind of Hitchcock movie. And to tell you the truth, it's one of my faves of the year and one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. No, I'm not kidding.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>The critics disliked this film, and I heard that it was horrible, even one of the worst films of 2005, so I avoided this film when it was in cinemas. However, before I seen this film, I believed (and still do believe) that Clive Owen is an actor who can give a great performance, just watch Mike Nichols' "Closer" (one of the best films of 2004, in my opinion) to see how great of a performance he can give. Jennifer Aniston, on the other hand, had yet to impress me with her "same character" performances.<br /><br />"Derailed" is about a man, Charles (Owen) and a woman, Lucinda (Aniston) who are both married, who meet on a train, and eventually fall in love with each other. So they wind up in a hotel, and decide to get a room, and then they begin to have an affair with each other. Soon after they get a room, they're interrupted by the bad guy, a french villian named Philippe (Vincent Cassel) who kick's Charles' butt, steals Charles' wallet, and leaves him unconscious, and then he decides to rape Lucinda. He decides to blackmail Charles, and Charles decides that the only way he can stop the bad guy from terrorizing him and his family, as well as keeping his affair a secret is by giving into Philippe's demands.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Jennifer Aniston has attempted to climb out of her "Friends character" shell, finally.<br />-Those looking for a great popcorn movie, plenty of action, or violence will most likely be satisfied.<br />-Excellent performances from Clive Owen and Vincent Cassel.<br />-The rap stars performances in this film DO NOT RUIN THE MOVIE (for once).<br />-Plenty of plot twists.<br />-Good character development (especially Aniston's character).<br />-You'll be cheering Clive Owen's character on in the last half hour of the film (and trust me, it's worth seeing).<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The film's adverts practically give away the plot twists, so when you watch the film, you most likely know what is going to happen BEFORE it happens!<br />-The film is too predictable, and if you want to enjoy most of the plot twists, chances are, you'll have to leave your brain at the door.<br />-Jennifer Aniston's performance in the movie was somewhat difficult to believe, I felt like she was miscast.<br />-Clive Owen looked like he could kick the french villian's butt at anytime, but instead, his character took all of the punches.<br />-This movie would've been over in 15 minutes if Owen's character had a spine and common sense.<br />-I couldn't believe all of the stuff Owen's character lets the bad guy get away with.<br />-All Owen's character did around the bad guy was whimper and exclaim, "Take all my money, please don't kill me". COME ON! It's CLIVE OWEN! He was NOMINATED for the James Bond role!<br />-This film has plot holes out the wazoo!<br />-Before seeing the movie, I already knew who the bad guys were.<br /><br />I advise those who expect to see a ground-breaking thriller to avoid this film, because chances are, they'll be disappointed. If you're a fan of Clive Owen or Jennifer Aniston, popcorn action flicks, or a thriller film aficionado, this is worth at least a rental. Two stars for the excellent acting by most of the lead cast, and the "keeps you on the edge of your seat" ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Vincent Cassel is excellent and extremely cruel in this movie. Clive Owen is cunning and smart and Jennifer Aniston as always is breathtaking and here she is tragic. Execellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>This film is great if you like being told how to feel, and have never seen a decent work of this ilk such as Matchstick Men. If pointless violence and rape scenes are your bag, you'll love it even more. But if you appreciate intelligence and subtlety, stick to Hitchcock and the real thriller masters.<br /><br />[Spoilers coming] The whole thing is so incredibly manipulative: we're told what to feel constantly via foreboding music and hackneyed camera shots stolen from Hitch, but with none of his finesse or humor. The ending makes it even worse; there is absolutely nothing remotely believable about the final killing of LaRoche. Nothing. "I was on my way to the bathroom and he jumped me." Oh really? In the back of the prison laundry room? Ridiculous.<br /><br />But then again, this film is full of plot holes you could drive a truck through. Owens tells his wife everything, and his lawyer, but the cops never connect the dots? His wife just forgives him for an affair and a murder? He happens to be in a hotel room next to the killings, while he's still a suspect in the other killing, and the cops never put it together? Etc.<br /><br />And when Aniston, a mediocre actress well out of her puddle-deep depth here, tells the taxi to stop, it's raining hard and the wipers are on. It stops, and one second later, presto! No rain, no wipers. It's magic! No, it's a lousy continuity man on set, and a crummy editor, and a sloppy director.<br /><br />But that's par for this course. My only question is why Owens, who is talented and the only thing (with Cassel) holding this together, took this role. There are so many other films that tackle the same ideas with more wit and elan, let alone believability.<br /><br />Never any fun, Derailed isn't thrilling either, due to the many plot holes and taking itself far too seriously. A little humor would have gone a long way, but the only funny thing here is how everyone agreed to make a movie with so many unbelievable twists, and so little real edge.<br /><br />And they price the barely-better blu-ray at five times what the dvd is going for. Perfect.<br />Well, it is a con movie, after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>Clive Owen did a credible job playing the stressed, hapless guy who gets caught with his pants down. Jennifer Aniston is not someone I've ever found particularly appealing (either looks or acting-wise), so Clive going for her while he had a faithful Melissa George at home didn't make a lot of sense to me. Ah, but then there was a truly menacing performance by Vincent Cassel that made me forget any such quibbles and fall hook, line and sinker for the plot. All in all, a much better movie than I was expecting.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I watched this last night for the 1st time, and I thought it was pretty good! Charles Schine meets Lucinda Harris on a train. It begins as harmless fun, but when he has an affair and takes her to a cheap hotel, they are robbed and Lucinda is raped by a guy named Philippe LaRoche. LaRoche starts blackmailing Charles and threatens to tell his wife, but he can't let that happen. There is a lot of suspense and a little plot twist! I highly recommend DERAILED!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>"Derailed" was Swedish filmmaker Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m's first American picture. It stars Clive Owen as a man who is having an affair with a woman he met on a train, played by Jennifer Aniston. He's about to have an affair, anyway - because before they can get down to it, a man bursts into their hotel room, takes all their money, beats up Clive, and then rapes Aniston. When Owen returns home, the man calls him and demands $20,000, or he'll tell Owen's wife about the affair. Owen delivers, gets punched again, end of story.<br /><br />Or so Owen thinks. But then the man calls him again, this time demanding $100,000; earlier in the film it's established that Clive has been saving that money for seven years to pay for a new drug for his diabetic daughter. Yet again, he has no choice but to pay up. But Owen needs that money for his daughter, and finally he decides to turn the tables. However, things are not as they seem.<br /><br />Despite the harsh reviews it received upon its release, "Derailed" is not a train wreck. There are just as many good things as there are bad. Ultimately, it's a mostly dull movie with a few moments of genuine excitement toward the end. If you can make it that far, well done. You will be rewarded. Unfortunately, many people won't make it that far, because there's just no life in the picture. Owen is trying hard, but he can't hold the picture up on himself alone. Aniston is lukewarm in her scenes. The blackmailer, played by Vincent Cassel, is thoroughly hateable, but Cassel doesn't bring anything new to the role.<br /><br />The transition to American films for foreign directors can be hard even for the best of them (look at Jean-Pierre Jeunet's "Alien: Resurrection," or "Hard Target" by John Woo). Under the circumstances, H?fstr&ouml;m does well. It's clear that he has style, but either not enough or not the right style for this particular film. Toward the end of the movie he lets loose and crafts a few thrilling scenes, but the rest of the movie is a dully-colored drama about people we don't care about in a situation that's nothing new.<br /><br />After all, Owen isn't like Lester Burnham in "American Beauty." He has a family he loves, and although it's lacking the romance it once had, he's not unhappy. He still kisses his wife, he still helps his daughter with her schoolwork. When he decides to have the affair with Aniston, they both know it's wrong. But they're turned on, and so they do it anyway. There's nothing special about these characters, and nothing to make us sympathize with them. The "couple having an affair gets blackmailed" routine is getting very stale. There have been a wealth of wannabe-seductive affair movies in the last decade, and "Derailed" offers little new.<br /><br />So in the end, is "Derailed" worth watching? Sure. You could do better, but you could also do worse. The twists which begin appearing about 3/4 of the way through the film are worth sitting through the first three parts for, if you can do so. As a drama, "Derailed" is stale and uninteresting, and as a thriller, Derailed offers a few scenes of excitement and a whole lot of the same old stuff. Ironically, the downfall of "Derailed" is that it stays on the track and never goes off in some interesting and foreign direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Swedish director Hafstrom (Evil) gives a striking visual sheen to this simplistic thriller, essentially a variation on Fatal Attraction, with exactly the same themes.<br /><br />Charles (Owen) is an overworked Chicago ad-man with a wife (George) and daughter (Timlin) in the suburbs. Much of his attention has gone toward earning money to pay for the daughter's kidney transplant, straining his marriage as a result. So he's vulnerable when he meets the flirty Lucinda (Aniston) on a commuter train. But just as they begin a tentative affair, they're assaulted by the French thug Laroche (Cassel), who turns into a menacing extortionist and threatens to destroy Charles' entire life.<br /><br />The plot is both preposterous and predictable--alert viewers will see the twists coming. So it's the central issues that keep us gripped, asking as things get increasingly tense, "What would I do here?" The problem is that all of the characters make such bad decisions that it's difficult to feel any sympathy at all, no matter how engaging the performances or how stylishly the film looks.<br /><br />There's a nice Hitchcockian vibe running through this wronged-man story, and Owen plays Charles with a surprisingly energetic charm, balanced by Aniston's sexy fragility and Cassel's kinetic viciousness. From the moment they come together, these three seem locked in a death struggle, with increasingly threatening situations in which no one's remotely innocent. It's also nice to see Aniston play a darker, murkier character than normal (to match her darker, murkier hairdo).<br /><br />Hafstrom has some superb jolts up his sleeves, and even gives the supporting cast character-defining scenes. Esposito is fascinating in the under-written detective role; RZA is surprisingly effective as Charles' ex-con coworker; Conti is rarely seen as Charles' boss; Xzibit is pretty bad as Laroche's sidekick.<br /><br />Gaping plot holes are plentiful, but not too glaring, although Beattie's script cheats by withholding some key information to make way for one last twist. The strangest thing, though, is how the filmmakers skip over the potential subtext (race/class issues) to make what's essentially a shallow, pointless thriller. Like a one-night stand, it's gripping while it lasts, but will be hard to remember in the morning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Clive Owen stars as a family man who gets his life turnt upside down when he meets a business-women (Jennifer Aniston) on the train. They decide to get together eventhough they both have families. Before they can have sex, a man (Vincent Cassel) busts in the motel room, robs them and rapes her. Things don't end there though because the man starts calling Owen and making threats to tell his wife on him unless he gets more money. After Owen gives him some, he calls wanting more and more and Owen has to figure out how to get him out of his life.<br /><br />  The trailers make it look like the movie is all about Owen and Aniston trying to get this bad man out of their lives but this is mostly Owen's movie and Cassel's. Vincent Cassel is great as the kind of  slimy villian you love to hate.  Aniston is basically just a side-character that doesn't have that much to do. Owen is excellent but the material isn't really worthy of his ability.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I think the title of my review sums up "Derailed" quite nicely.<br /><br />The 1st 30 minutes of this movie starts off very slowly. So slow in fact that my husband & I were contemplating stopping this DVD 25 minutes into "Derailed" because it was so boring!<br /><br />However, we did finish this movie and were glad that we did as the storyline does pick after the 1st 30 minutes. There were a lot of twists and turns in this movie and some suspense, however most of the major plot details were predictable! I won't bore you with the plot details as you can read what others have mentioned about the plot in their reviews.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was mediocre. Clive Owen's character in this movie was the most frustrating character in this movie. I had a difficult time believing some of the choices his character made in this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Derailed is full of surprises, not the least of which is that Jennifer Aniston, freed from romantic comedy, both on television and film, is an actress of surprising weight and darkness.<br /><br />This point is driven home early, when the sexy flirtations give way without warning to something different, in a sudden change of direction, and the film has more on the way.<br /><br />The film's not perfect -- Clive Owen's protagonist does several very dumb things along the way, when the alternative really isn't much worse, and in one case, what he does is almost unthinkably worse than what he's been threatened with -- and the big secret of the plot can be put together before Clive's character stumbles on it, but it's still an effective and affecting thriller.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for thriller fans and especially for anyone who thought that maybe, just maybe, Jenifer Aniston had more of a future ahead of her than just an endless series of Meg Ryan-style romantic comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>I'm not going to review the movie; just the Blu-Ray disc, which is what everyone who's interested in purchasing this movie on Blu-Ray wants to read.<br /><br />I purchased the 2010 Blu-Ray version of this film.  I can't believe that they can't make a good Blu-Ray disc from a 2005 movie.  There is a lot of grain.  A lot of detail, yes, but a lot of grain.  It is probably better than the DVD.  Just beware.

Bored married man and bored married woman meet; fatal attraction and, then the movie just derails. There is a semblance of chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen but it quickly evaporates.  Clive Owen is married, has a daughter with a chronic illness, bored with his job and his life, meets Jennifer Aniston; married wiht a daughter and too busy husband and an attraction ensues. They meet a couple of times and then one fateful night they go to a hotel. They start to make love when they are interrupted by a man with gun. A beating, a rape and then life starts to fall apart for both of them. Blackmail ensues and then Clive Owen decides he has to do something about this man who is ruining his life. All is not what it seems, and the twists and turns in this movie are out of line.  You become confused and begin to lose interest.<br /><br />The final scene is so out of character that you wonder if this is the same story line or was one juxtaposed to give this movie some life.  Whatever has happened, the movie has taken a final turn that does not make sense. Too bad, both Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston separately are fascinating people. Together they did not make a team.

This is no hard task considering that the characters are everyday people. Charles shrine had a simple life as a comercial executive. He had a loving wife, a dog named beanie, and a daughter who has diabetes. Everyday he would catch his train on time until one day he accidently missed the one he always takes. Oddly enough, when he boards the next train he is short on cash and forgot to buy a ticket. Thankfully, a woman a few rows ahead of him pays for him--This is where the two characters come together and eventually start another little train in motion. A train of intrigue and friednship and . . .possibly . . .adultry.<br /><br />The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was that it was formulated in the same way as THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT in where the hits and the shocks just keep coming. It makes you sympathize with Charles and even gets you in suspense from one event to the next. The villian is perfectly illustrated in this tense thriller as a man who wants the dough no matter who you are and will keep asking until eventually he gets paid. But this movie is far beyond blackmail, adultry, and a foolish man who should have looked the other way when another passenger paid for his ticket. In fact, he should've gotten off the train in the first place. But, be aware, there are a lot of shocking twists in this movie.<br /><br />As for the plot, I disagree with some of the other reviewers and say that this is a Hitchcock plot with a modern feel. Two people, meeting on a train, who end up in a world of trouble that they can't get out of. I mean, come on, that's hitchcock.<br /><br />However, this movie was done surprisingly well and I'm shocked that it only made 30 million at the box office. It will probably become one of those sleeper hits on dvd. This movie makes you want to read the book by james seigal just to see if all the peices fit or if the characters were drawn up right.<br /><br />It's really worth a look.<br /><br />This thriller proves that even though ordinary people misses their train; Fear arrives just on time.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m is a Swedish film director making his English speaking film debut with a atmospheric little thriller that, despite the gaps in the screenplay by Stuart Beattie based on the thriller novel by James Siegel that allow the story to become predictable, gives us a solid bit of entertainment as escapism. His style is tight, tense, and he is in love with  quirky camera angles that keep the viewer on edge.<br /><br />What begins as seemingly a little light comedy romance on a train in Chicago where ad exec Charles Schine (Clive Owen), married to Deanna (Melissa George) and father a young daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) who suffers form renal failure and is on dialysis, quite by serendipity is rescued from a lack of ticket by the beautiful, smart, classy Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) who is also married and also has a beloved daughter.  What develops is an intellectual repartee that evolves slowly but insidiously into passion and the two find themselves checking into a seedy hotel for a tryst, a grand mistake because in medias res their room is crashed by a smarmy Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel) who begins his blackmail of the affair by beating Charles and raping Lucinda.  After LaRoche leaves with their wallets, Lucinda begs Charles not to go to the police, as it would destroy her marriage.<br /><br />The manner in which the blackmail is drawn out with repeated threats and confrontations with both LaRoache and his hit man Dexter (Xzibit), Charles' confiding in an ex-con Winston (RZA) who proceeds to help Charles, and Charles' eventual loss of the money saved for his daughter's medical treatment make for the cat and mouse chase and game in which the true identity of each of the 'players' is revealed and Charles learns his lesson the hard way.<br /><br />To say more would disrupt the flow of the story for those who don't identify con games easily.  Clive Owen is magnetic and though Jennifer Anniston doesn't have a lot of screen time, when she is on she proves she can step into roles much different than previous fluffy ones.  The supporting cast is strong, and while this isn't a great movie, it certainly is a well-paced gripping little bit of entertainment if you allow yourself to flow with it.  The first twenty minutes of the movie justify its being made!

Sitting through this once was a pain enough, but I can't imagine anyone subjecting them to repeat viewings of this travesty.<br /><br />The good - Clive Owen is fantastic in a very poorly written role as a husband who wants to cheat on his wife with a stranger he meets on the train. Vincent Cassel is passably average as the villain of the piece - a `French' sounding person who insists on using clich&eacute;s and more clich&eacute;s to harass Owen and his pretty family (all of whom are blond in the most blatantly Aryan way imaginable)<br /><br />The bad - Jennifer Aniston. Need I elaborate? This woman can sink a ship simply by phoning in her existence. Never has the aging tart looked or sounded more pathetic, and her entire appearance is only what I can call `doggish'. They even give her some lines. Imagine that. She plays a woman on a train whose job it is to seduce unsuspecting men by taking them to hotel rooms, and then getting her boyfriend (Cassel) to torment them. She is the actual villain in this sordid Bollywood saga, and here she portrays a woman who is molested (though she actually isn't). Tedious.<br /><br />The Ugly - Jennifer Aniston. Nuff said.<br /><br />Final Views - This is not so much a movie as it is a trainwreck (the `Derailed' title makes sense in more ways than one). Many say that the plot is `absurd', but I just think its `unbelievably bad'. That said, the `happy ending' wasn't that much of an ending - everyone pretty much dies, though the more intelligent ones among us might actually take pleasure of the scenes where Aniston bleeds herself to a bloody, slow death after being accidentally shot. And then you remember its just a movie.<br /><br />Avoid at all cost. For a far better film, watch Angelina Jolie in "Beyond Borders". Now THAT'S how its done Jennifer.<br /><br />Two Stars for Clive Owen though - the man shines even in a heap of dung.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>When this film was released I really wanted to see it.  Horrid at worst, lukewarm at best reviews later and I decided to wait.  I actually decided to wait until it came out on TV but I had the opportunity to see it without any money lost in my pocket and so I decided to give it a watch through.  The outset, story and even acting was all a nice start.  Owen and Aniston have great chemistry together, and Jennifer was able to effectively leave here Rachel behind.<br /><br />The story revolves around a passionate bad decision on the part of Charles (Owen) and Lucinda (Aniston) who are both married but end up attempting to be unfaithful.  I say attempt because their plan is foiled by a masked mugger (Cassel) who in turn rapes Lucinda and beats Charles and then leaves them.  What appears to be a one time freak coincidence turns into a game of cat and mouse as this man demands money from both Charles and Lucinda to keep their secret of infidelity from their spouses.<br /><br />What could have been great falls a bit tired at the end, and I will admit that I did guess the big twist about half way through which made it a bit uneventful, but the acting was far better than I expected (I mean it stars among others RZA and Xzibit but shockingly both, especially RZA, do good here) and the overall experience was one that you won't fully regret.  It's nothing brilliant but it sure is entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*Derailed* is worth watching, even though it was a little predictable to me.<br /><br />Charles and his wife rarely see each other.  They're too busy with their work and the wife is busy with committments.  Their daughter is diabetic and has to do dialysis.<br /><br />Lucinda has a daughter, whom she adores.  Her husband does international travels so they only see each other on special occasions.<br /><br />Charles and Lucinda meets by happenstance on a train on a rainy day.  They meet up again for lunch.  They call their spouses to lie about working late.  They go to a hotel to have an affair.<br /><br />However, the affair is interrupted.  Charles gets beaten to unconsciousness.  Lucinda gets raped.  Afterwards, they go on their separate ways.  However, the thief/rapist doesn't go away.  He calls and demands money or else members of their families will get hurt.  Their savings are depleted and they become desperate to meet the demands.<br /><br />Lucinda seems to be pliant as long as it keeps the police out of it.  Charles wants to report it to the police.  However, without Lucinda's cooperation, Charles feels he needs to take matters into his own hands to stop the man.  This is when things start to get interesting.<br /><br />I'm used to seeing Jennifer Aniston in romantic comedies.  It was different seeing her in a thriller.  I have to say that she does a good job.<br /><br />Overall, it's a movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>For the first 45 minutes this was one of the dullest "thrillers" I had ever seen. The rest of it was one of the more cliche-ridden ones you'll ever watch. Clive Owen is an advertising exec who's marriage is rocky and has a daughter with diabetes. One morning on the train he meets Jennifer Aniston and they strike up a conversation which leads to flirting which leads to an attempted affair. Something very bad happens at the hotel they go to and the rest of the movie is Clive Owen being blackmailed and trying to keep his secret from his wife and also protect Aniston.<br /><br />The twists in this movie aren't hard to see coming and will surprise no one. The ending is unbelievable and wraps things up too neatly. The movie has a good cast, and is a nice looking film but it takes too long for anything to happen and then when it does, it's predictable.</p></br></body></html>

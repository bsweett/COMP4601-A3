Why she wasted her talent on this film, an overblown cartoon about an Englishwoman type superhero, is what I can't understand.  Jolie enters the action adventure genre with this film and I hope she doesn't intend to do more films in that genre.  If you like fight sequences, you might like this film.  If you like looking at Jolie, you also might like it.  That's not enough for me though and this film offered nothing else.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Tomb Raider is good fun and good for a rental.  The Movie itself will eventually be forgotten.  Angelina Jolie does good, and the plot it okay.  The effects are good, as well as the settings.  The movie is only okay.  See it if you love action.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Hey I will not lie to you guys going to see this movie was a very fun experience.  However it is the type of movie you can only go and see once before it becomes utterly worthless.  <p>This is the kind of movie you go to see(or rent)for the cars, the music and the frontal cookware of one Angelina Jolie.  <p>The best part about the movie was that my main man Rimmer(from Red Drawf) got a bit part.</p></br><a href="../users/AAI57M3OXP5NK.html">AAI57M3OXP5NK</a><br/><p>This movie is worth the watch but not a good storyline at all because she could have destroyed that part of the triangle and it would have ended it right there but no they had to keep it going anyways it had okay special effects it looks worse on TV than it did in the movie theatres.  The DVD is okay but nothing spectacular.  this movie is worth a watch but i can't watch this movie after one time, it annoys me.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>I was a really big fan of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; phenomenon when the whole thing began on PlayStation and PC, and I knew that there was going to be a movie someday, it was just the matter of when they are going to release it. Now comes the hard part...who will be Lara Croft?! Well, I always thought that either Sandra Bullock, Elizabeth Hurley, and even Demi Moore would be among the lucky ones to play Lara. But when Angelina Jolie secured the part, man, was I going to get a real kick out of this!! When I finally saw it in the theaters, I thought that the movie was great! I loved how Angelina flew up to her chandelier on her bungee cord and the way she shoots both her guns at the same time, now that's something that the skills of an expert can handle! And now, I have the DVD of &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;, and I love all the extras that are jam packed into the DVD, such as the U2 music video, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, cast and crew interviews, and much more! In closing, I would just like to say that Angelina Jolie is quite frankly the absolute best Lara Croft around. And &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; is possibly one of Angelina Jolie's best films since &quot;Gia&quot;, &quot;Hackers&quot;, and &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;. This is more fun than playing the video games of this!!</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>Ah yes, Angelina Jolie...well, this film did not do much for me -in spite of her presence.  The effects and action were okay, but the characters were paper-thin, the plot was murky (if you could call it a plot at all), and the overall of the film was uninspiring.  One gets the feeling that any one of several so-called action stars could have substituted for Ms. Jolie (and I don't think much of any of them, either).  Angelina does have some pretty good acting chops (&quot;Girl Interrupted&quot;, for example), but hardly showcases them here...</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO.html">A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO</a><br/><p>Angeline Jole rocks (&amp; rolls) as Lara Croft in this exciting movie involving an artifact which can manipulate time itself!<p>Hey guys, hands off, she's mine!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>This film by Simon West is no Raiders Of The Lost Ark but you have to admit Angelina looks fit enough to be in WWF, in<br />terms of seeing a lifeless video game charachter that only you<br />control Angelina's presence is welcomed no doubt she looks and<br />is Laura Croft in this film in a film that really dosen't give<br />anything but a fun summer popcorn flick , but then again so was<br />Raiders.Angelina underwent some brutal training and did almost<br />all of her own stunts , her father John Voight makes a cameo<br />in the film but is not really top brass in this but don't take<br />my word for it judge for yourself this is only my opinon it's<br />a really fun film and if you like the mummy films , Indiana<br />Jones film you will love Tomb Raider hang on and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>This film by Simon West is no Raiders Of The Lost Ark but you have to admit Angelina looks fit enough to be in WWF, in<br />terms of seeing a lifeless video game charachter that only you<br />control Angelina's presence is welcomed no doubt she looks and<br />is Laura Croft in this film in a film that really dosen't give<br />anything but a fun summer popcorn flick , but then again so was<br />Raiders.Angelina underwent some brutal training and did almost<br />all of her own stunts , her father John Voight makes a cameo<br />in the film but is not really top brass in this but don't take<br />my word for it judge for yourself this is only my opinon it's<br />a really fun film and if you like the mummy films , Indiana<br />Jones film you will love Tomb Raider hang on and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>There is really only one reason to watch this movie. Only one reason to tolerate it. That reason : Angelina Jolie. There is no question that this girl is a great actress. While this film may not show you her true talents, she does do the best of what she had been given. She is definitley her hottest in this film. She might be a tad quirky in real life, but, that's endearing. This movie is pretty mediocre. I'm not a Lara Croft fan. In fact, I don't really know anything about it. I really wasn't expecting much. I didn't get much either. The silly plot about time or something, I really can't remember, was pretty transparent. I mean, I just said I can't even remember it!. The action scenes are pretty adequate. The raid on the mansion is especially fun and thrilling. It's too bad the rest of the film couldn't hold on to that thrillness. Is thrillness even a word?. Oh well. Jon Voight is on hand in a cameo as Lara's father. Voight, a brilliant actor, is pretty much not there in his performance of a barely there character. If mindless, senseless action films is your thing, you'll probaby like this. Others will probably just fall asleep. Five stars for Jolie tho. Not worth raiding.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>Why is it, that we want more from a movie than is on offer?  Come on chaps, &quot;Lara Croft - Tomb Raider&quot; isn't a film of any intellectual merit, it is merely an exciting adventure movie with a whole host of good special effects and lots of quality funny moments.  I for one really enjoyed this film, I expected nothing from it other than a series of explosions and gun battles and that is what I got and I loved every single minute of it.  The plot wasn't too complicated, with Lara piecing together a mystery about an ancient clock and two pieces of a mystical triangle that has the ability to fragment time and space and of course there are the obligatory bad guys trying to get their hands on it.  There was a fine cast of characters from Iain Glenn playing the evil Mr. Powell (the main bad guy) to Chris Barrie of Red Dwarf fame coming across with great aplomb as the overtly English Butler Hillary who tries and fails to make his young employer into a regal young lady instead of a gun-toting maniac.  One of my favorite moments is when Hillary realizes that the security in the Croft Mansion has been breeched and there is a battle going on downstairs.  He calmly gets out of bed, dons a bullet proof vest taken from his wardrobe, locks and loads a massive double barreled shot gun without blinking an eye then carefully steps into his leather slippers before stepping out to join the melee.  I cracked up laughing, it was SO funny!  Angelina Jolie is well cast as Lara Croft, and she manages a pretty good English accent too as well as doing ALL her own stunts which impressed me big time.  The special effects were superb, watch out for when a husky-dog jumps through a break in the fabric of time, it's awesome.  All in all this is fun, fun film and that is the way it should be treated.  The DVD is worth every cent and is stuffed full of extras that just add to the enjoyment of the film.  So come on chaps, give it a chance, you never know, you just might enjoy yourselves!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ.html">A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ</a><br/><p>Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie, brings the popular video game to the big screen to fine results.<p>THE STORY:<p>Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider, must search the world for a mysterious relic that holds to key to controlling time and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>For fans of the video games, Jolie's depiction of Lara Croft is just amazing.  It really does feel like the game come to life with the mysterious locales, mysterious artifacts, treacherous monsters and rival tomb raiders.  Easily the main driver of this movie is it's myriad of action sequences and the awesome special FX.  The cool background story of "a Father and Daughter's Love that Defies Time" is another cool aspect to the film.<p>BEST SCENES:<p>1. The Mansion Battle<p>2. The Battle in the Cambodia Temple<p>3. The Last Fight Scene<p>THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS<p>All cool things aside, the storyline takes a major backseat to the action here however.  The rough gist of the story was Lara's need to prevent the time control device from falling into the wrong hands but to be honest, the actual storytelling gets quite confusing and if you blink for a minute you'll probably miss a lot of the story development.  The movie itself moves at a frantic pace and if not paying attention carefully you'll definitely miss out on some key plot developments (such as why are we suddenly in this particular locale).  Don't feel too bad though, it's the poor storytelling and not your lack of attentiveness.<p>That being said though, you're more than likely watching this movie for the eye candy (action, FX and Lara Croft) and not the brilliant storytelling.<p>THE DVD EXTRAS:<p>Like most action film DVDs of late, what the movie lacks is MORE than made up for in the awesome extras package of the DVD.  Among the cornucopia of awesome goodies in this batch are:<p>1. "Crafting Lara Croft" - 7 minute featurette about Angelina Jolie's extensive martial arts and weapons training to prepare for her role as Lara Croft.  Cool stuff.  Remind me not to mess with her...<p>2. Director's Audio Commentary Track - Always insightful<p>3. 4 Deleted Scenes - Some good, some alright<p>4. "Stunts" - 8 minute featurette about how some of the action stunts (particularly the<br />Mansion battle scene) were filmed.<p>5. "Digging Into Tomb Raider" - 25 minute feature that talks about the entire movie including it's video game origins, the stunts, Jolie's training as well as shooting on location in Cambodia and Greenland.<p>6. Music Video - "Elevation" by U2<p>7. "Are You Game?" - 8 minute featurette that talked about the Tomb Raider games and how they translated the game to the big screen.<p>8. Alternate Main Title Sequence<p>9. Visual FX - Several mini featurettes on how they filmed all the big Special FX scenes in the movie.  Cool stuff!!!<p>THE VERDICT:<p>While the story and storytelling may be pretty lacking, this film DOES deliver the goods in spades in terms of action and FX so viewers will be pleased in the action category and the story is easy enough to follow along and get the "basic gist" of if nothing else.<p>For fans of the Tomb Raider games you'll be pleased with the rendering of everyone's favorite action heroine and the DVD extras provide some awesome insight into the world of Lara Croft.<p>Overall, action fanatics should be pleased with this film which is great for a rental or a purchase.  The awesome DVD extras make it a solid addition to your collection if you're so inclined.<p>GRADES:<p>The Movie:  3 ? stars<br />The DVD Extras:  5 stars<br />Overall:  4 ? stars<p>Recommended</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>I'm not sure what possessed me to pick up Tomb Raider after reading all the horrible reviews already posted for it, but I did, and while Tomb Raider is everything that has already been said about it, I still found it a fun and worthwhile purchase. <p>Tomb Raider had the task of trying to please two distinct groups of fans: the video gamers who wanted an accurate adaptation of their beloved franchise (I never got around to finishing the first game), and those drooling for another Indiana Jones-style adventure flick. On the first count, Tomb Raider (TR) succeeds admirably. Lara Croft's world is perfectly translated to the screen, and Lara Croft herself is perfectly captured by Angelina Jolie. Like the games, the movie has Lara facing ancient evils and supernatural powers all while blasting away evil guardians and humans attemptng to thwart her. All the actors are believable, and the dialogue can be very witty at times: When the Illuminanti tell their field agent he must hurry or risk waiting another 5000 years, he answers that that's more time than he's willing to commit to this enterprise. It's not too hard to imagine someone in real life saying something of a similiar nature. The subplot of Lara wanting to see her father again adds depth that wasn't found in the game. Tomb Raider is a good video game adaptation, easily the best since the original Mortal Kombat movie.<p>However, as an adventure flick, Tomb Raider is sorely lacking. The movie feels like four distinct action set pieces coupled together with bits of dialgoue and traveling. At one point, Croft and her allies head to Siberia, but we're never told exactly how they knew to search there. This is one case where I wouldn't have minded if the movie had been longer, just so we could get a sense of the logistics behind the globetrotting. Another gripe is the action sequences: they're flashy, loud, rapidly cut, and totally ruin whatever excitment they were trying to build. Think back to the Indiana Jones Trilogy or even The Mummy Returns: these had nicely choreographed action sequences set to epic scores, where the viewer could savour the action without being over-bombarded. Then there is the special effects: A lot of them weren't needed. The Ray Harryhausen-ish stone monkeys were cool, but I could have done without the lightening in the final scene, and if they'd filmed the flashback of the triangle's origin using real locations, it would have been more believable. Lastly, there is the suspension of disbelief factor. The movie asks us to buy the whole 'controlling time with a mythical triangle' storyline. Okay, fine, for the movie's sake, I will. But plots like these need realistic scenes to ground them, and the movie doesn't have enough. Case in point: Lara drinks some tea given to her by a monk, which magicaly heals her wound. Walking stone monkeys I can accept, but herbal tea has its limits!<p>So while Tomb Raider succeeds as a video-game-based movie, it fails as an adventure movie. The disc has top-notch video and sound, but while the supplements are generally good, they're not enough to warrant a purchase by themselves. While Tomb Raider isn't the best movie I've ever seen, I enjoyed it enough that I can honestly say I didn't waste 100min of my time.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>If anything would prove that most films based on comic book or computer game characters are rarely worth a jot of concentration, this one should.  This film is terrible on every level - wooden acting, silly stunts that are obviously computer-enhanced, and the most flaccid plot you could imagine, just pure formula garbage.  The worst.<br /><br />Don't bother, unless you want to vegatate and wallow in mindless pap.  There is nothing to recommend this film, not even you-know-who's computer exaggerated chest.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YXMN40D7WTGP.html">A2YXMN40D7WTGP</a><br/><p>The Tombraider series has done well as a video game, mainly due to it's good gameplay and the main character, which the designers managed to give a personality (as well as breasts)that supersedes the other paper thin characters in the video game market. <p>However, that does not mean that it would transfer well into good cinema, where breasts just don't cut it as good character development or story telling. <p>The film project starts well enough by getting Angelina Jolie. While her accent in this movie is mixed at best, she looks the part and has the body to match. <p>However, the rest of the pieces that make the Tomb Raider pie fall completely short. <p>Simon West, a mediocre director at best, is not known for movies where character development is prevalent. I mean, in his Con Air, he has accomplished actors like John Cusack, Nicolas Cage (at that time), Ving Rhames and John Malkovich, but ends up making them paper characters, secondary to his image that movies should be a montage of 5 second cuts and involve one big explosion after another. <p>The writing team is little better and the story they provide is so preposterous, that they should be blacklisted for trying to subvert the already simple minded summer audiences into mindless zombies. <p>Lara Croft is a rich aristocrat type who is also a part proclaimed archaeologist. She get's this from her father who is also an archaeologist, but mysteriously disappeared while trying to find the location of the &quot;Clock of Ages&quot;, a wonderous object that can bend time when the planets are aligned (once every 5K years). <p>The force behind finding the clock and it's various parts is a group called the Illuminati, and they discover that Lara unwittingly has the first piece, which is needed to find the other two pieces, which operate the clock. <p>There are many problems that even my huge &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; mind cannot ignore. <p>1. It seems like Lara knows every language in the world. I mean, how many people can fluently speak Thai, Russian and can read obscure symbolic mumbo jumbo like it was all English? <p>2. She is bullet proof. She has the Arnold Swartzennegger, Commando syndrome, where bullets do not apply to her. 15 Commandos raid her home and she takes them all out without the need of a gun. <p>3. Scenes which involve getting a piece for the clock are arranged just like a video. Okay, I know this is based off a video game, but do you have to make it THAT obvious? <p>4. She is immune to cold. How many people can cross the Siberian wasteland in a T-shirt and a thin (often open) jacket? <p>5. She doesn't have to think. All the mysteries are given to her. And anything she doesn't know, the movie gods give her the answer without having to research any of it (this becomes apparent when a dog at the end of the movie walks through something that no one on earth has ever have seen before). Of course Lara knows that was a &quot;time storm&quot; and the effect that it would have, as if she sees such things on a regular basis. <p>Lara also doesn't seem to have much of a pulse. Her facial expression never seems to portray fear, nervousness or a sense that she might be in big trouble. Her voice rarely climbs above that sultry level she speaks, even if ten stone soldiers just tried to kill her. <p>Combine this with a one sided badguy who the director badly portrays as neither very evil or redeemably good and a love interest that she seems more annoyed with, Tomb Raider is my pick as one of the worst summer popcorn movies of 2001. <p>The DVD does a fair transfer and the sound effects are well done. If I had more interest in this movie, I would have checked out the special features, but I didn't. I turned this DVD off as the first credit opened and returned it for my money back</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>I suppose the special effects are ok here. I just don't get too excited about these types of films. This was a 2001 vehicle for the then slightly less famous Angelina Joli whose main claim to fame here are her enormous breasts and overly plumped fish lips. She is not a bad actress, really, but you would think she would opt for slightly more cerebral films. I guess she likes money. Poor Daniel Craig has nothing whatsoever to do here pre-James Bond. If you are 15, or have the maturity of the same, then you may enjoy this silliness.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>This film just did NOT do it for me.  Sadly, the film cannot capture the tension and unexpected excitement that spills over your game controller every time you play the video game.  Thankfully, this film is not as thankless as the sequel, but it rarely makes a real impact.  I didn't expect that at all.  Seeing Angelina Jolie all reared and ready to go as this classic video game vixen, I really expected more out of the whole thing, but instead I got a marginally entertaining action flick with an uninhabited lead actress who didn't seem to connect with this character at all.  She seemed disengaged, which is a shame because on paper this works gloriously.  The plot is a shamble, but that is to be expected (I mean, it's not like the video game was too concerned about being plausible) but the tense engagement a person feels while sifting through clues on their own to `solve the puzzles' is lost in this unimaginative rendering of the prose.  Instead, we get a film that feels generic in texture and certainly less inspired than the cultural phenomenon that the video game became.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Lighten up Lara. There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel.<br /><br />Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Fans of the Tomb Raider games may grumble at the change in Lara's character.  In the original game, she had been ostracized by her family after her survival of a crash.  In the movie, she is a much-loved daughter, but orphaned.  But it still works.<p>The key to the games is problem solving.  In the movie, much of the problem solving is done off-screen so that it almost seems like Lara has all of the solutions already memorized.<p>A planetary conjunction is at the heart of the story.  The conjunction is the only time when the pieces of a fabulous device from an ancient civilization may be found.  An organization known as the Illuminati (based on the real group) is after the device.  Lara is sucked in when she uncovers a key her father left her.<p>The story travels the globe with lavish sets and more action than most.  From start to finish the action almost never stops and the story remains fairly true to the spirit of the games.<p>The disk comes packed with plenty of extras; deleted scenes, commentary, making of, effects, music video, etc.  Of course some of the making of information is untrue (obvious if you followed any of the stories during the making of the film), but are still fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ANP3R2R4V4GAN.html">ANP3R2R4V4GAN</a><br/><p>I really liked this film.  I liked it so much I went to se eit in the movies twice.  TWICE!  And I had to sit thee with ... 12 year old boys and was about to get into a debate with them on the veracity of Ms. Jolie's...eeeeeehhhhhhhh..........endowments.  She is a beautiful woman.  Beautiful in not simply an exotic way, but a naturally exotic way.  She also seems like an actress who is comfortable with what is going on around her.  I've seen her in a couple of movies and she seems very comfortable with the sihft from romance to thriller to action hero.  The plot is a little convoluted in the sense that it goes really far out on a limb about the Illuminati and the alignment of planets.  That was a little hard to believe.  That a society could exist for only one moment in time.  If maybe this happened every 50 years, that might've been more believable and the time traveling was handled nicely as more or reality altering than true going back.<br />The action scenes are great particuliarly the aerial fight when theives break into her mansion.  I have to admit that I haven't seen anythign like that in quite some time, it was amazing and one of my all time favorite action scenes for teh amoutn of stuff going on, as well as the inventiveness of it.<br />There wre points where the soundtrack was annoying loud and brash but it does really work well with the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Instead of your typical pumped full of steroids male, you get the very svelte, toned &amp; very female, Angelina Jolie, playing the computer game heroine. Making a computer game into a film has not always been well accepted in cinemas - for example, Mortal Kombat &amp; Resident Evil - but this one is a sure-fire hit for the studio. Had they not picked Angelina, it might not have been that good. I can't see it being good without her. You really can't imagine anyone else in that role now. She's taken it and made it hers. <p>Apart from the physical attributes she brings to the role (put the tongues away guys), she also manages to speak very well in an English accent, which actors have failed to do so in the past. (Think Keanu Reeves in `Bram Stoker's Dracula' or Tom Cruise's pitiful excuse for an Irish accent in `Far &amp; Away')<p>Angelina has been well known for her tattoos, so the studio probably weren't that keen on her for the role, because of the difficulty make-up artists would have had covering them up. None of them can be seen during the film - particularly the well-known `Billy Bob' tattoo on her left arm. It's not easy to cover up tattoos, and sure, some of her tattoos are in parts of her body which wouldn't be shown on film, but that `Billy Bob' tattoo must have been HELL for makeup artists every day. <p>The CGI &amp; the set are extremely similar to `The Mummy' and `The Mummy Returns', and all three films obviously take their inspiration from the Indiana Jones movies.<p>There's not as much action or violence as I expected in this film, I expected a lot more. There are bursts of violence, interspersed with strange scenes, with a haunting/pounding soundtrack. The use of guns is big in this film, shooting the strange CGI, or shooting bad guys - none of whom seem seriously hurt! <p>I know he's dead in the film, but Jon Voight, as Lara's father (and also her father in real life!), should have had a bigger role. He's only really seen at the start, opposite a young actress playing a young Lara Croft, and then at the end, playing opposite his real-life daughter. <p>If you're a fan of Red Dwarf, look out for Chris Barrie (Rimmer), in the very Batman butler role of Henry.<p>I didn't expect to enjoy this movie, but as I like Angelina Jolie as an actress, I thought I'd give it a go. It's very fast paced, the time flies by and before you know it, it's over. I'm glad I bought it now.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>I love a movie that has a lot of action. I tried playing a demo of one of the "Lara Croft" video games a couple of years ago, and I wasn't very good at it, so I figured it'd be a lot more cooler to watch instead of playing. WAS I RIGHT. It has adventure with action and fantasy. I guess you  either love or you hate video game adaptions. Everybody on this website hated "Super Mario Brothers" and I liked it, and "The Cat In The Hat." I don't know why. That had the same humor as the Grinch. But that's not a video game originally. It's just something that I liked and everyone else, for no reason that I can think of, hated.<br /><br />Heeeeerrreee'ss the plot:<br /><br />The Illuminati is some kind of "group" that Lara Croft {Angelina Jolie} has to stop. In order to do that, she needs to find pieces to the Triangle of Light, which goes back to her father's {Jon Voight, her real-life father} past. He had been missing for quite some time and hadn't been found. She has to go and find them on a dangerous quest. I'm not sure what else to say about the plot. I just found this movie to be pretty entertaining. Lara goes on a big adventure that is worth seeing for the special effects and the action!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Hey, what the heck!  This is a movie adaptation of a video game, for pete's sake.  What do you expect?  This movie is flashy, fun, wildly ridiculous, campy, and adventurous.  Angelina Jolie pouts and moves appropriately; the action sequences are well choreographed, and the bad guys lose.  What more could one want in this type of movie.  Iain Glen is sufficiently villainous; Daniel Craig is a hunky, if traitorous, former associate; Chris Barrie is delightful as Lara's manservant, Hillary; and Noah Taylor as nerdy Bryce couldn't be better.  Grame Revill's score is nice, and Simon West's direction, while not all that original, moves the film along.<br />One shouldn't look for Oscar caliber material all the time; just sit back and watch instead of play the video game movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>There isn't a lot of plot to this movie, but it's still the best movie I've seen so far that's based on a video game.

The dialogue is also well thought out containing lots of memorable little quips one can store away for personal use at a later date.<br /><br />Lots of fun provided for a high energy evening so fasten your seat belts!</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Apart from Angelina's knockers, this film is a complete bore. Did anyone mention plot? Didn't think so. Did anyone mention acting? Nope. Did anyone mention good action? And that's the shocker of all shockers, they could of at least thrown in some cool action set-pieces, but what's on show here rarely passes mediocrity. Major dissapointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This is a delightful film, jam packed with excitement. In addition, Angelina Jolie moves about in a tight t-shirt in virtually all the scenes, except the last few minutes, even in the freezing arctic, showing what appears to be, but may not be, artificially extended breasts. She is portrayed in the film as a virtual superwoman, what the disc cover calls the "ultimate superhero," with amazing intellect, strength, and agility. In fact, we see her training frequently in remarkable ways to maintain her skills.<br /><br />The plot is sci-fi. Nine planets will line up once every 5,000 years. This is an opportunity to combine certain items and gain enormous powers over time and space. Laura's now dead father trained her for this event. She is determined to do what her father requested. But there is a group of illuminati who also want this power, and their henchman who wants it for himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>I guess you can't really expect much from a movie based on a video-game. There are plenty of fanciful actions scenes (how do they always seem to miss point-blank with automatic weapons?...) but not much of a plot to speak of. Silly story; sub-par movie.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>The trailers looked pretty fun, right? As long as I wasn't expecting anything Shakespearean, it might be entertaining, right?<p>Wrong.<p>The plot ... the plot ... the pain. In the abrupt climax, the villains, the fabled Illuminati, turn out to be chumps. And talk about abrupt! You don't realize that was actually the big finish (so to speak) until the credits roll and ... wait, that was it?<p>Lara Croft also dispatches huge stone monsters with ridiculous ease, and bullets from her little guns.<p>Is this review incoherent? Yes, have some. Well, that's the feeling you get after seeing this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>Video transfer quality is great. Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 soundtrack is very clean - I haven't listened to the DTS soundtrack, but it includes one. Special features are PLENTY, among which are both a trailer and a teaser trailer in HD.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie, I would say you get a great value for the money with the quality and all the features. If you've never seen this movie before, and you feel the same way as I do about some of the other movies I've reviewed here on Amazon, then you may feel the same way as I do about "Tomb Raider" as well.<br /><br />My first impression - having all the bells and whistles of a great surround system - leads me to conclude that it's plenty "Tomb" but not quite "Raider".<br /><br />The story is decent as far as "adventures" go, perhaps more on the unconvincing side, but the action seemed small to me: gunfire petite...explosions dainty...somewhat corny...Lara evades a gunman's barrage of bullets in the main lobby of her mansion like a schoolyard tetherball going around its pole, and I couldn't help but be reminded of writings I remember from the U.S.S. Alabama - "Lead Dammit, Lead!"<br /><br />"Tomb Raider" may be more of (but not necessarily) a "chick flic" adventure (pardon the reference) strongly cashing in on the "daddy's little girl" theme, which could easily alienate some. However, do not assume me biased about a female lead: I found "Aeon Flux" to be an outstanding film - it too has a female lead.<br /><br />It turns out I honestly just didn't like this movie. If you're a fan of the "Tomb Raider" videogame, or of Angelina Jolie, or of archeological adventures or of the aforementioned thematic structure, you might get a kick out of this film. If you're particular about your collection, you may want to be cautious about this one - but in its defense, it's all a matter of taste.<br /><br />I neither recommend nor condemn this film - I just didn't like it.</p></br><a href="../users/ANP3R2R4V4GAN.html">ANP3R2R4V4GAN</a><br/><p>I really liked this film. I liked it so much I went to se eit in the movies twice. TWICE! And I had to sit thee with ... 12 year old boys and was about to get into a debate with them on the veracity of Ms. Jolie's...eeeeeehhhhhhhh..........endowments. She is a beautiful woman. Beautiful in not simply an exotic way, but a naturally exotic way. She also seems like an actress who is comfortable with what is going on around her. I've seen her in a couple of movies and she seems very comfortable with the sihft from romance to thriller to action hero. The plot is a little convoluted in the sense that it goes really far out on a limb about the Illuminati and the alignment of planets. That was a little hard to believe. That a society could exist for only one moment in time. If maybe this happened every 50 years, that might've been more believable and the time traveling was handled nicely as more or reality altering than true going back.<br />The action scenes are great particuliarly the aerial fight when theives break into her mansion. I have to admit that I haven't seen anythign like that in quite some time, it was amazing and one of my all time favorite action scenes for teh amoutn of stuff going on, as well as the inventiveness of it.<br />There wre points where the soundtrack was annoying loud and brash but it does really work well with the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Angelina Jolie was the perfect choice to play the video game heroine Lara Croft.  Jolie delivers high-paced action and stunts throughout the film.  She obviously trained long and hard for this role. <p>The movie is loaded with excellent special effects and action sequences.  Sometimes the plot is hard to follow.  Watch this high-paced film.  Its one you will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>Most of the sets were great, I also liked many of the stunts and special effects but not really a great movie. I've seen the Indiana Jones movies, didn't think they were great either, and found this one to be very similar in nature although perhaps more oddly paced. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft might actually be better than Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones but really you're getting Indiana with a braid and an accent. It's O.K. to spend a couple of hours with but not deeply satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I am really tired of people putting this movie down. When I read the negative reviews it's obvious to me most of these people have never even seen the movie because they have no clue as to what they are talking about. First of all, this is the only movie that is completely faithful to the video game. No, Lara isn't running through tombs throughout the entire thing flipping switches but that would be boring. Lara does go in a tomb though and solves puzzles which is what the game is about. The game is also about this strong, independent woman out to save the world. Which is what this movie faithfully brings to the screen. So what if Lara isn't wearing a green shirt and brown shorts??? She's wearing all black in the new Tomb Raider game. Give me a break! And Angelina Jolie is the perfect Lara Croft. Even the game's real life models don't look as much like Lara as Angelina does. And her acting in this movie is wonderful. She brings to the film a sense of power and control that not even the game has. When you see Angelina playing Lara you know she is always in complete control of the situation. The storyline is great. It takes Lara all over the world in great locations and the whole thing is about solving one big puzzle which is what the game is about. What more do you want people??? Tomb Raider is the perfect video game movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q.html">A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q</a><br/><p>Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), adventurer and heiress, finds a mysterious clock in Croft Manor when it starts ticking on the night of the first stage of the alignment of all nine planets. Lara discovers that this clock will lead her to two triangle pieces that when put together at the exact moment of the alignment of the planets, the possessor will have the power to control time. But she Manfred Powell (Ian Glen), a member of a group called the Illuminati who want to use the power of the All-Seeing Eye, steals that clock from her. It's now up to her with the help of her friend Bryce (Noah Taylor) and later on another 'tomb raider' Alex West (Daniel Craig), to find the two pieces of the triangle before the Illuminati use the power for their own diabolical plot. But Lara herself be tested when she starts having thoughts of using 'time' to be able to be with her long dead father, Lord Richard Croft (John Voight). Will she able to resist the temptation? <p>I was totally impressed by Angelina Jolie with her doing most of her own stunts. I thought that action scenes using the bungee cord was pretty neat. Angelina sort of reminds me of Sophia Loren, you know the big lips parted a little. As for the plot, it was pretty cheesy but still it was entertainment. <p>But the best part of the whole movie is of course the cool action scenes! The four main action scenes are 1) the beginning where Lara is head-to-head against Bryce's robot, 2) where the bad guys are trying to steal the clock from Croft Manor (with Lara giving them a pretty hard time), 3) when Lara 'raids' the Tomb of the Dancing Light, and 4) the finale with Lara and bad guys going into the Tomb of Ten Thousand Shadows. The computer graphics were actually good.<p>As for the DVD itself, it's a pretty good special edition DVD. Plenty of special features, my favorites are the cast and crew interviews, a featurette on Angelina Jolie's physical training for the role, about the stunts, explains about the visual effects that were used in the movie, deleted scenes, and the U2 music video &quot;Elevation&quot;. Of the four deleted scenes, three of them I was happy they had deleted. The one scene in which Powell killed Lara's friend was pretty grotesque. The one they shouldn't have deleted was the one where Lara takes the one part of the triangle from Alex's room. There are also some DVD-rom features.<br /><br />All in all, it was a pretty fantastic movie to watch, enjoyable by people who want to spend two hours at home watching a film which you won't have to think too much but still have fun watching the action. Can't wait till &quot;Tomb Raider 2&quot; comes out!</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Oddly enough, if I were writing reviews when I first went and saw this film at the theater when it was first released, I probably would've given it only a three or four star review and slightly panned it, especially since the producers felt it necessary to "overly endow" Angelina Jolie.  There are times in the movie where one might get the impression she may get "knocked" out.  <p>Not unlike other films though, this one kind of grows on you and can be appreciated for what it is, a great action film couched a reasonably well thought out plot.  One of the most important aspects to the success or lack thereof in this film was the leading role of Lara Croft.  The decision to cast the ever beautiful Angelina Jolie was right on target.  I can honestly say that I don't think I've ever watched any of her previous movies, but I can say that she performs quite exceptionally in the role of the female "Indiana Jones/James Bond" type superhero.  The fact that she spent several months preparing for this film and performed the majority of the stunts makes this movie that much more appreciable, especially considering the effort she put into it.  Her reactions, facial movements and overall style of acting certainly adds a good "flavor" to the movie as well.<p>Of particular note is the style in which this film was produced.  Given that it is based on a video game and previous efforts to project video games onto the silver screen have come off as "campy" and lame, the producers made an outstanding decision to put this film in a "serious" light, with a mostly workable plot.  Given that I've only had a passing familiarity with the video games themselves, I don't really wish to comment on that particular aspect.<p>Of the many great action films I've watched over the years, I'd rate this one pretty high as it definitely exceeds expectations and leaves you wishing for more, which brings to mind the pending release of the second Tomb Raider movie.  Hopefully this movie will stand up to or exceed the popularity of this first Tomb Raider film!<p>The premise:<p>Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, Tomb Raider performs exceptionally well; from A to Z she immersed herself in this role, including an extremely believable British accent.  The film begins with a great main title and opening sequence where Lara Croft if "battling" Simon, a machine that is well bent towards killing her.  This of course, is but the first of many outstanding action sequences for the Tomb Raider.<p>From there we're brought into the real plot which is Lara Croft, prompted by dreams and letters from the grave starts to piece together clues about her missing and presumed dead, father.  This brings her into the hunt for an ancient and powerful device while at the same time dealing with another person who is seeking this device for not so altruistic purposes.<p>I highly recommend this film to any and all that are fans of great action sequences/films that "actually" contain a reasonably decent plot.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>This one is definitely full of some great Special Features that are definitely worth the time to explore.<p>Digging Into Tomb Raider<br />Crafting Lara Croft<br />The Stunts of Tomb Raider<br />Visual Effects of Tomb Raider<br />Are you Game?<br />Commentary by Director Simon West<br />4 Deleted Scenes<br />Alternate Main Title Sequences<br />U2 Music Video, "Elevation" Tomb Raider Mix<p>DVD-ROM Features<br />Tomb Raider Timeline<br />Tomb Raider Chronicles Game Demo<br />Web Site Archive<p>Access To the Online Experience</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>When the coming alignment of all the planets in the solar system triggers the ticking of a clock hidden away by Lara Croft's  (Angelina Jolie) eccentric archeologist father (John Voight) it signals the beginning of a new era for the young adventuress.  Lord Croft's disappearance and presumed death had hurt her badly, and she had spent her life so far in a desperate quest to be what her father wanted her to be, a great field archeologist, Britain's answer to Indiana Jones.<p>Within the clock is yet another, this one the key to unlock the two pieces of the Pyramid of Light.  And the holder of the Pyramid can warp time.  Lara can return to her father and discover the cause of his disappearance.  Or the Illuminati can take over the world.  To prevent this Lara must outwit and outmuscle Powell (Iain Glen) the conspiracies agent.  And keep her old friend Alex West (Daniel Craig) from selling her out.  <p>Based on the computer game series by Eidos Interactive, Jolie's Lara is smart, sexy, and tough as nails.  The actress spent three months in hard physical training for the part and performed many of her own stunts.  Of course, this isn't the kind of film where great acting is to be expected.  But all the characters, from Lara's eccentric assistant Bryce (Noah Taylor) right through to the star herself turn in solid, professional performances.  If the dialog isn't brilliant, at least it isn't stupid.  Of course, the real stars of the film aren't the humans but the technical teams.<p>I hardly thought that, when I first read Shea and Wilson's 'Illuminatus Trilogy' some thirty years ago, that I would find myself watching astonishing adventures of at heroine of a computer game in a race against time to save the world.  Completely new technologies would have to come into being before this was possible.  Back then, the closest thing to a real time game was an anemic version of Star Trek, and the only adventure game had you chasing (very slowly) through a few dozen 'twisty little passages.'  Taken from that viewpoint, the spectacular visuals of 'Tomb Raider' are a testimonial to the state of animation and special effects.  <p>The film is meant to be fun, and a recreation in 'reality' of a computer game world, and does that perfectly.  Lara, as a woman, succeeds in a world where we once thought only men had a place.  Even so, almost every other actor in the film is male, the next longest female role being the bit part of a Cambodian girl (Ayla Amiral), who points out the entrance to one of the lost tombs.  Angelina is literally 'without competition.'  Even with a new Lara Croft film in the offing, this one will be tough to beat.<p>The requisite extras are provided on the DVD.  Features on visual effects, Angelina Jolie, the computer game, Angelina Jolie, the director's commentary, and (of course) Angelina Jolie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C21DQ4FQARGV.html">A2C21DQ4FQARGV</a><br/><p>i love this movie. It just works. Jolie did a good job and i love the end where shes visit her father's grave in the end wearing a cute white dress and hate.

Being a mentally lightweight action film with no credibility (no villain ever harms Jolie in this film despite firepower that would take out some Third World countries) but our heroine is there to save the day, of course!<br /><br />Jolie mainly is there to show off her chest in tight tee-shirts and perform near-impossible stunts. To her credit, she went to extreme lengths to get herself physically-fit for the role.<br /><br />Audio-wise, this is a one of the better DVDs you will ever hear, with excellent use of the surround speakers. Nice scenery, a sharp picture and low profanity also are pluses. Yes, the action is a little much and too loud in spots but otherwise "Tomb Raider" is a fun adventure that is recommended to all.<br /><br />p.s. Skip the sequel; it's a weak one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>As someone who has never played the game, I am looking at this strictly as Film entertainment...  YEEHAAA!!!<br />Let's not get carried away, this is not Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Not even close.  Here's the breakdown;<br />-It is to "Treasure seeking adventure" as Resident Evil is to "Zombie Horror".<br />-If you're looking for high art, this is not for you.<br />-If you want challenging plot that keeps you guessing... nope.<br />-If you enjoy lots of action held together by an extremely simple plot, you can't go wrong.<br />-For what it is (pure action movie) it is very well done and entertaining.<br />-I was never insulted by dialogue or story because I wasn't expecting to be challenged, just entertained.<br />-It's certainly better than one star.  That's just snobbish.<br />-It's not for everyone. Rent it first.<br /><br />This is one of those "put it in and let it go" kind of films.  Great after a stressful day.  Not a lot of thought required, but engaging entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>This is a movie that got universally bad reviews.  It helped knowing that going in because my expectations were very low.  Being a fan of Angelina Jolie, I was not disappointed in her performance.  Despite a thin plot and cheesy effects, Angelina delivered her lines with class and finesse.  Unfortunately even her talent cannot overide an overall lack of plot and unbelievable situations.  The film grew tiresome very quickly.<br /><br />On a Jungian level this film portrays a strange sterility.  The first scene is Lara upside down, in the middle of a training exercise set by her computer nerd flunkie and her all-purpose butler.  This opening segment defined the problem for the film--someone who is not grounded and unconscious.  Lara raids tombs and fights bad guys to no real purpose--except perhaps to pit her skills against someone else.  This cycle repeats endlessly, as do video games, which create a feeling of accomplishment where there is none, sterile endeavors with no learning and no personal or interpersonal gain.  The individual does not develop--just the skills.  Lara steals the ancient wealth of civilizations from tombs, co-opting heritage and treasure for the love of the game.  This disregard for cultural artifacts except as an exercise is indicative of lack of depth and insight.<br /><br />In one moment in the movie, there is a clear symbol of the futility of this lifestyle--Lara puts everything aside to retrieve a memento of her dead father.  But then she reverts to form.  In addition there is no mention of her mother--what happened to her and why is this not a loss? Obviously this is such a deficit it cannot be referred to except obliquely by one scene where an enormous statue of a woman is destroyed, and by the total lack of other women in the film.<br /><br />Overall a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>shes angelina. most beautiful star around. for that I give 5 stars. movie wasnt bad either. keep my attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>boy, oh, boy they really blew the hell outta this franchise and they shouldnt of made this movie at all.

Considering the plot of the film has its roots in a video game, the film does admirably well... but it does take itself a little seriously.<p>The orphaned child of a wealthy, world-famous archeologist, Lara Croft lives the life of Batman... a stately mansion/castle w/ intensely loyal servants and a cavalcade of one-of-a-kind gizmos and James-Bond-esque weapons and gadgets, not to mention a garage full of Jaguars, Porsches and BMW's.<p>Mysterious dreams and/or voices in her head draw Lara to a forgotten relic in a storage space under the stairs which turns out to be the key to a device that controls time and space. Naturally, super villains seek to get the relic and learn how to use it, turning Lara Croft into a buxom Indiana Jones on a globe-trotting adventure with booby-traps, exotic locales and animated stone statues.<p>Much of the story is totally perposterous, so you make yourself escape, acknowledging that this is totally a fantasy... then you have actors and scenes and dialogue that treat the film as though it were a documentary... much of the film is way over-acted, forced and downright cheesy.<p>Despite silly cliche scenes, Angelina Jolie pulls off the character as a feminine, sexy, butt-kicking machine. Sadly, the filmmakers felt obliged to show her in a white cotton dress at the end of the film to underscore her feminine side. It was trite and almost insulting... but then again, so was a great percentage of this movie.<p>The amount of cheese will ensure you will not be calcium deficient, but the action is entertaining and enjoyable. <p>The DVD makes the movie that much more enjoyable by packing in a lot of features, including deleted scenes and behind the scenes footage of the special effects highlights.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>Angelina Jolie excels as Lady Lara Croft, a wealthy English archaeologist, and modern-times female version of Indiana Jones/James Bond in this video game adaptation. Not only does she look fantastic swinging through the air on bungee cords, knocking out menacing villains clad in black but she totally looks and acts the part of the Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft, like she was born to play this role. She is stunningly attractive and looks every inch the action hero and what's more, her English accent is absolutely spot on. However, despite her valiant efforts this really is a soul-less film served up by Director Simon West (Con Air) that fails to live up to the excitement of the video games. The action scenes are merely a collection of set-pieces (often borrowed from other movies) that somehow fail to thrill and the plot (what plot?) is about as uninspiring as they come. <p>So what is the "plot"? Tragically, Lara's father, played by real-life dad Jon Voight, died when she was eight, leaving her to a lonely life of raiding tombs... As fate would have it, Lara becomes embroiled in a plot to recover the pieces of an ancient artefact (a small pyramid) that was split into pieces to protect mankind and hidden in unspecified tombs around the world, guarded by elaborate defences. When re-assembled the possessor of the pyramid can control time and space when the planets become aligned and so it is left to Lara to race against time to stop the bad guys and save the planet. <p>There is little or no character development in this movie. None of the main or supporting characters, apart from Lara Croft, are given any depth or explanation for their actions or motivation. Lara, we discover, still mourns the death of her father (Jon Voight, hamming it up with a truly awful accent) but even this sub-plot is pretty pointless. Meanwhile her fellow tomb raiders (Iain Glen plays a particularly loathsome villain) betray each other for no reason other than to serve the plot, and when ultimately Lara risks everything to save her former love (Daniel Craig) it's a bit hard to swallow, particularly when for the previous eighty minutes their has been no evidence of any previous affection or chemistry between the two of them and he spends most of the entire film being villainous with no apparent redeeming qualities. <p>Ultimately the movie has its moments but it's a bit of a mess. No story, a poor script, no character development and lacklustre direction. It has no soul or integrity and insults it's audience's intelligence by assuming that all we want to see is a beautiful big-breasted woman shooting up bad guys in a series of action set-pieces in exotic locations, without any plot or cohesion to hold the movie together. Angelina Jolie certainly can't be blamed for this movie's failure. She excels as the confident and sexy tomb raider and makes a very believable action hero. I just hope that they make a sequel, a much better sequel, with a story, direction and plot to do Angelina Jolie, the character and the games justice.<br /><br />5 STARS FOR ANGELINA, 4 stars for the DVD extras but only 2 stars for the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>I watch movies to be entertained for 2 hours or so.  This movie fulfilled that requirement.  Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a tomb raider extraordinaire.  She is the female version of Indiana Jones but with acrobatic skills, fighting skills, brains and looks.<br /><br />She is trying to steal a diamond from a chamber of an Egyptian tomb and she is attacked by a robot.  A fight and chase occurs and Lara defeats the robot and takes the treasure to find out it is a tape of her favorite music.  This action takes place in her home and it is her way of keeping her skills sharp for the real thing.  Unfortunately she doesn't suspect that the real adventure will be even more dangerous and deadly than the practice session could ever be....<br /><br />Angelina Jolie does a superb job in playing this role.  Her acting skills and athletic ability shine in this movie.  It is almost nonstop action and adventure all over the world with Lara being the focus of the movie.<br /><br />Yeah the movie is over the top and silly at times but the premise of the movie is a video game.

Difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character, against all the Draculas and Frankensteins who did the reverse trip. They had to bring some kind of English fabula into the picture, accent, tea and everything else, plus a touch of Cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of Siberian whitish russianism. And it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some Arabian astrology than anything from another constellation. But it does not really matter. Lara Croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent. And it works as much as we can hope, and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her English mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate. We recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely British Clive Barker, but that might have been an illusion.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Lara Croft Tomb Raider really is a movie that is doomed by the critics the day the making of it is announced. It's based off a video game where the heroine is mostly known because of her large (...).She is suppose to be a combination of Indiana Jones and James Bond which is also going to be hard to pull off. We know the stunts will be outrageous along with a lot of other things. If you look past all that you really can enjoy Tomb Raider.<p>Lara Croft Tomb Raider is a simple enough plot. Lara(Angelina Jolie)must find the Triangle of Time. It's a legendary artifact that is capable of altering time and space as we know it. She must find the artifact before the evil secret society of the Illuminati do. The society is led by Manfred Powell(Iain Glen)who is set on using the artifact for his own eveil purposes. It's now up to Lara to stop the Illuminati and Manfred before it is to late.<p>Angelina Jolie really is the reason to watch the film. She looks fantastic in the movie and it's probaly the best she has ever looked. She plays the video game heroine to perfection and nobody could have pulled it off quite like she did. She did all her own stunts in the film and even learned how to fire weapons and train for the part from a former SAS agent.<p>The only knock I have against the film is the traveling the movie. In a span of not even three days Lara goes from England to Cambodia back to England and then to someplace in North Western Russia. Thats a little far stretched even for a video game based character.<p>This really is a three star movie but the DVD extras bump it up to a four. There are deleted scenes and an altered main title sequence. You get the specials on how they crafted Angelina Jolie into Lara Croft. There is a special on the visual effects in the movie which are decent. You also get directors commentary from Simon West. To top all that off you get the Music Video for U2's song Elevation. Not bad at all.<p>Like I said earlier, if you look past the flaws this is a fun movie. It's a summer blockbuster thats suppose to be enjoyed. I like the movie and it's a decent buy if you can pick it up cheap.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I have to confess that I liked a number of moments in this film, despite the fact that it is without any question overall a pretty bad film. I could compile a long list of absurdies connected with it. For instance, while I know that part of the point of the movie is to promulgate the legend of Lara Croft, sex goddess, is there really any excuse for her wearing a thin duster that she never closes over a very tight-fitting shirt while sled dogging in Siberia? The overall list of silly moments in this film could be expanded far beyond the amount of space that isalloted any reviewer.  Most of the sexual tittilation seems more appropriately targeted at adolescents than grown ups, but, then, that is true of the Tomb Raider games as well.<p>So after these negative comments, why do I still find things to enjoy? Well, for one thing, some of the fight scenes are, if not believable, at least quite inventive and fun in their over-the-top silliness. For another, Angela Jolie is never short of absolutely marvelous to behold. Had the movie merely consisted of her strolling down a sidewalk, with those beautiful lips and other unquestionably enhanced features, the movie would have been salvaged from complete disaster. If the movie fails, it isn't her fault. Although the idea of bringing any character as supranaturally athletic as Lara Croft to screen is daunting, Angelina performs far better than could possible have been anticipated. If she struts and poses a bit more than one might like, she still managed to carry off the role with some aplomb. <p>In closing, I would like to ask, when will we see an end to movies based on computer games? So far, we have had to witness a long list of terrible movies based on otherwise decent computer games. I played Tomb Raider when it first came out, and a couple of its sequels, and I have to admit they were pretty good games. But with absolutely terrible movies based on Super Mario Brothers, Wing Commander, Mortal Kombat, and others, you have to wish for filmmakers to decide not to make any further cinematic adaptations. Actually, TOMB RAIDER is actually one of the better film versions of a game, and that ought in itself to stand as a warning to Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>Fans of video-game-movies look no further. "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" is the best of its kind. Loaded with nonstop action and thrilling fun, Angelina Jolie plays the very sexy Lara Croft, a british chick with an attitude. She uncovers the secret of an ancient legend hidden in a mysterious clock. Now it's a race against time as she must go against fellow archaeologists to find an all-powerful triangle. Great special effects, great direction from Simon West, and some high-flyin' explosive action mixed with the seductiveness of Jolie make this film an adventure-fans weapon of choice.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of 'heroine' action movies, and so I was glad to watch this one.  Angela Jolie, stars as the pouty-lipped, heroine "Lara Croft."<p>This is the story of Lara's discovery of a mysterious clock, hidden in the immense Croft mansion. The clock holds the key to a mystical device which is coveted by an evil cult (aren't they all?) Can Croft prevent the key from falling into the wrong hands?<p> Angela Jolie does her best to breath life into the buxom action heroine, but it was a difficult task. The movie (loosely based upon the videogame) has a meandering action plot, (which seemed to be designed to show Jolie's figure to its best advantage) and an immense special effects budget which might feed a small third world country.<p>While not utterly terrible, in a world of 'video-game' knockoff movies such as 'mortal Kombat' , I can't honestly say that Tomb Raider had much to recommend it unless you are missing your dose of eyecandy for the week. Good for a laugh, but nothing to take to seriously. Next...!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>There's something odd about a transition from a video game to a movie, and whereas it is often compared to comic book characters one would assume (after seeing this movie) it is much more difficult to carry off convincingly. Angeline Jolie is sultry, sexy and certainly focuses your attention, but the plot is thin, predictable and very silly in places. In trying to add suspense to a weak script the viewer is left with a comic depiction. The movie never intends to take itself seriuosly, and shouldn't considering that upon which it is based, but what starts out with such promise, ends in a contrived mess. One for a rainy day only</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>Basically my title says it all, this is mainly why the movie was so good. The sets were some of the best I've seen and her toys were even better than some of James Bonds gadgets. She in fact reminded me of a girl James Bond. Her accent is really very good too,, reminded me of Gwyneth Paltrows. The stunts were great and what is really great is that Angelina Jolie did them all without a body double. I really like her fearless energy and it comes across on film as it does in real life. The storyline was not really great and pretty one dimensional with no real subplots and romance was practically nil but what made it a winner was the richness of design and the beauty of Jolie. A worthwhile video to view. <p>Lisa Nary</p></br></body></html>

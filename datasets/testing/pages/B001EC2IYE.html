Clint Eastwood's movie revolves around three characters who are living life on the sidelines (two by choice, one by birth), and through the crucible of boxing and motivated by the iron will of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), they each learn to step back onto the field of play.<br /><br />A word of advice -- avoid any spoilers regarding plot twists, if at all possible!<br /><br />The movie's story, based on a short story by F.X. Toole, could have been the source of a cliched piece of tripe.  Frankie Dunn (Eastwood, never better) is a boxing trainer who runs one of those dead-end gyms that you drive by and wonder, when the heck are they going to knock that thing down?  Dunn has a world's worth of boxing knowledge in his head, but he's so afraid of overextending his boxers (based on a prior bad experience) that his top contenders leave him for people who will give them shots for world titles.  Poor, struggling, and estranged from his daughter, Dunn nevertheless seems comfortable with his hum-drum no-risk life.  His only enjoyment seems to come from tormenting his Catholic priest Father Horvak (Brian O'Bryne) with the "unanswerable" questions of Catholic dogma.<br /><br />Dunn's "partner" at the gym is his former boxer, Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman, who also narrates the film, and should narrate every film).  "Scraps" lives at the gym, cleaning up the place, helping out, and offering a cautionary tale through the obvious loss of vision in one eye.  Dunn and Scraps have worked out a friendship that is essentially based on mild banter and never challenging the other.<br /><br />That is changed with the arrival of Maggie, whose ambition is for Dunn to train her to champtionship form.  Dunn resists, claiming that he doesn't train "girls" (a word Dunn defensively uses with dripping sarcasm).  But Maggie, a self-proclaimed escapee from a lifetime of being trailer-trash, is one of those people who will not be denied.  Interestingly, most movies would have Dunn finally accept Maggie after seeing her shockingly k-o the top boxer in the gym.  But Dunn's reticence to train Maggie is based almost as much on his unwillingness to take a risk on her (and to risk a "girl's" health in the ring) rather than a real conviction that she's no good . . . and this is a barrier that Maggie's fierce determination will overcome.<br /><br />While this movie clearly revolves around boxing (and the boxing scenes all ring with authenticity, which is a testament to the actors), this movie isn't about boxing.  It's about three lost souls who each find something they need in each other.  Through Maggie's successes in the ring to the film's shattering conclusion, the movie wisely says very little and shows a heck of a lot.  I may have seen every movie Clint has ever made, and I'm not sure he's ever shown this much emotional depth before -- there are several moments where his lined, scarred face says more with a stare, or glance, or glare, than most actors could achieve with ten soliloquies.  Freeman is Freeman, which is high praise in and of itself.  Freeman and Eastwood have such astounding chemistry that one never questions their bonds, even though they never speak of such unmanly things.<br /><br />And then there's Ms. Swank as Maggie.  Yes, she won another Oscar for this movie, and yes, she deserved it.  She disappears into Maggie, who could have so easily been your typical "girl from the wrong side of the tracks." Instead, Maggie is given life, strength, and delicacy.  Not every young actress could go toe-to-toe with titans like Eastwood and Freeman and stand on her own, and yet Swank does so astoundingly well.  Also, for a truly gorgeous woman, Swank disappears into Maggie so well that after only a few minutes, you forget that you're looking at a beautiful movie star and only think that you're looking at little Maggie, who wants more than anything to be a boxer.<br /><br />A wonderful film, "Million Dollar Baby" deserves all the accolades it received.  The two-disc DVD set is fine, but I've watched the movie three times and still haven't made it to the extras -- the movie's just that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Amid shadows, the haunting silhouette of Hillary Swank dances around a boxing gym's heavy bag as she trains in the midnight hours. Behind her can be seen a poster whose message inspired her and this film's creators to achieve greatness. It reads, "Winners are simply willing to do what losers won't", a message easily applied both to struggling athletes and filmmakers who desire to meet and exceed their dreams.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" masquerades as a Rocky-meets-Thelma & Louise, a film about a female fighter overcoming the inherent adversity of trying to succeed in a man's sport inside a man's world. On many levels, the film aspires to address that issue, but to reduce it to that point is to fail to recognize the stunning insight it provides on the human heart. With almost limitless ambition, Eastwood tackles the mammoth subjects of lifelong regret, penance and the responsibilities tethered to love.<br /><br />Decorated with the soft tones of Eastwood's own score and narrated by the dulcet voice of Morgan Freeman, "Million Dollar Baby" recreates the warm, comfortable feeling of hearing your grandfather tell a story by the fireplace. With slow pacing and development, the film focuses on a determined fighter, Maggie, trying to convince Eastwood's Frankie to train and manage her. Motivation and toughness are not enough for Frankie who tells her "girlie tough is not enough."<br /><br />Undaunted by his initial rejection, she preservers and convinces Frankie to handle her career. Not since "Rudy" has a character been so determined to reach a goal. A rare return to traditional values, Maggie's story borrows from inspirational tales about people who were able to meet all their aspirations. Compared to her hillbilly family (welfare, illegitimate children, prison), Maggie appears to succeed in life because she sets goals, works hard and makes proper decisions. "Million Dollar Baby" does not perpetuate the popular myth found in most Hollywood features that success is handed out to lucky people and failure results from disadvantages. Eastwood's film suggests everyone creates their own place in the world through the cumulative results of their actions and decisions.<br /><br />Once she begins her career, a second story unfolds that I would rather refrain from mentioning. Like "Fight Club" or "The Crying Game", the film contains a surprise which potential viewers should try to avoid knowing. But even if the ending is known, "Million Dollar Baby" succeeds because it gives its audience real characters who will inspire and challenge with their depth and truth. Like his lead pugilist, Eastwood shows greatness results when he is willing to do what other filmmakers won't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>When "Million Dollar Baby" came out, I had little desire to see it. My wife, being the steadfast Clint Eastwood fan, pleaded for me to go with her. Girls boxing... I wondered (yawn). Okay, good reviews were hitting the newspapers at the time... so off we went. The movie starts out slowly. Establishing the characters is a must... and Eastwood knows his trade (this is his 25th directed and 57th acted). Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald - the skinny southern poor waitress with a dream and what turns out to be a wicked punch. Eastwood plays the gym owner and trainer, Frankie Dunn. Morgan Freeman plays Dunn's right hand man in the gym, Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, as well as narrator of the story. The story starts off with Maggie wandering into the gym, trying to work out, looking to be trained. Dunn tells her to get lost (repeatedly "I don't train girls", and that an over-the-hill woman shouldn't be starting a boxing career so late in her life). Persistance pays off for Maggie as Dunn is soon training her. The boxing sequences look real and are action-packed. Swank takes many a punch as does her stunt double. Boxer Lucia Rijker ("Blue Bear" in this film) was Swank's trainer during the process. "Million Dollar Baby" simply draws you in to the story from the start. The likable characters make you empathize for them every inch of the way. Most importantly, each of the three main character's performances are believeable. Wonderful highs and unexpected sad lows. One of my favorites in 2004. Worthy of 4 of the big time Oscars (Best Picture, Director/Eastwood, Best Actress/Swank, Best Support/Freeman). A 2-disc set; feature is 132 minutes; 5.1 Dolby digital sound; 3 better than average featurettes (1. Behind the scenes, 2. "Born to fight" with boxer Lucia Rijker, 3. James Lipton goes toe to toe with Eastwood/Swank/Freeman). If the movie "Boys Don't Cry" (1999) didn't make Hilary Swank a household name, in 2005 "Million Dollar Baby" surely will. This movie needs to be in your collection (5 stars).</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>With a cast like Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman, how could this movie go wrong? Well it couldn't, and it didn't. It was full of tour de force performances full of passion and physically demanding work, and every cast member was up to the task. The movie centers on a female boxer (Swank) and her relationship with her reluctant trainer (Eastwood). The film also, beautifully incorporates a story about Frankie (Eastwood) and long-time associate Eddie (Freeman), from whom many of Frankie's insecurities stem. The only problem with the film is that they try to incorporate a bit with Frankie having it out with his Priest, but the emotion seems a bit forced. However, this does nothing to hurt the picture. In the end, this is a story about family (blood and formed) and love, and each of these themes is presented perfectly, with a few good "punch-lines."</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an aged boxing manager and former cut-man.  Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is the "white trash" waitress who is desperate to better herself and persuades Dunn to take her on as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  They have both been pretty beaten up by life, but their new-found affiliation brings them fame, fortune, and, most importantly, a surrogate father-daughter relationship that is immensely healing to them both.  Little do they realize, the cruelest blow is yet to come.<br /><br />The story could be criticized as clich&eacute;, but that would be like criticizing the coat-hanger and ignoring the garment it displays.  This is not a plot-driven film.  Director Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis have given us fully developed characters and the cast, including the wonderful Morgan Freeman, have brought them powerfully to life.  The end of this film is just gut-wrenching.  I have never before seen such a genuinely effecting performance from Eastwood, who eschews his usual stoic, clenched jaw persona to deliver an Oscar-worthy performance.  Swank is amazing as well.  This is a great film./</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>This movie is based on one short story taken from a collection of boxing tales by (author:F.X O'Toole). In this particular story, a manager is trying to turn a woman into a top boxing contender.<br /><br />This could so easily have been a smarmy or unbelievable film but, thank goodness, Eastwood has the directing and acting chops to pull it off and Hillary Swank proves yet again that she is an excellent actress, as she portrays a young woman desperate to make something of herself and with few other options in life. Eastwood is her manager and, as you'd expect, he is rather hardened and gruff and not open to managing a woman boxer (at first). He doesn't believe women should be boxers, period..end of discussion...and how and why he changes his mind is believeable.<br /><br />As he does so well, Eastwood manages to stay away from sentimentality, letting his feelings (especially the softer ones) show only at critical moments in the film - and even then, he never overplays the moments, trusting viewers to get the point, respecting his audience.<br /><br />  Swank makes the most of her angular features and hard edges and is convincing as a poor girl who is desperate for a break, someone who has run out of options. She looks and acts hungry - for a break, for success, for some way out of her dead end life.<br /><br />The tone of the film is equally wonderful and the lighting and cinematography are crucial to setting the right mood. I really loved this film and recommend you make time for it as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Actor Martin Landau whom I usually respect, casually dismissed this film as just another boxing movie.  Boy, was he far off the track, for boxing is just the background for a drama about how one committed person can affect the other's lives.  Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman clearly deserved the Oscar for their roles and Eastwood turns in one of his most heartfelt performances--he was also nominated for an Oscar and the pic itself won Best Picture along with Best Director (Eastwood). I admired Clint's restraint of the material never forcing the material to feel syrupy or sentimental like a Spielberg or a Garry Marshal--he allows it to come out of the writing and the acting.  In the end, if you're not moved by this picture then you must be made of stone or from another planet.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Million Dollar Baby (2004)<br />Drama, Sport, 132 minutes<br />Directed by Clint Eastwood<br />Starring Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman<br /><br />Boxing isn't a sport that I find appealing. I did follow the career of Muhummad Ali as a child, but haven't paid much attention since he retired. It's a brutal way to earn a living. I do admire people for the dedication it involves, but it's no longer something that I want to watch.<br /><br />There have been several good boxing movies over the years, from Rocky and Raging Bull to Cinderella Man and The Fighter. Each of those movies attempted to show the character behind the gloves, and that's where my interest lies when I do watch a boxing movie. As a fan of Clint Eastwood, I was particularly interested to see whether he would bring a fresh perspective as he has done in films showing racism and war from unexpected viewpoints. He didn't disappoint me.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby depicts women's boxing and focuses on Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). She thinks of herself as trash, works as a waitress to pay the bills, and often resorts to eating leftovers from the diner. She shows up at Frankie Dunn's (Eastwood) gym and begs him to train her. He refuses, so Eddie Dupris (Freeman) shows her a few techniques. Frankie eventually agrees to train her after seeing how dedicated she is. Boxing is her only hope of escaping her miserable existence.<br /><br />Frankie has problems of his own and is trying to get in touch with his estranged daughter, so Maggie becomes an outlet for Frankie's fatherly affection in some ways. He soon sees what amazing character she has. She's not only determined to succeed, but is kind to her ungrateful family when she starts to earn decent money.<br /><br />Eastwood deviates from the normal formula by showing some of the grim reality of the sport. Not every aspiring fighter succeeds and Freeman's character has to live with the loss of an eye after being injured in his 109th fight. The film shows the dangers of boxing and how cutthroat the business can be. The thing which elevates it is the realism and the delicate way Frankie and Maggie deal with adversity. I cared about these characters.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby lifted four Oscars. Eastwood was Best Director, Swank Best Actress and Freeman Best Supporting Actor. The Best Picture award was fully deserved and the final 30 minutes is extremely sad and difficult to watch. That said, I included this in my 100 movies series for a reason. It's another superb project from Eastwood and will be remembered as one of his best creations.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>Million Dollar Baby is a film perspective of women's boxing that is reflective, which contains: success, heartbreak, and personal development. All the lead characters have their own misfortunes, which makes them individually inspiring. Clint Eastwood keeps the narrative lively with raw humour, whilst also exposing some of the inadequacies of human nature such as moral degradation. It is indeed the cold hearted selfishness on the part of some supporting characters, which makes the tragedies of this movie seem like worthy sacrifices. Subsequently, the taste of pride and personal attainment can clearly be missed in life, if not sometimes taken with the risk of great cost.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Eastwood, Swank and Freeman ( who finally got a much over-due Oscar ) are all magnificent in this fantastic film. There is not a false step in this masterpiece. It resonates with quiet power, and harsh beauty, and it packs an emotional impact that few films in any genre can compete with. ROCKY looks 'cute' next to this 'baby.' MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a classic, pure and simple.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is beautifully strong but immensely cruel. The strength of the film holds in one single fact: anyone can always win one battle provided they are trained properly and they are managed properly. That does not mean they will win the world title but they can always try and win one victory. How far will they go, no one knows, no one can tell. Luckily, otherwise there would be no meaning in trying. But the cruelty is all contained too in one fact: the end of such a fight for the top title is lost sooner or later if the contender does not learn how to cheat with life and the rules or to be aware the other one may cheat with life and the rules and this contender must be ready to resist these attempts. And that's just what the "boss" forgot to teach his fighter. And she was the victim of the viciousness of the champion who did something wrong for the third time causing severe damage and eventually death. If you just concentrate on these two elements this film is a masterpiece that deserves all the prizes it got. If you want to go slightly farther and sort out other elements like the heavy reference to God and religion, you will fall into something very trite, like the priest advising the "boss" not to meddle with the fallen fighter's desire to die because then he, the boss, would not be able to come to terms with himself. This answer is so narrow-minded, so egotistic in the name of God. I respect the divine command not because I respect or fear God, but because my disobeying this command may make me unhappy. On these sides issues and questions Clint Eastwood is definitely less clear. But the cruelty of this boxing against all people involved in the business is mastered in an admirable way. You win or you die and if you lose you have to die, at least die away into non-existing.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This movie was nominated for seven Oscar's awards.  And as is mentioned in another review, Oscars were won by Clint Eastwood for Direction, Morgan Freeman for best performance by a Supporting Actor, Hilary Swank for best performance by a leading actress and Best Picture. But this movie should be watched because it is very well made. And should help the Woman's Boxing Federation gain the respect they deserve.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn an overcautious boxing trainer who knows how to train champions. Morgan Freeman plays his friend Scrap who is an ex-boxer who lost use of his eye in his final fight. Of course Frankie Dunn blames himself for this injury and is one of the reasons we learn he is so cautious with his fighters. And of course Hilary Swank plays Maggie, a very hungry fighter who has been self-training for years and has won some fights. She wants Frankie to train her and of course he wants nothing to do with here. For some reason we never learn, Frankie daughter wants nothing to do with him and all the letters he writes to her are returned unopened.<br /><br />The movie builds from there with Maggie earning Frankie support with the helping hand of Scrape. And we watch as her training progresses and career starts. The training and fighting is very real. The acting is superb, as is the story. It is not your normal movie of today were you can figure out exactly what will happen. It takes some twist and turns along the way throwing you surprises as movies use too. I do not care much for boxing yet I still rate this as a must see movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A37B3O457INKEA.html">A37B3O457INKEA</a><br/><p>MILLION DOLLAR BABY is an excellent movie about women's professional boxing.Clint Eastwood plays the part of Frankie Dunn, an embittered veteran trainer and manager of male boxers.His friend and helper is an ex-boxer named Scrap,played by Morgan Freeman.Frankie carries a deep sense of guilt for allowing Scrap to fight too long and receive a severe injury as a result - even though Scrap assumes full responsibility for the injury.Still, Frankie can't seem to forgive himself.One day a young and hungry woman named Maggie walks into Frankie's gym expressing a burning desire to become a pro fighter.Reluctant at first,Frankie finally agrees to train her because of her persistance.Frankie is also estranged from his daughter and there is a strong hint that he sees some possible redemption in helping Maggie who is played by Hilary Swank.The rest of the plot centers on Maggie's blossoming career and her developing relationships with Scrap and especially Frankie.The ending is controversial and there are some politically incorrect moments which help to make the film more interesting and realistic.The cast also includes Jay Baruchel,Mike Colter,Brian F. O'Byrne and Riki Lindhome.<br /><br />Oscars were won by Clint Eastwood for Direction,Morgan Freeman for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role and Hilary Swank for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.In addition, Eastwood was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Very nice film and Clint Eastwood's best work.  Noteworthy performances by both Swank and Freeman earned them their most deserved Oscars; however, I'm not so sure about Best Picture.  I still think Ray should have been the winner on that.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the performances in this movie were  well done without being overdramatic.  I found the trailer trash relatives to be a bit too caricature, but the intimate "father-daughter" like moments between Swank and Eastwood were very touching without being overdone.<br /><br />Worthwhile movie and Eastwood's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood directs quiet films that stay with you:  "Mystic River", "Unforgiven," "Bridges of Madison County"....In the year that produced sleeper, "Cinderella Man" I'm not sure this movie will go down in the annals as the great it deserves to be.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" starring Hillary Swank as a female boxer hopeful from humble beginnings is no exception.  Clint Eastwood plays in a supporting role as her coach Frankie Dunn with Morgan Freeman acting as the narrator and gym manager, "Scrap Iron" Dupris.<br /><br />Maggie comes to Dunn's gym hoping he'll take her on as a manager. She's got some serious strikes against her:  she's a girl, while she's trained extensively she's not done it properly, and she's 32 years old.<br /><br />"Scrap Iron" (Freeman) takes the girl in and gives her some pointers despite Dunn's objections.  Maggie begins to learn and box right.  Her determination and guts impresses Eastwood enough to take her on as a student.<br /><br />The tale isn't just about what it takes to be a boxing champion, but how to make your dreams--any of them--come true.  This is a hard film to watch and one that will leave you crying in the end.  But, it's not one of those films that you'll forget anytime soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>First of all let me say that, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood, did a fantastic job in this movie! Personally,  I found the first half to be pretty boring.  The second half was much more interesting, but way too depressing!  Instead of an Oscar for best picture, it should've won an Oscar for most depressing.  It's definitely worth seeing once, but too depressing to want to watch over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>_MAJOR spoiler alert_<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Million Dollar Baby is a fine piece of filmmaking, but I can't help but feel like it's a little overrated. Aside from the great performances in the film and the gloomy overcast camera work that sets the tone to the film very well, I had a few problems with the script. I was enjoying the film at about 4 1/2 stars during the first two acts, but what happened in the final act made me drop it down to a 4 star rating. When Maggie goes down and is paralyzed from a dirty boxing fight, I couldn't help but feel that this was so very Oscar cliched. A story of a poor girl (designed to make you feel sorry for her) rises to the top and then tragedy strikes and all that is taken away from her and she dies in the end. The Oscars and critics took this formulaic drama setup hook, line, and sinker. With this in my mind, I had a hard time getting totally emotional at the end. Another part I had a problem with was with how Clint Eastwood's character just walsed in the hospital, assisted Maggie's suicide and then left like it was some normal thing. In real life, his ass would be sitting in prison for euthanasia.<br /><br />It sounds like I'm bashing this movie completely, but I really did like it. I just don't allow myself to be brainwashed into thinking this is the best movie of my life just because that's what the Oscars want me to think. It's awesomely acted by some very fine actors who bring a sense of complete realism to their characters, and it's excellently shot, but I feel Clint Eastwood has done better and there were better films that 2004 produced that were more deserving of the best picture award such as the biopics The Aviator or Ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood had already convinced me that he knew how to direct a movie. "Unforgiven" stands at the Pinnacle of Westerns and, good as it is, didn't surprise us that much. After all he must have learned a thing or two about making Westerns in all those earlier films. "Mystic River" was astonishingly good - and probably he learned something about police procedural movies from those Dirty Harry films. (Although Mystic River reaches levels of emotional complexity never attempted by the Harry movies.)<br /><br />In Million Dollar Baby Clint scores again. Everything about the film is set up to make you think this is a film about boxing, and as a boxing movie it's better than all the Rocky movies put together - even the one that won the Oscar. But in the final act "Baby" becomes another movie, and to say any more about the last 30 minutes of the film would be to say too much. (Although you wouldn't have to look hard to discover the controversy involved.)<br /><br />Eastwood directs himself and gives one of his best screen performances as Frankie Dunn, a lonely old man who runs a boxing gym and knows how to train fighters. But he's also afraid to put his fighters into a position where they could be hurt - perhaps going back decades to an incident where his friend Eddie "Scrap" Dupris fought one fight, or at least a couple of rounds, too many and lost an eye. Scrap is played by Morgan Freeman in one of those performances that you can't imagine anyone else in. You have to believe that he loves that gym and loves Frankie and loves the boxers who go there to train. His boxing career left him capable of not much more than sweeping the floors at the gym, but as in "Shawshank Redemption" Freeman's character serves as both an importance character, and as the story's narrator, filling us in on the heart and soul of the other characters.<br /><br />Hilary Swank earned her Academy Award as Maggie Fitzgerald, a poor white trash girl who left her dysfunctional trailer-park family behind in Missouri and headed out west to make her way. She has already discovered that she has a little ability, and she knows she has the heart. But she has not trained properly and she just knows that Frankie will be able to help her. But Frankie tells her gruffly a half-dozen different times that he doesn't train girls. Since she is persistent and keeps coming to the gym, he has to become increasingly cruel in his dismissals. The transition between the first and second acts of the film is a remarkable scene where Swank and Eastwood stand toe to toe. She is as determined as ever to become the best fighter she can - he is equally stubborn that women shouldn't even BE fighters. But she bares her soul to him - telling him about the welfare cheating family she left behind to come out west to make it, and Eastwood's Frankie gives in a little. He tells Maggie that he'll train her, but once she's ready to actually fight she'll have to find her own manager.<br /><br />The movie is full of realistic and wonderful touches as we see little morality plays involving unscrupulous managers, cheating fighters, boxers with plenty of skill and no heart and the opposite. Some of the most delicious moments involve Eastwood and Freeman about the most mundane things. I'd be glad to watch the whole movie again just for the conversation they have about Freeman's socks.<br /><br />It's wonderful.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>mr. eastwood has proven, yet again, what a master craftsman he is. from a great actor, to a great director, as well as a great jazz composer, this dude is a genius who deserves every award they can bestow on him this year! the aviator pales next to this marvelous film, truly.

While he picked out something for himself, I made a bee-line for a movie I'd wanted to see since its' release.  Some things improve with age and Clint Eastwood definitely fits into that category.  I don't think he's acted in or directed anything that hasn't been very good or great since he quit being Dirty Harry.  After all the hype I had heard for roughly a year, I was afraid I'd be in for a let down.  To my pleasant surprize, "Million Dollar Baby" was better than I thought it would be (and I was expecting something pretty darn good).<br /><br />There are things that make good movies great and "Million Dollar Baby" has most of them.  The acting is superb with special recognition to the top three in the cast; Eastwood, Hillary Swank, and the ever-reliable Morgan Freeman.  The story is very good as well.  I admit that I had my doubts about women's professional boxing.  However, it was very easy to buy into the script.  In fact, I don't think that the story would have worked nearly as well with a male boxer instead.  However, the greatest aspect of this movie is the directing.  There are so many short takes and side stories that weave into such a completeness.<br /><br />The story itself is rather simple and, to a point, rather predictable.  An aging boxing trainer/manager (played by Eastwood) is asked to train a female boxing wannabe (played by Hillary Swank) who's already a bit old to be entering the profession.  Obviously he turns the woman down and, just as obviously, the movie doesn't end with that refusal.  Those short takes and side stories tell us why the manager, Frankie Dunn, eventually takes her on.  Naturally, with his training, her career takes off.  I'll let up on the plot at that point.  You probably know the rest but let's not take chances.  I had heard just enough to have a general idea of what happened next.  Even so, when the first big moment came, it hit me like a brick even though I knew it was coming.  The eventual climax was also something I knew was coming.  I admit that I had an issue with that.  My wife, who is a quadraplegic, came in around this point in the movie and watched the rest of it with me.  We both realized that there were some very wrong choices being made.  I was prepared to dwell on that but I realized that I could let go of that and focus on the bigger picture.  You see, the movie isn't about her; it's about him.<br /><br />For all of the drama and excitement of boxing and the odd relationships it fosters, "Million Dollar Baby" comes down to a story about love and the sacrifice one man is willing to make for someone he cares for.  For those of us concerned about the moral issue raised by this movie it is important to consider the real dilemna of Frankie Dunn.  All of those rather odd (and somewhat humorous) scenes of his visits with his priest lets us know that this is a man who is devoted to his Catholic faith.  He may not always grasp the particulars but he has been quietly living his faith all these years and now it is truly put to the test.  In granting his friend's wish, Dunn forfeits everything he holds dear.  To put it theologically; Dunn betrays the greatest commandment in favor of the second greatest commandment.  Let's face it; most of us are at least a commandment or two below that.  In making a movie that delivers so powerful a message, Clint Eastwood has created a masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>This movie succeeds where other award winners fail.....it works for every moment of viewing pleasure. For once a movie emerges that is well written, well filmed and well acted with a little controversy thrown in like a punch for good measure.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) emerges from a trailer park in the middle of nowhere. She reeks of white trash but manages to perfume herself with an undying dream. Maggie wears her heart on her sleeve and exists on the edge of survival pushing towards something better. She pursues the sport of women's boxing with relentless fervor befriending gym-owner Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Together the misfits persuade Eddie's partner, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), to train Maggie professionally. Beneath all the punches there exists vulnerable lives and failing egos but through teamwork and Maggie's brawn the boxing ring encircles them with life lessons.<br /><br />Oscar winner Hilary Swank is incredible in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald. Swank takes the punches and leaves behind the glamour of less gritty roles with her choices paying off immensely. She is entirely believable as the down on her luck loner trying to overcome the stigma of a worthless family. She is America, rough and rugged but filled with a blind passion to succeed despite all the critics who loom at large beneath her dreams. Clint Eastwood captures the power of simplicity in both his acting and directing on this film. Each scene is as unglamorous as most mundane lives unfolding quietly to reveal the true essence of living, that daily grind that most of us forget to appreciate. But it's the grind that reveals our true character and without Eastwood's brilliant low-key style this film would have never emerged as a million dollar gem. As Frankie Dunn, Eastwood is subdued on the surface yet boiling underneath only overflowing with emotions as necessary. And of course the ever fabulous Morgan Freeman excels in his role as a half-blind ex-boxer content to mop floors and wipe bloody noses for his remaining days. His narration guides us forward and offers comfort to this hopeful and sometimes tragic story of real life struggles.<br /><br />This film is simply beautiful. It will make your heart soar for the grittiness of an underdog while identifying with a questioning soul. It is about hard work, perseverance and latching onto a passionate dream that guides you forward relentlessly. But it's also about hard choices and devotion that will leave viewers questioning right and wrong when faced with the desires of someone you love. This film sucker punches you in the end and leaves you breathless for days. But ultimately it takes you inside the ring of a family of misfits and makes you feel like a true champion with your own dreams.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Yep, it's about an "old-time" boxing trainer who runs a gym and helps out boxers who are up and coming, but looses them when they go for the big time.  He finds himself training, with great reluctance, an aspiring female boxer.  Their relationship goes from rocky to deep and loving (not as lovers, but as father/daughter.)<br /><br />I've seen a few reviews here and elsewhere that say the movie is just full of cliches.  Pardon me, but can a movie be made about sports that isn't?  If it's about winning or losing in any fashion, it's a cliche.<br /><br />What is great about MILLION DOLLAR BABY is that while it doesn have some "cliches" (the boxer actually manages to earn her way to a title fight...the grizzled trainer warms up) this is a movie that skirts the cliches with details that are true and cut to the bone.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood is often praised for telling stories without a lot of fluff.  He's well known for filming fast.  But what this seems to do for him as a filmmaker is to allow him to capture something that feels true and spontaneous and then he moves on...he doesn't try to work it...to make it "truer" or "more spontaneous."  He knows that no moment ever brings perfect clarity.  That every time a person learns a hard lesson about life, it isn't just a time of growing...it's a time of reluctantly giving up on something you've clung to for a long time.  With growth, with love, with respect and with hope also comes the knowledge that you are opening up to loss, rejection, tragedy and despair.<br /><br />MILLION DOLLAR BABY's charactes are far to specifically realized to be relegated to "cliche" status.  Eastwood plays the trainer.  He's a hard, grizzled man, gravelly voiced, slow moving and simmering...in many ways a typical Eastwood hero.  But we see all too soon that beneath his surface is actually a very decent fellow, capable of love and regret, capable of strong feeling (and also a good, instinctive trainer) who has simply closed himself up because of past events.  It's as though his very movements have been constricted by regret.  It is Eastwood's best performance ever, hands down.  It's Clint, I know it is...but never has he come close to this.<br /><br />Hillary Swank is the boxer.  Her character is too old to start boxing, but it's a dream she's had all her life and she's sacrificing almost everything to give it a shot.  She also instinctively senses the Eastwood can also be the "father" that she loved and lost years ago...the only other person who supported her dreams.  She's one tough cookie, but she's naive.  We believe she is totally brave, and we know we wouldn't want to get in a fist fight with her, but she is also very vulnerable.  She's easy to love, and she WANTS love.  More than she wants to box, she wants to fit in somewhere.  She isn't looking for a husband or child...she needs the uncomplicated, unquestioning love of a parent.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays Eastwood's oldest friend, a former boxer who lost an eye in a fight (and Eastwood blames  himself) and has worked as a "sidekick" to Eastwood ever since, these days as a sort of manager/janitor at the gym (where he lives).  We know he has a gambling problem, but he's also the guy who perhaps is the wisest of all.  He's our narrator, and to some extent, he's really a dramatic device.  But Eastwood's character is revealed best (especially early on) in his relationship with Freeman.  And as far as I'm concerned, any film rich in the voice of Morgan Freeman is okay by me!<br /><br />Some have heard that the movie takes an unexpected twist as it nears its final 45 minutes or so.  Well, I can't deny that it goes places we hoped in our  heart (at least the heart that enjoys "sports movie cliches") it wouldn't go.  But it DOES go where the story needs to take us.  The movie leaves you wrung out in the end...but oddly uplifted too.  We see some strong, clear, brave HUMANITY in these very flawed characters.  They make tough decisions.  But their love for each other is so strong, that we can't help but be happy for them that they experienced such love.<br /><br />The movie deserves all its accolades.  It's long and moves at its own leisurely pace, but not one single time did I look at my watch.  It's absurdly well acted.  Swank, Eastwood and Freeman all deserved their Oscar nominations.  It's beautifully photographed as well...just marvel at the shadows and colors in the gym.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's PG-13, by the way.  There's one "f" word early on, and a couple of fairly brief, but coarse references to the female body.  Other than that, there isn't anything overtly objectionable.  I say it's okay for ages 13 and over.  SEE IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: A man and a woman who are alone in this world find each other in Clint Eastwood's Best Picture winner, Million Dollar Baby. Frankie (Eastwood) is an aging trainer who is afriad of moving on to the future and dwells on his past, which is really never told to the audience in the film.  All we know is that he and his daughter are not getting along, and each week he sends a letter only to have it returned to sender unopened.  Maggie (Swank) is the opposite, a young woman who also has a bad relationship with her family, but instead wants to move on from her past instead of trying to mend broken wounds.  She is poor, lives in a one room place, and is a waitress who pockets the leftovers for herself.  After Frankie's boxer moves onto another manager due to the fact that he felt that Frankie was holding him from a championship, Frankie feels lost.  His only friend is an aging boxer, Eddie (Freeman), who lost one eye because his manager left him and couldn't "protect" him.  Frankie feels that the number one rule in boxing is to "protect yourself", and Eddie feels that Frankie can't always protect his boxers from everything because he's protecting himself from a championship. While reluctant to train Maggie at first, he ends up taking her under her wing and she slowly becomes one heck of a fighter.  The relationship of these two build and build, and the audience really sees how they fit each other perfectly.  Maggie's father is dead, and her mother lives in a trailer ignoring her, Frankie has no family it seems (but the audience never  really knows) and her daughter never answers his letters.  The film is told through partial narrations from Morgan Freeman's character, who is really the only person who knows Frankie.  He lives in the gym that Frankie owns, and serves as the janitor.  The theme of boxing is used as a symbol for the punches that life throws at you, and that is why it is important to always "protect yourself".  This is not a boxing movie, but a film about the troubles of life that all of us can relate to.  The ending is very beautiful, very sad, very moving.  I am a huge film fanatic and usually see Oscar contenders before the ceremony, but I missed this one, in fact it was the only one I missed.  Now I wish I saw it before because it would have had my vote. The film is beautiful, just beautiful, probably the most moving film in the last 10 years. I don't remember a film where I was as touched as I was from Million Dollar Baby. Even when I watch the trailer now I get tears in my eyes.  If you haven't seen the film, I cannot stress enough the journey you are missing.<br /><br />ACTING: Hilary Swank deserves the Oscar, and so does Morgan Freeman. I thought DiCaprio gave the best performance of the year before I saw Clint Eastwood here, and he was definately more deserving than Jamie Foxx or DiCaprio.  The chemistry is perfect between all three of them. The sweetness of the relationship betwen Frankie and Maggie are so real and it never feels forced or unreal.  While Swank's character is 32 in the film, you'd swear she was a little girl, and that is what really sparks the father/daughter relationship the two share through these times in their lives even though they're not related.  Morgan Freeman, while a washed up boxer, is the wisest of the characters, always providing insight in every situation that is befitting.  The acting is top notch, and Clint Eastwood is magnificent.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Eastwood's production company is called Mal Paso, which translates from Italian as Bad Choice. This is a tribute to Sergio Leone because everyone in his life back then told him that doing those Spahgetti Westerns was a bad choice, and would ruin his career.  Well, I guess they weren't such a mal paso after all. Eastwood is more accomplished as a director than he is an actor, while he was America's (and Italy's) tough guy, here he shows his emotional side and his brilliant perspective on  drama, which is equivelent to life. Isn't It? I mean drama in films and books are meant to tell a story based on one's view on life, so drama is life.  Clint Eastwood sees this, and that's why his films touch close with everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>For me, MILLION DOLLAR BABY actually surpassed all if its acclaim, with its strong, stirring acting, compelling story and beautiful character development.  This earned well earned Oscars (among others, Best Actress for the wonderful Hilary Swank and Best Picture), and is definitely a film that director Clint Eastwood has a lot to be proud of.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a dirt poor, Missouri-born waitress who lives such an impoverished life that her meals consist of leftovers from customer's plates after closing time.  She is drawn to boxing because she has spent her life just fighting to subsist in day-to-day life and really has nothing much to live for at all.  Maggie encounters Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), an excellent boxing trainer, during one of his matches.  The grizzled, seventy-four year old trainer just retorts, "I don't train girls" in response to Maggie's enthusiasm.  Frankie is a man who has been estranged from his own daughter for some years, writes her letters that are all returned, and attends daily mass.  Why, we aren't sure.  Whatever it is he is repenting for, it has eaten a hole in his heart.  Nevertheless, Maggie persists, turns up at the gym, and steadfastly proceeds to tirelessly beat the punching bag until he can't ignore her anymore.  She also makes an impression on Frankie's best friend, Eddie "Scrap Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), his steadfast friend who lost an eye in a boxing match some years ago.<br /><br />This film truly transcends gender, subject matter and generations to emerge as a great friend about the triumph of the human spirit, and also the fragility of life.  Hilary Swank will permeate your soul, make you smile, and then proceed to break your heart in, this, one of her most sizzling screen performances yet.  Clint Eastwood's transformation as the wounded Frankie is touching to watch, and Morgan Freeman is wonderful as always (and received a much-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar).</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>If this movie does not move you emotionally in some way then its official ... you are a dry piece of rock.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Deserving of all the accolades it has received, Million Dollar Baby stands out and rises above many films made in the last five years. What makes this film so good? I believe it is the perfect combination of a superb script by Paul Haggis, the vision and skill of the director, Clint Eastwood, and the stellar performances from the entire cast, particularly Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman. One other ingredient that turns this picture from a great one to a masterpiece, is its honesty, a pure truthfulness in the narrative, a real tragedy that long after the last credit rolls, the images and themes remain lodged in your memory.<br /><br />Hillary Swanks performance is really beyond any criticism. Her portrayal of Fitzgerald, the humble girl from hillbilly country, persisting to attain her dream as a prize-winning boxer, is inspiring; because of her utter lack of ego and pretension. Without giving anything away, her performance at the end of the film was extremely realistic and incredibly moving on many levels. In the end, the character of Fitzgerald is that type of woman you'd like to meet and know - a good person.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman has to be one of the best narrator's in the history of the cinema. One of his most memorable voice-overs was in one of my favourite films, The Shaw shank Redemption. In Million Dollar Baby, his narration carries the film and possesses that same resonance as Redemption. Freeman's character, again, was totally without pretence, a kind man and a friend we'd all like to have in our lives.<br /><br />Eastwood's transformation from the hard-hearted boxing trainer to a sensitive man is a subtle one but ultimately believable. The character's daughter has disowned him, as he continues for years to write her letters to only get them back as Return to Sender. This rejected love from his real daughter transfers to Fitzgerald as she remarks at the end of the film how he reminds her of her real father. They have a relationship that develops profoundly by the film's end.<br /><br />In fact all the performances have this aspect in common, an unpretentious realism, understated and subtle.<br /><br />Most of Eastwood's films including Mystic River, The Unforgiven and even Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, have that feeling of quality about them, something old Hollywood, something very credible and satisfying. As a cinematic storyteller, Eastwood is one of our best.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece and defies any real criticisms: a work of pure art.<br /><br />An easy five star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>Boxing movies are really a genre to themselves, kind of like cowboy Westerns in fact---recurring characters, plot development and themes pop up very predictably.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is no different, you'll recognize a lot of similarities (or CLICHES, to use a less flattering term) with other boxing movies, except for two things: its main character is a FEMALE boxer, and its last 20 minutes pretty much takes us on a whole other tangent.  Eastwood skillfully employs all of these well-worn familiarities to draw in as wide an audience as possible, then springs the REAL subject of his movie on us about 2/3rds of the way through.<br /><br />The only irritating thing I found in this movie was how much it stretched the viewer's credulity with the evil villain boxer (played by real-life women's kickboxing champ Lucia Ryjker) getting away with all sorts of flagrant and dirty tricks in the ring...unnecessary and obtrusive.  The fight scenes are not very realistic but still way better than most Hollywood boxing movies, particularly the ludicrous "Rocky" series.  In fact about the only boxing film that can be put on the same level as this one is Scorsese's "Raging Bull."<br /><br />NOTE: those who have not seen this film are advised to stop reading *now.*<br /><br />This film is really not about the glories of fighting in and out of the ring, but also about knowing when to LET GO of fighting, to walk away and just let a dying horse die in peace...in this case through euthanasia.  Eastwood seems to be implying that while fighting is what gets us through life very often, if we do enough of it, at some point there comes a time to simply let go of it and move on: the fighting spirit transforms into the peaceful, accepting and compassionate spirit, at last totally emptied of, and freed from, itself.  Which is pretty much what Eastwood and Swank's characters undergo.  In fact Maggie can be read as basically a representation of Eastwood's real soul, when he extinguishes her he is also extinguishing his own dead-end life that was defined by the boxing gym and his futile attempts to communicate with his estranged daughter.<br /><br />This is an Eastwood film that truly deserves its Oscars, it shows a director at the august peak of his powers.  Hillary Swank most definitely deserved hers, this is her best work since "Boys Don't Cry."</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Every year a motion picture masterpiece comes along that makes us laugh, cry, and never forget what we have just experienced. Million Dollar Baby is the movie for 2004. I never in a million years would have thought I'd feel this way about a boxing film, but boxing seems to be a subplot for the beautiful character studies that make up the majority of the film.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has outdone himself as actor/director. He won the Oscar for his directing, but is equally fine playing Frankie, a trainer who runs a seedy gym in Los Angeles and reads poetry on the side. Hilary Swank is absolutely phenomenal in her second Oscar winning role as Maggie, a lost soul who has been waitressing since she was 13 and sees boxing as the one way she can escape waitressing for the rest of her life. Morgan Freemon is terrific in another Oscar winning role as Scrap, our narrator, who was managed by Frankie into a title bout. Now he lives in a room at the gym and is Frankie's partner in conversations that have coiled down through the decades. When Frankie refuses to train a "girly," it's Scrap who convinces him to give Maggie a chance: "She grew up knowing one thing. She was trash."<br /><br />Paul Haggis deservedly won an Oscar nomination for adapting the screenplay from the book, Rope Burns: Stories From the Corner, a by Jerry Boyd, a 70-year-old fight manager who wrote it as "F.X. Toole." I haven't read the book, but after experiencing this terrific movie, I'd wanna give it a shot. This deserved every Oscar it won, and possibly more. It is one of the most unforgettable movies of the year, in a year that barely managed to pick 5 Best Picture nominees. While the other nominee's were good, Million Dollar Baby is possibly the only film that actually deserved to get the Best Picture Nomination. Lucky for us, it won.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'Million Dollar Baby' is a simple story of a woman boxer rising up through the ranks in the sleazy boxing world.

And yes, I do believed that its definitely superior to Mystic River. The script is beautifully written, a character study about boxers and Eastwood's direction moves the film along at a crisp and well grounded pace.<br /><br />Hilary Swanks plays a female who wanted to be a boxer. Eastwood plays the trainer who ended up pushing her to the championship title bout. There are excellent chemistry between the two actors and thanks to a great script, there are great deal of believability in their dialogue. While boxing is the theme, this movie is about these two characters, each with their own pains, their own dreams and when combined, they created a bond between them that transcends the boxing world.<br /><br />I thought Clint Eastwood performed fantastically in this movie but I believes that he will be overlooked because his character in this movie looks much like most of his characters in other movies: loner, estranged family members, guff and history of many regrets. For Hilary Swank, this movie should put her up again in the "A" class of actresses. Let hope that she will learn to pick better projects in the future. Morgan Freeman does his usual great job but I felt he was bit under used. His narration was fine but his presence was needed more.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic job by Clint Eastwood, a moving character study film that should be seen by all. (This movie is nothing like "Rocky".)</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We've seen many different kinds of fi;m from Clint Eastwood over the years, but this one is unique.  Halfway through the movie an event occurs which causes the audience to sit up and groan with shock.  After this event, the movie becomes a very different kind of viewing experience, a film almost European in its insistence on philosophical type questions about what is the meaning of life, and how does the quality of life differ from its quantity?  Eastwood himself shows off more sides to his character than ever before.  His talks with his parish priest will leave you in stitches, because he's so ornery.  And yet he will bring you to tears later on in the movie by confiding in the same priest a great dilemma he has to resolve for himself.  Eastwood has aged like a old stone figure from Easter Island, and there are grooves running vertically right down each of his eyes that seem made to channel tears.  Morgan Freeman also does excellent work in this.  If you are tired of Freeman "being Morgan Freeman" in each of his recent movies, rest assured, this is a part with some real meat on it and shows you what a talented actor he really is.  Dramaturgically, the weight of the whole movie rests on his performance and his ability to react to the chemistry and plotline between Eastwood's and Swank's characters, and he pulls this off marvelously.<br /><br />I didn't want to see this movie because I didn't want to see Hilary Swank butching it up again.  Is that awfui of me to say?  But indeed I shouldn't have been so gloomy about her.  She is great in this movie, from beginning to end, she gives it an oddly life-affirming glow.  Her soul shines through even under the most adverse of conditions (I dare say no more for fear of spoiling the movie for you) and she looks beautiful.  She plays a boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald, on whom Eastwood bestows the ringside monicker "Macushla."  Throughout the film she keeps asking him, what does Macushla mean?  I found it odd that the curious, alert Maggie would never have researched the answer herself, but when she finds out what it means, you will be bawling your head off and leaving the theater in a mist of tears.  Go to see it yourself and you will be grateful that in our modern age, one man has the courage to go back and try to re-tell the world's oldest story and this time, he gets it right.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Hillary Swank (Margaret Fitzgerald), who proved her athleticism in her first major role, The Next Karate Kid, demonstrated it again, pummeling a heavy bag with a power left on which I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end. She's very convincing in this movie - both as a young woman from humble beginnings who wants to make a better life for herself, and as a boxer. In Million Dollar Baby, she returns to the visceral emotional range that left us so deeply moved in Boy's Don't Cry.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood (Frankie Dunn), who has proved himself repeatedly, has perhaps turned in the best performance of his career. At times irascible, intellectual, mournful, instructive, reflective, passionate - in every manifestation, he reaches you. He was brilliant.<br /><br />And Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman. As the narrator of the story, and an actor within it, he lends a soft-spoken touch that ameliorates some of the film's darker elements. He also lent the film a certain amount of boxing sagacity, as he spoke in non-technical and sometimes quasi-technical terms of the basics of boxing.<br /><br />This film ain't no Rocky. It has an intelligence and compassion that Rocky (and virtually every boxing film ever made, save perhaps Raging Bull) couldn't think to have. Beyond that, it actually has better fight sequences. More often than in most boxing films - certainly the very poor choreography of the Rocky fight sequences - the punches looked and felt real, or as real as "fake" can make them.<br /><br />Margaret introduces herself to Frankie after a fight and asks him to train her. He turns her down flat, saying that he doesn't train girls. Given her pluckiness, she appears at his gym the next day, punching a heavy bag with all of the skill, style and fluidity of Pinocchio. Finally he agrees to train her ("finally" takes a while, and watching it come to fruition, the subtle changes in Eastwood's character, is a real treat to watch), and soon she is ready for her first fight.<br /><br />Here's the only similarity to Rocky: she turns out to be a natural, with a wicked left hook and overhand right (at least that I could see) and is knocking out all of her opponents in the first round. Some might think that this is, perhaps, a bit much. However, in the sport of women's boxing, such a thing isn't uncommon. PLEASE don't think that I'm saying women are not good boxers or don't have the same abilities that men do. It's simply that the increasing popularity of the sport hasn't quite yet led to the kind of talent that exists in men's boxing (although, frankly, talent on that side isn't exactly at it's apex). Her superiority over lesser opponents isn't unheard of.<br /><br />There's so much more I want to say about this film, because from this point forward it moved from being one of the best films of the year - purely on the strength of the writing, and the performances of Swank and Eastwood in particular - to one of the best films I've seen in several years. I'm so grateful that reviewers didn't give away the ending. I'll just say that the ending is layered with surprises, and that it's been a very, very long time that I haven't seen a single cell phone being used (how annoying is that, even with all of the polite requests and warnings?), and also seen so many in the theater remain in their seats long after the movie ended.<br /><br />It's a brilliant, brilliant film, the kind that makes me want to go back and change the number of stars I've given most movies that I've reviewed, simply so that this 5 star review means more. I recently gave Sideways, Closer, and Finding Neverland 5 stars, and while they are all very, very worthy films - I'd like to give this one six.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is "the best cut man in the business' intones the narrator, Morgan Freeman in "Million Dollar Baby."

But the letters come back marked "Return to Sender" and Frankie files them away in a box and his life returns to the needs and wants of his Gym for Boxers and to his best friend, confidant and former fighter, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman).<br /><br />And then Maggie Fitzgerald walks into Frankie's Gym, pays her Gym dues for six months and asks Frankie every day to train her. And everyday he turns her down: "you're too old, too skinny...and you're a girl," he says.<br /><br />Until one day she wears him down, he concedes to her wishes and there begins a Cinderella story of fights won, money earned and glory attained. And then it's all taken away.<br /><br />Eastwood has made some great, even unforgettable films: "The Unforgiven, "Bird" to name a couple. But he has done nothing to match the guts, emotional power and poignancy of "Million Dollar Baby." And Hillary Swank, pretty much floundering after "Boys Don't Cry," is as sunny, thoughtful and real as she's ever been.<br /><br />There is a scene towards the end of "MDB" between Frankie and Maggie in which Frankie explains the meaning of a Gaelic nickname that he has given Maggie that grabs at your heart and is so beautifully realized that you are galvanized with emotion. It's so real and so true to the tone of the film that you can't help but gasp.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is Eastwood at his most emotionally aware and naked. This film comes from the deepest areas of Eastwood's heart and soul. It is a brave and honest film from one of the best purveyors of our Hopes and Dreams.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>Waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) wants to be a boxer. Problem is she has no experience and she's too old. At 31, most professional boxers have been and done the best of their careers. Maggie doesn't care. All she wants to do is box.<br /><br />Trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) goes to church every day, reads books to expand his mind and writes his estranged daughter once a week hoping she'll write back. Frankie has never trained a woman before and has no desire to start now.<br /><br />Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman) is a retired boxer who has a room in the back of Frankie's gym. He cleans up after the boxers and provides moral support and direction to Frankie who stood by him during his last fight when his manager was off having a good time somewhere else. He thinks Frankie should train Maggie and he loves Maggie's tenacity.<br /><br />Maggie pretty much camps out on Frankie's door step (gym) until he agrees to train her. Their relationship immediately extends beyond that of trainer and trainee to daughter and father figure. These three make up an unlikely but solid family unit.<br /><br />MDB was nothing like what I was expecting. I expected a female Rocky and ended up with an intense emotional drama with the usual specs of humour Eastwood provides. The uplifting quality of watching someone train to be the best they can be is present but not the main focus. Family, love, loss, determination, friendship, loyalty, betrayal are all prominent themes. MDB was wonderfully shot and acted. They deserved the 7 academy nominations and 4 wins they received. This movie is definitely worth adding to your Eastwood/Swank/Freeman collection. Bring tissues.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It has been quite a few years since Clint Eastwood was reamed by critics for starring and sometimes directing ultra-violent vigilante action thrillers. What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his filmmaking techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in his latest film, which despite marketing that would lead you to believe it's the distaff version of "Rocky", is actually a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary. Once you see it, you will have no doubt why it is scooping up so many awards. In fact, the only thing wrong with the movie is the title, which seems almost too comically ironic for such an enriching film.<br /><br />The basic story is simple, almost corny really. A spunky female fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, Maggie Fitzgerald, wants a grizzled old trainer, Frankie Dunn, to guide her to become a professional boxer. Of course, the trainer owns a third-rate gym with an array of male fighters encompassing all the stereotypes. He also has an aged assistant, Scrap, who is of course, willing to champion Maggie's potential more than Frankie, at least at the beginning. Eastwood, however, belies the predictability and takes his story to a far deeper and more nuanced level than one would presume from this set-up. It turns out that Maggie is pushing 32 and considered over-the-hill for getting into the game. Frankie is estranged from his daughter, reads Yeats, studies Gaelic and goes to Mass every day mostly to annoy the young priest. Scrap was a contender trained by Frankie but lost an eye and his boxing future when a match went awry. How these three characters interact with each other supplies the film's main pleasure, not really the obligatory boxing scenes that will assuredly make one wince by their realism. In fact, one of the more painful scenes in the movie is not in the boxing ring but in a new house that Maggie buys for her ungrateful mother, when Maggie comes to the revelation that she has no one but Frankie to provide emotional support in her life. This is not to say the film lacks humor, as Eastwood infuses a clever sensibility that subtly draws you into these characters' lives without hesitation. The story follows Maggie's ascension in the boxing world, and what happens beyond that development is devastating. While it is enough to say there is tragedy involved, leave it to Eastwood, in his straightforward, confident directorial approach, to make the last part of the story surprisingly life-affirming and not at all exploitative. Only a filmmaking master could pull off such a feat in such an honest and emotionally affecting manner.<br /><br />As an actor, Eastwood continues to impress primarily by his innate connection to Frankie. Probably not since his surprisingly open-hearted turn in "The Bridges of Madison County" has he made himself so vulnerable onscreen, granted this time under the veneer of his hard-earned, leather-faced machismo. His sense of authority is never in question here, and he shows it off with great relish, especially as his character realizes how much more complicated life becomes as he grows older. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap with his customary humanistic skill. In fact, he provides the narration as a voiceover letter to Frankie's daughter in a manner that will remind you of his similar turn in "The Shawshank Redemption". That's not to say his performance is unsurprising, as he and Eastwood have an easy rapport that plays to both actors' strengths. But the standout is Hilary Swank, who has languished somewhat since her stunning work in "Boys Don't Cry" five years ago. She portrays Maggie with an emotional directness and piercing vulnerability that cuts right to the heart. Not only is she physically impressive in the gym and in the ring, but she elevates what could have been a one-note character into someone far more complex, intelligent and affecting.  I doubt if I have seen a more realistically heartbreaking performance all year. If you are wary of sports movies, please don't be put off by the commercials. This is a wonderfully profound film with superlative acting. Strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>"Million dollar baby" is a complete winner of a film. This is actually an Oscar recepient that is hard to dispute. Knockout performances from Freeman, Eastwood, and especially Swank. It's really hard not to be moved by this film once it has been seen in its entirety.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is laced with just the right amount of honesty, comedy, integrity, action, drama, and tragedy. It really is a beautiful piece of work that should equally appeal to both sexes and audiences of every age. This film definitely has it all.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is a movie that is not worth describing the plot for, as it really must be seen to be appreciated and respected. Swank and especially Eastwood should be proud of what they have given us. A crowning acheivement for two outstanding performers.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and make it the next movie on  your list. "Million Dollar Baby" is without a doubt a landmark film and and a new American classic.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Frankie Dunn has trained and managed some incredible fighters during a lifetime spent in the ring. The most important lesson he teaches his boxers is the one that rules life: above all, always protect yourself. In the wake of a painful estrangement from his daughter, Frankie has been unwilling to let himself get close to anyone for a very long time. His only friend, Scrap, an ex-boxer who looks after Frankie's gym, knows that beneath his gruff exterior is a man who has been seeking, for the past 25 years, the forgiveness that somehow continues to elude him. Then Maggie Fitzgerald walks into his gym. "Million Dollar Baby" has great characters, but it doesn't glorify them. It has a wonderful story, but it never tries to impress you. The photography, score and direction is superb, but never distracting. What this movie has is passion. Passion for film-making, passion for storytelling, passion for its characters, passion for its actors, and passion for its story and the means at which it will go to tell it. Amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>If there's anything in this world that interests me less than boxing, I don't know what it is. Plus, this movie is burdened with a very stupid name. But it's a Clint Eastwood film about a female boxer, played by Hilary Swank, which received rave reviews from a large number of my Advanced English Writing students back in China. I bought this maybe two years ago, or maybe even longer ago than that. Finally, I watched it.<br /><br />First thought. Clint has the ability to portray so much with an economy of effort that you can forget he's a damn fine actor.<br /><br />Macho philosophy in quotable bite-sized nuggets. Okay, we have those.<br /><br />Understated humor. Yep, got that.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood as a gruff misfit who's really a soft touch. Yep, got that.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman as the sidekick you wish you had. Yep, got that.<br /><br />Whenever something really interests Clint as a movie maker, he will make you see why. We have an analysis of boxing that makes me say, "Welcome to the gym." You feel it on a level where words fail to express it. I almost understand why people are interested in participating. Almost. Why people watch a damn bloodsport will always remain beyond me.<br /><br />And then, even though I knew from my students' writing that this was going to wind up raising the question of euthanasia, and that Clint shares my sentiments about it, I was wholly unprepared for the way it broke my heart. This has got to be the saddest movie I've seen in... well, maybe ever. If it doesn't break your heart, you don't have one.<br /><br />It deserves every award it won or was nominated for, and I'm glad I saw it once. I don't think I've got the guts to see it twice, which surely means boxing isn't for me. Are you ready for some football?</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>In the Winter of his career (he is now 76 or 77) Clint Eastwood continues to make quality films, which ignore the Hollywood 'market' and at least require you to engage your brain. Million Dollar Baby is another well directed, well acted and engrossing movie.<br /><br />The stand-out performance is undoubtably Hilary Swanks as the gritty working class woman who wants to make it big as a boxer. You can see she obviously worked very hard to get into shape for this film. Both Eastwood and Morgan Freeman give good performances alongside Swank, although I'm sure it would have been a better film if Morgan Freeman had played Frankie, rather than Clint Eastwood. However this is arguable and we'll never know.<br /><br />The film won 4 Oscars, and overall is a thought-provoking movie that deals with a difficult topic very well - and its well worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood has truly grown as a director.  From his early efforts like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4R">Play Misty for Me</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NTNW">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a> to his middle character pieces <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCOA">A Perfect World</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729369">The Bridges of Madison County</a> to his critically acclaimed works <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FDCJ">Unforgiven (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1XITE">Letters from Iwo Jima / Flags of Our Fathers (Five-Disc Commemorative Edition)</a>, Clint Eaastwood has definitely shown a grasp for directing.<br /><br />So this movie did not seem to be too different to expect from Mr. Eastwood.  But it was.  Coming off the success of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ZX0PG">Mystic River (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, Clint Eastwood returned with another critically acclaimed masterpiece.  Following two wins in the acting category, Eastwood directed two more performers to Acaemy Awards in this female boxing story that is so layered and magnificient.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays a boxing trainer that trains a new up and coming female boxer (Hilary Swank).  Morgan Freeman (who won an Oscar) plays his former bocing trainee and provides the narration.<br /><br />One of the best movies of the decade and possibly the best of 2004.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>While I'm not into women's boxing, per-se, this was nonetheless quite a powerful movie.  The plot has an unexpected twist in it, and I would admonish people who view this movie NOT to find out what the twist is before watching it.<br /><br />I swear, you could dress Clint Eastwood up in a pink dress, put little girly hairpins in his hair and he would STILL be more macho than the lot of we men.  In this film, he portrays a past-his-prime boxing trainer who is without any top-notch contenders to teach.<br /><br />Hilary Swank is a girl who shows up @ the gym some day, pays her dues and wants to get a trainer.  Eastwood's character is reluctant to be her manager as he's never dealt with women boxers below.  However, in the end her charm wins him over.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is great as an over-the-hill boxer who had a very bad experience in his final bout.  His character is kind of the "stabilizing force" of the movie.<br /><br />Hilary is toned & buff for the film.  She looks sexy even with a broken nose and blood all over her face.  On top of that, she's an accomplished actress.  This will be one of the most memorable roles in this timespan of her career, although I have a feeling she will still be active as an actress in her 50's & 60's.<br /><br />This is a sports movie, but it is a very atypical one.  It is as much about Hilary's character as it is about her boxing prowess.  Hilary portrays a girl trying to break away from poverty, and the thing she is best at is boxing.  There is perhaps more character development in this film than any other movie I know of.  That's always a plus for a sports film!</p></br><a href="../users/AR14BIUHYR6B7.html">AR14BIUHYR6B7</a><br/><p>I saw this one in the theater, then bought the standard DVD.  Now that I own the HD-DVD edition, it's like being back in the theater.  Faces are very sharp and clear, sweat glistens with reality and the entire journey, much of it in shadows, has a much greater feel of realism thanks to the HD presentation.  Warner Home Video hits it out of the park again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>I am always suspicious of movies that get Oscar buzz and awards because they are usually the ones that PUT ME TO SLEEP! This one was pleasantly an exception!<br /><br />I don't think any one performance stood out here really. It was all a blend of strong performances put together that made this film work. Clint Eastwood's character is almost a rip-off of the late Burgess Merideith's "Mickey" from the Rocky films only he wasn't ever a boxer, just a corner man and trainer. But, unlike Mickey, there are a lot of underlining issues in his past that he wrestles with throughout the film.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's character is the "Ying" to Eastwood's "Yang." An ex-fighter who is the reasoning side of this duo who eventually influences Eastwood to train Hilary Swank's character Maggie.<br /><br />Swank's performance as the simple but full of heart fighter Maggie is very good. She carries herself well in most of her scenes and her character's fate takes an interesting and shocking turn! I won't give it away but it'll take you by surprise.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this film. I didn't think I would like it but I did. This is one that's worth the money at full price but if you can find it at a reduced price, take it! Its worth it either way!</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>Eastwood's gritty-looking boxing film Million Dollar Baby may not pass the smell test when it comes to believability in some parts, but on the whole the messages and the heart of the film are in the right place . You can make up your own minds as to whether the mercy killing at the end is moral, but I wouldn't focus too hard on that. Take with you instead that spirit and drive are what makes life worth living, and that winners only do what losers won't. Well worth your time if you aren't too cynical about moviegoing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>To tell the truth, I had no real desire to see this film, even after it won Best Picture (I tend to be fairly unimpressed with the Oscar-dubbed "best" movies).  I also had the impression that it was ultimately a very sad motion picture, and it's hard for me to watch sad movies.  But - Morgan Freeman's in it, and (as I've said every time I review a Morgan Freeman movie), I consider Morgan Freeman to be the best actor working today.  So I watched the movie.  To say I was impressed and moved is an understatement.  Million Dollar Baby is a truly magnificent film that does indeed hearken back to the old days when movies touched lives rather than merely entertained.<br /><br />This movie plants its roots deeply into the human landscape, with the final hour riding a mighty wave of raw emotion.  What began as a film suddenly transforms into something much more real.  Much of the power of the whole story is subtly rendered, as past regrets lie hidden even as they influence everything that happens.  Morgan Freeman is, of course, masterful in his co-starring role, and Hilary Swank more than deserved the Best Actress statuette she claimed at the Oscars.  It is Clint Eastwood, though, who shines the brightest in this little universe of amazing stars.  As producer and director as well as actor, he once again proves himself to be among the most gifted artists of all time.  Much credit must also go the writer of the screenplay.  The writing is well-nigh perfect, particularly in the way it brings disparate elements together in the end.<br /><br />If I were to lay out the whole story, I could do it pretty quickly.  It's amazing how the most powerful of movies usually feature the simplest of stories.  If you don't know the story already, you really don't need to know what happens before you watch it (and I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone), so I'll talk about the characters and what they represent (to me, at least).  Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a classic underdog.  She has nothing but a dream and only one thing she cares about - and that is boxing.  Not only is she trying to penetrate what has always been a man's world, she also has another strike against her in the form of her age.  Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a long-time trainer and manager, is not about to start training a woman, especially a 32-year-old rookie.  Maggie has the heart of a champion, though, and she is simply not going to give up.  Dunn is a fascinating character - gruff on the outside, a loner, but also a man haunted by his past and obviously searching for something.  He attends Mass every single day, for example, and only to get the priest riled up with questions after every service.  We don't know much about his life other than what we see in the gym, but we know he has a daughter who returns every one of his weekly letters to her.  When he and Maggie finally team up together, their relationship runs deep.  Dunn becomes a surrogate father to Maggie, even as she becomes like a daughter to him - this latter point is expressed beautifully at the end.  Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), Dunn's gym manager and only real friend is the bridge that finally brings them together.  He's a wonderful character in and of himself (as are several minor characters); we don't plumb his emotional depths the way we do those of Dunn and Maggie, but he is actually the narrator of this truly moving story (plus, we get to see him bring a real punk down a notch or two at one point).<br /><br />Maybe you're shying away from this film because it's about a female boxer - well, it's really about life itself.  Maybe you don't like sad movies - this film's worth the emotional turmoil it might put you through.  Maybe you're just biased against Best Picture award-winners.  All I can tell you is that I was all three of these things, and now I am here praising Million Dollar Baby in a loud voice.  This is filmmaking at its best; it will move even the hardest of hearts, and it will renew your faith in the ability of motion pictures to truly transport the human soul in the most compelling of ways.  Million Dollar Baby plays on the level of Greek tragedy, and that's something you can say of only a handful of recent movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>By far the finest boxing movie EVER made!

Sometimes whole stories can be seen as they talk about stories of their character's past. Clint Eastwood makes sure each character has their own strengths and weaknesses:<br /><br /> From a young man who wants to be a boxer who suffers abuse from his fellow boxers in a gym, to an old gym-caretaker played by Morgan Freeman [Scrap] who narrates the movie and offers help to Hilary Swanks character [Maggie].<br /><br />Even Clint Eastwood's character Frankie Dunn, who gives a great perfromance as a man who went from not caring much about female boxers, manages to find himself caring for Maggie near the end of the movie. I found Maggie's and Frankie's relationship in the movie genuwine and heartwarming, as a young female hopeful shows up at Frankie's gym just asking for a chance for Frankie to train her.<br /><br />The movie shows us some great boxing fights as Maggie steadily climbs to the top of the female brand. A first round knockout in about 10 seconds was considered normal for one of Maggie's fights. Frankie even has to go and pay other trainers to put their fighers in with Maggie after a while, but even that stops after a few more fights.<br /><br />I've heard some people comment on how slow the second half of the movie is after the accident [No spoilers ahead, so don't worry] But again, its the DIALOGUE that is what makes this movie. How Frankie transforms into this caring man who becomes great friends with Maggie, and Scrap manages to get his 110th fight he so desperately wanted.<br /><br />This is one of the best acting movies in the year 2004, quite arguably THE best, but thats for you to decide. No wonder it won 4 Academy Awards.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are:<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />James Liptin takes on three: Where Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank talk to the Moderator, James Liptin.<br /><br />Born to Fight: A great look on how the movie was closely related to actuall boxing.<br /><br />Producers Round 15: Just behind the scenes footage.<br /><br />This DVD is definately reccommended.......</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>Well, I'm not going to explain the above - you'll just have to wait until it shows up in the movie. I'll just say it's a pure and moving moment richly earned.  As far as the movie goes as a whole, it deserves the hype.  I was really skeptical when I heard Eastwood won over Scorcese's Aviator.  But now, after seeing both, I think there's no question that the Academy made the right choice.  "The Aviator" is often breathtaking, but also very uneven.  "Million Dollar Baby" is one tight package.  For those upset over Scorcese missing out again (and from what I understand, Eastwood himself was uneasy over the comparisons), put it to rest.  Eastwood, as a director, has grown - perhaps now, brick by brick, film by film, beyond the great Scorcese.  Who'd of thunk it?<br /><br />What can one say about Eastwood?  Recently I watched again "Unforgiven," and I was struck by the power of that movie (which also has Morgan Freeman).  Eastwood's growth as a director is one of the great quiet stories of Hollywood.  As an exercise watch the horrible "Gauntlet" or even the "Outlaw Josie Wales," and then watch the trifecta of "Mystic River," "Unforgiven," and now "Million Dollar Baby."  What an astounding evolution!  Somewhere along the way Eastwood discovered that people matter - and moviegoers want to care about the people on the screen. And how he does it?  By focusing on character - and the heart.  Hillary Swank is a perfect example, with her heartbreaking performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, the toothy waitress with a right hook, who dares to dream of a life beyond her dreary existence. You are rooting for her despite the odds. Freeman - what a pro, he plays off of Eastwood in such a way that elevates both characters.  Eastwood's own performance as curmudgeony Frankie Dunn is simply one of his best - and should of netted him a best actor award.  But it's tough when people still see you as the Man with No Name.  Anyway, it's time to start looking at Eastwood as a throwback to the great American directors John Ford and Frank Capra. "Million Dollar Baby" and "Unforgiven" are American fables in the truest sense.  Right down to that lemon pie.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood (Director/actor) takes his specialized filmmaking skills again to an Oscar level with Million Dollar Baby. Eastwood takes his years of acting, producing and directing experience to accomplish an emotional character driven award winning film.<br /><br />Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is lifetime, hard-nosed boxing trainer and manager. He started out in boxing as a cut man. He was in the corner of Eddie "Scrap-iron Dupris (Freeman) when he lost in the title match. Now, he just lost his best fighter to another trainer/agent because Frankie would not give the demands for a title shot. Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) asks Frankie to train her because he is the best. After some convincing Frankie agrees, but only if she follows his rules. A close father/daughter relationship is struck. Frankie's lack of relationship with his daughter will only bring out his fatherly traits. The ending explodes the heart like a emotional nuclear time bomb.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is a great film with even better acting. All deserve receiving awards for their outstanding acting work. Its is nice to see a film based on acting skills rather than special effects only to carry a film.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" received Academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor. This DVD will not disappoint any viewer. Sure you could pick apart or disagree with technical aspects of what YOU would do but Clint Eastwood shows why He received the Best Director Award from the Academy. (Scene: Frankie and Maggie driving home at night. Check out the lighting.

Now I'm not sure it hits every point on the believablity scale, but once you accept that a girl this beautiful is still single at 33 and only making just enough to survive at a waitressing job eating scraps that customers leave.. and that on top of all that she wants to become the next Mohammed Ali of women and actually has what it takes to do just that (almost)..... well, once you accept that, you're in for a beautiful ride. Hillary Swank is gorgeous and in spite of all the above mentioned improbabilities, puts in a fantastic performance as Maggie.  Hollywood be damned, she'll win your heart in spite of it all.  And Clint, well, of course his performance is fantastic as usual. Likewise for Morgan Freeman.  If the point of a movie is to get the audience involved on as many levels as possible, entertaining you through and through in the process, then this movie succeeds admirably.  Much more than a female version of Rocky the film tackles some hard issues towards the end.  Always great to see Clint in action and this film is no exception.  "Gran Torino" also featuring Clint in his winter years is another great ride as well.  I'm glad to have seen Million Dollar Baby.

She eats off folks leavings at work and saves up just about every dime and works hard because as Morgan Freeman so beautifully narrated in the film, there is a dream in everyone that only they can see and for her it's a shot at becoming a female boxer; She don't have many people in her corner rooting for her; Matter of fact, her family down her and even spurns the house she buys in cash money for them because as the mother puts it, "she don't wanna mess up her welfare" that just reinforces to me that that mentality isn't in any one group of folk. Anyhow, in spite of the odds(she's over 30, little or no support, one woman in a male dominated field,the lack of respect female boxers get, the reluctance of Eastwood to even want to train her ("I Don't Train Girls") she makes a name for herself and rise up in the ranks in spite of the fact that other fighters are reluctant to spar with her due to her knocking them out in the first round.And even when things get better, she stays grounded and keeps on training. One of the saddest yet triumphant scenes in the movie is when her family comes to see her in the hospital, going to Disneyland on her dime mind you(Remember they felt she was a laughing stock) and wanted her to sign some papers basically giving them complete control over her affairs and with the lawyer in hand, mind you but she kicks them to the curb and sends their butts packing. But in spite of the good, there's some bad and sad; Won't spoil it all. One more thing, I think Morgan Freeman's role in the movie as narrator and as the voice of reason to Clint Eastwood's character was refreshing and candid; I liked and applauded it; Eastwood gave a great performance as well. I tell you what though, that priest needed telling off. If a person is trying to find God no matter how old or what have you, it is your job to help them to him. How you gonna sit and pass judgment over a man who wanted answers? didn't like that at all. Otherwise, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>First, I dont give many films five stars. I believe the absolute pinnacle of filmmaking and talent with an ensemble cast that brings cohesion and belivability, makes a five star film. Fanboys and fanatical followers who follow their fav actors or directors around like lemmings and unfairly give their work five stars is sophmoric. I believe films like Empire of the Sun, Europe Europa, Remains of the Day, Schindler's List, E.T., Dead Poet's Society, Zeff's Romeo and Juliet, even Saw, are five star films. I finally have room to garner another film five stars, thus is 'Million Dollar Baby'.<br /><br />Million dollar baby gave me an upper cut in which I still have not regained consciousness from. A mind numbing extasy of emotion, surrounded by a cornucopia of unpredictability, that I wanted to lather in its warmth and tenderness long after the rolling credits whited out an otherwise black screen. All I can simply find the need to say now is 'WOW'. Without a doubt this emotional masterpiece of finely honed craft, is without question, and rarely do I ever say this, one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I had given the idea to seeing this some thought several times, but loathing anything Clint Eastwood and my inate disdain to boxing, simply left my tongue dry with any thought of watering it. I was very surprised by my addiction to it from jumpstreet. During many moments I was grilled to the tv, so close I could hear my mother as a child telling me I would go blind because I was sitting so close to it. Actually routing her on from time to time, like we all did in Rocky, it made me smile and cheer and cry and think; it told me in a fashion that few films do, to move with your heart, think that you will acheive greatness, despite everyone around you saying you can't and despite obstacles, and the film spoke to me, in its own personal way, telling me not to take anything for granted.<br /><br />I like the fact that a film can be an uplifting experience that stays with you days after you view it. Sure nothing wrong with a Harrison Ford flick once and again, but nothing beats the feeling of walking out of something tangible, that you can feel a part of.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby, full of stucco bravado and yearning contempt towards status quo and mainstream, its message is a strong and important one, a redefining look at the underdog in its capacity to have others pay attention, stagggeringly detailed in its tempo, it marvels in a way that makes me want to quit my every day job or night job I have, collect all the bills in the mattress and head out and be a filmmaker. Damn I dont know about you, but if I made a film, and someone, anyone, said that about my film, it would fill me with tears and a joy in which I know, wholeheartedly, would be the reason why film is made.<br /><br />A way past prime female boxer, gets a chance from a worldclass trainer, in his own right, bitter with his ways, to train her to be the best in the world, and thus both finding solace through each other, which grows as each one learns more about the others world and where they came from. It's tender and tragic and seems to find its way from every nuance and turn in a fine display of cinematography and acting, that is uncompromisable.<br /><br />The only moments that made the film stretch a bit, which really bothered me, as it was THAT good, was boy with serious issues that looked like he had turrets was very annoying, and not needed in any fashion and his return was pointless (save sticking with a dream) and unncessary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>For some time the strongest problems I've heard from other viewers about Million Dollar Baby is that it's either unrealistic or it's too depressing. Besides whatever wrong technical facts about Maggie's hospital stay I think this is a perfect and realistic story. Yes it was depressing but there are plenty of real people with worse stories that never got anything good in life. Though Maggie had an unfair life she kept a smile on her face and still worked hard to get where she wanted to be. She was tough and fought with no regrets. She may have not had the family she wanted but at least she got to fight and be important to someone. Basically the first time you watch this film you should watch it for the story not hunting for technical rights and wrongs. If you can get by that it's very enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>I had not heard much about this movie before seeing it (other than the fact it had Clint Eastwood in it, and it was about boxing) When this movie starts off, you think it is going to be a "Rocky", "Cinderella man" or a "Karate Kid" type of movie (you know the ones, where the underdog is being bullied until they finally rise to stardom) Boy, was I surprised which direction this one went. I like movies with atypical outcomes. So that was a breath of fresh air. I also like old Shakespearian style tragedies, so this movie was right up my ally. Everyone has already talked about the movie synopsis in their reviews; I will just get to the point:<br /><br />Verdict: Very good movie, definitely worth watching. The characters are well developed, the story keeps you interested form beginning to end, and all the actors did a very good job. Its not a very "happy" movie though (meaning it might not be for everyone, especially teens and younger kids, or anyone who gets depressed easily) Still a good movie though.<br /><br />My only MINOR complaints are as follows. (1) I like Clint Eastwood, so don't get me wrong here (I have been watching him since he was dirty hairy and in movies like "the good the bad and the ugly") I just think he is getting a little bit too old to be acting. I'm NOT saying his acting was bad in this movie. He just seemed to be straining a lot to talk, as if he is struggling to say his lines (at times he was even hard to understand). He is an excellent writer, and getting into writing was the wisest choice he has made in his career. He is just getting a little old to be playing the tough guy roll. (2) Once again, the movie was good, but I would have liked to seen a more developed ending. It had a little bit of a rushed feeling to it, and it is a little more open ended than I like. The ending seems a bit abrupt; you will find yourself saying "well what happened next?" I guess you could say the story was good enough to where you just wanted another chapter to see what happened to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>Don't read any more of this review if you intend to see Million Dollar Baby and don't know what the story is about. Assisted suicide is a key part of the story  -- one character who, despite his strong Catholic faith, decides to help another character, doomed to life as a quadrapeligic, end her life. I seriously doubt that Clint Eastwood, a lifelong conservative Republican, is making a political statement with Million Dollar Baby. But that didn't stop the right wing, in the person of Michael Medved, in trashing the film's supposed advocacy of assisted suicide. Thankfully voices of sanity like Roger Ebert rose up in defense of the film, rightfully claiming that the film wasn't making a political statement. The character that assists in the suicide does not do so lightly and only arrives at his decision after much self-searching.<br /><br />I'm tired of right wing robots like Michael Medved who yell about liberal bias in the media one moment but then think it's all right to let their own personal extremist conservative agenda color everything they watch on TV or at the movies. Clint Eastwood has made a humane and compassionate film that uses assisted suicide as a plot resolution, not a political statement. To reduce this film, which richly deserved the Best Picture Academy award, to a "cause film" is just wrong. I'm sick and tired of Michael Medved's right wing garbage. If you haven't seen Million Dollar Baby, don't let Medved stop you from doing so. If you have seen it, please don't let Medved's ignorance and stupidity change your view of it -- he is a smug, hypocritical, right wing shill who has squandered any credibility he might have had by making such a stupid statement about such a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This quiet and low-key film from director Clint Eastwood is a story of real life. It is filled with love and pain and regret, and at its conclusion, you will feel all three. Eastwood released it slowly, in a deliberate manner, so that word of mouth would be its advertisement. In its own heartbreaking manner, it might be his best film both as a director and actor.<br /><br />Hilary Swank is magnificent in her down-to-earth role of a young woman with a background she dreams of rising above through boxing. Her determination to make it during times so dire she is relegated to eating leftover food from the plates of others is just one moving moment in a film full of them. This is not the usual Hollywood version of how people survive, but the truth.<br /><br />Eastwood is a legendary trainer and cut-man she hopes will help her achieve her dream. She has the heart but knows he can teach her the skills to make it happen. Morgan Freeman is once again Eastwood's pal, but this time he won the Oscar he deserved for his moving performance. His compassion and understanding of life's regrets is the thread which ties all the pieces of cloth into a quilt, each piece having its own story to tell. His narration, coming at critical junctures in the story is tinged with the sad overview of events from a higher perspective.<br /><br />Eastwood for his part gives a subtle and moving performance as a man with deep regrets over an estranged daughter. His letters are always returned unopened but he keeps sending them nonetheless. It is the spirit and desperation of Swank that will tip the scales in her favor with Eastwood because he sees in her a kindred soul, coming to view her as his own. When she tries but fails to connect with her family after she becomes successful, it is Eastwood who will remain. There is something tender and very real in their understated scene afterwards in the car.<br /><br />A tragedy the viewer does not see coming, and one I will not ruin if you haven't seen this, will shatter dreams and hearts, however. When Eastwood is asked by Swank for something which will take all he has left, you can almost see his heart breaking. Swank simply disappears into her character in the same manner for which Montgomery Clift was famous. Morgan Freeman gives a masterful performance. Eastwood did not get the accolades Freeman and Swank did for their roles, but if you watch closely, you will see a subtle but rough grace to his performance. Only in the film's final moments will we understand how much he cares for her.<br /><br />This is a film elemental but by no means simple. It touched audiences on a human level and was a success without fanfare because it is an all too real slice of life, its truths sometimes painful to watch.<br /><br />Sometimes, when all we have is gone, all that is left us are our memories, and a slice of lemon pie.....</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR.html">A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR</a><br/><p>I have seen many fine reviews by perious reviewers so, I'm not going to repeat the great jobs that have already been done. To review the movie, I have to avoid giving away the last third of the movie but, my reference to "thirds" indicates that I have divided the movie into three parts. First, an aspiring female boxer, Margaret Fitzgerald, who is already in her thirties comes to trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood. She wants him to train her and the first third of the movie governs this evolving relationship. The second part of the movie deals with her boxing career blooming and flourishing. The third part of the movie takes a major turn and the film takes on a much heavier quality.<br /><br />In the first two parts, which I can be more revealing about, the boxer, played by Hilary Swank, shows a grittiness and determination that is much more believable than that displayed in the movie Rocky. Additionally, the fight scenes and progression of her career is also more believable and realistic than in Rocky. Indeed, Rocky seems almost cartoonish compared to this. What really makes this film, however, is the third part which adds a dimension that is nonexistent in Rocky. I cannot reveal the last third of the movie other than to state that it takes a very heavy turn. I must mention, before concluding, that Morgan Freeman, in a supporting role, gives his usual stellar performance. I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>One of the best films I've seen in years! A beautifully written and directed story with a strong cast. This is an engrossing film that will keep you glued to the screen from start to finish. I went into this film not knowing anything about it, I was shocked that it turned out to be a much different film than I first assumed it would be. Eastwood proves he can do it all this beautiful and poignant film. No wonder this won best picture! The DVD has a great transfer, many extras and is a worthy purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>MILLION DOLLAR BABY has to be one of the saddest movies I've ever seen--so sad that if I catch it on cable I find myself changing the channel before the tragedy strikes.  That said, this is an acutely tender, compelling drama, featuring three very believable characters in an unusual setting:  women's boxing.  And of course, this is a film directed by Clint Eastwood, who has become one of the elites of even elite filmmakers.<br /><br />We all know the story.  An impoverished waitress (Hilary Swank) wants to be a champion boxer; as her mentor, she wants grizzled, veteran manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood).  Yet Frankie resists, and resists aggressively, as he wants no part of women's boxing, yet Maggie (Swank's character) persists.  Plus, she touches a nerve in the old, wily manager, a parental nerve in a lonely man who is very much estranged from his own daughter.  Aided by Frankie's longtime friend and partner Eddie (Morgan Freeman), the duo achieves skyrocketing success along the women's boxing circuit--until unspeakable tragedy takes place.  And then Frankie is faced with some very difficult decisions.<br /><br />Believability.  That's what is so strong in MILLION DOLLAR BABY, from Frankie's grungy boxing gym, to the boxing action, to the tenderness between Eastwood and Swank's characters.  It's all very compelling--it's all literally heartbreaking.  Obviously, my bias is showing; I'm giving this exceptionally good film four stars instead of five because it's simply too painful to watch the final half hour.  But it doesn't keep me from heartily recommending it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I made the grave mistake of watching this movie with my infant daughter a few nights back and by the time Frankie Dunn gets to explaining what `Mo Cushla' means to Maggie I was a complete and utter mess.  Yes, I'm an emotional wreck when it comes to films that tug the heart strings, and `Million Dollar Baby' is just that kind of movie.  It's funny because come Oscar season 2004 I was a huge supporter of this film but ended up getting caught up in the backlash especially with Swanks Oscar win.  It's a shame because I unfortunately shelved this film for quite a while allowing the opinion of others to influence my opinion of this film.  With the birth of my daughter I've been up plenty of nights with nothing much to do but watch movies to drown out the cries and `Million Dollar Baby' just so happened to be one of the first films I decided to watch again.  I'm glad that I did, for as much as it drained me emotionally by the end it helped remind me why I was such a supporter of the film the year of its release.  `Million Dollar Baby' is truly an astounding film.<br /><br />To me it's hard really to categorize this film.  If you haven't seen the movie you may want to read my review with the foreknowledge that while won't reveal the ending of the film I will divulge information you may not be privy to.  `Million Dollar Baby' plays out like two separate films.  There's the sports drama that unfolds throughout the first half and then there's the paced dramatic second half that has absolutely nothing to do with boxing.  What ties these two halves together is the relationship drama unfolding between Frankie Dunn and Maggie Fitzgerald.  It's one of the sweetest yet ultimately devastating father-daughter sagas in recent years.  What makes this all the more involving are the stellar performances by Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood.  They are so in tune with each other, so connected with their characters and with their cast mates that you believe them through and through and that is the key factor in understanding and appreciating this film.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald is a middle-aged waitress who feels her life has wasted away without ever truly becoming what she wanted it to become.  Her family is a vapid void of who she used to be, a carousel of white trash self centered bodies who take what they can and give nothing but heartache.  They criticize Maggie for her dreams even when she attains them but welcome the checks she sends home every week.  Frankie Dunn is a trainer at the end of his rope.  He's losing his fighters because of his ethics and he's losing himself as he struggles to reconnect with his daughter who's given up on him years ago.  Maggie believes Dunn to be the best trainer there is and wants nothing more than to be his fighter, but as Frankie so bluntly puts it, he don't train girls.  Maggie is persistent though, and eventually she breaks him down.  He agrees to train her on the condition that she will find herself another manager when the time is right, but when that time comes he realizes he can't let Maggie go.  It's that realization that makes this film all the more heartbreaking.<br /><br />The movie is far more than a `down on her luck girl becoming a prized fighter' type film.  It's more about heart than anything else.  Stripped bare of its boxing backdrop and you have a film about the deepest most remote parts of love, a love that can only exist between families.  This is not about romantic or lustful love but about respect and admiration.  Hilary Swank plays Maggie with such determination, such heart that you feel for her, you love her every step of the way.  It's a shame to me that Hilary has only done two good films.  Watching her in this film and even to a greater extent in `Boys Don't Cry' it's hard to imagine that she's the same actress to give us `The Core'.  I can't decide if Swank is a good actress or a lucky one, but hating aside her performances in both `Million Dollar Baby' and `Boys Don't Cry' are brilliant.  I will admit that Kate Winslet's performance in `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' was better and more deserving of Oscar gold, but I can completely understand and get behind the academy's decision to crown Swank once again.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood also pulls out a fascinating performance.  The first time I saw this film I was so blown away but Swanks performance that I didn't truly grasp the magnificent portrayal of Dunn that Eastwood provides.  His subtle variations of emotion are so expertly mannered that I can't help but wish they would have handed him the Oscar.  He was so controlled here and watching his shift from arrogant and demanding to content and understanding to depressed and defensive as he comes to grips with Maggie's situation.  He was, in a word, outstanding.<br /><br />While I love Morgan Freeman and feel that his presence in this film is wonderful I am less impressed with his performance than with any other in the film.  His Oscar win in my opinion was undeserved for his character is not all that impressive.  In fact I feel that the idea of Eddie Dupris is more impressive than the limited amount of depth the script allowed for him.  He could have been a more powerful presence but he lacked something that both Swank and Eastwood were able to deliver.  I hate to single out Freeman as the flaw here because I truly love the actor but there really is nothing else in this film I can find fault with.<br /><br />In the end the film, including Freeman, is a masterpiece of modern cinema.  Sure it may appear sappy in some areas but ultimately it's rewarding in the same vein.  It's a truly extraordinary accounting of a beautiful relationship between a girl in need of a father and a father in need of a daughter.  It's a movie that will make the burliest of men cry and to me a film that can invest itself so deep in an audience as to evoke real emotions is a film that is deserving of all the praise it can receive.  `Million Dollar Baby' is just that film.  I'm sorry for ever allowing others to influence my opinion of you when I knew you were always a gem.  I promise to never let that happen again.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>It was only after I watched "$1M Baby" the second time, that it's power, via its simplicity, knocked me over. Eastwood has a way of allowing the audience to absorb the material, and, as mentioned in the extras, Paul Haggis' screenplay hadn't reached it's final draft before Eastwood decided  that the primitive screenplay as it was would be more effective. It was a good decision. Characters are complete, and in the hands of the letter-perfect cast, there is no question about who these people are, what they want nor where they've been. Various plot twists keep things interesting, and there's a softness, even in the fight scenes, that makes you adore these people. Hilary Swank, once again, was in an Oscar race with Annette Bening. She deserved both. Excellent film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Abandon any notions that Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" is another routine underdog-rises-to-the-top boxing tale.  This is a film more concerned with examining the hard choices that life sometimes asks us to make.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) asks Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to train her as a boxer.  Frankie refuses because he says she is too old and a girl.  Yet, the defiant Maggie continues to insist and, with the support of Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), gets Frankie to change his mind.  Soon she is on the fast track to success but a terrifying accident abruptly changes her life and forces Frankie to make a difficult decision.<br /><br />Eastwood never resorts to melodrama or cheap manipulative tricks in "Million Dollar Baby" to examine the value of one's personal dignity.  He instead uses his veteran directing talents to weave together a heartbreaking story that refuses to supply any easy answers.  Maggie's quick professional ascension may stretch credibility a bit but this is a minor quibble.  Anchored by strong performances throughout, especially that of Swank's, "Million Dollar Baby" is a compelling piece of filmmaking that will undoubtedly linger in your mind for quite some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>Great HD DVD Movie!!!

Well, not his life, but a marvelous movie; deep, moving, loving, sincere, brutal, telling and humorous at times. This is s story of a boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald from a poor southern town with not much of a future to look forward to. However, she wants to be a boxer. She never did explain that, but meeting her family I would have become a garbage collector to get away from that crowd.<br /><br />Clint plays Frankie Dunn, owner of a gym and trainer in that gym. Maggie Fitzgerald is Hilary Swank, and what a Maggie she is. Morgan Freeman is a retired boxer and all around good man at the gym. Into and around the gym come all sorts of people,  young, old, talented and crazy men wanting to play the fight game. And, of course, in comes Maggie, Frankie finally decides to train Maggie, and in 18 month she has knocked out most of the women boxers she has met. This is an undeniable group of scenes. But the real kicker, the real start of the story arrives with the next set of scenes.<br /><br />I am not going to spoil the ending or the near ending except to say that this is the part of the movie that makes it great. This is what makes a good movie, and this is what makes Clint Eastwood, the director he is, and Hilary Swank the Oscar winning actress she is.  You could miss the first half of the movie and still understand the ending. Great movie. Not for the faint of heart, but recommended highly. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>This movie uses its extremely strong characters and a decent storyline to create what could literally be called a modern day classic. It shows a softer side to Clint Eastwood that I am not sure we have ever seen before. Hilary Swank is outstanding - I wish I had a better word for her performance - but I am not sure there is one. They key to this film is her ability to pull off the boxing segments in a convincing manner - and she does that in spades. Her right hook appears to be truly devastating. Morgan Freeman also turns in an awesome performance - both he and Swank are worthy of the Oscar. Million Dollar Baby is a film that should not be missed. See it.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood has made a movie about a hot-button social and political topic much discussed today. But he's disguised  it as sports formula about a rags-to-riches boxer. That the boxer is a woman (Hilary Swank) is not the twist we just knew he would give the genre. The training and boxing scenes that introduce the characters and story lead us to expect "Rocky Redux." Eastwood gives us something else entirely, a one-two punch that makes it quite clear that the non-training, non-boxing scenes address the real plot and theme. You won't see it coming, but you'll sure know what hit you.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" has too good a script to rely on mere surprises, although the movie still moves us knowing them in advance. It's unfortunate, however, that some reviewers here have revealed them, as audiences and the national press have not. No matter on what side of its central controversy you stand, this movie sneaks up on you long after it's over, forcing you to delay discussing it until others have seen it. Even at the 2004 Academy Awards, Eastwood, Swank and Morgan Freeman (they each picked up one) kept its secrets.<br /><br />"Unforgiven," "Bird," "Mystic River," "Million Dollar Baby," his quirky comedies and taut thrillers, plus the many Oscars three of them have won, all qualify Eastwood as that rare Hollywood denizen, an auteur (he often composes his own musical scores.) And unlike some actors, he knows how to direct himself, a tricky feat. Only one dud apparent, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," oddly disappointing given its bestsellerdom and starry cast (Kevin Spacey, Jude Law, his own daughter.) No split decision here, though. It's hard to avoid a tired boxing cliche when touting Clint's achievement, but "Million Dollar Baby" is a knockout.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Despite the insistence of some critics that "Million Dollar Baby" is a notably fresh, surprising and original movie, don't believe it. It's an old-fashioned, five-hanky, melodramatic weeper, basically notable for the way that screenwriter Paul Haggis and director-star Clint Eastwood graft one familiar plot onto another to change the movie's direction, abruptly and  completely, about two-thirds of the way through. (It's no fair to say precisely what they do, or how they do it; but if you know what people generally do in boxing rings, it isn't a particularly surprising plot twist.) But if you've seen both stories before, seldom have you seen either story done with such conviction, polish, and restrained yet powerful emotion. Eastwood, one of Hollywood's smoothest old pros, milks every scene for maximum impact, and gets marvelous chiaroscuro effects out of cinematographer Tom Stern as well as believably grungy, gritty sets from production designer Henry Bumstead. Eastwood's also at the top of his game as an actor here; his scenes with another great old pro, Morgan Freeman, are wonderful to watch, like Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus matching each other shot for shot on the back nine. Haggis gives Eastwood and Freeman sharp, incisive dialogue that is fully worthy of their artistry. But the standout here is Hilary Swank, who proves beyond doubt that her mesmerizing, Oscar-winning performance in "Boys Don't Cry" was no fluke. In a role that makes both extreme physical and emotional demands, Swank creates one of the most heartrending, lovably three-dimensional heroines in recent movie history.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>"Million Dollar Baby" is simply an outstanding movie, one of those which you won't forget anytime soon after seeing it. I really hope Hilary Swank wins Best Actress. I tend to like Clint Eastwood's directing more than his acting, but in this movie he shows an unusual range and even lets himself cry, something we don't typically see him doing. Morgan Freeman's performance is, as always, great, although his most deeply-felt asset to this movie is his narration. He has such a talent to completely engage the audience whenever he narrates a movie, and this is no exception.<br /><br />What I personally took away from it is that sometimes we must pay a price to reach our dreams, and what lies at the end of the road isn't always what we had hoped for. But it's better than if we never got our chance to have those dreams at all. Mushy and a little corny perhaps, but that's what I believe this movie is about, and it manages to convey this message in a non-mushy and non-corny way.<br /><br />There really is no more praise I can give this film than what has already been said here. Watch it for yourself and just try not to be moved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>What boxing movie? We don't see a deluge of training montages leading to a foregone triumph; Million Dollar Baby (MDB) has much deeper themes in mind.<br /><br />It canvasses emotionally fraught territory and forces its characters to make decisions for which no sport can prepare them. "Sometimes the best way to deliver a punch is to step back. But step back too far and you ain't fighting at all."<br /><br />The production reeks of austerity all round, as if Eastwood has boiled off every ounce of fat and let only the essentials remain. Principally we have three characters that are sketched with satisfying precision:<br /><br />Frankie (Eastwood), a has-been manager dumped by his last client thus growing dangerously risk-averse. His disaffection finds expression in hollow visits to church, some of which are hilariously blasphemous but never gratuitous.<br /><br />Who better to shake him up than Maggie (Swank), a scrappy, dirt-poor wanna-be who stashes away leftovers from the restaurant that she waits at. Already pushing her luck at 31 she is so hungry for boxing that she practically lives at the gym, gobbling up stray bits of advice. Swank's portrayal of angst, exuberance, doggedness and zeal all rolled into one, sans Hollywood theatrics, is a feat.<br /><br />Then there is Eddie (Freeman), Frankie's help around the boxing gym, whose earthy narration comes into play and charts Maggie's progress with some evocative voiceover.<br /><br />The core narrative is simple so shouldn't be spoiled, but several subplots are constantly at work throughout the movie: Eddie's own career and his relationship with Frankie, Maggie's poor background and her relationship with her abhorrent family, Frankie's long-lost daughter and his taunting interplay with his local priest. None of these smother the movie, nor are they followed through to much conclusion, yet they provide intriguing depth to the three main characters as we come to know them in the shadowy expanse of Frankie's boxing gym.<br /><br />The denouement is not one bit controversial, it's a very natural culmination of events. I am not quite sure what the controversy was all about anyway. There used to be a time when different opinions were resolved with you and I agreeing to disagree. Now, everything that's not in line with one's opinions is either moronic or just plain wrong. The script does a good job of explaining its decisions. When Frankie ruefully questions his judgment for ever backing Maggie's foray into boxing, Eddie gives him a rejoinder that makes perfect sense for the upcoming decisions.<br /><br />What an impeccable production; no supercilious plot structures, just a hard-nosed theme with great respect for the slow miracles that draw people together in ties that touch the heart and soul.<br /><br />Your collection is incomplete without this marvelous film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HWD9PTM7RBXN.html">A2HWD9PTM7RBXN</a><br/><p>Millon Dollar Baby is truly a specia movie.  Maybe not quite one in a million, but definitely a rare breed.  Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood put in epic performances.  No phoniness here as it certainly takes a lot of time for Swank's character to get through to crusty old Mr. Eastwood's character.  The side stories involving Morgan Freeman and the semi-retarded fighter is quite intriguing as well.  Nonetheless, Eastwood at this late stage in his career still has a strong will.  Good stuff indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This film is a masterpiece. It is absolutely brilliant.  It is reminscent of The Decalogue, a series of films directed by Krystof Kieslowski about the 10 Commandments. It addresses the moral questions (along with the moral ambiguity) that we may all have to face. It doesn't do it in a condescending, Hollywoodesque way. It does it in an adult way. The film stayed with me for days afterwards. I have watched several Eastwood directed films since seeing this one, and I think Clint is sorely underrappreciated as a filmmaker. He has directed 26 films (his latest, Flag of Our Fathers, is due out in 2006).  He isn't an actor (like Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson) who occasionally steps behind a camera.  He's a real, legitimate filmmaker, and he displays a sensitivity and subtlety that are so rare in Hollywood these days, reminiscent of old Hollywood masters like John Ford.  He is a true artist, a great filmmaker that should be spoken about alongside the greats.  And his artistry comes through this film in every frame.  Only a true artist with the depth and substance of Eastwood could have made this heartbreaking, thought provoking film.  ADDENUM...Check out the Producer's 15 segment on the DVD.  Tom Rosenberg, one of the producers of this film, makes some hilariously pointed comments about directors.  He compares how inefficient and pretentious other directors are compared to Clint, who is arguably one of the most workmanlike, unpretentious, and excellent filmmakers in Hollywood today.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>I did not leave the theater totally depressed. I knew I had seen a very well made movie. As good an actor as Clint Eastwood has become he has mastered the other side of the camera also. He just doesn't make bad movies. I don't see Hillary Swank as a movie star, just a damn fine actress. One of the best. What can you say about Morgan Freeman? He just gives great narration. I put off seeing this movie because of the subject matter. Not only another boxing movie, but girl boxing. I'd be hard pressed to think of a more misbegotten sport. No matter. Boxing's not the point, (it rarely is) it's merely the vehicle. I felt the movie was about pursuing dreams, & facilatating the dreams of others when you can. It's about taking chances, opening youself up to different options, the ability to adapt & change.

With typical spare elegance, Eastwood's rendering of this fable-like story will at first excite you, move you, and thrill you, then devastate you, infect you and haunt you.  It's the best kind of movie -- one that lingers long after you've seen it, with questions swirling in your own head -- what might you have done as one of these people?

This is one of last year's best (Oscar Winner)!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>I didn't much like Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning MILLION DOLLAR BABY the first time I saw it. When its first 90 minutes of boxing-movie cliches (however well-acted and directed) gave way to 40 final minutes of tearjerking, (eventually) morally-charged drama, I found myself unmoved. Instead, I just couldn't get past how contrived and melodramatic this last third of the movie seemed in comparison to the rest. Many people, of course, were applauding Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis' refusal to bow down to cliche towards the end of the picture; to me, though, the film's relentlessly catastrophic finale seemed more shameless than sincere. I balked.<br /><br />But the film had garnered so much praise, and won the 2004 Best Picture Oscar to boot, that the recent release of the film on DVD prompted me to look at it again. Now that I've re-seen it, I've basically come down to the following conclusion: I still think MILLION DOLLAR BABY is overrated, yet it may still be worth seeing all the same.<br /><br />What changed? Not much, really. I've always appreciated Clint Eastwood's style as a director. In a time when movies seem to be getting louder and flashier, here is an older-generation artist who makes films that are quiet, introspective, and character-based. While a lot of his films are basically genre films, Eastwood takes his time and utmost care to make films that make you care about the characters and situations onscreen. It's an approach that worked especially well in his 1992 Oscar-winner UNFORGIVEN and his 2003 film (maybe his masterpiece) MYSTIC RIVER, because both films also had resonant themes to go along with its stripped-down style. UNFORGIVEN was about the dehumanization of violence in man, and MYSTIC RIVER could be seen as a critique (though perhaps not necessarily a flat-out denunciation) of vigilante violence.<br /><br />What is MILLION DOLLAR BABY about, then? I guess it's ultimately a love story. No, the relationship between Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and her manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) never becomes the typical Hollywood-style love affair. It's a deeper love and admiration that develops between the two, and, as the tragedy unfolds towards the end of this film, that father-daughter-type relationship gets pushed to its emotional limits.<br /><br />The choice that Frankie ultimately must make is probably what most of the film's admirers love about MILLION DOLLAR BABY; it's perhaps the source of my biggest reservations about it. (SPOILER ALERT) Now, after seeing the movie again, I'll admit that the final 15 minutes---as Frankie is forced to choose between keeping Maggie alive or killing her---does have some power as human drama; it's a choice between showing your love for someone and personally sinning to do so, and Clint Eastwood has perhaps never been finer in characterizing this internal conflict in Frankie. But---even after all these months---I still can't quite get past Maggie's decision, and how wrong it feels to me in the context of the Maggie the rest of the film has shown us. Here's a character who is pretty much heart personified: even when Frankie initially rejects her, even when her own mother decries her boxing, and even when she starts to face slightly tougher opponents, she never fails to show steely determination. But then the twist comes, she sustains a paralyzing spinal cord injury, and, when the personal horrors start to pile up (the last straw is when she is forced to lose her legs thanks to bedsores that form on them), she decides to ask Frankie to put her out of her misery. When I saw MILLION DOLLAR BABY in the theater months ago, at the time I simply didn't believe that the eternally-optimistic Maggie would have made that kind of decision---not the way Paul Haggis had written the character, and certainly not the way Hilary Swank played her, even during the hospital scenes preceding that important decision scene. I tried to put such a misgiving out of my mind in watching the film for a second time, and I think I was able to appreciate that, ultimately, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is more Frankie's story than Maggie's---it's less about Maggie's rise to the top than about how Frankie, with Maggie's help, opens his heart and stops "protecting himself." Still, I think the problem with the way the film approaches Maggie's decision is that there isn't enough of an attempt to depict her change from determined to suicidal; it just happens one fateful night, out of the blue. To mildly cynical me, it comes off as more a bald attempt to shock and jerk tears rather than a serious examination of the moral and ethical dilemma of euthanasia...in other words, manipulative.<br /><br />In fact, almost all of this bleak final act of MILLION DOLLAR BABY engendered a similar feeling: yes, it may be a bold move on the part of the filmmakers to shift into such dark territory in the midst of what has so far been typical boxing-underdog drama. It's daring, but I don't think it pays off: there's little during the emotionally draining final act to suggest a deepening of themes presented in the first two-thirds. Instead, it feels like two different movies in one, and there's barely a connecting thread to give both parts a kind of unity to it---except maybe its idea of boxing as a metaphor for life. Instead of trying to tackle his themes head-on, Haggis and Eastwood take the easy approach: overlay it upon a comfortingly familiar underdog tale, and then sucker punch their way into the "important" part. It felt crudely manipulative to me in the theater, and---as well-done as the ending is---it still feels that way to me now. At least MYSTIC RIVER's tragic ending was all of a piece with its dark vision; the sadness at the end of this film seems merely unearned.<br /><br />Despite my serious reservations, though I must give the film at least some credit for its, uh, unpredictability; for the grace that Eastwood brings to the film; for the compelling drama of the film's final 15 minutes; and especially for its actors. Clint Eastwood has only been getting better with age, and once again he uses our knowledge of his former tough-guy persona to surprise us with his vividness and emotional depth (especially towards the end). Morgan Freeman finally got an Oscar for his performance as Frankie's confidante Scrap, and, while the role is basically a rehash of the best-friend role he played in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Freeman is such an imaginative and authoritative actor that he still manages to find some fresh notes to his performance anyway. And then there's Hilary Swank---another Oscar-winner---who takes a terribly underwritten role---she's basically a device to get Frankie to open up---and injects with as much heart and conviction as she can muster. This may be an even more impressive characterization than her Brandon Teena in BOYS DON'T CRY (the source of her other acting Oscar), since Haggis doesn't really give her much to work with.<br /><br />I give MILLION DOLLAR BABY 3 stars, because, for all of its refreshing simplicity and grace, I find the film to be deeply flawed, with a problematic third act that strikes me as terribly contrived, manipulative, and heavy-handed. And yet, in spite of my reservations, this is perhaps a film worth seeing anyway, since at least the ending does give you something to think about and discuss. If any movie engenders deep discussions about life, death, and love after its over, I suppose it must be doing something right. And maybe the fact that the film forces me to go back and forth in my mind---as I think I've done in this review---means something. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not a masterpiece, but, in its own crude way, it's effective.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The first two acts of "Million Dollar Baby" are perfectly recognizable to fans of sports movies. Once upon a time there was a crotchety old boxing trainer named Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who was running an broken down gym. One day Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks Dunn to train her, but Frankie does not train girls. Maggie sticks around and picks up a few pointers from Eddie "Scarp-Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), another former fighter who cleans up the joint. Eventually Maggie's persistence wears down Frankie, and at the end of the first act he agrees to train her.<br /><br />Remember, he is crotchety and she is stubborn, so the training is problematic. But eventually Maggie starts fighting and the second act moves, as all boxing films must, to the big fight. At that point I was actually thinking of writing a review of "Million Dollar Baby" that would start by rewriting the lyrics to Alice Cooper's "Billion Dollar Babies." Then, we get to the final act, at which point any and all thoughts of being cute with regards to this movie go away. I had heard whispers about the last act, but conveniently forget all about them during the big fight. One of the nice things about the legacy of "Rocky" is that we can never be sure which way these things are going to go (unless, of course, it is a true story).<br /><br />Because "Million Dollar Baby" is about the "freak show" of women boxing the screenplay by Paul Haggis (based on the "Rope Burns" stories of F.X. Toole) gets to have Maggie get really good really fast. Of course she is helped as much by Frankie's wisdom as she is up her ability to hit really hard, but the competition is a lot less than it would be if this was the story of a thirty-something guy trying to become a championship boxer. This is not to be disparaging to the idea, because one of the key subtexts of this story is how the dynamic is changed because Frankie is training a girl, and even if it is laid on thick (he is estranged from his only daughter and her daddy is long dead), Eastwood and Swank make it resonate. The film also avoids conventions and pitfalls by being devoid of the presence of the press (who would have certainly killed the big payoff regarding a key Gaelic phrase).<br /><br />Apparently, Hillary Swank is going to be known as the "All or Nothing Girl," not to mention the bane of Annette Benning's existence, if she wins the Oscar again. Between "Boys Don't Cry" and "Million Dollar Baby," her most notable film was "The Core," but if such drek gives her the money to live on waiting for these choice roles to come along and win Oscars, then that is certainly better than being a one Oscar wonder who gets one fantastic role and then slim pickings for eternity (e.g., Marlee Matlin). Despite her character being burdened by the conventional stereotypes of a white trash background, Swank keeps Maggie from becoming a caricature. Much is made of the fact Swank does all of her own boxing (I like how she keeps her shoulders squared during her fights), but those are not her best acting moments in the film.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson was on the ESPN Hotseat when he was asked how cool he was on a scale of 1 to 10. Jackson said 9, and when asked who was a 10 he immediately said Morgan Freeman. The man has played the President of the United States and God, and in this movie he talks about having holes in his sox in a scene that should be shown to acting students as an textbook example of the art. In the 20th century there were three iconic actors representing three different traditions of acting: Laurence Olivier, Spencer Tracy, and Marlon Brando. Freeman is the living embodiment of the Tracy "know your lines" school of acting. If the award and standing ovation he got from the Screen Actors Guild last week is any indication, then the most respected actor in Hollywood is finally got to win a long overdue Oscar.<br /><br />Swank kept touting this as Eastwood's best performance and in terms of acting it probably qualifies. I still think of Eastwood in "The Bridges of Madison County" as his most engaging performance, and the one most like the actor in real life. But for the most part as an actor Eastwood has moved from the squinting eyes of the Man With No Name to the memorable one-liners of Dirty Harry. In "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby" he gets to move beyond such strictures and if my preference for the latter is because I like Eastwood better as a romantic figure, remember which of his performances I have enjoyed the most.<br /><br />Eastwood won a second Academy Award for directing "Million Dollar Baby," but I think part of this was due to the momentum created by his "Mystic River" from the previous year, which was arguably his most artistic effort as a director.  But that came the year Peter Jackson got his reward for pulling off "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."  Eastwood is clearly an aactor's director with three acting nominations and two wins for "Mystic River" and the same payoff for "Million Dollar Baby."</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>The beginning comes across very slow...a very powerful, emotional movie.

First of all, my expectations were high since this was an Academy Award-winning film.  It started out like many sports movies with a young, unknown athlete (in this case Hillary Swank) who decides that her whole life will be dedicated to winning a championship in her sport.  Her mentor (Clint Eastwood) is a crusty old curmudgeon who keeps telling her that he doesn't coach girls.  When his best fighter leaves him, however, he finds himself with time on his hands and frustration in his heart, and he agrees to train her.  I did not expect the dark turn that the movie takes and I'm not sure what point is being made by the crisis situation.  On the positive side, the characters are real and believable.  It is the situations in which they find themselves that strains credibility.  Morgan Freeman is still able to put his indelible stamp on any movie in which he appears, and I was grateful for his soothing presence amidst the tragedy of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Morgan Freeman narrates this epic of sorts and plays a character that of a one eyed man in this movie.

This movie isn't all about boxing but I must admit it made me want to get myself engaged in it. I know I'll be "Danger" but it's all good intentions here.<br /><br />I didn't know what quite to expect from this film.I must say there were times in this movie when all I could is punch my fist in the air with the kind of raise in moods it gave me.Also there were a few scenes that made me gulp.The subtely with which the characters are introduced is pretty good.It explores two different realms in life.<br /><br />You really want to believe everything Morgan Freeman says.He's more than a good man.Hollywood can try but can not find a man better than him to replace the character he played.

To see her knock out the opposition was enough for me to feel gallops of adrenaline run through me.<br /><br />THe last 30 mins caused unavoidable heartache. They made the film more believable than it already seemed. Morgan Freeman in the last words he says to Clint Eastwood sums up quite a lot. I won't go into details cause I realise there are some people who haven't seen it yet.Million Dollar Baby is a movie I'll derive another meaning out of with every second watch.<br /><br />The one punch line and dialogue I do remember from this film is what Morgan Freeman uses to describe Maggie.Now this has been said before , sung before but never quite put in the way it was in this film.<br /><br />"It's the magic of risking everything to see a dream nobody sees...but you"</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I read somewhere where Eastwood said that he at first had not considered acting in this movie, but he sort of decided at the last minute to cast himself...if true good move Clint.  The part was tailor made for him as were the parts played by Swank and Freeman.  Eastwood at times makes his movies too long, like in the case of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, but he paces this one perfectly.  The chemistry between he and Swank is touching and real, which is why the ending resonates so strongly.  Late in the film when he finally tells Swank what her nickname he has given her means, Eastwood puts you right next to the actors and you feel like you should look away because this is such a private, intimate moment, honestly if it does not bring a tear to your eye you need to get thee immediately to a cardiologist to see if you have a heart.  Great film very deserving of all the Oscars, though I think Eastwood should have gotten the best actor award as well, this is his best performance to date...hey Clint how about another Dirty Harry.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) has a dream to be a professional boxer.  She seeks out gym owner Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to be her trainer.  He quickly turns her down because he doesn't train girls and she is too old anyway.  Of course, Maggie is determined, and with the help of Frankie's long-time friend Eddie Dupris (Freeman), she is able to win him over in a weak moment.  Soon, with Frankie's training, Maggie finds herself winning match after match.<br /><br />A strong father-daughter relationship develops between the two.  Maggie's dad is dead, and Frankie's daughter will not speak to him.  The relationship is a second chance for both, and is the emotional core of the movie.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has crafted yet another fine movie with "Million Dollar Baby".  There is more to it than a first glance would lead you to believe, and even if it is manipulative at times, it is done so well that it is not a detriment.  The trio of actors that are the core of the movie are amazing both alone and together.  The ease with wich Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman interact is so real that you will feel drawn to them, faults and all.  This is a great boxing movie, perhaps the best since the original "Rocky", but "Million Dollar Baby" is about more than just boxing.  To share more than this would be to spoil a movie that deserves a fresh viewing, but let's just say that the final act of the movie has another focus that is thought provoking.<br /><br />This is a movie that will give you something to think about and debate for long after you leave the theater.  "Million Dollar Baby" is more than the sum of its parts, and is well deserving of the Oscar nominations that have been heaped on it.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>"Million Dollar Baby" is a great, no-frills, to-the-gut movie. It's not just about boxing, despite what you may think after seeing the trailer, and it's not about the twist ending, though the movie is better if you don't know what's coming at the end. It's tightly made, carries a hell of an impact and features some of the best acting you're likely to see onscreen this year.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances in years - if not his best ever - as Frankie Dunn, a grizzled boxing coach so beaten up by life that he refuses to allow his contending fighters to take any risks or any chances. Frankie counsels his fighters to approach a title bout with the sort of reluctance and pre-destined disappointment that he applies to his entire life. He goes to church every week, but he's a guilt-ridden skeptic, not really a believer. He wants a relationship with his daughter, but she has made it abundantly clear that she wants nothing to do with him. Given any number of opportunities, he's taken none of them. Frankie runs a gym with his closest friend Scrap Iron (Morgan Freeman), who used to be one of Frankie's boxers until he lost an eye.<br /><br />Into Frankie's life comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress who wants to be a boxer even though she has no training, is a bit out-of-shape and is way too old to start a serious career.<br /><br />For the first half of the film, it does follow the formula of a "boxing movie;" however, these characters are fleshed-out and real, and the movie is more about following dreams that only you can see and rising above the circumstances that you're presented with. The last portion of the film is about how life, even when it's sweet, can be desperately unfair.<br /><br />The movie's heartbreaking, compelling and grand. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Though 'Million Dollar Baby' features a detemined boxer Maggie, who starts her career at the age of 31, the film is not about the sports itself; boxing is only a metaphor for life, and you can easily find that out after seeing what happens to three main characters<br /><br />The film is about these people -- hardened ex-boxing trainer Frankie, retired boxer Eddie (who lost sight of one of his eyes), and Maggie for whom boxing is all she's got.  They are played by Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman respectively, and they all deserve the awards and praises they have already got, for what they have done as real professional actors.  In short, their acting is simply great.<br /><br />Don't follow the story.  Some people, quite understandably, thought that this is a female version of 'Rocky.'  Don't get me wrong here, for to me 'Rocky' is also one of the greatest films ever made.  To those who expect 'Rocky'-type story, some part of 'Million Dollar Baby' might be depressing, especially when the film ends in an unexpected way.  But remember, Rocky in fact didn't win the bout (Apollo did), but you know that is not the point.  The point is, like star Stallone himself, it was a do-or-die project, and he did it.<br /><br />And boxing is the do-or-die project for Maggie, and you will know that at the end of the film.  You will get to know the believable characters (including the ones who hang around the old boxing gym), and the film slowly reveals the life of them on screen.<br /><br />The slow-moving pace of the film may not appeal to you.  Actually, some might find part of the film a bit dull.  I did, but I also know this is a kind of film in which you have to keep the same pace with the realistic characters because in reality things just don't happen so fast.  Then, after leaving the theater, the images of Maggie and Frankie will remain with you.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>On paper, Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' doesn't sound like anything special. The tale of a tough girl from a white-trash background who persuades a reluctant trainer to teach her the ropes and rises from nobody to champion in double-quick time. You might think this is just another triumph-against-the-odds movie to file alongside the likes of 'Rocky', but you'd be wrong. Thanks to a strong screenplay, subtle direction and a trio of flawless performances, 'Million Dollar Baby' is much more than just another boxing film. In fact, it's one of the most impressive and emotionally involving films that Eastwood has yet made.<br /><br />Eastwood himself takes the role of Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck former boxing manager who now trains fighters a small, ramshackle gym. Frankie's right-hand man is Scrap(Morgan Freeman), who used to be a boxer before he lost an eye in the ring. One night, as Frankie is heading home from a match, he is approached by a young woman named Maggie(Hilary Swank). She believes she has what it takes to be a boxer despite her inexperience and the fact that she's already 31 years old. Frankie doesn't train girls, and he ignores her requests, but she's soon turning up at the gym every day and he can see that she's got something special. He agrees to be her trainer and it's not long before she's knocking out a series of opponents in the first round.<br /><br />A championship bout is on the horizon for Maggie, and the film seems set for a predictable climax. But after remarkable turn of events, we are hurled into a totally different movie, a much darker and more complex film than we've been watching for the past 90 minutes.<br /><br />Superbly adapted by Paul Haggis from FX O'Toole's short story collection 'Rope Burns', 'Million Dollar Baby' is a film that, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, may have slipped into melodrama or mawkish sentimentality. No chance of that here, with Eastwood's intelligent, sparse direction focused on character and story above all else. Eastwood shrouds the film in shadows and drains it of colour, until it's almost like watching a black-and-white film; Eastwood is using light and dark as an expression of the human condition and sometimes it's hard to see the actor's faces which makes the words they say take on extra resonance. Morgan Freeman's narration gives events the feel of a fable and it's impossible not to be drawn into the story and to care deeply about the characters involved.<br /><br />The three main cast members all turn in first-rate performances too. Hilary Swank, who has dropped off the radar since 'Boys Don't Cry', returns with an even better display than the one which won her an Academy Award. She takes a character who could amount to little more than a bunch of clich&eacute;s and invests her with so much heart and determination that most audience members will be rooting for her to make it. It's a gutsy, brave performance and her efforts are complemented by he co-stars. Morgan Freeman's part is hardly a stretch for him, the kind of wise compassionate character he's played numerous times before, but he is typically superb in the role.<br /><br />However, the real surprise is Eastwood himself who gives the best performance of his career. Frankie is a great character, a rugged, tough exterior disguising his big heart and humanity, and Eastwood is heartbreakingly powerful in the role. His developing bond with Maggie is convincing and never overplayed, likewise his enjoyable repartee with Freeman, and these three characters form the heart and soul of the movie.<br /><br />But if there is a flaw in 'Million Dollar Baby', it's the fact the the same care and attention hasn't been spent on the supporting characters. In particular, Maggie's monstrous trailer-trash family are all so one-dimensional that they stick out like sore thumbs when held against the subtle characterisations of the leading trio. The supporting cast elsewhere are also underdeveloped, and it's a misjudgment to have Jay Baruchel provide the gym's 'comic relief' as incompetent boxer Danger.<br /><br />However, it's easy to ignore minor flaws because this is such a wonderful film. Eastwood has proved himself as one of the finest American filmmakers and, in his 75th year, shows no signs of slowing down. 'Million Dollar Baby' is a haunting love story, a deceptively simple character study and a serious analysis of faith and redemption all at once. If you don't see it because you think it's 'just another sports film' then you'll be missing out on one of the most beautifully crafted and deeply moving dramas of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Hilary Swank must be making many Hollywood starlets very jealous.  Swank does not have stunning good looks and is not glamourous.  But she has raw talent, put to good use in Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />Swank is so perfect for the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, an over-thirty wanna-be boxer.  Maggie is alone in the world, without a penny to her name.  She comes from a white trash background.  Maggie is set on getting Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to train her.  Dunn is aghast at the idea of training a GIRL.  But Dunn has many sad things troubling him.  His only friends are Scrap (Morgan Freeman) and Father Horvak, a priest who is so irritated by Dunn's irreverence that he cusses like a sailor.<br /><br />The settings of the film are dreary, dingy, depressing, and grimy.  The story is awash in hopelessness; that is what makes Million Dollar Baby seem grim.  Million Dollar Baby is a bit depressing and over the top in some places. You can't honestly believe Maggie's mother and family would be THAT bad.  They are almost caricatures of themselves, not really believable.  But if you look under the surface, you will see that some hope lingers in the hearts of Scrap and Maggie.  Ultimately, a spark is fired in Dunn.  Will the spark last?  That is a turning point in the film, which makes it a rare film of unusual quality.  I have not seen a film with such non-showy integrity since Slingblade.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I'm almost tempted to say Hillery Swank deserved this oscar, not only because she played her role so perfectly, but because her character was so moving...but that's just really good writing.  Hillery Swank is a gem in the film industry.  She puts herself completely into her role, pulling every ounce of life she can out of herself and spills it onto the screen.  This film as a whole was splendedly done and well worth the oscar buzz.  I would recomend this film to anyone.  Great father-daughter movie.  Be prepared to cry.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>Let's make it clear up front -- there is no working director/actor more in command of his art than Clint Eastwood.  He proves it again with Million Dollar Baby, whose plot line is well-known enough to not need repeating here.<br /><br />With each scene, Eastwood moves his story forward.  Nothing feels forced or faked up for greater emotional intensity.  Even the controversial twist, a melodramatic moment if there ever was one, is not overdone, although in its use of slow-mo it recalls a key scene in In the Line of Fire where, of course, Eastwood acted but did not direct.<br /><br />The boxing action is tough and authentic; every character, with the slight exception of Maggie's obnoxious family, lives as an individual, not a cliche.  Eastwood has this old-fashioned idea that if you have a story, characters with ideas, and, yes, values, you don't need glitz, noise or other attention-grabbing filler.  As with Mystic River, check out the color that Eastwood uses to set each scene and the overall mood of the film.  Also as with Mystic River, the characters grapple with everyman's eternal issues, loyalty, love, friendship, loss, guilt, and a search for meaning against the terrifying suspicion that it may not exist.<br /><br />On that controversial twist: the criticism being rained on Eastwood from various quarters is completely unwarranted.  As he himself has said in interviews, he is not making a generalized statement of a position; he is showing how one person struggles with and resolves a terrible situation.  It's an individual's choice in a story; it's not a paradigm or meant to advocate.<br /><br />Haven't mentioned the acting, but we're talking Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint himself.  As they used to say in Marvel Comics, 'nuff said.<br /><br />I do have two nitpicks -- Maggie won her fight since her opponent would certainly have been DQ'ed for her action and Morgan Freeman's voiceover narration is used too frequently, especially early on.  Actually, I have a third too, but that would give away a key plot element more than I already have.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby, though I slightly prefer the somber power of Mystic River, is simply superb.  If it loses the Academy Award for Best Picture to a bio pic -- however, well done -- about a boring billionaire, there is no justice.  But then that's one of Clint's eternal themes, isn't it?</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I was enthusiastic about renting this movie, but the realization<br />was less original or provoking than I thought.  First of all, the movie is good, and Clint and Morgan are great as they almost always are.  Here are the problems.  The boxing story is not original, it is essentially the Rocky story until after the climax. Also, the dialogue, although good, is over-the-top or just trying too hard sometimes, especially the voice over, which tries to heighten the circumstances or make things profound, but often comes off more artificial than natural.<br />I also thought the returned letters were straight out of Forest Gump, another thing that struck me as unoriginal.  Also, the lighting, which is strong and sometimes breath-taking, often is done at the expense of the story.  For instance the car ride scene, has very interesting (although unnatural) effects, but to such an extent that one hardly pays attention to what is spoken. Also, it's not very plausible that Clint, in a dirty old inner city gym, gets not one but two talented atheletes that get title shots.  Worse than that, the climax scene with the dirty boxer isn't even plausible, there is no way she is sanctioned to fight and especially not allowed to continue her match after the violations that occur.  It was more like WWF than boxing. The whole ending was touching I guess, but nothing remarkable.  Also, the red neck stereotype was overdone, and Swank's whole relation with her family was summed up in cute soundbites. Although it is a fine movie with some brilliant flourishes, it is too standard and flawed to be considered great in any sense.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>It is somewhat amusing to read some of the criticisms of the movie on here.... some criticize Eastwood's "Right Wing Conservative politics" in the film, while just as many complain that he is pushing "liberal values"... makes you wonder how many people still form their own opinions and views on things today and how many are simply programmed by the media to express the views they have.<br /><br />The film was well done overall despite it's predictability and overshadows of "Shawshank Redemption" stylization.<br /><br />In fact is it interesting to see the same formula Clint has used in his last 5 films.... he has a certain 5-point formula he has used identically in Unforgiven and all his other recent films.<br /><br />But it is a formula that works for him.<br /><br />This is worth seeing but it not the sort of DVD I would add to my collection to watch over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>It is exciting to watch a filmmaker at the height of their powers tell a moving, memorable story.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" is such an example of this.<br /><br />Frankie Frank (Clint Eastwood), a former boxer, now owns a rundown gym in downtown Los Angeles and trains hopeful boxers on the side. He handpicks the boxers, coaxing them, bringing them up through the ranks slowly. Too slowly for his current prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who jumps ship just before his big chance at the championship. Watching all of this, with a knowing eye, is Eddie Scrap - Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Eddie is a former boxer who was once trained by Frank. Now, he manages Frank's gym for him. One day, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) walks into the gym and starts training. She asks Frank to become her trainer. Initially, he turns her down, using her age and lack of experience as reasons. As Maggie proves she is determined to become a boxer, Frank gives in to her requests and becomes her mentor.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is a film about boxers. It is not a film about boxing. The story revolves around the three main characters and their relationships with one another. Boxing occasionally happens, it is Maggie's goal to become a boxer, so the film is going to have some scenes involving a ring and gloves.<br /><br />Hillary Swank is amazing as Maggie. She loses herself in the character, showing Maggie's drive and determination as the character struggles to make ends meet working a job as a waitress on Venice Beach. There are probably more scenes of Maggie working, riding the bus, counting pennies, eating leftover scraps, and training then there are of actual boxing matches. As Maggie struggles with her long days, Swank doesn't let the character slow down or become depressed. This is her dream, and probably her only shot at getting out of the gutter. Every little step towards this goal makes her happy.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is also great as the older, perhaps wiser, boxer who watches Frank's gym. He and Frank are friends, Frank was a trainer late in Eddie's career. But their relationship is more than friendship. Now, Eddie is more of the mentor to Frank's character, roles that were previously reversed. Freeman's portrayal of this character is very quiet, but it works perfectly. This man has seen a lot and doesn't have a lot. He doesn't mind sharing his thoughts. He pushes Frank to take Maggie on as a student and also becomes emotionally invested in her fate.<br /><br />The weak link in the trio is Eastwood. He does a great job with the direction of the film, but Eastwood has difficulty convincing me that he is anyone other than Eastwood. He is a bit like Gary Cooper or John Wayne now. He is, perhaps, too iconic for us to forget that we are ever watching Eastwood play a character. That isn't to say that his character isn't intensely interesting and very real. Frank frequently visits the local church seeking guidance from the Father. He's been going every day for years and he and the father have a prickly relationship. Frank likes to goad him on and the Father is frankly tired of him. This relationship pays off extremely well during the course of the film. The relationship between Frank and Maggie grows until we feel that they share real admiration for one another.<br /><br />The other regulars of the gym are not quite as believable. One character, in particular, sticks out like a sore thumb. A skinny red neck seems to be involved for comic relief and it isn't needed.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a masterful director. Intent on letting scenes unfold at their natural pace, his films seem all the more real. He doesn't bother with special effects or car chases (anymore) and the story benefits from it. His last few films have explored the main characters, creating rich stories that really move the viewer.<br /><br />The film was written by Paul Haggis. Haggis is the creator of one of my favorite television series of all time, the little scene `EZ Streets', a cop drama from the mid 90s that was cancelled after a few seasons. It is easy to see his touch on this film. In both stories, he creates rich believable characters that make each seem real, moving and powerful.<br /><br />I can't recommend "Million Dollar Baby" enough. If you miss it, you will miss one of the best dramas to grace the silver screen in the last few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>Great movie! Is it perfect? No...<br /><br />However, the movie had really good character development<br />and while it started out as a boxing movie, it became alot<br />more in the second half of the movie. Then it really hits<br />you what the movie is all about. Clint and Maggie become<br />so close and it seems as time passes by Clint starts to<br />forget about the real daughter that ignores him and Maggy<br />starts to become his daughter. It's about a relationship<br />and a womans will to do more than what is expected of her.<br /><br />Now, I think Clints problems with his daughter could possibly<br />have been brought to more light and perhaps Maggie winning<br />so easy throughout was alittle overdone... Also, the ending<br />can be argued as if it's right or wrong. But I believe these<br />are things that can be looked over.<br /><br />The movie delivered without using B movie clich&eacute;'s and un<br />needed music to help provide drama. It felt real and every<br />body in the movie done a good job. It's hard to do the<br />second half without getting overdramtic, but Clint managed<br />to do it.<br /><br />Oh, and for the guy... below... This movie is much better<br />than action flick Dirty Harry. Sorry. People need to realize<br />that Clint is doing different things now. It's ashame that<br />some of his older fans have tried to pigeon hole him as a<br />cowboy or action star. Those days are most likely over and<br />you need to realize that.<br /><br />Some of the reviews here are just moronic. Some complaining<br />because it doesn't have a happy ending. Personally, I'm<br />alittle tired the endless movies were everything and everyone<br />is happy. Those movies come a dime a dozen and several come<br />out every year. Not need to take moronic jabs at this one<br />for actually being different.<br /><br />We also have people complaining about the extra features.<br />Those are just freakin icing on the cake. So what if they<br />aren't great... Who buys a DVD for the extra features any<br />way? Sheesh! I can understand the ones that complain about<br />the ending, but these other people complaining about things<br />of such little importance are morons.<br /><br />Another Rocky? This movie takes a crap all over any of the<br />predictable feel good Rocky movies.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Hilary Swank won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, woman boxer, in this outstanding movie directed and produced by Clint Eastwood.  Her first was for Boys Don't Cry (1999).  It's clear she put a lot of work into the part and was outstanding and clearly deserved the award.  The movie is one of Clint Eastwood's best.  I would not however recommend that everybody see this.  The latter part of the movie is brutal and the ending is not pretty.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman as Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, a tough-as-nails veteran of 109 fights and owner of only one working eye, narrates part of the action as the jack of all duties at the Hit Pit Gym for boxing hopefuls run by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood).  Scrap is addressing somebody.  At the end of the film we find out who (but of course I can't say).  This is a nice touch that adds some depth to the theme of the movie which is the love that exists (or should) between a father and a daughter.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays the father figure to Swank's irrepressible Maggie, ambitious trailer trash girl with a heart as strong as a bull.  Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a deeply troubled man who is continually writing to his daughter only to have the letters always come back unopened with the words "Return to Sender" on them.  Apparently Frankie did something so bad that his daughter will no longer have anything to do with him.  I didn't notice that we ever find out what this something was, but it doesn't matter.  Frankie's character is such that we forgive him even if his daughter doesn't.<br /><br />The story starts out like any one of a hundred Hollywood fight movies with the difference being the boxer is a woman.  But the story does not end like a "Rocky" contrivance.  Instead Eastwood and Paul Higgis, who wrote the heart-wrenching script, opt for a kind of stark realism that will not please some people.  There is the sense that this could really happen and is the kind of tragedy that Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists would appreciate.<br /><br />But the tragedy is not Maggie Fitzgerald's alone.  It is also Frankie's.  And it is Scrap-Iron's as well.  If only Frankie had not trained her.  If only Scrap-Iron had gone to Vegas for the title fight and been in her corner.  If only Scrap-Iron had not encouraged Maggie.  "If only," like so much of life, has no meaning after the fact of what actually happens.  Scrap wants to believe that Maggie was the better for having really lived and had a chance at a great personal triumph; and even Maggie herself seems to at least want to believe that.  Frankie however is clearly not in agreement.<br /><br />At the end Frankie, who is a lifelong Catholic who goes to church every Sunday and is looking for the meaning of life, must face a terrible dilemma.  Maggie asks him to do something that he cannot do, that goes against his religion.  Yet he feels he must do it.<br /><br />How one interprets the ending--did he do the right thing?--may very well determine whether one likes the film or not.  His moral dilemma is very real and I, for one, cannot say what I would have done in his situation, and so for me the horns of the dilemma are very sharp indeed.<br /><br />I quit watching boxing on TV many years ago because of the way the fights excite the blood, since the point of a boxing match is to make the opponent helpless.  I don't like feeling like that.  This movie, in a way, perhaps accidentally, comes to the same end as many a fight: the winner goes on to another fight, and to an eventual loss, while the loser is made helpless.<br /><br />Some people might be wondering what the message here is.  I'm not sure, but I can tell you this: Shakespeare essentially said there is no message.  Life is a tale told by an idiot...in the end signifying nothing.  And the existentialists will tell you that life has no meaning except that which we ourselves bestow upon it.  I guess Scrap is the existentialist and Frankie the Shakespearean.<br /><br />And who is Maggie?  And who is everywoman and everyman?</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Joe(Eastwood)is a cut man, he has been old school even when the new school was in, He owns a boxing gym, and he has lost his best fighter.

She is full of determination and she works hard for Joe. He gets her a title fight, and then a tragic accident occurs, and Joe has to do something that is not what he wants to do.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a master director. He can be compared to Martin Scorsase, Stanley Kurbrick, and whoever else, and hold his own with them. I loved Morgan Freeman in this, I felt this was his best work since The Shawnshank Redemption and Unforgiven. The newcomer to the bunch, Hilary Swank, pulls off a stunningly powerful performance and deserves a oscar for it. The film itself, is a beautiful, and astonishing masterwork. Clint Eastwood's direction is brillant, He can really get the best out of his actors.<br /><br />I really liked this film, and I hope to enjoy it in the future. It was one of the best of last year, and it deserves any oscars or awards that it gets because it rightfully deserves them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I'm reviewing this movie again, as I just deleted the last one which was bombarded with "unhelpful" votes. It seems that the point I was trying to make has been missed for the most part, so I'll try and reiterate.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie from the point of view of acting, direction, and script, and as I predicted it did of course win 4 oscars recently, to rubberstamp that viewpoint, most desevedly and notably for Hilary Swanks incredible performance.<br /><br />All that said however, the movie is slow to start, often plodding in dialogue and continuity in places, and regardless of how masterfully portrayed, it's a very depressing picture. As previously stated, Eastwood has of late immersed his directing (and acting talents here) into the stark realities of human nature in their most raw and naked state, arguably having a free reign like most other renowned directors, by not being entrenched in hollywood "crowd pleasers" as if caring less about the financial success or failure of the picture at the box office.<br /><br />Clint plays Frankie Dunn, a long time boxing manager and expert corner man "from the old days" as narrated by Morgan Freeman who is desperately embittered with an approaching old age laced with regret and emotional torment. His current title hope ditches him for a high flying competitor, his estranged daughter returns all of his letters unopened, his priest admonishes his cantankorous debating, and Freeman is an uneasy friend/employee and former talent who was blinded in one eye after his last fight (something which Frankie also blames himself for). Enter Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald, a 30 something down to earth woman encumbered with a past of zero opportunity, and humble but tangible dreams, despite her trailer park family ties. Her desire to follow her dreams to box, and her tenacity and stubborness eventually win over Frankie who decides to train her after initially refusing several times, and against his better judgement. What follows is a symbiotic relationship on which both characters thrive, she becoming a surrogate for his own estranged daughter, and he a surrogate for her dead father whom she admired and misses terribly.<br /><br />The movie turns from this point into a rags to riches to rags picture, with a sombre tone that whilst being absorbing actually leaves you feeling pretty miserable. I'm not criticizing the flavor of the film, but even the most ardent of human drama fans will find the lack of ANY levity to be amiss. Combining euthenasia into the story adds more fuel to the sobriety of everything, and regardless of your political or moral affiliations on the subject, most will agree that too many plot holes, and unlikely inconsistencies make the ending seem unecessarily protracted.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of Eastwood, both as an actor and director, and have seen most, if not all of his movies, and rarely have a bad word to say, because even the most sombre of topics has been balanced, lifted where necessary, or even had funny moments. "Lightening" the subject does not mean that the viewer will take the subject  lightly, and although a movie does not have to be a comedy to be entertaining, it shouldn't be morose either. Like Mystic River before this, Clint has proved he can handle some thorny issues with as much mastery as a western or any other genre, just from a strictly personal point of view however I think the lighter side of his talents would be most welcome in his next project.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>MILLION DOLLAR BABY  is quite simply one of the most moving experiences captured on film to be released in a long time.  By now everyone knows the story (or at least the first two thirds of the story) and while 'yet another film about boxing' may have kept some viewers away from this movie originally, the recent controversy about the last third of the film's message should certainly breakdown the resistance of the remaining population.  This is a film that should almost be required viewing - on many levels.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood deserves all the kudos mounting around his direction and acting and courage to put this compilation of stories by FX Toole as written for the screen by Paul Haggis on celluloid.  Eastwood's "look" (color made to seem almost black and white by his choices of strong light and shadow throughout) fits this microcosm of the down and out in the dregs of Los Angeles gyms and allows the redemptive powers of the individual soul to gleam.<br /><br />As Frankie Dunn, Eastwood is an old has been boxing trainer who lives a quiet life in his rundown gym writing to his long lost daughter (his letters are always returned unopened), attending mass trying to make sense of an irrational universe, and supporting young wannabe boxers, afraid to take them to the 'big fight'.  He is aided by an old one-eyed boxer custodian, his longtime friend Scrap Iron (Morgan Freeman). Into this milieu steps Maggie (Hilary Swank), a trailer park trash 31 year old waitress who has placed all her dreams of rising out of her status by having Frankie train her to be a prize fighting boxer.  Frankie refuses, Maggie is quietly persistent, and Scrap is supportive,  until events occur that result in his taking Maggie on as a  boxer.<br /><br />From that point Maggie and Frankie and Scrap form a warm trio of hope and work and Maggie slowly and surprisingly quickly is readied for a big fight.  The outcome of that fight changes all the characters, but those changes, as devastating as they are, open doors of redemption.  This journey out of meaningless existence into the aura of human compassion is magnificently written, acted, molded and photographed and is destined to be film footage that burns its impression onto the minds of every person who experiences this film.  Saying more is unnecessary.<br /><br />Grady Harp, February 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's breakthrough came through Sergio Leone in the 60s where he acted as a cool killer with exceptional precision shooting people.  Eastwood's precision never changed as he continued to act and began shooting his own films, which includes mysterious Westerns such as the High Plains Drifter (1974) to geriatric cowboys in Unforgiven (1992).  Unforgiven is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of the 90s.  This politically active actor and director has also made films about Charlie Parker, proud Marines, stealthy thieves, and childhood tragedies.  Several of Eastwood's films have received Oscar nominations in many categories as did Mystic River (2003), which was considered one of the best films of 2003.  Nonetheless, it seems as if Eastwood has searched within himself through decades of experience and wisdom, as he has found something special that can be seen most recently in Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />Ding, the bell sounds, as the first round commences where two fighters stare down each other's eyes while instinctively attempting to dance the boxers tap to sweet victory.  Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) knows everything there is about the boxers tap, as he routinely utters, "You have to protect yourself" with his hoarse voice.  It is in the ring where Frankie is most comfortable, which has always been regarded as a mans world to him.  In addition, Frankie has acquired this knowledge of boxing through years of training and observing a mass of fighters loosing and winning, but also seeing many of them get seriously hurt.<br /><br />When Frankie does not coach his boxers, he studies Gaelic, reads Yates, and dwells on the many mysteries of life.  Through attending daily masses, Frankie questions his faith, but also harasses the Priest with annoying questions.  However, it seems as if Frankie is stuck in his own-trained mentality as he instinctively does what he teaches, defending oneself, as some say it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  Yet, this old dog, Frankie that is, seeks continuously new knowledge, but never seems to progress with wisdom as his defensive instincts prevent him from reaching greater wisdom.<br /><br />Frankie's defensive instincts seem to prevent him from taking on female fighters and training them as he trains males.  It also seems as if Frankie perceives women, or as he refers to the women, girls, as too weak and not fit to fight.  This male chauvinistic approach that Frankie has could have caused him difficulty in his past, as he has a daughter with whom he cannot communicate.  When someone asks Frankie about his daughter it appears as if he tries to avoid it, yet being truthful, as he gives quick responses and smiles.  Frankie's behavior in regards to his daughter gives an impression that he tries to protect himself.<br /><br />Despite what Frankie's instincts say, he meets a girl, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), that is particularly hardheaded about having him as her coach, and he ends up training her.  Initially, Maggie asks Frankie whether he is interested in training her to which he responds, "I don't train girls".  Maggie does not seem to be discouraged as she joins Frankie's gym, pursuing her dream, as Frankie continuously reminds her that he does not coach girls.  This bickering  between Maggie and Frankie continues until Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a retired boxer and friend of Frankie, recognizes Maggie's tremendous intrinsic drive and determination.  Despite Frankie's directions not to help Maggie, Scrap, who lives and works in the gym, offers her some small tips on how to box, which results in improvement.  When Maggie displays her progress it leads to a small discussion between her and Frankie in which he offers to help her until she can get a manager of her own.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby could in many aspects be compared to other boxing films such as Rocky (1976), Girlfight (2000), Raging Bull (1980), and Champ (1979). However, it does not focus on boxing, but rather the characters and their decisions in life.  The training of Maggie brings both Frankie and her on a soul searching journey as they travel to visit her family, across Europe, and to a shot for the world title.  However, the fight scenes do not become an overburden of desire to win glory, money, or a title.  Instead Maggie boxes to display her respect and loyalty to Frankie, which guides them into a long and painful exploration as they get closer to one another.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood lays down the six shooter from his past as his marksmanship aims for empathy and poignant solution.  The empathetic feeling in Million Dollar Baby could be tough on the audience as it could be emotionally and physically draining, in some aspects, and it could feel as if the audience fought a 15 round match and lost.  Under the direction of Eastwood the cast performs exceptionally as they supported each other and stand out by themselves.  The cinematography interestingly uses plenty of shadows in order to enhance the drama within each scene, which is something that Eastwood is known to do on occasion.  Ultimately, the audience will have experienced brilliant cinema, which offers much to ponder while recovering from the punches of Eastwood's brilliant direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>No doubt about it. This film certainly did deserve every academy award it walked away with.  Clearly, it is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It certainly is sad though.  And so I don't think I'd recommend it to everybody.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has emerged as a new film icon.  He's 75, an age when most actors are quietly moving out of the public eye.  But he is at the top of his game and it's getting better and better.  He's perfect in the role as the fight manager who reluctantly agrees to train Hilary Swank and then connects with her in with a very special kind of bond.  Perhaps though, it is his role as a director that should win him the honors.  Every scene rings true, and the film techniques which use shadows so dark that occasionally the only light is on the perspiration on a actor's face, work well.  It's not overdone but it certainly adds to the atmosphere of the story.<br /><br />Hillary Swank is one of the finest actors I've ever seen. She immediately endears herself to the audience as the trailer trash waitress who dreams of becoming a boxer.  She has a special way of smiling and of showing determination on her face that is completely her own.  And Clint Eastwood brings out the best of her.  Then there is Morgan Freeman as the former boxer who works at the gym and who encourages Eastwood to train Swank.  His role calls for wisdom as well as the angst of losing an eye in his final boxing match many years before.  His presence adds character to every scene he's in.<br /><br />Some of this film is hard to watch, but it's certainly worth it.  It's more than just a boxing story.  It raises some serious questions of right and wrong and personal responsibility.  I will be thinking about it for a long time.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>Wow! I just seen this film on PPV and all I have to say is AMAZING! Brillantly thought out, well-acted, realistic, and dramatic!<br /><br /> Maggie is a woman who dreams of becoming a boxer. Her family is struggling, her brother's in jail, her dad's dead, and her mom is a lazy fat oaf. Boxing trainer Frankie Dunn doesn't want to train a girl, but Maggie's pretty damn stubborn and eventually he agrees to. They form quite a tight bond, and she becomes a great female boxer. But soon something tragic happens [I won't tail!] and Frankie has to make a decision that might change his life.<br /><br /> This film is not for people of faint heart, nor is it for people who want happy endings. It's a brutal, hard, and crafted work of art that you must see. It deserves all the Awards it got!</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The gifted Clint Eastwood once again proves his mettle as an outstanding director as evidenced by his spectacular and moving flick "Million Dollar Baby".<br /><br />Eastwood a crusty, curmudgeonly owner of a boxing gym and trainer reluctantly takes an unpolished Hilary Swank under his tutelage.  Swank, utterly fantastic in her portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald, a dirt poor trailer park denizen of southwestern Missouri is desperate to hone her pugilistic skills.  Eastwood assisted in his gym by the accomplished Morgan Freeman a washed up ex pug who serves as Clint's conscience.  Eastwood is finally cajoled into taking the determined Swank under his wing.  So begins a special relationship between Eastwood and Swank.  Eastwood finds in Swank, the daughter figure he lacks due to his unexplained estrangement from his own daughter.  Swank, close with her now deceased father, but distant from her self centered and dysfunctional hillbilly family looks at Eastwood as a paternal figure.<br /><br />Rising through the ranks and with hard work, Swank is elevated in stature to be deserving of a shot at the woman's world welterweight boxing championship.  At the pinnacle of her fame tragedy strikes.  What follows is an profound and emotional exploration into the psychology of interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />Kudos to Eastwood, Swank and Freeman for superlative acting performances in what could conceivably be the top picture of the year again under Eastwood's capable direction.  Morgan Freeman's soothing baritone narration of the flick was outstanding.  The boxing sequences were brutal and extremely authentic.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood truly made a Great film that dealt with so many topics&themes. Hillary Swank did a great job as did Morgan FreeMan.the film is very touching&it touches on many aspects of Family Life. it centers around the Boxing Ring,but it goes beyond that. this was far&away the best overall film that I saw last year&It really hits home.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>This is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, played masterfully by Hillary Swank, who enjoys boxing and wants a shot at the title.  What sets Maggie apart is described as her "heart" or her eagerness to win and inability to step down.<br /><br />Directed and also starring Clint Eastwood, he plays boxing coach Frankie Dunn, who at first vows to never teach Maggie (due to the fact she is a girl) but then caves upon the pressure of her persistence.<br /><br />This also has Morgan Freeman in the supporting role as Eddie Dupris who is Frankie's best friend and right-hand man in everything.  He also narrates the movie.<br /><br />These three actors have fantastic chemistry.  They worked well together and hope that many academy awards (next week) are awarded to them for what they have pulled together.  They didn't go for cheap laughs and high costing special effects and this turned out to be a fantastic movie.<br /><br />Fantastic... until the end.  The problem with the this movie is that the main character, Maggie, goes against her nature.  In the end, she turns out to be a quitter.<br /><br />Also, it is hard to believe that a movie could be made like this after what happened to Christopher Reeves and his overwhelming determination.<br /><br />So, if you love fantastic acting then you've got to check out this movie.  However, be prepared for the last third of the movie.  It made me disappointed (and I dropped two stars because of it).</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's acting is in line with his other recent films, which is good, and they show his maturing.

Check out the extra-features undercard: An embarrassing roundtable session with Eastwood and his stars; a leftover promo piece; talking-head bits with the producers; and a trailer. It adds up to about an hour of extras -- a puny showing for any major film on DVD, much less the most honored movie of the year. Feel free to throw beer and popcorn.<br /><br />As for the main event, there's still reason to cheer: "Million Dollar Baby" looks and sounds like, well, a million bucks. The film's flat color scheme comes across suitably downbeat with its queasy greens, pale blues and nicotine grays. The widescreen images unspool in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), as shot. The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio delivers the body blows with authority; the subwoofer shovels out foreboding and menace. The surround arena seems mostly abandoned until the big fight scenes, when it comes to life with a jolt. There is no DTS option.<br /><br />The extras deliver almost nothing on how the boxing was shot or staged -- a shame because this "Baby" delivered some of the most visceral fight scenes since "Raging Bull." (MGM's recent DVD of "Raging Bull" got it right, with exhaustive breakdowns of Robert De Niro's bouts.)<br /><br />Those seeking an old-fashioned boxing drama that refuses to be tied up by sentiment are directed to Robert Wise's 1949's "The Set-Up," released last summer by Warner.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The first two acts of "Million Dollar Baby" are perfectly recognizable to fans of sports movies.  Once upon a time there was a crotchety old boxing trainer named Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who was running an broken down gym.  One day Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks Dunn to train her, but Frankie does not train girls.  Maggie sticks around and picks up a few pointers from Eddie "Scarp-Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), another former fighter who cleans up the joint.  Eventually Maggie's persistence wears down Frankie, and at the end of the first act he agrees to train her.<br /><br />Remember, he is crotchety and she is stubborn, so the training is problematic.  But eventually Maggie starts fighting and the second act moves, as all boxing films must, to the big fight.  At that point I was actually thinking of writing a review of "Million Dollar Baby" that would start by rewriting the lyrics to Alice Cooper's "Billion Dollar Babies."  Then, we get to the final act, at which point any and all thoughts of being cute with regards to this movie go away.  I had heard whispers about the last act, but conveniently forget all about them during the big fight.  One of the nice things about the legacy of "Rocky" is that we can never be sure which way these things are going to go (unless, of course, it is a true story).<br /><br />Because "Million Dollar Baby" is about the "freak show" of women boxing the screenplay by Paul Haggis (based on the "Rope Burns" stories of F.X. Toole) gets to have Maggie get really good really fast.  Of course she is helped as much by Frankie's wisdom as she is up her ability to hit really hard, but the competition is a lot less than it would be if this was the story of a thirty-something guy trying to become a championship boxer.  This is not to be disparaging to the idea, because one of the key subtexts of this story is how the dynamic is changed because Frankie is training a girl, and even if it is laid on thick (he is estranged from his only daughter and her daddy is long dead), Eastwood and Swank make it resonate.  The film also avoids conventions and pitfalls by being devoid of the presence of the press (who would have certainly killed the big payoff regarding a key Gaelic phrase).<br /><br />Apparently, Hillary Swank is going to be known as the "All or Nothing Girl," not to mention the bane of Annette Benning's existence, if she wins the Oscar again.  Between "Boys Don't Cry" and "Million Dollar Baby," her most notable film was "The Core," but if such drek gives her the money to live on waiting for these choice roles to come along and win Oscars, then that is certainly better than being a one Oscar wonder who gets one fantastic role and then slim pickings for eternity (e.g., Marlee Matlin). Despite her character being burdened by the conventional stereotypes of a white trash background, Swank keeps Maggie from becoming a caricature.  Much is made of the fact Swank does all of her own boxing (I like how she keeps her shoulders squared during her fights), but those are not her best acting moments in the film.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson was on the ESPN Hotseat when he was asked how cool he was on a scale of 1 to 10.  Jackson said 9, and when asked who was a 10 he immediately said Morgan Freeman.  The man has played the President of the United States and God, and in this movie he talks about having holes in his sox in a scene that be shown to acting students as an textbook example of the art.  In the 20th century there were three iconic actors representing three different traditions of acting: Laurence Olivier, Spencer Tracy, and Marlon Brando.  Freeman is the living embodiment of the Tracy "know your lines" school of acting.  If the award and standing ovation he got from the Screen Actors Guild last week is any indication, then the most respected actor in Hollywood is finally got to win a long overdue Oscar.<br /><br />Swank keeps touting this as Eastwood's best performance and in terms of acting it probably qualifies.  I still think of Eastwood in "The Bridges of Madison County" as his most engaging performance, and the one most like the actor in real life.  But for the most part as an actor Eastwood has moved from the squinting eyes of the Man With No Name to the memorable one-liners of Dirty Harry.  In "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby" he gets to move beyond such strictures and if my preference for the latter is because I like Eastwood better as a romantic figure, remember which of his performances I have enjoyed the most.<br /><br />If Eastwood wins an Academy Award this month it is probably going to be for Director rather than Best Actor, given he has already picked up the Golden Globe and Directors Guild of America awards.  I think the momentum towards Eastwood winning his second Oscar for directing started with last year's "Mystic River," arguably his most artistic effort as a director, but swamped by the sheer effort and success of Peter Jackson's trilogy of "The Lord of the Rings."  The common denominator remains that Eastwood has become an actor's director with three acting nominations and two wins for "Mystic River" and clear portends that is exactly what will happen again this year.  What is in question is whether "Million Dollar Baby" will be Eastwood's second Best Picture winner as well.  I would not be surprised, but at this point, having seen all five nominated films, the last Oscar of the evening is totally up for grabs (Update: Indeed Swank, Freeman, and Eastwood won Oscars for this film, which won Best Picture as well).</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>"LEAVES YOU COMPELLED!"<br /><br />"HAUNTING!"<br /><br />"BRUTALLY POIGNANT!"<br /><br />Bla, bla, bla. Hollywood's more stylish stepson is at it again, this time in the form of Million Dollar Baby. I want to first state that I didn't see an agenda to this film like many nay sayers of this film claim exists. I simply thought it played us like fools, though, and "indy" (does such a thing exist anymore?) film patrons are laughing at the legions of peons once again.<br /><br />Before you crucify my post here  (I write that with an understanding that many readers here have already seen the film and formed an opinion on it) I want to ask you one question. In light of the constant nihilism we see in our world and our movies, does it not irk you a bit that the films that "mean something" these days leave you empty and dead, half beaten to death on the side of 1213 Film Viewer Drive? Does it make you feel good to shed an artificial tear over a fictional story, an especially contrived one at that? Does it make you feel good - as it did me - to walk out of the theatre and feel desperately worse off for having seen a film, whiping the tears from your face as if our viewing of a film had any significance on the world at large? Does it? If this is escapism, let me go back to jail. At least I won't contemplate suicide there.<br /><br />If you enjoy snythetic emotionalism that kills your soul in less than three hours, this film is perfect for you. If not, save your tears for something that actually matters. There's plenty of sad films out today, why bother with another one?<br /><br />Remember, PLATOON and TITANTIC both won best pictures too and last years LOST IN TRANSLATION was the hit on the indy front. Food for thought. Are you grasping my flow here?</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>The strong point of this movie in front of it's opponant "The Aviator" is, this movies tells how low wealth people can step into the way of progress and get their shot! Being a millionaire and following some strange and monumental ideas is not that important! The Aviator is only a movie with brilliant special effects only for entertainment but this movie has concept! and It's really a Defectless movie. It makes you think about the concept of life. for old people, old for certain jobs I mean, for example for being a Pianist, 20 years age is considered old. This movie for any old people for certain jobs has a message that even as an old man and woman, everyone can get his or her shot anytime. Everything is possible with love and hard work both!<br /><br />and this movie may could not make you weep, although I'm sure many people weep at the last hour of movie. but, Difinately it makes you think.<br /><br />I'm not religious but I heard from some religious people that the punishment is in this world not in everlasting life. They say be kind with you mother, be good with others and similar words. the question is, What wrong had she done for receiving that kind of punishment. she was a good apprantice for her mentor, good daughter for her mother, good sister for her family and nice with others. something seems wrong here. at least at religious point of view. most of american people are religious so I'm sure that's the question of many people. That's very important cause when a kid or a young person who's grown up with religious believes, see this movie, It's highly possible to say to himself or herself, hey, she was nice to everyone. look at her salvation. so what's the benefit of being nice? Fear of GOD that may punish me for being nice? then let's not be nice! and that's not a good lesson. I think Clint Eastwood had to write more accurate scenario. anyway that's not a real problem!</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood does know how to make his movies.  He is an even better director than he is an actor and that is saying a lot.  Great acting all around and a great script that is put into play by Clint.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>A friend asked me recently if I liked boxing movies, and was surprised when I said yes. But this isn't a boxing movie. It's an ode to Clint Eastwood's self-image. Clint is a great comic actor; he's funny whether he's getting beaten or beating some poor fool to a pulp. In this droning fraud, he does neither. Instead he quotes the poetry of William Butler Yeats. I like poetry and I like boxing, but this is just pretentiousness on the part of an aging actor who has begun to take himself too seriously as a tough guy. Equally pretentious is the performance of Morgan Freeman as God... (or was that another movie...?). In fact the only quality bit in Million Dollar Baby is the performance of Hillary swank, which is almost good enough to save the project. To class this sentimental escape with such great boxing movies as Raging Bull or Cinderella Man is a disgrace and an outrage.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a movie about an aging boxing trainer (Clint Eastwood) named Frankie Dunn who goes on a limb and against his instincts and begins training a late-twentysomething female boxer (Hillary Swank), named Maggie Fitzgerald, who has tons of raw talent, a lot of heart, and very little skill.  Under Frankie's tutelage, Maggie's raw talent is processed and refined and she quickly picks up the skills needed to be successful as a boxing champ.  She becomes the knockout queen, knocking her opponents out one after the other before the end of the first round.  After a championship fight in England and a European tour that still left her undefeated, Maggie comes back to the states as a member of a whole new level of play.  Agents across the country come crawling and the offers roll in.  Frankie knows Maggie is good, but he still believes in perseverance and patience and wants to keep her from fighting for the world championship until she gets a couple more fights under her belt. But, Maggie is his Million Dollar Baby and his surrogate daughter and Frankie can't deny her anything. So it's off to Las Vegas to fight the world champion, Billie "The Blue Bear".  That fight changes everything and the backdrop of boxing fades away as the lives of the characters begin a journey down a less-traveled path.<br /><br />The best thing about MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the acting. Morgan Freeman plays a supporting role as Eddie Dupris and lends his voice as the film's narrator. Freeman is a master of underplay and makes the most simple and mudane scenes and lines full of power and emotion just by a simple facial gesture or change in tone of voice.  His 2005 Best Supporting Actor win was well deserved and long overdue.<br /><br />Hillary Swank does a remarkable job portraying Maggie Fitzgerald and went through a great deal of training and conditioning to tone her body for the role. Her performance in the first 2/3rds of the film is amazing.  However, though she is believable in the last 1/3rd of the movie, she really didn't do much acting (it's rather easy to let your limbs go limp).  Her performance garnered another Best Actress win, but one that might not have been deserved as voters were taken back more by emotion than actual performance.<br /><br />With MILLION DOLLAR BABY Clint Eastwood has now officially directed about half the number of films he has acted in and about half of those are pictures he acted in as well.  Eastwood did a brilliant job of directing by melding three top-notch acting performances together so they feel as though they are one whole. He was able to do this despite a several cliches in the plot, a few cheesy lines, a limited budget, and three strong performers.  As much as I would like to see Martin Scorsese win a Best Director Oscar before he dies, Eastwood's direction was better and MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a slightly better picture than THE AVIATOR because it flows together much more smoothly whereas THE AVIATOR (despite all its brilliance and bringing a long-gone era back to life) is long and somewhat choppy.<br /><br />However, as far as movies go, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is really just an average flick.  Sure it has some great performances, direction, lighting, even some occasional witty banter.  But all of that without a great story does not make a great movie.  There are moments in the movie that are touching, especially with the relationships between the three main characters. But much of the "emotion" surrounding the movie is simply hype having to deal with the controversial subject that the film deals with in the last act. Unlike some, I did find the accident to be believable.  My problem is that the way the controversial subject is handled failed to move me in any direction. The film's solution did not anger me to protest nor did it make me want to "switch sides" and become a Kevorkian sympathizer because I "understand" now. In fact, the way the movie handles the whole situation left me rather indifferent and apathetic. A great movie doesn't do that.<br /><br />Besides the "controversial subject" the movie deals with, the picture also points a negative picture of family and religious leaders. There are people in the world like Maggie's family. However, that combined with the fact that Frankie's daughter is the one who refuses to reconciliate leaves a complete negative picture of familial relationships.  Then there is the mockery of religion.  The priest of the church that Frankie attends is uncaring, aloft, unsympathetic, and unnloving. He treats Frankie with disdain and loathing instead of compassion and empathy. I'm sure that there are religious leaders like that in the world, but not many. I just found it disheartening that once again the only religious leader of a Hollywood picture was portrayed in a negative light instead of a positive one.<br /><br />MILLION DOLLAR BABY is worth seeing for the fine acting performances, but as far as movies go in general, it's just about average and really shouldn't have won BEST PICTURE (the movie that should have won wasn't even nominated).</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>It seems Clint Eastwood is like wine, the older he gets, the better he becomes. At least, that is what Hollywood thinks. "Million dollar baby" is Eastwood's last movie, a story about a girl (well, let's say a young woman - Hilary Swank) who wants to be a professional boxer, and an old man  - Eastwood - tormented by his past mistakes.<br /><br />Of course, at the beginning Frankie Dunn, the old boxing manager says he doesn't train girls, but in a short time the girl's simplicity and beautiful smile will win the old man's heart. That's the problem with "Million dollar baby". It's utterly predictable, and somewhat shallow. Eastwood has a name in the industry - especially with some of his more recent movies, like the award-winners "The unforgiven", "The bridges of Madison County" and, most of all, "Mystic River" - , so he will get all the money he wants. So "Million dollar baby" has excellent actors, and the necessary atmosphere - settings, props, etc. - to a boxing movie. It's a pity the screenplay wasn't that well developed. Although the dialogue is, at times, very good and funny, from halfway on the movie looks like a mexican soap opera - or "Days of our lives". It's full of the most basic - and obvious -  kind of drama: the greedy and ignorant rednecks, the german villains - who speak not a word of german in the entire movie - broken spines and euthanasia. It's a script created to make the audience cry, but the characters and the story are so shallow that we know where this is going from the very start. I mean, there are no surprises here, and we only relate to the movie due to the good acting of the main actors, not because of the script.<br /><br />The good point in "Million dollar baby" is the acting of Hilary Swank - that is expected - and Clint Eastwood - he still looks and talks like Dirty Harry, but his time he's convincing as an old man. On the other hand, Morgan Freeman was lost in the story, looking like one of those supporting sidekicks in comedies, there solely for the purpose of making the leading actor funnier. And the fighting scenes and sequences are really good too - well directed and enacted.<br /><br />What I mean is, if this was plainly a movie about boxing - and I don't mean like the "Rocky" series, but something like "Raging bull", for example - it could have been much better. As a plain drama, movies like "Million dollar baby" have been made over and over again, so it's nothing new. Take, for example, Alejandro Amenabar's "Mar adentro", which has basically the same theme, but it's a much more touching and believable movie - and a true story as well.<br /><br />"Million dollar baby" is not a bad movie, it's just that I don't understand all the hype created around a story that has been enacted many times before.<br /><br />Grade 6.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>This movie stars Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank who seems to get another Academy Award every time she appears in a movie.This movie seems to be a female version of Rocky at the start but then becomes a touching human drama. The only thing that spoiled this movie for me was the usual sanitized Hollywood Death Scene. The last time I checked if your oxygen supply is cut off then you turn red, then blue then purple.Not so in this movie. I am sure that Doctor Kevorkian would have loved this movie for this reason alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Though it is not the best movie I have seen it is full of honest performances by Hilary Swank (Insomnia, Boys Dont Cry) and especially Morgan Freeman (Lean On Me, Kiss The Girls and all the other films hes been in). Swank plays a woman who is a waitress and she wants to be trained into the boxing world and she wants Clint Eastwood (Blood Work, True Crime, Absolute Power) to teach her but he wont because he thinks shes weak but in the end he does. Freeman plays a old boxer who lives in the boxing gym and who is blind in one eye. He also helps out Swank. Also the characters are well written, Swank has a family that only wants money and doesnt care about her boxing and Eastwood is stricken with the fact that his daughter is dead to him and he doesnt have a relationship with her, though she sends him letters but he never reads them. He becomes closer to Swank and its kinda like a father/daughter relationship between the two. In the end Swank does become a good boxer but she gets hospitalized after one championship fight with a made of steel femme boxer. A damn good piece of film in which gives another nod to Clint Eastwood but I like Mystic River more then this one...that's only me. Freeman stands out in a wonderful performance giving him a memorable scene in which he fights a young punk boxer. Swank has never been sweeter and Eastwood is still at the top of his game. If there's a movie our there right now that you wanna go see and enjoy with a loved one or maybe by yourself...this is a good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I saw Million Dollar Baby without knowing much about it -- other than it involved an aging fight trainer and his young protege.  That ain't the half of it, but I digress.<br /><br />You've heard this before: the story in Million Dollar Baby isn't terribly original. But how many of life's highlights and tragedies are?  Eastwood, who stars and directs, is trying to capture a slice of real life, and chances are that anyone who has lived a little bit will connect to the ordinary and extraordinary elements of this story.  So, it isn't that the story is old and chewed up, it's more about the universality of the human experience -- which is something that certainly could stand a lot more chewing.<br /><br />The weakest part of the movie, I think, is Clint Eastwood's acting.  I may be swimming against the current, but Eastwood's performance was thin and undercut the entire enterprise.  He just didn't sell me as the Gaelic-reading, mild-mannered, crotchety trainer who doesn't like taking risks.  I know the whole movie is Eastwood's "baby," but this casting mistake turns what could have been a glorious film into a decent one.<br /><br />Hillary Swank, in contrast, was perfectly cast, and maybe because the role hit so close to home.  Both she and her character had tough, trailer park beginnings, both overcame great obstacles, and both probably feel a little out of place in what passes for "culture" among the well-to-do.  She hits the quiet determination, optimism, and passion quotients just right.  It's hard not to see her as a life force, an indomitable survivor who has good instincts about right and wrong, and has just the right sprinkling of selflessness.  (Okay, at times she seems too good to be true, but I'll forgive her that given the dramatic final encounter with her hillbilly family.  Haven't we all experienced parts of that "scene" before?)<br /><br />Morgan Freeman does a great job with a weakly scripted character.  Sure, we've met guys like him -- wise, balanced, and skipping through life in a lowly job (he's an ex-fighter who is the janitor at Eastwood's gym).  But we don't see the counterpoint, the internal struggle, that animates him, that shows us he isn't this perfect, angelic figure narrating his way through life.  One can't help but compare Freeman's performance (and narration) in Million Dollar Baby to his similar role in The Shawshank Redemption.  On every level, it falls short -- sometimes by a little, often by a lot.  Eastwood's use of Freeman has, perhaps unfortunately, made such comparisons almost inevitable.<br /><br />The movie centers around a seminal event, and there are real pacing problems before it as well as afterwards.  No matter, it can't help but move you in its rather slow, methodical way.  We don't always need films to move forward at a blistering pace.<br /><br />The movie's ending -- poignant as it is -- was made ineffective in large part because of Eastwood's character and his performance.  There simply wasn't enough uncontrived humanity in it. It came close at times, like in the car ride back from a visit to Swank's family, but ultimately fizzled.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>At first I had no interest to see this film. It's not that I don't like Clint Eastwood, I do. I enjoyed his last film "Mystic River" and was happy to see it receive such praise. But, "Million Dollar Baby" just came into the night, no one knew anything about it, and I thought, honestly how good could a boxing movie be?<br /><br /> Then the critics rallied behind this movie just as strongly as they have been the sadly overrated "Sideways". Roger Ebert and all three of the NY Times critics placed it on their "top ten" list. Two of them placed it at number one. And of course the recent news that the film has won seven Oscar nominations and thus opened to more screen also provoked me to see this film.<br /><br /> "Million Dollar Baby" first of all, is NOT a boxing movie in the traditional sense. Yes, there are boxing scenes, but, the movie is really about so many other things and has an amazing twist in its third act. The film is about hopes, dreams, courage, friendship, love and many other things that I can't give away here.<br /><br /> The film has an almost breezy effect. I didn't even realize when the first hour and 40 minutes went by. The film takes its time setting up characters and the plot. Infact, you couldn't seperate the two. This is one of those character driven movies. It's not really about the plot but the emotion we feel for the characters.<br /><br /> Eastwood has so effectively paced the film. It has a lyrical feel to it.<br /><br /> But for as good as "Million Dollar Baby' is, it does have some flaws. First of all the film's last act goes on a bit too long. Here Eastwood and the screenwriter are "milking" the situation for all it's worth. They are doing this so the emotion connection will be strong, but, by the time the events do happen. we're hooked. We've been hooked from the first 10 minutes. The film could have been shorten 15 minutes and still retain the power is does.<br /><br /> I've heard people find the film depressing, why? I find it to be a 'feel good movie'. I had a warm feeling while watching it. I came to feel as if I knew the characters. I was put in a very good mood.<br /><br /> Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hiliary Swank are all believeable in their roles. We never for a moment say to ourselves, "hey, there's Clint!" No, we accept them as the characters. This is the film's major strenght.<br /><br /> And about those seven Oscar nominations. I really don't think any of them are deserved. Now, that doesn't mean I don't like the film. A movie doesn't have to win or get nominated for an award to be good. I hope people don't need to have a film win an award to appreciate it.<br /><br /> "Million Dollar Baby" is a knockout. A simple story told in a simple style with an amazing effect.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Clint Eastwood's has a knockout with this film. Everyone is believeable in their roles. A movie about people instead of plot. No special effects, no nudity, just heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Million Dollar Baby is my favorite Clint Eastwood film along with his Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil, The Bridges of Madison County, and last year's Mystic River. Casting Hilary Swank as an aspiring female boxer is the best thing about this film, because she has the ability to go to the extreme musculine side like no other girls in Hollywood can. Just take her Oscar-winning role in Boys Don't Cry for example. It's very convincing especially she had gained more than 15 lbs of hard muscles as result of preparing for her role in this film.<br />Swank plays a cafe junkie waitress(Maggie) who sometimes eats left-over steak in order to save money to train at Frankie's gym. She grew up in a disfunctional family. Daddy died early, and her mother is fat, heartless, and her siblings are nut cases. To her, boxing was all that she loved and hoped to make it big if Frankie would train her. At first, she gets rejected by Frankie, because he doesn't trian girs, and also he has a dark past with his estranged daughter. Maggie didn't give up, and continued to train on her own. Meanwhile, she gets advice from the gym's janitor(Morgan Freeman), who used to be a professional boxer until he was brutally beaten and lost sight on one eye many years ago. He wanted to help her, and eventually convinced Frankie to take her. Frankie finally decided to train her when the guy that he had trained for 7 years walked out on him to find another manager.<br />After many months of intense training, Maggie had become a professional, and started to win in local matches. Eventually, she made it to international championships and won those matches as well. She used her earnings and bought a house for her mama, but she not only was ungrateful, she even said nasty things about her for being a boxer. Maggie was devastated and she became more determined to go further with her career. Then there's the world boxing championship to fight against "The Blue Bear", who was almost defeated at the end of the match and she punched Maggied when she wasn't looking. Maggie collapsed, and her neck hit the chair! She past out instantly, and was parallized afterwards.<br />Frankie fell very remorseful for having train her, and see her became a "vegetable". Then Maggie makes her ultimate decision about her life, and it was upto Frankie to help her one more time.....<br />It was very moving to see Eastwood breaking down in the church. He had a great deal of chemistry with Swank and it was wonderful and touching that they bonded and he was not only her trainer, he had became a father figure. He should get a best directing and acting nomination for this film.<br />This is Hilary Swank's career best performance since Boys Don't Cry, and she will probably get an Oscar nomination again.<br />I rarely watch movies about boxing, with the exception for Raging Bull, and Beautiful Boxer(a Thai film). This is  a very entertaining, moving, and uplifting film. It doesn't have the depressing tone like Mystic River.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Marred only by an unfortunate subplot involving a mentally-deficient boxer, Million Dollar Baby is a powerful look at three characters that pulls no punches and takes its story to an emotionally honest conclusion; a deserved Oscar-winner, it is well worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" is a parable and a meditation about greed, exploitation, and redemption. Eastwood himself stars as Frankie,a boxer who runs a gym. He "doesn't train girls" but the determined Maggie (Hilary Swank) wants to be a champion. Morgan Freeman stars as Eastwood's mentor&friend. Their relationship shows that true friendship transcends race. Freeman is an excellent actor; unfortunately, his near-constant voice-over gets intrusive&heavy-handed. Eastwood,show,don't tell!<br /><br />Frankie is as determined as Maggie- he wants to win at any cost- and he pays the price. He exploits Maggie for the money, even pitting her against a famously brutal female boxer known for cheating. Frankie knowingly endangers Maggie&she naively accepts the challenge. However, Frank does have a conscience. He is repulsed whenever Maggie tells him to "put her down" if she is seriously injured.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" shows the seamy underside of female boxing. Boxing between men has an air of legitimacy, while female boxers live in a world of exploitation, treated as freaks. It also comes across as homoerotic. It's no wonder Maggie's redneck mother tells her to "get a man"-but maybe Maggie prefers being surrounded by bikini-clad babes&battling more muscular ones.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is controversial because of it's "death with dignity" theme. The young priest warns Frank that if he puts Maggie out of her misery,it will lead to more tragedy. It's not a solution. The priest's prophecy comes true. Frank gives Maggie the lethal injection- and exiles himself from the human community. He doesn't live "happily ever after." On the other hand, Freeman's character is happily reunited with the boxer whose life he saved. Choosing life is redemptive. Some have painted "Million Dollar Baby" as propaganda. One wonders if they actually watched the movie, or if they're merely parroting what talk show hosts told them.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" has excellent acting,a beautiful score. Its weaknesses are Freeman's near-constant narration (though he has a wonderful baritone) and often stereotypical characters (such as Maggie's family) It's not one of the best Oscar-winning movies; it's still a champion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is a plain and predictable movie which was confidently directed, and has three very good performances. I just cannot believe how many clich&eacute;s it's got - the estranged daughter of Frankie (Eastwood) to whom he writes every week and receives every letter back not opened. This device was used for Freeman's character's narration - in the last scene of the film we realize that he was telling the story to Frankie's daughter to convince her that her father was a good man. The main character, Maggie the waitress (Hillary Swank) eating table scraps and counting pennies, makes a long trip to LA to be trained by Frankie to became a boxing champion - why is she so determined to have him as her trainer we'll never know. Her conversation with Frankie when she remembers her father and her dog, Axel that was put asleep when became sick - kind of lets you know what to expect in the end. The ominous descriptions of a German champion Billy the Blue Bear, "the dirtiest killing machine" - you know what will happen way before the movie takes it turn. It should've ended just after the turn with Maggie's death - the final round of the movie is despicable in its manipulation. It is hard for me to believe that Maggie practically fall apart from the lack of the proper care - it was shown that way to squeeze as many tears from the audience as possible. What it squeezed from me was anger and burning desire to hiss "Die already!!!" It is also quite predictable that all members of Maggie's family are the crude caricatures. By the way, her sister does not look like a redneck girl who keeps having babies and cheats on Welfare but this is a small detail. Final heartbreaking scene between Maggie and Frankie - in her last moment he told her what Gaelic phrase 'Mo cos&uacute;lacht' means and of course, it should make the audiences cry even harder. But if you think of it, Maggie had the robe with the sign for months, her many Irish fans kept greeting her with this phrase all the time - and she never was curious enough to find out (through the dictionary or just by asking any of her fans) what it meant. Again, it is a small detail but I hate to be manipulated by the cheap tricks and the movie has lots of them. Oh, I almost forgot the mentally retarded boy in the Frankie's Gym whose only purpose to be in the gym and in the movie was to provide a triumphant moment for Freeman's Scrap and the comical relief exactly in the right time.<br /><br />You know, when I think of it, I hate the whole idea of women boxing - I find it unnatural, cruel, and absolutely unsympathetic (but it is me). If Maggie was able to safe a few pennies to get to that Gym, if she was so subtle, strong willed and determined to change her life, to pull herself out of the trailer park, to become somebody, to not be called "white trash", why did not she go to school - to better herself, to receive education. She was smart enough to know where she came from and to want to get out of there, so, why choose the way she chose? But I guess, the movie was not supposed to answer this question.<br /><br />I believe that Eastwood is an incredible artist at almost 78 - with sure hand, great style, and sharp mind. I loved the music he wrote for the movie, I liked his acting (as well as Swank's and Freeman's) but for me, "Million Dollar Baby" was not the Best film of the year, not even close.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Maggie Fitzgerald (played excellently by Hillary Swank) is trying to scratch her way out from under her trailer-trash past. She's working as a waitress at a dive diner, and in her spare-time she works the amateur circuit in the little advertised sport of female boxing. But what she really needs is a coach, a trainer.<br /><br />Enter Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a washed-up boxing coach who owns a cheesy little mid-town training facility. He's in league with one of his old boxing pals, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). They quietly run the place. Maybe too quietly.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's character keeps sending warning messages to Clint about "holding back" potential contenders for world championship positions. And when one of Clint's formidable fighters leaves him for another trainer, and wins a title, Clint's character is forced to examine his dealings in greater detail. Not an easy thing to do for a man who has incredible guilt resting on his ample shoulders.<br /><br />It is clear from the outset that Clint's charcter blames himself for Eddie's blind right eye (he was unable to throw in the towel during the fatal fight that caused Eddie's blindness). He also has an estranged daughter who keeps sending back his letters "return to sender" every time he mails her anything (Clint has a box full of the returned envelopes in his closet). Add to this that he goes to mass every day at his local church (partly out of guilt and partly to harrass the clergy) and you've got a pretty deep character on the screen.<br /><br />Maggie enters Clint and Morgan's lives despite the fact that they "don't train girlees", and sets up camp in their boxing establishment. Finally, Clint gives in and starts to train her. Their interactions are excellent together as Clint takes Swank through the basics of the sport, teaching her foot movements, weight shifting, speed bag usage, and other crucial items.<br /><br />The greatness and horribleness of boxing are brought into blinding focus here. It's a dangerous sport, with dreams that can quickly turn into nightmares.<br /><br />The ending of the film is a fatalist's dream. The movie tries to downplay this by saying that "sometimes, you just don't have anything left". But it didn't work for me on that level (thus my four star rating). But the superlative acting kept my interest. All of the actors, from Swanks excellent portrayal of the desperate human, to Clint's amazing scene with the clergy in the church after a horrible accident, to Morgan Freeman's gritty voice-overs and stunning visual presence, this movie will undoubtedly be an Oscar contender for many of the actors. But will it win a Best Picture Award? I don't think so. But that's just my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>if you overlook the plethora of absurd plot holes (excuse me, but no cops are seeking clint eastwoods character for murder???) and concentrate on the strong performances, this is a good movie. hilary swank as the injured boxer and morgan freeman as the best friend both merited their oscars. but i cant rate this as a first-rate tear jerker because of the ridiculous screenplay by glorified tv hack paul haggis, who went on to perpetrate the even stupider screenplay for "crash".</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>I don't understand why critics, Hollywood and the Academy loves these types of films. It's in the same league as HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG and Eastwood's utterly dark MYSTIC RIVER all of whom were nominated for several OSCARS. I must admit I liked the movies listed above (as depressing as they were). The main difference between those films and MILLION DOLLAR BABY is that the earlier films do not depict their unpleasantness in so grotesque a manner. Being an ardent horror film fan I have to brutally state this film was more disturbing than alot of the more sinister films out right now.<br /><br />It is not inspiring.<br /><br />It is not pleasant.<br /><br />And for the most part, it is not much of a boxing movie.<br /><br />It is very difficult to talk about the contents of this film without giving anything away so out of respect for those of you who want to see this film, I will not discuss the film's plot. But be warned, if you are expecting a heart-warming and inspirational tale of love and triumph do not even attempt a view. This film was torture and it left me questioning why so many in the Hollywood establishment look upon these types of films as entertainment and why they love to be depressed so much.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood needs to cheer up. Thanks to him, I was depressed for an entire week and next time I want to see morbidly BAD things happen to extremely good people, I will watch TITANIC instead. At least I was expecting that one.<br /><br />This was as inspiring as an episode of JERRY SPRINGER.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>This film has a lot of strengths to it.  Good acting, some good turns of the plot, some characters to care about.  But it is really just too damn depressing at the end.  What's going on?  We start out with a good action movie, a sports triumph.  How did we get from there to "Gee, I hope someone kills off the main character soon".<br /><br />All I can say is - What were you thinking?  Why did you take this film in that direction?  Why exploit that particular emotion?  A film is a work of art, and just like any other work of art, it is free to go where it chooses.  Why did this one go to the depths of depression?  Do I really have to follow you there?<br /><br />Gee.  Pass the popcorn.  What is this, Ibsen?<br /><br />Greatness and depression are not synonyms.  Reminds me of the Saty Nite Live skits of Mr. Bill.  Oh nooooooooooooo.  Uh oh, we'll have to cut off your leg now.  Oh Nooooooooooo.  Uh oh, we'll have to cut off your tongue now.  Oh nooooooooooooooo.  Uh oh, we'll have to kill you now.  Oh nooooooooooooooooooo.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I tend to notice a pattern when it comes down to Oscar winners. For every film that deserves to win such as Return of the King and Titanic and Schindler's List, we get films that oddly win like American Beauty, Chicago, Shakespeare in Love and this one. Not saying that this is a bad film(the other 2 are however) but I like it going how did this win the entire thing? I wasn't a fan of the way too overdramatic Mystic River but with this film it's good but I wouldn't say it's Best Picture worthy like Braveheart or Titanic but it's good.<br /><br />Frankie Dunn is a boxing manager training a Title bout contender. Only before the match, the fighter ditches him for someone else and wins. In walks in Maggie Fitzgerald, an early 30s waitress who wants to be a fighter only Frankie won't teach her but with the help of Frankie's friend and ex-boxer Eddie she goes on her way to the top only to hit a really big snag.<br /><br />Like I said, this won Best Picture so I watched it after the fact it won and I don't see how it won. Similar to A Beautiful Mind or American Beauty, a film wins the big award while more deserving didn't get it like Saving Private Ryan over Shakespeare or Gladiator over Crouching Tiger. Guess I'm just not getting the big deal.<br /><br />One problem that really plagued Mystic River was it was too overdramatic. It was almost like the film kept asking you whether you were crying or emotionally moved yet. With this film however it doesn't have that which was a plus such as the last scene with boxer/trainer. And kudos for having Maggie tell off her leech family members.<br /><br />The film does have some issues though such as the wannabe pipsqueak boxer Danger. It just seems like a break from all the dramatic stuff by adding some humor but it doesn't fit. Same with the reasons why Frankie isn't speaking with his daughter anymore. While it does leave his character even more alone and broken at the end, why bother putting it in in the first place if you're not going to resolve it. Even Eddie's 110th final bout gets resolved. It's also a really dark film at nighttime with very bad lighting.<br /><br />Performances are one of its saving graces with them being likable people, even funny. Although I don't understand the attraction to Hilary Swank. Yeah her physicalness in the film's good but it's not like she was the best performance that year.<br /><br />I'd kind of recommend it although I have no idea why. I don't know whether to like it or call it overrated. Guess Oscar had the same problem I did.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I honestly do not understand why this movie was so highly praised. I only rented it out really because I thought it actually was the female version of Rocky, and for awhile it seemed to be that way. Poor fighter, crusty old manager, the works you know. And I loved Rocky so I thought, why not give it a shot, see how well it is. It looked interesting and I assumed maybe the critics actually picked out a good movie this time.<br /><br />Critics and I have always been on different wavelengths though on what is good and what is mediocre or trash. I hardly ever agree with other critics, but I always give them a shot with the movies they praise. Sometimes they're right, sometimes I think they are wrong. On this film I think it was too highly praised. Everyone was saying it was amazing and just so heart- jerking. I disagree. It was not amazing, matter of fact, if it wasn't for two major actors playing in the film (Clint, Morgan) then I doubt this film would have been as praised as it has. To me, if I looked to the actors as just actors I just saw normal acting, nothing amazing. And the plot itself held good ground, being somewhat like Rocky but putting in its own difference, like when Clint hints at problems with his daughter- although you never figure out unfortunately why his daughter and him are not speaking with each other. But especially when Maggie falls and falls hard is the major difference.<br /><br />The major disappoinment though in this film was not the highly applauded acting being just nothing special to me, but the ending itself. Maggie came in this film strong and determined to fight anything and anyone to be a great boxer. I believed in her strength, I believed she believed she could do anything, that's when I liked the movie a lot was seeing the determination of Maggie around Clint's gym, punching that bag all that time. Then something happens in the end, and it was terrible I can tell you that much, and suddenly Maggie just didn't have the fight in her anymore. That was the greatest disappointment of the film. I don't know, maybe others thought that was the most powerful point, when Maggie loses her will that she had so strongly in the beginning, but I thought it was just down right miserable and a bleak ending. I know that they were really trying to make it a tear jerker and the ending was supposed to be miserable but I just did not like that ending at all. I expected from all of Maggie's will in the beginning that she wouldn't have fallen all the way down, but she did, and it was just greatly disappointing that's all.<br /><br />Others, many others, will say this movie was great, but I would say in my personal opinion that this movie was not great, but just average. It was a good plot, with average acting, and a disappointing and miserable ending where the lead character named Maggie totally lets you down in the end. You can sympathize with her definitely, but the point was after you see her in the beginning, you expected her to be so much more stronger. Maggie said something in the beginning of the movie that I totally ignored, but now, I know was the most strongest quote in the whole film. Listen to her carefully in the beginning, and hear her hint at the ending of the film in one single sentence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Up until today, The Aviator was my pick for the Best Film of 2004. Now that I have seen Million Dollar Baby, I can say that it barely beats that film out and MDB is the Best Film of 2004 in my opinion. The acting from the three leads is mind blowing, with Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman having the best chances of winning the Oscar next month. Clint Eastwood is very good as well, but he won't beat out Jamie Foxx or Leonardo DiCaprio in the Best Actor category. I know that Swank will likely win (and she deserves it), but I really hope Morgan Freeman finally wins an Oscar after all these years. How could this guy not have won for the Shawshank Redemption? It seems like everytime he is nominated he is passed over (Driving Miss Daisy, Glory, Shawshank, etc.). Anyways, back to the film. Clint's direction is spot on and even though the film is well over two hours the pace is right were it should be for this kind of film (fast enough to hold your attention, yet slow enough to take in the mood and great performances). The dialogue between the three leads always seems freshly real and my eyes even teared up during a few scenes and that never happens with me. This film and The Aviator will likely take most of the Oscars (hopefully a long overdue Director win for Scorsese) and if you haven't seen these two films I recommend that you do soon. Million Dollar Baby may be sad and depressing, but what really makes the impact so devastating is that you care about these characters and when something bad happens you feel the pain as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Cast:  Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Jay Burachel, Mike Colter, Lucia Rijker.<br /><br />Running Time:  132 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for boxing violence, thematic material, and some language.<br /><br />Fresh off his success of the critically acclaimed "Mystic River", director Clint Eastwood embarked on "Million Dollar Baby", the "Rocky"-esque account of a near middle-aged, courageous individual who would give up anything just to follow the path in which she believes she needs to take.  What originally begins as a sports drama becomes much more:  a harrowing depiction of the despair that comes from the loss of a loved one, the tremendous valor of the soul that can be reached through the help, assistance, and dedication of others, and the ultimate sense of loyalty and care.  Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert 'cut man' who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He's a nice enough guy, but he can't seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (he has lost contact with his only daughter). His guilt and ignominy is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet Dunn's aware of his own plight, but just doesn't know how to melt the ice or more importantly, if he's deserving of such a meltdown.<br /><br />Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank in a wonderfully portrayed role), a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. Like many people, Maggie's dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It's a silly phrase but it's as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove.  Morgan Freeman plays Scrape, Dunn's right-hand man at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from "The Shawshank Redemption". He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he's similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He's there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together.  Together, the three enter on a journey of courage, hard-work, and love, which eventually leads Maggie to the peak of accomplishment-a chance for fight for the woman's welterweight championship.<br /><br />Eastwood's performance in "Baby" is just the right anchor the film needs to keep it from sinking due to a heavy dramatic workload, and the clich&eacute;d material the script touches on from time to time. His gruff, weathered performance hits all the right notes, but also retains an unanticipated warmth that Eastwood rarely lets out. His co-stars are just as striking. Eastwood's "Unforgiven" partner Freeman is a treat in a supporting role (which he won an Oscar for).  The two enjoy easy chemistry and longstanding acting history and it shows winningly in every frame they share.  The elders are an excellent tease for "Baby," but it all hangs on Hilary Swank's performance in the title role. A chameleon performer, Swank inhabits Maggie both mentally and physically, breaking quite a sweat in both departments. Maggie isn't a lost soul, but her defiance in spirit and lack of guidance has led her into a dead end. Swank captures that lost but ultimately found emotional movement like a champ, and her pugilist skills seen in various boxing matches are just as believable. Swank isn't the seasoned acting pro like her co-stars, but her full court press in this difficult role is stunning, and her performance perfection because of her unwavering dedication to the character's flaws. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light. There is a grey area between the light and the dark where something approaching truth lays waiting, and this is where Eastwood takes us, and then leaves us there to ponder. "Million Dollar Baby" is a great American film, thrusting the audience into a realm of emotion and ambiance not often consummated on film. Even more accomplished than "Unforgiven" and "Mystic River", yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Million Dollar Baby is a multi- Oscar winning film directed by and starring Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood. This film follows a young woman who pursues her dream to make it big in the sport of boxing and achieves a great deal of success with Eastwood as her trainer.<br /><br />Eastwood directed this movie and he produces a winning formula on all counts. The main plot of this film involves a young woman who wants to become a champion boxer and wants Eastwood's character to be her trainer. There is also a subtle but important subplot involving the family lives of Eastwood and Swank. Both have problems with family members and they are both missing some important relationships in their lives. And in the end, they each fulfill the others relationship gap.<br /><br />This movie is well- directed, well- produced, and superbly acted. The standouts in the acting department include Hilary Swank in the role as Maggie; Morgan Freeman in the role as former boxer Eddie Dupris; and Eastwood himself in the role as Frankie Dunn. Swank's character is most memorable and the strength of her hard- nosed, yet friendly character won her an Oscar. Eastwood and Freeman's character provide some good contrast. They are different in their approach to boxing and their philosophy on success. They both love the sport they teach, but they approach it from different angles. Freeman captured the Oscar for his performance and Eastwood received a nomination.<br /><br />Yet another plus for this film is its lack of predictability. Sports films are, for the most part, easy to predict after a few minutes. You can usually tell which team or individual is going to reign victorious in the end. Sometimes, the predictable nature of sports movies lessens their appeal; other times, it doesn't matter. But in this movie, there isn't as much predictability and some of the turns of events will leave viewers surprised.<br /><br />Narrated by Morgan Freeman's character, Million Dollar Baby is a winning motion picture about life, victory, achievement, and loss. Its winning formula made it an excellent choice for the Best Picture Oscar in 2004. If you haven't already seen it, I recommend doing so immediately. It's a great film from Clint Eastwood.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Million Dollar Baby is slow, boring, and not worth Oscar gold. Hilary Swank is not that good of an actress, I find her unbearable to watch. Morgan Freeman always seems to play the same character but to my surprise Clint Eastwood is quite good in this film, his acting has never been better. The story and pace of the film is what leaves me disappointed. I just couldn't get into this weeper, oh well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I didn't feel that the film connected on an emotional level, and that it was more like watching stock characters in action. Hillary Swank is very good, but her character moves from amateur boxer to championship contender while showing practically nothing in between. Clint failed to impress me with his performance (and I'm a Clint fan), and Morgan Freeman continues to be highly overrated. The second half drags considerably, and I felt the whole third act to be very manipulative.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>Eastwood performance reminds of the mummy. The whole story is performed in a slow and untouching way (I had no feeling for the characters). Do you want to see the pinnacle in boxing movies? the Rocky series is the one to go, nothing even comes close.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Could this be the year? That appears to be the very question on everyone's mind this Oscar season and the answer always depends on who you are asking. Based on the fans of The Aviator, they believe co-heartedly that if the Boston Red Sox could lift their once-ancient curse then there is still hope for Martin Scorsese in the Best Director category. For Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator's only true competition (Sorry Sideways), Clint Eastwood could prove to be back in contention form. Though many critics praised last year's contender, Mystic River, it had nothing on the existential strength that was The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. But, seeing as how that was the last film in the trilogy, the field for Best Picture is left wide-open, but truthfully only two face a bout-to-bout battle for the prize. Do you feel lucky, punk?<br /><br />Frankie Dunn, quite possibly one of the best boxing trainers in the country, is not the type of person who will ever get close to anyone again, especially after his daughter wants nothing to do with him, returning all of his letters to her, and his champion-in-training abandon him for a chance at the big time. Then one day, a typical white-trash diner waitress named Maggie Fitzgerald walks into his gym and asks to be trained to fight in the ring. Dunn quickly refuses, stating being "tough is not enough". Eventually, after witnessing Maggie's sheer determination in her training, Frankie takes her on based on two conditions - that she listens to everything he says and that she does not ask any questions. Though begrudgingly brought together by fate, the two begin to form a solid father/daughter-like relationship together, each sharing a common bond with one another based on family abandonment lodged in their pasts. This relationship will be tested to its limits by an event none of them ever expected or ever wanted to face. The story for Million Dollar Baby is darn near impossible to define in precise terms. What starts out as not only an engaging and exhilarating boxing drama but also an emotionally stirring divulgence into the belief of second chances quickly, and all too suddenly, shifts gears into a pure spear-headed propagandist piece. Why did things have to go so disturbingly wrong? The first two-thirds of the film showcased some of the most heart-warming, breathtaking, and all-out inspirational boxing sequences this side of Raging Bull. Truly an Oscar tour-de-force from everyone involved. And then they had to go about and kill it, so to speak, with a conclusion that felt as if someone had side-checked the audience into a brick wall.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood, in the role of the hard-shelled - are not all his characters that way - boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, was mainly nominated for his performance due to his marquee name - Paul Giamatti deserved it more - but the character itself is too wild for even the most Hollywood of clich&eacute;s. It is both an appalling and disturbing sight to see critics and the public alike applaud a performance in which Eastwood comes in at the end of the film through the hospital wing like the "Angel of Death" to secretly kill a woman he raised as if she were his own daughter. Perhaps audience members were given the wrong perception on the real daughter that left him. Maybe she was the only one with the true sense about her. If you knew your father would end up doing what he did to Maggie, would you not leave him? The parish priest asks Frankie one day after exiting the morning service, "Why do you bother coming to church?", or something to that affect. This honestly has to be the most thought provoking question in the entire film after witnessing how he goes against practically every Christian teaching on the subject of valuing the human life in the book, specifically The Bible. Hilary Swank is obviously on tap to receive the Oscar for Best Actress this year at the Academy Awards for her performance as boxer in training Maggie Fitzgerald, but does she truly deserve the honor or rather is there a serious lack of true competition against her? Should she receive kudos for training excruciatingly hard for the role and floating gracefully around the boxing ring like a true woman champion? Sure, she deserves every bit of it. Should she be the one to receive two golden statuettes in such a short period of time while taking lead roles in such trash as The Core and The Gift? Not so sure about that one. Maggie also acts as a rather crude insult toward anyone from the South - in fact her entire family could actually be brought into this discussion while we are at it. In Million Dollar Baby, every individual who happens to be from the southern region of the country is portrayed as either a know-nothing country bumpkin, complete with inbred appearance, or a worthless piece of white trash that will never amount to anything in this world. This is the typical clich&eacute; of both Hollywood and the liberal establishment in general. They love it so much it kills them to see over and over again - if only.<br /><br />Overall, Michael Moore occultists, more accurately those left who have yet to buck up the nerve to take their Kool-Aid following the reelection of Bush-Hitler, can at most find some consolation in the fact that at least some left-wing propagandist piece could walk away with a golden statuette on Oscar night, though seeing as how it is not from the imagination of the grand-master himself it may mean little to them. Already the fringe leftists have a pathetic excuse for their bumbling actions claiming, "But at least Frankie was not cruel enough to do the deed while she was sleeping. Was it not the most touching moment when they said their good-byes before the end?" Sure, if your name is Michael Schiavo, master of illusions, willing to romanticize the concept cold-blooded murder in order to knock off your wife and collect on her life insurance  in which to live happily ever after with your mistress and your two children. Straight out, euthanasia is nothing more then a gussied up word used by liberal elitists to cover-up the act of cold-blooded murder, accepted only by the slack-jawed idiots churned out by donkey universities who can not put two-and-two together.<br /><br />"But", they stutter "should we truly allow those who are confined to wheelchairs, unable to move a single limb, live out the rest of their purposeless lives in utter agony?" Following that sense of logic, Christopher Reeve, in spite of whatever Brother John Edwards may want you to think, should have been put of his damn misery years before he actually died. In spite of how thickheaded the liberal establishment is, this should not be as complex an issue as it has been made out to be. First and foremost, your life does not solely belong to you; it belongs to the creator as well. God created everyone specifically in his image with a purpose in this life, though we may not know what that will be at the time, and he will take you from this world when he feels it is your determined time. You have neither the privilege nor the authority to dictate when and where you want to die. In spite of what the radical liberals may tell you otherwise, man is not higher up within the chain-of-command then God himself. Anything to the contrary is absolute sacrilege. And secondly, concerning the level of governmental authority over this issue, the 1997 Supreme Court case, Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, in which the nine justices were unanimous in their decision, determined that the United States Constitution did not allow the practice of assisted suicide and declared that it should continue to be outlawed in this country. In addition to that, Baby promotes the ideal that if you are able to reach the zenith of your life, the one true shot at the big time, that even if you fail doing so you will have achieved your purpose in this world and you may therefore die with a sense of dignity having nothing left to live for. Perhaps that one could be explained more clearly to Mr. Eastwood, whether he actually wins on the big night or not, by taking a quick pot-shot to his head on his way to the limo. After all, does it not make sense for him to practice what he preaches? Million Dollar Baby is positively insulting, bordering on the line of being flat-out slanderous, both to Catholicism and the respect for quality of life in general. There should be no respect left for Clint Eastwood, either in the realm of films or politics, after this travesty.<br /><br />Believe what you want, but the liberals of this country view the cruel methods of abortion and euthanasia (assisted suicide) as the justifiable means in which to purge themselves of the responsibility they have toward another human life. If that is the direction in which we as a collective national society are heading towards in terms of our moral values then we are all royally screwed, both within this life and the next.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It has been quite a few years since Clint Eastwood was reamed by critics for starring and sometimes directing ultra-violent vigilante action thrillers. What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his filmmaking techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in this acclaimed 2004 film, a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary. The only significant thing miscalculated is the movie's title, which seems almost too comically ironic for such an enriching film.<br /><br />Written by Paul Haggis (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash</a>), the basic story is simple, almost deceptively corny sounding a bit like the distaff version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAO5Y">Rocky</a>. A spunky female fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, Maggie Fitzgerald, wants a grizzled old trainer, Frankie Dunn, to guide her to become a professional boxer. Of course, the trainer owns a third-rate gym with an array of male fighters encompassing all the stereotypes. He also has an aged assistant, Scrap, who is of course, willing to champion Maggie's potential more than Frankie, at least at the beginning. Eastwood, however, belies the predictability and takes his story to a far deeper and more nuanced level than one would presume from this set-up. It turns out that Maggie is pushing 32 and considered over-the-hill for getting into the game. Frankie is estranged from his daughter, reads Yeats, studies Gaelic and goes to Mass every day mostly to annoy the young priest. Scrap was a contender trained by Frankie but lost an eye and his boxing future when a match went awry.<br /><br />How these three characters interact with each other supplies the film's main pleasure, not really the obligatory boxing scenes that will assuredly make one wince by their realism. In fact, one of the more painful scenes in the movie is not in the boxing ring but in a new house that Maggie buys for her ungrateful mother, when Maggie comes to the revelation that she has no one but Frankie to provide emotional support in her life. This is not to say the film lacks humor, as Eastwood infuses a clever sensibility that subtly draws you into these characters' lives without hesitation. The story follows Maggie's ascension in the boxing world, and what happens beyond that development is devastating. While it is enough to say there is tragedy involved, leave it to Eastwood, in his straightforward, confident directorial approach, to make the last part of the story surprisingly life-affirming and not at all exploitative. Only a filmmaking master could pull off such a feat in such an honest and emotionally affecting manner.<br /><br />As an actor, Eastwood continues to impress primarily by his innate connection to Frankie. Probably not since his surprisingly open-hearted turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012E2HRC">The Bridges of Madison County</a> has he made himself so vulnerable onscreen, granted this time under the veneer of his hard-earned, leather-faced machismo. His sense of authority is never in question here, and he shows it off with great relish, especially as his character realizes how much more complicated life becomes as he grows older. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap with his customary humanistic skill. In fact, he provides the narration as a voiceover letter to Frankie's daughter in a manner that will remind you of his similar turn in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0EW">The Shawshank Redemption</a>. That's not to say his performance is unsurprising, as he and Eastwood have an easy rapport that plays to both actors' strengths. But the standout is Hilary Swank portraying Maggie with an emotional directness and piercing vulnerability that cuts right to the heart. Not only is she physically impressive in the gym and in the ring, but she elevates what could have been a one-note character into someone far more complex, intelligent and affecting. The film is wonderfully profound with superlative acting.<br /><br />The three-disc 2005 DVD set is solid but rather light on extras. Disc One contains a pristine print transfer of the film but no commentaries from Eastwood or the cast. There are three extras on Disc Two. The first is an 18-minute featurette, "Born to Fight", which features interviews with the three stars and three other cast members, in particular, boxer/actor Lucia Rijker (who plays Maggie's fatalistic opponent) who discusses the ways in which the film parallels her career in boxing. The second is "The Producers' Round 15", a 13-minute short on the film's production process featuring Haggis, as well as producers Albert Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg. The last extra is a roundtable discussion, "James Lipton Takes on Three" with the three stars being interviewed in typical sequestered fashion by the erudite host of "Inside the Actors' Studio". Disc Three is the soundtrack CD of Eastwood's atmospheric musical score orchestrated by Lennie Niehaus conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The thing that strikes you the most while watching "Million Dollar Baby" is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director.  Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations.  In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.<br /><br />Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, an aging boxer-turned-trainer who has yet to hit the big time with any of his "clients."  The gym he runs in a seedy part of Los Angeles seems more like a watering hole for outcasts and misfits than the launching pad for the next welter-, middle-, or heavyweight champion of the world.  Then one day, into his gym, strides Maggie Fitzgerald, a wide-eyed girl from the Ozarks with dreams of making it big in the arena.  Even though she has set her sights on Dunn as the man who will teach her, Dunn makes it clear to her that he has absolutely no interest in taking on "a girl" for training purposes.  But when he sees her determination and fiery spirit, he agrees - however reluctantly - to show her the ropes.  The film is an account of the warm relationship that develops between this old man - who has long ago lost contact with his own estranged daughter, and sees in Maggie, if only subconsciously, a chance to make some kind of amends for his own sins - and this feisty, full-hearted girl from the hills.<br /><br />Even though "Million Dollar Baby" has all the earmarks of a typical underdog sports movie, the film far transcends its genre through the excellence of both its screenplay and the performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, who, in the role of a former boxer himself and Dunn's closest friend, provides the voice of practicality and reason that permeates the film.  His narration (as it did also in this summer`s "War of the Worlds" and "March of the Penguins") lends the film the gravitas and classicism it needs to stand out from the crowd.<br /><br />Basing his screenplay on stories by Rope Burns, Paul Haggis has written dialogue that is astute, dramatic and authentic, far more literate than what we are accustomed to finding in most mainstream American movies.  And, in his direction, Eastwood establishes just the right rhythm in the speech patterns to draw the audience into the center of the drama.  Of course, Eastwood would never have been able to achieve this level of greatness without evoking strong performances from his assembled cast.  As an actor, Eastwood himself has never been better than he is here.  Gruff and cantankerous one moment, he is tender and warmhearted the next.  Dunn has many deep-seated regrets about the past, but, even though his choices have rendered him virtually alone in the world, he still manages to remain both decent in his treatment of others and optimistic about the future.  In her second Oscar-winning performance, Swank provides just the right mixture of na?ve sweetness, openhearted frankness and unquenchable determination to bring Margaret to vivid life.  And Freeman, as always, delivers a beautifully understated performance as the man of quiet perceptions whom Dunn has leaned on for guidance and advice for nigh unto thirty years.  Together, this amazing ensemble molds what might have been a clich&eacute;-ridden tale into a work of art.<br /><br />Beautiful in its pacing and exquisite in its details, "Million Dollar Baby" is, without question, Clint Eastwood's finest film to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>At first glance, Clint Eastwood's Oscar winning "Million Dollar Baby" looks like a standard boxing movie until, of course, the devastating climax. But this is a film that grows deeper and more rewarding with each viewing. The deep bond that exists between trainer Frankie Dunn and boxer Maggie Fitzgerald becomes more evident each time you see the film. Dialogue that seems to mean one thing suddenly seems to mean something all together different the second and third time around.<br /><br />The more you see it, the more you also realize that much of the "controversy" concerning the actions of the characters was the result of propagandists who either missed the point or deliberately attempted to mislead the public about the film's "message." But this film's only "message" is that life is a frequently brutal business that sometimes requires making decisions we would rather avoid. "Million Dollar Baby" does not "promote," "endorse," or "condone," but rather "depicts" an act that has deeply disturbing consequences for all involved.<br /><br />The performances are excellent with Hillary Swank commanding the spotlight even when sharing it with her illustrious and legendary co-stars. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are also excellent, as is Jay Baruchel as Danger. Eastwood's subtle score is fine, and Tom Stern's moody cinematography is outstanding, effectively using light and shadow to create moods and to comment on the characters and the action.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>I never thought I would say that.  When you think of Clint Eastwood, you think of action packed westerns, macho police dramas and adventure films that bring you to the edge of your seat.  But this movie throws his mystique out the window.  He has come full circle, giving us a drama about common people, dreams and heartbreak.  It's purpose is filled with self realization, hard choices and consequences.  Eastwood continues his incredible 15 year ride of outstanding filmmaking with an Oscar worthy perfomance.  If Jamie Foxx didn't win or wasn't nominated, Eastwood would have completed the triple crown winning Director, Producer and Actor awards.  Hillary Swank proves her Oscar winning peformance for "Boys Don't Cry" wasn't a fluke.  And Morgan "Easy Reader" Freeman gives his best perfomance of his career.  Though it's ending is controversial, it is a conversation piece.  You will laugh, you will cry, but in the end, you won't soon forget Eastwood's finest film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood directs & stars in, this, his 25th film as director.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is a great film that is arguably one of Eastwood's best films & is one of the best films of 2004.<br /><br />31 year old, Maggie Fitzgerald is determined to make it as a professional female boxer. But, not if Frankie Dunn has anything to say about it. Spotting her in his gym, Frankie tells Maggie that at her age there is no way that she has a chance (obviously Frankie hasn't watched any of the "Rocky" films).<br /><br />Maggie talks Frankie into being her trainer, telling him that all her life she's been poor "white-trash" and that this is her last ditch effort at doing something, anything with her life. Frankie reluctantly agrees, but, on one condition - Maggie must do everything Frankie teaches her to do & with no "ifs", "ands", or "but's" about it. Over the next four years Maggie trains and becomes a real fighter, but, Frankie is still nervous about her going pro. Reluctantly, again, Frankie makes the descision and lets Maggie go pro. The results are surprising, enthusiastic, and  ultimately tragic.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is one of those films that has points in the film where the director could have taken the film in different & familiar, formulaic directions but doesn't. Before I saw the film, I had heard something of the tragic last-half of "Baby", but, I wasn't told what the tragedy was and exactly where it would be in the film. With that said, there were, for me, a few twists & turns in the film.<br /><br />Hillary Swank is at her best as Maggie & rightfully deserves the Oscar for her portrayal. Eastwood is great as the cranky, crotchety Frankie & you can't help but hear his heart break at the end of the film, when he loses the daughter he found. Eastwood is a Hollywood Legend that will be sorely missed if he retires or, God forbid, passes on.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman turns in, what I hope will be, his most memorable role as one of Frankie's former prize fighters now retired and living & working in Frankie's gym. Freeman's career is rich with different roles that if he were chocalate it would be a mortal sin to eat him.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is one of those films that is a rarity in Hollywood, today. It's worth every well earned penny. This "Baby" is priceless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Clint Eastwood<br /><br />The more I think about this movie, the more I love it.  I am fully convinced that Clint Eastwood is becoming a better filmmaker with each passing year.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby is a movie about Frankie (Eastwood), a grizzled old "cut-man" who owns a boxing gym.  He is the type of man who was old school when the old school was new school.  Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a woman who wants Frankie to train her as a boxer, but being old school, Frankie won't.  She's paid her dues at the gym for the next six months, so he'll let her stay, but he's not going to train her.<br /><br />But because there won't be much of a movie if he doesn't, he does decide to train her.  Maggie is all guts and determination and she really doesn't have anything else going for her in her life.  Her family would be the definition of white trash, and Maggie is only one small but important step away from that.  She has desire to be more.<br /><br />To say more would really spoil the feel of this movie.  Routinely funny and moving, "Million Dollar Baby" is a nearly perfect movie.  Wherever you think the movie is going to go, it doesn't go there.  "Million Dollar Baby" is not a movie about boxing, it is a movie about a boxer.  There is a significant difference and the difference is likely what makes this movie so good.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank, and Clint Eastwood all turn in what may be the best work of their career and that is saying something.  Everyone feels absolutely perfect as their characters and Swank in particular does a fantastic job in becoming Maggie Fitzgerald.  It doesn't feel like Swank is playing a role, it feels like she is Maggie.  The other women who Swank boxes against do a great job making Swank look like the real deal, so the praise really goes to everybody in the movie.<br /><br />There are difficult decisions made in this movie and each one falls in line with what the characters might actually do.  "Million Dollar Baby" does not take a wrong step once and this is a movie that actually surpasses any hype it has been given.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Many viewers may decide not to see Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby because they find the idea of boxing, and particularly women boxing distasteful. If that's the case then they are doing themselves, and the movie a major disservice, because this film is simply one of the best studio released movies of the year. Million Dollar Baby isn't really about boxing - it's about the value of friendship, the importance of loyalty, the betrayals of family, and the terrible price that one can sometimes pay for achieving one's dream.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby is a quiet, intimate, three-person drama, directed with Eastwood's trademark, easygoing style that is both humanistic and down to earth.  There's a visual simplicity to this film and an emotional directness that doesn't pull any punches with the viewer. Much of the film is set in a run down, shabby but tidy looking gym situated in the industrial heart of Los Angeles. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the grizzled owner, and Morgan Freeman plays his best friend Eddie Dupris a former fighter (nicknamed Scrap) whom Frankie managed long ago and who now lives at the gym and also works there as a cleaner.<br /><br />Eddie and Frankie have a good relationship - a relationship that was formed through suffering and regret. Frankie has lost a daughter, his letters to her are returned unopened, and Scrap has lost an eye from a hard fight - but they never let this regret and sense of lament get to them. They are graceful and gentlemanly, and bare advancing age with a sense of humorless sentimentality. Scrap spars with the young would-be tough guys who hang out in the gym, while Frankie reads Yeats, studies Gaelic, and goes to Mass every day, mainly to annoy the prickly young priest with inane theological challenges.<br /><br />Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a waitress who shows up at his gym and won't take no for an answer. Frankie insists that he doesn't train girls, and since Maggie is already in her thirties she's too old to have much chance for glory in any case. But her combination of eagerness, enthusiasm, and discipline wear down Frankie's resistance, and he soon trains Maggie to fight with the best of them. But things don't go exactly as planned and it's downhill when a misguided trip to see Maggie's selfish and self-serving hillbilly family in Missouri ends in frustration and disappointment. The trip is a distressing and painful portent of the larger murkiness to come.<br /><br />Halfway through, the film takes a startling turn that most viewers will not see coming - it becomes dark and foreboding, and the focus of the story totally changes. Full of understated feeling, emotion and heart, the film gives astounding and absolutely heartfelt performances from its three leads, and Swank will probably be picking up the gold statuette for Best Actress, yet again, on Oscar night.<br /><br />Some of the fight scenes are indeed bloody - there's one particular scene where Maggie gets her nose broken, but the violence is never gratuitous and these scenes are quite riveting in the way they are staged. The highlight of the film, however, is the quiet, respectful relationship that develops between Maggie and Frankie. Maggie rediscovers her father in Frankie, and Frankie reconnects with his daughter in Maggie. The final part of the film is an emotional powerhouse of acting, and the decision that both Frankie and Maggie make will leave even the steeliest hearted viewer reeling. Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic ode to the underdog, and with its unobtrusive music score, its subtle cinematography, and its spot-on editing; it is quite simply one of the best films of 2004.

I've seen a lot of movies in my life, and I have to say that "Million Dollar Baby" has got to be one of the ten best movies of all time. It's definitely the best thing Clint Eastwood's ever done, and looking at his impressive list of credits, that's saying a lot!<br /><br />I thought that "Million Dollar Baby" was going to be Eastwood's interpretation of a female Rocky Balboa flick. Indeed, the film starts out that way. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a gym owner and boxing trainer who just lost his most promising fighter to another manager. Dunn has major relationship issues, both with his fighters and with his family: he has a daughter he hasn't spoken to in years. When an aspiring yet inexperienced female fighter (Hilary Swank) shows up on Frankie's doorstep, he doesn't want anything to do with her...Frankie Dunn doesn't train girls! But Maggie is persistent and with a little help from Eddie (Morgan Freeman), Frankie's friend and training partner, Frankie agrees to bend the rules and teach this girl everything he knows. The trainer and his fighter forge an unlikely father-daughter type bond, and they grow closer as Maggie's career continues to excel. Then tragedy strikes, and "Million Dollar Baby" transforms from a boxing movie into one of the most heart-wrenching, character-driven dramas the silver screen has ever seen before.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this film swept the Academy Awards. Swank and Freeman give the performances of their careers. (It was a real shame that Eastwood was snubbed in the Best Actor category...he truly deserved to win.)<br /><br />I don't want to give away any additional details about the movie, but the plot is full of surprises, and the ending is one that you won't expect and might have a hard time dealing with. "Million Dollar Baby" isn't the kind of movie I'll want to watch again and again...it takes too much of an emotional toll on you to watch it more than once. However, it is definitely one of the most amazing movies I've seen in recent years, and quite possibly one of the most powerful films in movie history.<br /><br />Eastwood's pictures keep getting better and better...I can't wait for the next one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>The movie begins powerfuly, showing in development, characters that in the end, you will cry for, mourning painfully as you would for someone whom you truely care for.<br /> So ironic Clint is, a man known for his violence, but alas in the autumn of his life he has viewed violence in the horrific consequences that they come with. As in mystic river or Unforgiven, and lastly, and more importantly Million dollar baby. Hilary Swank was bred for this role, calling on her youth experiences in interviews, but like her character, who was driven and all heart, needed temperance from a wiser sort: Clint Eastwood. Eastwood seems to have the unflagging spirit that is throbbing in his films, when you think he is down and out of his career and you think it is over for him, he comes back anew!<br />  It gives me hope, watching films like this, a rekindling of past flames for film, that honestly, has died down, but every now and then is stoked by fine surprises! In an age where the latest trend is what was last best to sell, it is refreshing to see someone so romantic of times now past. Eastwood is a zeitgeist for his time, where movies were original and always changing, compelling viewers to go to the cinema and experience something creative. Not re-hashes and countless sequels! All of these things can be said of Million dollar baby, which I adore.<br /> Don't look to find politics in this beautifully poignant film, where, if you have the ill will, could fine. Instead, rather appreciate the story, because lets face it, Clint is not political in this film. Meaning he does not draw you to one side of a battle of controversy, or to the other. It is a movie you will not find in the documentary section, it is a piece of work, meant to be expressive emotionally. Not meant to pitch a campaign.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Although I personally preferred Eastwood's prior year adaption of "Mystic River"; there is no question that he crafted another superb film with "Million Dollar Baby", in a year that had no hobbits, and thus, not as much competition.  When you stand back and view Eastwood's growth as a director, the choices he makes, the marvelous way he inspires his actors, well, there's not the hype of Martin Scorsese, but there certainly is finer craftsmanship.  (Note:  Try to forget "Bloodwork"; in that Eastwood took a marvelous Connelly story and tripped it up by playing a role for which he was far too old. The miscasting eventually sunk the production.)<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is the story of a hard knocks kid, Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank.  Swank showed great ability in "Boys Don't Cry", but she's awaited a film and a script like this for years.  In Maggie, she comes of age.  In Maggie's life, the constant is the memory of her father, perhaps the only person who has ever been kind to her before.  Eastwood, as grizzled trainer Frankie, is less than kind, but grudgingly agrees to train her at the behest of his sidekick, Eddie (Morgan Freeman) a jack of all trades at Frankie's run down gym.<br /><br />Eddie's got a secret - he knows Frankie won't put his fighters in jeopardy, and he helps the hungriest of them leave to take risks at catching a title fight.  But Maggie, for whom Frankie has become the surrogate father (she's been missing since his death), refuses to leave the man who has given her the reason to go on.  She's a remarkable fighter, tough and needy, with skills sharpened by Frankie's tutelage, and, against all odds, she succeeds.  Maggie's inevitable downfall is caused by a world-class opponent, with few cares about how she takes Maggie out.  Indeed, although Eastwood pinpoints his focus to his three main characters, with only bit parts on the periphery, take note of Lucia Rijker, as Billie, the Blue Bear.  She plays her role with terrifying lust and need to win at all costs.  (She scared the hxxx out of me at the theater!)<br /><br />During Maggie's rise, perhaps the most touching aspect of the movie is the hook by Frankie in nicknaming her with a Gaelic phrase, one that makes every man and woman jack in each and every audience a fan.  Maggie never knows, until a particularly moving scene between Swank and Eastwood later on, just what it means.  And what it conveys is his love for her, his young fighter.  It's a love that he might have had for his own daughter, but in an intriguing aside, Eastwood gives us a shadow of Frankie's own personal tragedy involving his estrangement from that daughter, and his ongoing battle with his religious beliefs as to why it occurred.<br /><br />Freeman is a constant.  He was better in "Shawshank" and "Glory" than he is here...his contribution here is best in his narration.  Winning the Oscar for "Million" is an award for his fabulous body of filmwork, not just this one performance.  Eastwood, as Frankie, is spare and believable.  He throws all of what he has into the making of the film, but still leaves enough of himself on the table to weave intricately with the center performance of Swank.  The filming, costumes, music are all angular and supportive of the drama enacted in center stage; they are essential to the story, they do not detract.  And the twist of the film, after Maggie is injured, is a true to life drama that is played out on small stages all across this great land of ours.  I don't want to get into the controversy over assisted suicide, but frankly, Eastwood did not overplay his hand here, he just told the tale as it should be.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby is a graceful testament to what good filmmaking is all about.  It deserved the Oscar, although it is not as good or as memorable as some of Eastwood's earlier work.  But the film will stay with you, winding through your subconscious, flashes of quiet brilliance, days after you leave the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Although the story in Million Dollar Baby is not something entirely unique, and one might be tempted to dismiss it as a "female boxing movie", such a characterization would be overly simplistic and unfair. The story is really about building deep relationships with people who seem unlikely allies, about choosing your own family when your own family disappoints you, and choosing your battles (both literally and figuratively). Often, those closest to us and who understand us best are not in fact people related to us by the accident of being family but are people with whom we find ourselves sharing life's best and/or worst moments. The kind of bonds and indeed "love" that is unconditional, as the film deftly illustrates. Nothing breaks that kind of loyalty.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman narrates the story of a gym owner/boxing trainer, Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who (battling his own personal demons) very reluctantly agrees to train an eager, ambitious female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). Frankie and Maggie build a very solid rapport, and this bond seems to grow. As it grows, this bond fills a hole in Frankie's life that has been bothering him for a long time (the estrangement from his daughter, for example, has haunted and hurt him for years, leading him to make daily visits to church, where he pesters his frustrated priest). The relationship Maggie and Frankie forge is real, is close, is loyal and familial... he looks after her and feels for her like a father for his daughter. When Maggie's family uses her and attempts to manipulate her (while making fun of her), Frankie is there for Maggie, wishing to protect her from this "sponging" family dynamic.<br /><br />While the entire cast is wonderful, and Morgan Freeman turns in an amazing performance, the most remarkable aspect of Hilary Swank's career and double Oscar win is that she was once FIRED from Beverly Hills, 90210, which could easily make almost any actor give up, but Swank chose to fight and thrive on a small failure, proving her own tenacity and clout. The understated, excellent performances create a vivid, deeply moving (and quite sad) story, definitely worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>This film, based on ROPE BURNS: STORIES FROM THE CORNER by F. X. Toole, is about as close to perfect as a movie gets in spite of its being about boxing and therefore extremely violent. Director/actor Clint Eastwood (Frankie Dunn), Hilary Swank (Maggie Fitzgerald) and Morgan Freeman (Eddie Dupris) give flawless performances. Freeman is cast here as a down but not out exboxer, the seasoned sage, a part he always does well. Eastwood as the tough, aging boxing coach with lots of psychic baggage, is more emotional and human here than in any role I remember. Swank, however, is incomparable. Apparently there is no part too difficult for her. Here she is the poorest of the poor, a waitress who takes leftover food home-- a fighter in every sense of the word-- who gets the first chance ever to be somebody as a boxer.<br /><br />The film would have been perfect if Maggie's family had been a little more human rather than cardboard versions of redneck white trash and Frankie's Catholic priest could have left the safety of his parish if only briefly to walk in Frankie's shoes. There probably are trailer park types and priests who are this inflexible, but a little more tolerance of them on the director's part would have made for a better movie.<br /><br />The film's ending raises serious ethical questions and makes a profound statement about the redemptive power of love, wherever you find it, and what makes up a family. It is as good as the critics say.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>A couple of points here. I'm a young guy, in New York, back from overseas, alone. It's 1976. I'm in my apartment. It's morning, I'm shaving. Gene Shallit is on the TV in the living room. He's droning on about something. Apparently he's seen a movie the night before. All I can hear him tell the blond 'hostess de jour' is, " . . . it's not about boxing."<br /><br />If Rocky I wasn't about boxing (the ONLY Rocky for you afficionados), then Million Dollar Baby (MDB) is not only not about boxing, it's not about Hollywood. MDB is a pulsating cut above the eyebrow of a brave fighter. It's a broken nose. It's a eye which will swell shut in about 90 seconds. It's life. That's all. No more, no less. The sweet science ain't sweet, and the joy of life when it comes should be both emptied and acknowledged.<br /><br />That Eastwood delivers a story about life, that Swank has so much wisdom with that darn hillbilly accent, that Freeman has so much dignity and insight like a soothsayer and visionary, is kudos to Eastwood the director, not the actor. (Although the actor is brilliant as well.)<br /><br />Margaret Fitzgerald is a down and out child-woman from humble beginnings. Very humble beginnings. She's 31 years old and wants to celebrate her birthday in Frankie Dunn's boxing gym, "The Hit Pit."<br /><br />"My mama's 300 pounds, my sister's pregnant. My brother's in prison. My pappy's dead. I'm all I got. And this is the only thing I got."<br /><br />That Eastwood as Frankie Dunn would become a father figure to her was not as clear to me as to some others and I felt was the easy explanation. That he would give her unqualified love and that unqualified love was available to her and that she could muster the willingness to accept it was the more substantial tour de force, I believe. That he had unqualified love to give is astonishing to him. It is a love that doesn't pander to the usual Hollywood confusion and dysfunction. It is just there. The dialogue between the Catholic Priest and Frankie would be priceless except for the dialogue between Eastwood and Freeman.<br /><br />You will think about the movie for months after you see it. It is not Michael Moore's rambling. It's not high tech. No Robots or sex. It's about us. It's about a lesson for us that we should know when we've done what we came for. I don't know that I've seen a better movie in ten years. 5 stars.

Million Dollar Baby is a great film and Hillary Swank is a magnificent actress. Her performance in these frames was as strong as it was in Boys Don't Cry. As far as her relationship with Eastwood's Dunn goes their bond was totally believable as a union between a daughterless father and a fatherless daughter. I know that some of my fellow conservatives were sickened by the ending. Frankly, I wasn't. While I would not have done what the main character (Eastwood) did, his actions did not ruin the film for me. I typically don't judge theatrical releases by how much they reflect my own core beliefs though. Regardless of values, Million Dollar Baby deserves its reputation. It is a superior drama and--luckily--not a melodrama.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Personally, I wasn't even that excited to see this movie but all of the rave reviews made me have to. The movie is a masterpiece, as good as Unforgiven, probably even better. These 2 movies are my favorite Clint Eastwood movies. Like Unforgiven, you should want to watch this movie let alone for the excellent reviews and 4 oscars!<br /><br />The movie is very unique in its own because it will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and boo. Now, that's something to see. Also, the acting in the movie is brilliant. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, 2 of the best actors of all time shine in this one. Hilary Swank also gives a remarquable performance as does the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The movie is about Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a woman boxer who finally convinces Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to become her trainer. Frankie is a sad man who owns a gym and is a boxing trainer and manager. He goes to church very often as he misses his daughter. You pity him because his daughter won't talk to him and returns all of his letters unread. He is a sad man. All he has is his gym and his friend Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). That's until he trains Maggie. Maggie becomes one hell of a fighter and knocks out most of her opponents in the first round (in a rather comical way). Maggie is to Frankie, his daughter that he never had. It helps him to forget about his daughter who is hurting him and now he has a good friend and a daughter figure. The movie develops at a great pace and is always exciting. But, the end is very sad and tragic and is unlike other PG-13 movies. If you would have to see one PG-13 movie out of all of them, definitely make it this one. This is now on my wish list to buy and is a beautiful masterpiece. It's a movie that everyone will cherish and love. Everything in the movie is perfect besides one thing. The F word is used once... Guess by who... A preacher/ pastor!!!!!!!!! Thats kind of strange.. But anyway, this is an excellent movie that EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD should see, and if you haven't seen it yet... well...you should IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>Although ostensibly a boxing movie, "Million Dollar Baby" is so much more than the usual good guy/bad guy story with the good guy ultimately triumphing.  No, this is a film of nuances and unexpected twists.  It is alternatively violent, moving, simple and complex.  It is the best film of the past 12 months.<br /><br />With Client Eastwood producing, directing, starring and writing the music, his stamp is all over "Million Dollar Baby".  And Eastwood is magnificent.  He has delivered a film that is totally believable and engrossing.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" covers the career of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) as she attempts to rise above her poor background as a virtual hillbilly from Missouri to a world boxing champion.  Trailer park trash made good.  Maggie's path forward is littered with potholes but she has an inner strength that seems to overcome all obstacles.  Yet, the moment of her ultimate triumph also becomes a turning point to tragedy.<br /><br />Maggie is guided, initially reluctantly, by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who also has his own demons to overcome.  He is a devout Catholic man but often troubled by personal dilemmas which only grow as the film progresses.  His dilemmas are part of the film's magnetism.<br /><br />There are some who may not wish to see a film that is based on boxing.  The noble sport is also a violent one.  However, do not let this squeamishness deter the viewer from seeing a magnificent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>Awards:<br /><br />2005 Academy Award: Best Actress: Hilary Swank<br /><br />2005 Academy Award: Best Director: Clint Eastwood<br /><br />2005 Academy Award: Best Supporting Actor: Morgan Freeman<br /><br />2005 Academy Award: Best Picture<br /><br />2005 Academy Award: Best Actor nominee: Clint Eastwood<br /><br />2005 Academy Award: Best Film Editing nominee<br /><br />2005 Academy Award: Best Writing Adapted Screenplay nominee<br /><br />......And VERY much deserved!!

Clint Eastwood is an experienced director who doesn't need overt, stylistic flourishes to make his point. His movies are the epitome of understatement. Fresh from the critical success of Mystic River, he is back with another minimalist yet thematically dark drama that works its way into your head in a powerful and emotionally affective way.<br /><br />While filmmakers like Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino belong to the Wal-Mart school of filmmaking with their obvious, overstated movies, Eastwood is couture-subtle, graceful filmmaking. Million Dollar Baby bucks the current trend that most Hollywood films adhere to by trying desperately to appeal to the largest demographic possible, usually a young one with disposable income. Eastwood isn't interested in demographics or test screenings.<br /><br />First and foremost, his movie is about characters and telling a story-a true rarity these days. He takes his time telling the story, letting us get to know the characters and settle into this world full of hard-working people who get by the best that they can with what they have. They aren't sophisticated people but have a quiet dignity. Million Dollar Baby explores the complex morality of death. It is not an easy matter and Eastwood doesn't let us off with easy answers. He keeps things honest and there is an authenticity to the way the characters act, feel and speak that avoids the tired cliches that fail most movies.<br /><br />The first DVD includes a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second DVD begins with a featurette called "Born to Fight," that examines the characters in the movie. Real life boxer Lucia Rijker who trained Hilary Swank and was one her opponents in the movie talks about the art of boxing, coming off as quite eloquent and passionate about not just the sport but the movie as well.<br /><br />"The Producers' Round 15" explores the origins of the movie. Producer Albert S. Ruddy recounts how he convinced F.X. Toole to option his book and get it away from HBO who was also interested in adapting it. This is an excellent look at how this project came together.<br /><br />This brings us to "James Lipton Takes on Three," that features the host of The Actors Studio interviewing Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Swank right after they each won an Academy Award for the movie. Lipton is his usual pretentious self as he treats every question that he asks like it was the most important words ever spoken. Thankfully, the three actors cut through all of this as Freeman calls the Oscars a contest while Eastwood is his usual low-key self.<br /><br />Finally, the last disc contains Eastwood's elegant and understated score for Million Dollar Baby.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Nominated for 5 Golden Globes and 7 Academy Awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year, Million Dollar Baby opened to widespread critical acclaim and excellent audience reviews. Director Clint Eastwood, whose career spans multiple decades in Hollywood, creates perhaps his greatest film to date, and co-stars Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption) and Hilary Swank (Boys Don't Cry) light up the screen with their deft character portrayals and unique charisma. Combining all the inspiration of Rocky with all the drama of a Greek tragedy, Million Dollar Baby is well-deserved of its Best Picture victory (despite the many protests of competing directors who think Eastwood won based on nostalgia for his heralded career and his personal likeability)...<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby focuses on tough-skinned boxing manager Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), proprietor of a local training gym who has long been estranged from his lone daughter and seems to have only one friend of note - Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Eddie lives in and helps manage the gym, and he was once one of Frankie's fighters. With Big Willie Little (Mike Colter, who once appeared in ER) under Frankie's management, the gym hosts the daily workouts of a legitimate heavyweight title contender. But Frankie's reluctance to move Big Willie along prompts him to switch to a less conservative manager, and Frankie must watch his years of hard work pay off for someone else. Meanwhile, 30-something Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) has scraped together the pennies and nickels necessary to train at the gym on a daily basis. Despite Frankie's advice to quit making a fool of herself, she borrows equipment from Eddie and works out until all hours of the night...<br /><br />With Big Willie out of the picture, Frankie finally confronts Maggie and agrees to train her. Over time, the two develop a close relationship akin to father/daughter. Maggie rises in the ranks of the female circuit until she reaches the title fight where a cheap sucker punch leads to tragic consequences... With emotional depth and colorful characters, Million Dollar Baby brings one of the most controversial issues of modern society into the forefront for an up-close-and-personal glimpse of the conflict and struggle experienced by trauma victims and their loved ones. Hilary Swank's Oscar winning performance is on full display, and Morgan Freeman is his usual mesmerizing presence...<br /><br />In the end, Million Dollar Baby beat out a number of excellent films in order to claim the Oscar for Best Picture - Finding Neverland, Ray, Sideways, and The Aviator (which prompted director Martin Scorsese to flee the awards ceremony in a huff). A case could be made for each of these fine films, but needless to say, Million Dollar Baby's victory is highly indicative of the film's enduring value. Each of the main characters comes across as likeable, the relationships as believable, and the storyline as inspirational and stirring. Million Dollar Baby is one of those rare films that stays in your head for hours on end long after you've walked out of the theater. Its subject matter is serious fodder for debate, and few viewers will fail to develop a strong emotional connection to Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman as they spring to life on the big screen. Quite simply, Million Dollar Baby is one of the best films of the decade and one you won't want to miss...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br></body></html>

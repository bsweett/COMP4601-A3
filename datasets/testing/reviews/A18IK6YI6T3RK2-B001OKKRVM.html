I really had no idea what these Emperor Penquins went through to mate and procreate, it was fascinating.  I loved the part in which you see the courtship, it was very touching and the penguins are just beautiful, their colors are so vivid.  I just kept thinking how in the world did the filmmakers accomplish this, it was beyond frigid, I mean even the penguins were freezing.  That is the great thing about this DVD, the extra's show you how the film was created, that is almost as interesting as the film..almost.  I found it interesting that in the end you realize why they traveled so far to mate, it makes total sence.  If you appreciate great filmmaking, then I cannot imagine you being disappointed in this wonderful piece of art.  Fantastic film.</p></body></html>

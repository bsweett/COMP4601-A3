Reviewers and viewers answer the question differently.  In a sense, both are right.  The movie is faithful to the book as far as basic plot, characters, and atmosphere.  There are changes made that are not in the book, but these changes are usually for the purpose of a) helping the viewer understand the historic setting, such as the movie's beginning, or b) adding to the entertainment value of the movie, adding humor (e.g. the beavers) or suspense (I don't remember the children riding a piece of ice in the original, though it has been well over 25 years since I read the book).<br /><br />IS THE MOVIE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN?  If and only if a parent accompanies them.  This movie lives up to the PG rating.  Other reviewers pointed out there is plenty of scariness in the movie, especially the battle scene.  But I don't think there is anything that would be overly traumatic if the child is accompanied by the parent.  (By the way, I believe that the parent should be with the child in viewing any movie or any TV show.)<br /><br />IS THE MOVIE A "CHRISTIAN MOVIE"?  Disney making a Christian movie?  Seriously, there are themes that a Christian would recognize in the movie, which would need to be there to be faithful to the book.  These allusions are such that a non-Christian would miss them, without losing appreciation for the story.  This is not like "The Passion."  However, a Christian can use the film in witnessing to unbelievers, pointing out the parallels between Aslan and Jesus.<br /><br />Allow me to make a few other comments.  I think Tilda Swinson did a good job with the character.  One reviewer used the term underplayed.  In some stories, the villain is more interesting, memorable, and maybe even likeable than the hero, and Swinson's performance keeps this from happening.  I also loved the beavers.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the release of Prince Caspian, the next of the series.  If it is half as good as this movie, it would be very good.</p></body></html>

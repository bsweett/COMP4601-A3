<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good for a Biopic"></head><body><p>Alright, let's cut to the end of the page: there is literally nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before. In fact, it's pretty much the same thing as "Ray" from the previous year, only with more subdued and less hammy performances. This movie was meant to be Oscar bait, and Reese Witherspoon did indeed walk away with a statuette, so mission accomplished. That being said...<br /><br />Walk the Line is the Johnny Cash biopic, and within the quite codified conventions of the biopic (especially musical biopic) genre, it is quite good, at times, even excellent. If you didn't see this movie in the theaters, you missed quite a show, because the musical numbers here are something that most home audio systems won't be able to replicate. The director, James Mangold, does an outstanding job of staging these sequences, and it is easy to see how Cash's music electrified listeners at the time. It even delivered a sizable jolt to me, and I generally dislike country music (most music, for that matter). Joaquin Phoenix and Witherspoon are magnificent on stage, I suppose that technically they are better singers than the performers they are playing. Since the music is one of the big draws, I figured I would comment separately on it and just say that this part is fantastically executed.<br /><br />As for the rest of it...credit Mangold and his screenwriters for not folding in every musical biopic cliche into their movie. There's no Freudian back door that conveniently wraps up everything, as in "Ray", which was completely untrue as to Charles' problems in real life. There is a groaner when Witherspoon tells Cash, "You cain't walk no line," after a drunken, drugged-up, all-night jam session with his band. Still, this is familiar territory for anyone who as seen a biopic or gets VH-1 on their TV. The execution is better than most, but people who come to watch a completely original story or want to find some sort of message will be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, this movie succeeds at what it tries to be, and for that, I give it 4 stars. One gripe though: even though Reese Witherspoon's Oscar was deserved, just looking at the last couple of years' worth of Oscar wins shows a pattern that anyone who is not a "serious" actor that plays a pop culture celebrity and does a good impersonation seems to be a shoo-in for an Oscar. I guess Jim Carrey's only mistake wasn't that he wasn't as good as the guy that won, he just picked out the wrong role--maybe a biopic about the secret inner life of David Bowie would get him some gold? Seriously, imitation can win awards, but let's tone it down, before Jamie Foxx wins Oscar #2 for "Stevie". Bunz singing "Cherie Amor". God help us.</p></body></html>

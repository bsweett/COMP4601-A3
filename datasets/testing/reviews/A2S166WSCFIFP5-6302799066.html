<meta name="summary" content="quite possibly the best movie ever made"></head><body><p>I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick--there are very few directors who rank up there with him. This is Kubrick's best movie, and I'd definitely put it in the top five ever made. It's a dark satire, with stellar performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden. And Peter Sellers' performance in all three of his roles is one of the best I've seen. It's shot in black & white, and very beautiful. And of course in a Kubrick film, everything means something. Unfortunately it isn't a widescreen edition, and there is no commentary, but those are the only faults I can find. There's a short documentary on Kubrick's shorts and early films. There's a pretty good documentary on the Making of Dr. Strangelove. The animated menu is done simply and brillaintly. It has the original theatrical trailor for the film, which was pretty cutting edge. Also there is the trailer for Fail Safe, and for some reason they threw in the trailer for Anatomy of a Murder, though I don't really see why. Even the case it comes in is elegantly designed. This is a dvd you definitely want to get, and a movie that should be watched over and over. Definitely in the top five ever made (along with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, North by Northwest, and Fight Club).</p></body></html>

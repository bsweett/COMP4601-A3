<meta name="summary" content="Crazies Remake DVD Loaded with Decent Extras"></head><body><p>There is an audio commentary by director Breck Eisner who, rather appropriately, starts off talking about how he got involved in the project. He wanted the film's focus to be on the townsfolk, specifically David and Judy Dutton. He admits that initially he did not want to remake a Romero film but after watching the original again felt that he could increase the scale of it and update the premise to reflect contemporary issues. Eisner touches upon various aspects, including casting and locations, while also eloquently analyzing the film's themes.<br /><br />"Behind the Scenes with Breck Eisner" is a pretty standard if not well-made making of featurette that mixes interview soundbites with clips from the film. Eisner points out that an early version of the script he read had more of a balance between depicting the townsfolk and the military but he wanted to focus more on the town with an emphasis on horror rather than action.<br /><br />"Paranormal Pandemics" takes a look at how the filmmaker designed the infected. The original design looked too much like zombies and so they went for a more vein-y look. We see actors getting fantastic-looking makeup applied. Eisner explains the three stages of infection and expanded on Romero's original concept. They based the makeup on actual infections to give an added realism to the film.<br /><br />"The George A. Romero Template" features filmmakers like Phantasm auteur Don Coscarelli and pundits from various horror film websites singing the praises of Romero's films and how influential they are. Naturally, they talk about the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJDA">The Crazies</a> film and its relevance now.<br /><br />"Make-Up Mastermind: Rob Hall in Action" goes into more detail about how they created the infected makeup. It's pretty cool to see how they do it and how realistic it looks.<br /><br />"The Crazies Motion Comic Episodes 1 & 2" features simplistic animated comic book art providing the backstory to the events depicted in the film.<br /><br />"Visual Effects in Motion" takes a look at a few sequences before CGI was added and how, by stages, they achieved the end result. It is interesting to see how much a given sequence is enhanced by CGI.<br /><br />Also included are a teaser and two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Finally, there is a "Behind the Scenes Photo Gallery" featuring shots of the cast and crew at work.</p></body></html>

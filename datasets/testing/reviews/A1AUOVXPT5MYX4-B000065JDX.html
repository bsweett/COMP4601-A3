<meta name="summary" content=""From Dusk Till Dawn" is a macho guy flick with style and substance"></head><body><p>From Dusk Till Dawn" is one of those films that never tires out, no matter how many times I've seen it over 20 times. With Quentin Tarantino's brilliant writing and Robert Rodriguez's flashy direction, how can we go wrong? One of the key elements that adds to this film's good quality is the character development. How often do you watch an action film where two characters are about to get killed, yet there's a character development sequence preceding their death? That's how the movie opens. The tone is set with a conversation between an overworked Texas ranger (Michael Parks) and a puny liquor store clerk. All the other characters are well-developed as well. Yet the development of these characters never seem to ruin the pace. In fact, it brings you into the film even more.<br /><br /> George Clooney is a very convincing villain, and was perfectly cast. Quentin Tarantino is good as his paranoid, whiny, perverse, psychotic brother--though I don't know if that's much of a stretch for him. The great Harvey Keitel gives a brilliant, subtle, underrated performance as a faithless former minister, who now has to regain his faith when faced with these demons (vampires) from hell. I think it's one of his best performances, and definitely a lot different from his usual roles. Cheech Marin is amusing in three (that's right! three!) performances: a border patrol guard, a greasy bouncer and a Mexican dealer. Eddie Murphy, look out! Juliette Lewis, though she's significantly older than the character she's playing, plays a nice supporting role. Another score for Ernest Liu who gives a fine debut performance as Keitel's adopted Japanese son. Salma Hayek is sexy as ever in the role that put her on the map.<br /><br />Personally, I felt the film worked out better as a crime drama than a horror movie. I enjoyed the second half, but I enjoyed the first half a lot better. The horror portion is very well-done, and not the least bit cheesy, but the film seems to go a little off-balance in its transition. Nevertheless, it's still a blast! And Rodriguez is very original in reprising one of the most-known sub-genres of horror: the vampire movie. He does a great job at combining dark comedy with the gratuitous violence and gore. For example, when Cheech turns (into a vampire) he approaches the terrified Juliette Lewis and says, "You know what people say about me: I suck!" One to keep and enjoy over and over again</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Maria's Journey"></head><body><p>According to the director's commentary, Joshua Marston's original inspiration for his movie "Maria Full of Grace" was reading an article about Columbian drug mules risking their lives to transport drugs into the United States. He then sat down at his computer, and in a fevered rush, wrote the screenplay for the movie in two days. The end result has wonderful intentions, and a mesmerizing performance by Catalina Sandino Moreno who plays Maria, with the end result being somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />The most wonderful thing about this movie is the main character of Maria, a headstrong flower worker with big problems in her familia. Her life in Colombia is less than ideal, with a boyfriend who's a lout who manages to inpregnate her quickly. She quits her job, drawing the ire of both her sister and mother who depend on the cash to live. In searching for another job, she happens on a young motorcycle rider with connections to Columbia's drug world, and convinces her ultimately to become a drug mule. Thus begins her journey.<br /><br />Maria, played flawlessly by the impressive and beautiful Catalina Sandino Moreno, is headstrong and purposeful. As Maria encounters problems entering the United States by some suspicious immigration officers, she is brilliant enough to lie convincingly, while having luck turn in her favor. Navigating herself through New York, unable to speak the language, she manages to keep herself and her friend Bianca away from some Columbian baddies. Maria relies on herself through this film, and it's refreshing to watch how she manages such a task.<br /><br />However, the script somewhat lets down the film. For example, the plane ride over to New York has some scenes of suspense, but they were somewhat downplayed to advance the story along. The potentially edginess of being hunted by the Columbian drug runners in New York City is somewhat downplayed to advance Maria's decision she makes at the end of the film. This film had the great potential to put Maria in much more danger than it did. Perhaps the screenwriter felt protective of Maria and didn't want to endanger her any more than he did. But perhaps if he did, the film would have been stronger overall.<br /><br />The film does manage to show how an innocent girl manages to make a decision to become a drug mule, and how the policies of the United States in the drug war are ineffective at best. "Maria Full of Grace"'s scope is a bit wide, but the net cast by Catalina Sandino Moreno in her role of Maria will be a portend of great things to come from her.</p></body></html>

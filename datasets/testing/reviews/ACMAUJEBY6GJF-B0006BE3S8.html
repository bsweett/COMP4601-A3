<meta name="summary" content="The strange thing is that..."></head><body><p>...I have to agree with those who give the movie 1 star and those who give it 4 (but that is how far as it goes because it's not a 5 star movie!). The thing is that Alien vs Predator could have been a lot worse. The way the creatures look (the aliens/alien-predators I mean), well, they're perfect "in their ugliness". And the rest of the movie looks good too. The pyramid, the halls. Well, the movie works visually, it works indeed -the problem is what Alien-fans notice too many times during AvP, the lack of research and "history" behind the previous Alien-movies (I haven't seen the Predator-movies). As a fan of Alien 1-3 I must say that this movie is not worthy of becoming a part of the Alien-saga. But at the same time -because of my low expectaions (real low) the movie surprised me in a positive way as an entertaining, watchable piece. And still the creators lack of "inspiration" (or so it seems) makes the whole experience a little "braindead". And sometimes embarrasing.<br /><br />The picture is fantastic, the sound too (dts) - but the acting is not very good (and I'm not surprised). But remember that the acting in Camerons' Aliens wasn't much to brag about either. What this movie is missing is a Ripley-character (and an actress like Weaver of course)!<br /><br />There are many flaws in AvP, and this way the scriptwriter and director Paul Anderson seems a bit lazy -and he does not impress me. And all in all this movie does not make me "hunger" for yet another sequel. It's watchable, that's all and I've seen the so-called "extended" version on the extreme edition. The movie is missing nerve, and adventure not least. The magic isn't quite there, and it surprises me that they used this director. The only good thing about his previous work "Event Horizon" is the sound. His storytelling seem to be missing something.<br /><br />3 stars, nothing more - nothing less.</p></body></html>

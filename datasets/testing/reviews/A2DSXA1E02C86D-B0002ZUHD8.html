<meta name="summary" content="Guinevere risks frostbite"></head><body><p>The King Arthur legend, burgeoning from Geoffrey of Monmouth's HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRITAIN (12th century) and Thomas Malory's LE MORT DE ARTHUR (15th century), has taken on a life of it own so embellished as to obscure the meager facts known about the 5th century Briton that made an enduring name for himself ostensibly battling the invasion of Germanic tribes. Historians don't even know what part of Britain Arthur hailed from, being variously assigned to Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland. And there's no contemporary historical evidence that he was a king at all. King Arthur has been, and will remain, a conveniently blank page on which Hollywood scriptwriters can pen just about any story they want so long as it includes lots of swordplay, male bonding between noble knights, and a Hot Babe (Guinevere).<br /><br />In this screen version, Clive Owen plays Arthur, a half-Roman, half-British cavalry commander stationed on Hadrian's Wall at the time the Big House back in Italy decides to abandon the province to the barbarians. The traditional knights of Arthur's Round Table - Lancelot, Bors, Gawain, et al - are Sarmatian warriors at the end of a 15-year conscription into the Roman occupation army. (Sarmatia was an ancient territory way over by the Caspian Sea.) Before gaining possession of their demob papers after years of fighting local Briton insurgents, the knights must accompany Arthur on one last mission, i.e., to rescue a patrician Roman family living north of the Wall whose villa is about to be overrun by an inconvenient horde of Saxon invaders.<br /><br />This KING ARTHUR is refreshing in that it abandons the silliness of the otherwise excellent EXCALIBUR (1981) which played along with the traditional misconceptions regarding elaborate castle architecture and personal fighting armor that actually didn't arrive in the British Isles for centuries. Here, Arthur isn't even a king, at least until the conclusion. And Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is a pagan Druid found chained-up by Arthur in the cellar torture chamber of the Roman aristocrat, a Christian, that Arthur is sent to rescue. The film's creators take this opportunity to take a swipe at the infant Roman (Catholic) Church by making Guinevere's jailers mad monks. Once released, Knightley's character is either muddy or daubed with Druidic war paint, and dressed in shoulder or midriff-baring costumes totally unsuitable for the cold, snowy weather. No frumpy animal skins for her!<br /><br />The generally cheesy dialogue and standard battle sequences make this a three-star film, but which I'm elevating to four in consideration of the costuming, however unrealistic, the gorgeous Irish exterior sets, and the occasionally engaging performances of Ioan Gruffudd and Ray Winstone as Lancelot and Bors respectively. Owen is suitably dark and rugged as the driven, charismatic Arthur. And he cuts a fine figure against the skyline mounted on his steed with breastplate, plumed helmet, and streaming cavalry standard. Keira's Guinevere isn't much more than eye candy, though she wields a mean bow and arrow.<br /><br />If I had to choose between KING ARTHUR and the previously mentioned EXCALIBUR, I'd have to go with the latter, a visually stunning piece of filmmaking up in the five-star category that features superb performances by Nigel Terry as Arthur, Nicole Williamson as Merlin, and Helen Mirren as Morgana, plus a soundtrack to knock your socks off.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unlimited Focker?"></head><body><p>"Meet the Parents" fame introduces the Focker family. Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand) play the parents of Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller).<br /><br />Robert De Niro (Jack Byrnes) returns as the father of Pam (Teri Polo). Gaylord and Pam are engaged but want the blessing from both parents. The whole film is based on Jack looking for Gaylord's flaws to expose to Pam. And a reason to dissolved there wedding.<br /><br />The potential in-laws Bernie and Roz are very affectionate in public and private. They teach Gaylord that there is no winner and loser. Everyone is a winner. Hence, they display all of Gaylord's trophies albeit seventh place or below. A shrine is built on a wall for everyone to "envy" at. Well that is contrasting to Jack Byrnes where you either win or you're a loser.<br /><br />The parent's differ in values, parental methods and personalities, thus giving the film some comedic options that the viewer can relate to. This gives some value to the film.<br /><br />This film has some good laughs utilizing the stepson. Of course utilizing the running jokes (Everything Focker!) through out the film keeps the viewer interested, but cannot excel this film into a classic comedy.<br /><br />This DVD is a good one viewing option. Purchase this DVD for "display only" value, so there is a viewing option for unexpected company.</p></body></html>

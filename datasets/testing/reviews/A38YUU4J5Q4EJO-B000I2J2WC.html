<meta name="summary" content="If you liked National Treasure...you will love this !!"></head><body><p>This movie has one of the best thought out and tightest plots I have ever seen. It reminds me a lot of the movie "National Treasure" in that it has a solid and important focus to the story, and that we go through MUCH action and adventure to get there!<br /><br />In National Treasure, it was a map on the back of the Declaration of Independance, On DaVinci Code, We are chasing the Holy Grail. Although I am of Christian Faith, I still thought this movie very intruging , although I know it has offended some Christians, bacause it blows what we believe right out of the water!<br /><br />The plot to this movie was so intracatly woven, I just can't get over it.<br />Without giving too much away, Tom Hanks is a professor who teaches about symbolism, but soon finds himself caught up on a quest for the  Holy Grail, along with a young woman, and an older gentleman, and always with the police and religious hiarchy close on his heels.<br /><br />I just can't say enough how much you will love this masterpiece!It not only keeps you right on the edge of your seat, but it also is very intelligent, and will leave you thinking about it long after it's over.</p></body></html>

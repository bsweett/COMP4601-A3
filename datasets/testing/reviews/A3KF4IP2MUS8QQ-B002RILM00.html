<meta name="summary" content="Worth watching just for its unconventional ending"></head><body><p>Here I am, having finally decided that I no longer dislike Nicolas Cage as an actor, and now I have to evaluate his role in The Wicker Man, a distinctly odd film that never manages to live up to its potential.  If you like your plots loose, disjointed, and full of unanswered questions, this is your film.  (Personally, I have a hard time figuring out why one of my favorite actresses, Leelee Sobieski, is stuck playing a fairly insignificant role in any film, but that's just me.)  Still, despite quite an over-the-top performance by Cage and a less than stellar plot, this movie isn't all that bad, especially for those who have never seen the original film.  One thing you cannot take away from The Wicker Man is its distinctly un-Hollywoodlike ending.  The conclusion alone makes the film worth watching, if you ask me, because it throws a monkey wrench into the years of programming droned into our heads by Hollywood lackies lacking the guts to rock any cinematic boats.  This modern incarnation of The Wicker Man may be a fairly disappointing movie overall, but the ending will greatly defy most viewers' expectations - and I count that as a good thing.<br /><br />The beginning of the film can boast of its own fair amount of shock value, as well - a traumatic accident that sends officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) for quite a loop.  Then, from out of nowhere, he gets a letter from his former fianc&eacute;e asking for his help in finding her missing daughter.  This girl, Willow (Kate Beahan, who's quite a looker in my book) basically walked out on him for no reason a number of years earlier, so it's strange for her to be contacting him now.  It's also strange that the letter arrived with no stamps or postage.  The strangest thing of all, though, is the fact that this letter is a model of calligraphy, not exactly the kind of writing you would expect to see from the hand of a mother desperately worried about her missing daughter.  Edward bites, though, and takes it upon himself to head out to Summersisle, a mysterious, very private island off the Washington coast, to try and help Willow find her daughter.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious from the start that Summersisle is the abode of a crazy back-to-nature, feminist witch-like cult, so Edward would not have been welcomed with open arms even if he hadn't thrown his weight around like he's Columbo come to solve the big mystery of the week (even a bunch of reclusive pagan cultists probably know that a California badge counts for jack squat on a private island hundreds of miles away).  Being a traffic cop and not an investigator, Edward has a heck of a time just figuring out whether the girl, Rowan ever existed, if she actually died, or if she still lives, but his instincts tell him that Rowan is to be sacrificed to appease the angry gods of a ludicrous cult of bee-happy women.  Don't expect a Mr. Mustard with a candlestick in the library ending here.  Edward Malus is no Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original 1973 The Wicker Man, I think this movie is well worth watching.  Just watch out for all the plot holes, don't get too distracted by the wealth of unanswered questions the story leaves in its wake, and prepare for a conclusion that may actually surprise you.</p></body></html>

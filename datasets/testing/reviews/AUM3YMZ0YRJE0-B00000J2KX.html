<meta name="summary" content="absolutely perfect horror that comes from the inside"></head><body><p>This is the introspective version of the story, unlike the later version that King preferred.  It is the story of a family down on its luck, so the father takes a job as caretaker of a remote hotel that is supposed to be on some kind of ancient Indian burial ground.  Strange murderous things happened there before, but no one knows exactly what.  The mother and boy feel the tension vis-a-vis the father, who is a recovering alcoholic boiling with the most terrible anger.  He clearly loves the boy, but the mother blames him for a violent action he had made when drunk.  This is all understated, in the background but every detail of what unfolds fits in with this psychology.  It is a masterpiece like cut crystal.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is at the height of his powers here, young and still with a spirit to experiment with his roles rather than walking through the blatant commercial ones of his later career (however well he did them).  He is a troubled father and stalled writer, on his last legs in many ways.  You feel this just by looking at him, every gesture of the character consistent with his mental state.  He looks frightening, but there is love in him, too, as the thing begins to struggle for his mind.  Shelly Duvall, his wife, is is absolutely amazing, as she watches, the terror mounting inside of her until she can barely speak.  Finally, the boy - with supernatural powers of extrasensory communication -  calls for help.  The boy and his mother know something is coming, as the visions mount and strange occurrences begin.<br /><br />Nicholson is haunted by visions and begins to drink.  But it is clear that he has been under pressure the entire time they have been isoated there.  When Duvall discovers that something is wrong, it is one of the most terrifying moments in cinema that I have ever seen, but what does it is her acting, her demeanor of hysteria and despair.  I totally believed her.<br /><br />There are also many mysteries in the film, strange clues that remain unexplained.  My favorite is the appearance of Nicholson in an old photograph, leaving it to the viewer to interpret.  It is a one wonderful detail among many that enter the careful viewers' imagination to fit in with all the other parts of the film.  It is brilliant and perfect, just like the way that the boy escapes.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  One of the best I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

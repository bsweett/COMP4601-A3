It stays true to the Saw theme by still asking if you are grateful to be alive, and asking how much blood you are willing to shed to stay alive once you are in a life or death situation (or game, as Jigsaw calls it).  The games (or traps some may like to call them too) are more played out in this sequal, where as we only got to see glimpses in the first Saw.  The main scenario is on a larger scale, played out in an old house with a group of people, as compared to the two men in a large bathroom in the first movie.  A nice connection is made with the first movie (in addition to story elements) which brings some of the people into the same bathroom once again near the movie's end.  There is also that unexpected surprise to the story that made probably the biggest impact (in my opinion) with the first Saw.  Again, you couldn't quite see this one coming either, but it didn't have quite the satisfying and felt impact as the first Saw.<br /><br />Tobin Bell is Jigsaw, and gets a lot more screen time in Saw 2, we even actually see his face quite a bit.  More light is shed about who he is, where he's come from, and why he does what he does with these sick little games.  The man has a point, but the scenarios he creates are so brutal its nearly impossible to see it as fear and panic take over.  This is the case with detective Mathews (Donnie Whalberg) who is the main character in Saw 2, and whom the main game's focus is around.  You got a house full of young men and woman (including Mathews son) trying to stay alive, playing one brutal game after another, but the bigger picture is Mathews and the game he is playing right in front of Jigsaw.  The rules are laid out for Mathews, but they are so wrapped up in the fear and panic that it is impossible for him to see and that's when things begin to unfold and the surprise ending is told.<br /><br />While disturbing and difficult to watch at times, Saw 2 doesn't have quite the impact as the original.  There is plenty of blood, gore and violence, and one of the guys named Xavier (Franky G) becomes the scariest guy in the movie when he is driven to do whatever he feels he must to stay alive in that house.  There are more traps and possible the most frightening was the very first of the movie, even before things get rolling we see a man who has had the key to unlocking his trap surgically inserted under his eye.  He has 60 seconds to dig it out with a little knife.  Not a very bloody scene at all, but just the thought of what must be done to survive is gut wrenching enough.  On a good note, things move along in Saw 2, going from one trap/test to the next, while the first Saw was a bit more laid back, with the two men in the bathroom talking things out in grave details and referring to flashbacks to piece the puzzle together, however I believe it was those moments that created more tension and fright when the bloodshed and panic occured, resulting in more of a felt impact in regard to those in Saw 2.<br /><br />Saw 2 works for what it is, by carrying on the Saw theme, expanding on the scenarios (and some gore if that's your thing) and exploring Jigsaw's background a little more.  I don't think it's quite as sharp as the original, but it improves in various areas and falls in others.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Horror/Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

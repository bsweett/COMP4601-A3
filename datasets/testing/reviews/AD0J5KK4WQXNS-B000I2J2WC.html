It does move quite fast from start to finish considering everything. I would say that going to see it is not such a waste of your precious time if you understand that it is going to be pure popcorn fodder and nothing more. It is however highly blasphemous and Christians will be appalled at how dangerous this material is for the gullible (For example the history of the Templar Knights is absolutely fantasy and there are 12 apostles in the Last Supper painting, not 12 + 1). There are reviewers here who even believe that this film is a tutorial of facts. It is not the film itself that is dangerous but the people watching it. The ignorance for the historical record is unforgivable. However, Ultra feminists will love this movie. Apart from that there are some great moments but important characters are wasted and plot holes gap through the screen. It is absolute trash material but somehow I just want to see TOM HANKS in something... anything, but sadly it had to be this. It is a good conspiracy angle and I like the conspiracy undertones and the references to secret societies, with TOM HANKS (who makes it three stars), but it basically ploughs through all morality and standards. I doubt athiests would even discredit Jesus that much! Is this what film is for? The Da Vinci Code ends up playing like Satan is quivering his rear end at you all the way through.</p></body></html>

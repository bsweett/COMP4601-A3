<meta name="summary" content=""This is the shootout.""></head><body><p>After a killing that went very wrong, two Irish hitmen hole up in Bruges, Belgium, and wait for their boss to tell them what to do next.  The younger thug, Ray (Colin Farrell), hates everything about the storybook-pretty city, while his older partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson), loves sightseeing.  They meet some interesting characters and then the phone call comes from the boss - and it's bad news for one of them.<br /><br />I'd heard a lot about how wonderful this movie was and, to my surprise, it completely lives up to the hype.  It's an outstanding black comedy, very much in the same vein as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo</a>, with bad guys interacting in a small town, speaking simple dialogue that is unintentionally funny, along with some really graphic violence. Farrell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLQN">Phone Booth</a>) and Gleeson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK2Y">"MadEye Moody"</a>) are outstanding as the killers who turn out to be pretty regular guys with consciences.  They are an appealing odd couple with contrasting personalities and a deep bond between them.  Ralph Fiennes plays a loving family man who happens to be the killers' boss.  He's very good with a Michael Caine-ish cockney accent.  The underlying decency of the killers makes them sympathetic and even somewhat noble, despite their chosen work.<br /><br />With its remarkable medieval architecture and serene atmosphere, Bruges is a spectacular location.  This is a movie with beauty and ugliness, humor and suspense, and most important, a truly great script; what a winning combination.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

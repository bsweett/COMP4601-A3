Uma Thurman is down two villains with three to go, and her journeys take her from the Mojave desert to Latin America. However, I must point out that you can watch Volume 2 and still have a grasp of what's going on. This is because the opening of the movie takes time to show you what happened at El Paso with Uma Thurman's wedding and later on explains how a group of white Americans came to be experts with samurai swords.<p>In this round Quentin Tarantino still finds time to spoof the films he loves. While he spoofed samurai films in Volume 1, he finds time to spoof Kung Fu films in this round with Pai Mei, the aging old Chinese man in the mountains with unlimited knowledge of Kung Fu. This sequence is a MAJOR satire of the old chop suey films of the 1970's, complete with corny lines ("From here you have a good view of my foot!") and unnecessary (and gratuitous) close-ups. For further reference, I suggest you go out and rent the Wu Tang films. I recommend "Ho's, Thugs, and Scrillah" and "Mystery of Chess Boxing."<p>Now amazingly, even though there is good action here, it has been some what replaced with what made Quentin Tarantino great in his earlier films: speculative dialogue. The character of Bill is a likeable character because Tarantino has given him an actual personality as opposed to simply having him be the one that killed off Uma's friends and family. Remember the Madonna's "Like a Virgin" speech from "Reservoir Dogs"? Well, you will never see Superman the same way again after watching this movie.<p>So if you've seen the first movie, watch this one. In fact, even if you haven't, watch this movie. It's well worth your time. If any thing, see it to watch the ultimate catfight ever filmed - the Uma Thurman/Darryl Hannah fight. And believe me, Hannah gets her just deserves. I ain't gonna ruin it for you, watch the movie!</p></body></html>

Bernie and Roz Focker join this winning team!<br /><br />Meet the Fockers is a superb sequel to Meet the Parents. Now, it is the turn for the bride's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, played by De Niro and Blythe Danner, to meet the groom's parents.<br /><br />With Gaylord and Pam, they travel in their new RV to Florida. They also bring with them their infant grandson from their other daughter, and the kid delivers some of the best lines of this film... Still to today... when we want to laugh, we find ourselves saying.... Ash-whole!!!<br /><br />Gaylord's parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are simply magnificent. As with great comedy, they play opposites to DeNiro, and rather than strict and controlling, they are care-free, touchy-feely... fun-loving parents.<br /><br />You should not miss this movie if you want to laugh and enjoy... one of the great sequels to one of the best comedy films ever!</p></body></html>

Beautifully filmed and full of action and romance, it has a little bit of everything to satisfy everyone.  Brad Pitt does a nice job as Achilles, a feared warrior who is battling his own demons and filled with repulsion for the King he serves.  Eric Bana (coming off the film, The Hulk) also gives a good performance as Hector, Achilles' foe, a good man that is caught up in fighting for his homeland and the honor of his family.  Orlando Bloom plays Paris, who's stealing Helen from the King of Sparta, sets the story in motion.  For me, though, it is the conflict between Hector and Achilles that is the most interesting part of the film.  The cinematography is beautiful and all the actors do well in their roles.  I highly recommend this film!</p></body></html>

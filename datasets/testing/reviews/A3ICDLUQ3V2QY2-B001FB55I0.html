<meta name="summary" content="Sour Disaster"></head><body><p>This movie is so massively wrong-headed, and so overtly throws sod on the original Terminator film, that I can only assume it's deliberate.  I can only conclude that director McG and the small army of writers who held this film in development hell for several years purposely want to sour you and me on James Cameron's 1984 classic.  What other explanation can there be for such transparent awfulness?<br /><br />Deep in the violence of post-nuclear 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) struggles as a low-ranking officer in the Resistance.  Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), executed by the state fifteen years earlier, awakes not one day older, already in the thick of fighting.  But in a matter of hours, Wright finds the one thing both the Machines and Connor need: the current location of young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).<br /><br />The original Terminator flourished by taking common fears and making them happen on screen before us.  Because many of us distrust ordinary technology, Cameron's 1984 film is justly considered a classic.  This film, by contrast, seems written as a showcase for the special effects.  There is not one moment of tension, not one revealing human moment, not one point at which I feel this movie is telling the truth.<br /><br />This film suffers innumerable orchestrated set pieces, fight sequences, and explosions.  Everything is tightly so choreographed, I never get the feeling anything has really happened.  If you doubt what I mean, I commend to your imagination the image of a CGI Arnold, head surrounded by a halo of anti-aliasing artifacts, tossing Christian Bale like a Frisbee.  Yeah, the whole movie is like that.<br /><br />Then we have all the bits and bobs stolen from other, better sci-fi movies.  You could make a drinking game out of spotting them all.  Beer for Star Wars, wine for The Matrix, liquor for Spielberg's War of the Worlds.  Make 'em double shots for images taken from sequels.  I saw not one original set piece, line of dialog, or piece of physical design in this entire 118-minute disaster.<br /><br />Cameron's original Terminator was one of the greatest works of film ever.  The second film was good.  The third was adequate.  This one is awful.  I don't throw negative superlatives around, because they get abused, but this is the worst film I've seen in at least three years.  I will watch no more Terminator films.  I love the original too much to see the franchise desecrated this way.</p></body></html>

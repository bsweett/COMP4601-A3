<meta name="summary" content="Simply Great Action Thriller!"></head><body><p>In what can only be described as one of the best thrillers to come out of the fantasy factory in recent memory, rising star Matt Damon shows why his career is bound for glory in terms of both incredible versatility and sheer star power. In this loosely adapted version of best-selling mystery author Robert Ludlum, Damon plays the lead part of Jason Bourne, and man who awakes from shock aboard a Portuguese fishing boat with two gaping bullet holes in his back and a terrific case of amnesia. As he lands with some evidence of some puzzling leads in port, he follows the lead and slips into a nightmare world where everyone is chasing him and he has no idea of what is going on. <p>Along the way he enlists the support of an existentially challenged twenty-something woman in search of her life, and the two of them fend their perilous way through the maze of inexplicable violence and mind-boggling subtexts. Thus, discovering through a passport that his name is Jason Bourne, an American living in a sumptuous upstairs flat in Paris, Bourne and the soon to be main squeeze are assaulted by an assassin. And in the midst of all this pounding, he discovers more and more about his assailants, his own mysterious combat capabilities, and finally himself. <p>The cinematography is excellent, and adds to the lure of the film, as does the young main squeeze, a relatively unknown actress (Franka Potente) whose only other screen credit is for "Run Lola Run". One suspects we will be seeing more of her soon. The sets are realistic, and some of the chase scenes are extremely well choreographed, filmed and spliced together in some of the most exciting and memorable heart-pounders in recent memory.  The sporting cast is excellent and quite believable, the plot is a bit sticky but plausible, and as sheer entertainment it is a great afternoon's entertainment. I expect we will soon see a sequel or two, as the Bourne character is certainly an appealing and exciting film figure. Until then, enjoy this one!</p></body></html>

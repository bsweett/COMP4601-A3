No where does the movie try to take sides.  I didn't watch this movie telling myself, `I didn't know the Americans were so savage.'  That's not really the point.  Eastwood and screenwriter take the position of individual Japanese participants without any thought of the Axis.  What they do is show how war sweeps up decent, ordinary people in its bloody grips.  There are corresponding battle scenes that work well in both movies.  This time we see it from the Japanese angle.  The graphic battle scenes surely don't hide the brutal affair that war truly becomes.<br /><br />The point-of-view is from a sympathetic Japanese soldier, Capt. Kirbashi (Ken Wanabe), who has visited America during a time that both sides couldn't conceive of war between the two countries.  He has pleasant encounters, but a telling scene shows comraderie with an American soldier who honors him in the States.  He indicates that a true soldier puts his country first.  However, later even he will offer a dying American soldier a nearly deplete portion of morphine.  (How much of a measure was that the usual course, I doubt, from either side.)  Another focus is for two young soldiers.  They, like many of their peers, believe their fate is marked on the island.  Their commander, Lt. Ito, is a nasty superior who always browbeats and actually once beats one with a cane for showing, allegedly, a lack of patriotism.  He is the arm of most Japanese sentiment.  Being men of honor, they are willing to commit suicide, rather than face dishonor.  One of them was discharged earlier for not having shot a dog on order.  We see how the Japanese operations work as government officials break up a reluctant young Japanese couple with a newborn.  "Congratulations!" the woman official exclaims.  It is a nice reminder of how people are often at mercy in the world of their own governments and circumstances beyond their control.<br /><br />I asked myself, considering myself a patriotic American, why I liked  `Letters from Iwo Jima' better than `Flags of Our Fathers'.  I believe, although excellent, 'Flags of Our Fathers' doesn't try to get bogged down with some trivia pursuit it took with the participants in the photo flag-raising.  'Letters from Iwo Jima' sees all of us as potential victims falling into the vortex of war, even on a bloody, desolate rock island in the middle of the Pacific.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gandhi Does LA"></head><body><p>I'm beginning to believe that Ben Kingsley is from a desert kingdom.  There's sand between my teeth from his recreations of Gandhi, or in this case, one of the Shah's men.  He's very good, and so is Jennifer Connelly who I last saw in an overwrought film that the elitist scum of Hollywood liked, Requiem for a Dream.  Don't bother with that one unless you enjoy dizzy spells and adult toys, but in HOSAF, based on a most un-Hollywood premise, Connelly's sad face is perfect.<br /><br />HOSAF is not a comedy and is not aimed at fifteen-year-olds.  Kingsley is a proud ex-colonel from Iran used to wealth and prestige, but now he is in exile in California.  He wears a suit to work, but changes in a restroom into workers garb, because he is reduced to working as a road-gang, ditch digger and a part-time gas station jockey.  He's saving every penny he makes and wins a house in an auction.  Unfortunately, the County made a mistake and they took the house away from Connelly, a depressed twenty-something, ex-drug abuser.  She should have opened her mail and after eviction, her lawyer and new boyfriend start a campaign to evict the Iranian family.<br /><br />Neither Connelly nor Kingsley is portrayed unsympathetically.  They are fleshed out with pathos.  This is a parable about ethical business and the consequences of our actions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It Would Be Five-Star Were It Not for the Blu-ray Transfer"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was incredibly funny. Lot's of great laughs. Awesome cast! What an outstanding film!<br /><br />This movie would have turned out much nicer if it were on HD DVD...the Blu-ray picture on this tile is a bit flat and unexciting, and the sound is just so...well, it's flat too.<br /><br />The shots in this film were such that you could have been drawn in, and the audio could have felt far more compelling than it did.<br /><br />I so highly recommend "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby". Five-star film, but sadly only a two-star or three-star Blu-ray transfer.</p></body></html>

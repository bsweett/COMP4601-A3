<meta name="summary" content="As a fan of Pitch Black, I wanted to like this. I almost did"></head><body><p>I normally hate to compare a film to its sequel(s), but for Chronicles of Riddick I will have to because it just doesn't stand on its own.  Having an understanding of the back story from Pitch Black is necessary to navigate through this choppy  plot - but since I assume that a large portion of viewers will be purchasing this film expecting a continuation of the characters and quality from that movie, I think it is my duty to point out how very much COR deviates.<br /><br />COR takes place several years after the events in PB.  Riddick has been on the run from various people in that time, but at the opening of the film he is running from bounty hunters hired by a private party for a very choice sum.  Of course Riddick has to find out who and why, which takes him across space to look up an old friend.  Coincidentally, that very planet is attacked shortly after he arrives.  It would seem that an evil death-worshipping religion has been sweeping the universe, killing all who will not convert, and a rogue being called an Elemental has purposefully lured Riddick there so that she can enlist his help in fighting them.  Through various flashbacks and offhand remarks from other characters we learn that Riddick is one of the few survivors of a race from the planet Furia which was also devastated by the Necromags, so naturally, he'd want revenge, right?  And of course he can be expected to singlehandedly defeat an evil empire if he wanted to.  But Furions are also contrarians, and Riddick is a confirmed loner, baby.  He can't be tied down, has to be free, blah blah.  But then the Necromongers annoy him by killing his pal, so watch out, now it's personal!<br /><br />I think that fans of PB will find that the pace, plot and tight storytelling of that first film is absent here.  COR shifts focus constantly, jumping around visions and events and leaving holes in the plot which I can only assume are due to bad editing.  The story tries to take on too much subject matter - a whole occultic warrior culture, Riddick's conflicted relationship with Jack/Kira from PB, the mysteries of Furia, Furions, and the race of Elementals - in too short a time.  I'm not any dumber than the average viewer, but this was a very confusing experience for me.<br /><br />By far the thing that threw me the most was how differently the character of Riddick was portrayed by the same actor in this film  Our anti-hero lost his mystery and much of his appeal this time around.  Vin Diesel was chilling and unfathomable in PB; now he starts to seem like any other super alpha male on an ultraviolent killing rampage.  Oh yes, there's lots of that going on, but this time humans compose the body count instead of monsters.  Riddick is now a modern action movie clich&eacute;.  I found it hard to root for him.<br /><br />The most impressive part of COR was evident in the high-budget art direction.  The set and costume designs for the Necromongers were convincingly dark and beautiful in the tradition of Giger (Alien/Aliens).  The special effects were good, the fiery scenes on the surface of the planet Crematoria were believable.  Lots of eye candy to be had.<br /><br />The end of this film strongly suggests that there is an opening for another sequel in the works.  Gads, I hope not...unless the editor can get his act together.  I suspect that the director's version  of COR is better than this theatrical release, and that maybe the third film will learn from the mistakes of the second.  My advice:  if you are still fan enough of Riddick to brave COR, check out the director's cut and skip this one.<br /><br />--Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

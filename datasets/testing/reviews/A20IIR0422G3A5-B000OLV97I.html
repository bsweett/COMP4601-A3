To point out that the story is loosely based on themes from and the style of the `Lord of the Rings' films is less interesting than to say that it is also based heavily on themes from `Star Wars' and Anne McCafferty's `Dragonriders of Pern' series, both of which are themselves heavily influenced by the `Lord of the Rings' novels first published in 1955 through 1958 and even more so on the first Middle Earth quest described in `The Hobbit'. So, since Tolkien's tales from Middle Earth have had a pervasive influence on fantasy fiction and role-playing gaming for the last 50 years, we must take their influence as a given and move on. The immediate influence on the novel and the movie is not Tolkien's books so much as the great success of the `Lord of the Rings' movies. I also detect some influences from the Matrix trilogy in some scenes, although these influences are minor.<br /><br />The problem now faced by `Eragon' the movie is that with the `Lord of the Rings' movies, Peter Jackson's realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's story has raised the bar so high, practically no one outside of fantasy creative powerhouses such as Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas have the juice to put the kind of creative energy and money into a film to match Jackson's benchmark. The film version of `The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' comes close, but basically served as a proof of my contention that even with a classic script based on a C. S. Lewis' novel and all the resources of the Disney studios, we get a movie which at best comes in a distant second to `Rings'.<br /><br />It may be just a bit less obvious than with `The Fellowship of the Ring', but `Eragon' story is clearly the opening chapter of a series. Virtually the only area where `Eragon' is superior to `Fellowship' is that like the first (Episode IV) `Star Wars' flick, the story is fairly self-contained, with a reasonably satisfying ending. Otherwise, the story is weaker than `Fellowship'. My first observation is that while `Fellowship' had at least fourteen (14) interesting characters, `Eragon' has barely three, and that's counting the dragon. `Fellowship' had the nine members of the fellowship plus Bilbo Baggins, Arwen Evenstar, Elrond, Galadrial, and Saruman. And that's not counting the black riders, Barliman Butterbur and the Balrog! I count Jackson's greatest achievement with the filming of `Rings' is his (and Elijah Woods) making the character of Frodo Baggins interesting and sympathetic. Through countless readings of `Rings', I could never shake the notion that Frodo was a wimp. In the movie, he is beset with doubt, but he does not come off as a wimp! So, compared to the character of Eragon, the filmed Frodo Baggins is much more interesting. Eragon's mentor, played well by Jeremy Irons, is simply no match for Viggo Mortensen's realization of `Ring's Strider / Aragorn character. Again, I was never entirely happy with Aragorn on the written page. Director and actor really make the most of his character.<br /><br />While there was no dragon in `Rings', we do get a superb realization of an intelligent, speaking dragon in the gloriously limned picture of the great Smaug in `The Hobbit'. In comparison, our friendly dragon Saphira, voiced by Rachel Weisz, carries her own.<br /><br />The primary heavy, the `shade', in the employ of king Galbatorix (a waste of the talents of John Malkovich) is no match for the heavies in `Fellowship', that being primarily the black riders (who still give me nightmares after reading about them one late Saturday night, forty years ago), the Balrog, and the Uruk-hai (Saruman's own special breed of orc).<br /><br />When it comes to pivotal scenes, `Eragon' pales in comparison to `Fellowship'. One can claim that Jackson actually drags out some scenes just a bit too much to milk them for all they are worth, but I totally forgive him for his totally convincing realization of the encounter between Gandalf and the Balrog. Director Fangmeier has nothing that comes even close.<br /><br />The other speaking characters in `Eragon' seem to never be adequately introduced or explained, and in the world of grand mythical fiction, that is the cardinal sin, as it is the primary legacy of Tolkien's work. In no other world of science fiction or fantasy do we have the depth of realized legend, language and lore as in Tolkien. McCafferty in `Dragonriders' and Lucas in `Star Wars' come close, and that is why the work as well as they do.<br /><br />The director's commentary on this DVD was interesting, but it failed to provide much of the mythical background I so much want in works like this. This is a fair effort, but the series has a long way to go to come up to its legendary model.</p></body></html>

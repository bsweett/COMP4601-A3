<meta name="summary" content="Good, stuggle on the story line though"></head><body><p>Continuing on the Shrek franchise, this one looks at Shrek not wanting to be king of Far Far Away after Feona's father dies, so he seeks to find another heir to the throne.  In the midst of that Prince Charming decides to take over Far Far Away.  A bunch of sub stories with Merlin and Author, and some fun scene, just not up to Shrek 1 or Shrek 2 standards.  Good to watch and because it is a series, good to own.</p></body></html>

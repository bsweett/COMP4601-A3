George C. Scott embodied Patton fascinating both audiences who seemed transfixed with a fine script and superior performances of all players. Patton's genius was praised and his neuroses were exploited by those who felt he personified military immorality.<br /><br />Several viewpoints of Patton' personality and leadership are explored. His staff seem sychophantically loyal, and his soldiers appear to love him or hate Old Blood and Guts (Our blood, his guts)! Eisenhower's chief of staff Bedell Smith couldn't stand Patton, and Patton had a running competition and animosity for Bernard Law Montgomery. Karl Mauldin, plays Omar Bradley who first serves as his assistant division commander and then his superior. Bradley is portrayed as the benevolent and unassuming general who challenges the morality and military wisdom of Patton's decisions.<br /><br />The Germans seem to be unanimous in their esteem for Patton's audacity and military prowess. When Patton is relieved of his command for slapping a soldier, he is assigned to Sardinia, then Malta, then Cairo, and finally to England opposite the Pas-de-Calais where the allies set up a fictitious army around him. The Germans cannot believe that the best allied commander would actually be relieved for slapping a soldier, and they actually moved troops around the Mediterranean in anticipation of Patton attacking in Sardinia, through Greece, and at the Pas-de-Calais.<br /><br />Standing at 6'1," George C. Scott seemed better at Patton than Patton did who matched him in height but had a high-pitched voice. Scott played up Patton's lack of verbal impulse control, his iron discipline (he was famous for fines), a lack  of patience with subordinate officers, and for slapping a soldier. (Actually, he slapped two). The viewer gets the impression that Patton is a neurotic military genius who is willing to sacrifice his troops to satisfy his vainglory and destiny. His performance is so effective that people will proably remember Scott as Patton rather than Patton as Patton.<br /><br />Detractors of this movie say that Patton was far more caring of his men than the script allowed. He was liberal with passes, ensured that mail arrived regularly, and that showers and hot food were provided more often than in any other command. He only relieved one general for cause as opposed to Bradley who relieved several. He was always found in front of his men rallying them from the side of the road or walking among them offering us an impression of a man whose bark was worse than his bite. There is no doubt that he instilled pride in his troops and made them believe they were invincible against any enemy.<br /><br />In spite of the movie's detractors, everything about this production is phenomenal and George C. Scott in a defiant Patton personna, refused the Oscar for best actor that Ryan O'Neil panted for in "Love Story." (Well, love is never having to say you're sorry). It has withstood the test of time as being an all-time military classic.<br /><br />The speech he gives at the beginning of the film is a compilation of many of the salty and foul-mouthed expressions he made over his career. This part is not to be missed, along with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Charge into this one!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Enemy Is Oneself"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Lots of cool action and special effects.<br />*Very different filming style.  Much more vivid and interesting use of colors and camera angles.  Also a bit darker and more dramatic.<br />*Storyline is interesting.  It's cool to finally see the Romulans in a film.<br />*Characters are smashing.  There are lots of paralells involved; Picard vs his clone, Data vs B-4 (his clone), Troi vs that ugly alien, Riker vs the same ugly alien, and so on.  Duality is the key point, and it makes for some very interesting interactions and dialogue.<br />*Writing is good.  Not so much comedy, but definately lots of drama.<br />*As mentioned above, strong themes of duality.<br />*Okay music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The ending is a little dissapointing.  Data is dead, the Enterprise is destroyed again, and everybody moves onto different paths.  It almost warrents a whole new Star Trek TV series.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It's almost too different.  Definately a strange departure from previous films.<br /><br />I didn't really like this one at first, but I'll be darned if it didn't grow on me.  The action and special effects are very slick and cool.  Above all, there are a lot of interesting issues involving duality between the characters, with the Romulans, and overall light and dark.  It's dark and deep, but also a little too dreary and different.  Still, it's very interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />The one-disc version had good video and sound quality, and had some deleted scenes and featurettes.  The two-disc version has good quality still, some of the same extras, plus additional featurettes.</p></body></html>

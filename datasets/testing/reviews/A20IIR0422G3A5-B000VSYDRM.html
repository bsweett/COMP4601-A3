<meta name="summary" content="An ambitious film, which lacks a vital component."></head><body><p>The film, "Perfume", directed and cowriten by German director, Tom Tykwer, is based on a novel I read shortly after it was published in 1985. I recall then thinking that is was an odd story, which seemed to have few cinematic virtues. This movie tends to confirm my point.<br /><br />The first thing which strikes me is that the dialogue is thin as a weak broth, made from old bones. I find myself in disagreement with several professional critics when I say that the most enjoyable scenes in the film are those with Dustin Hoffman as the old Parisian perfumer, Baldini. Those scenes have at least some reasonable amount of exposition by a character rather than the clinical voice of John Hurt who does the narration, an unseen voice. Some critics complained about Hoffman's over the top acting, a bit too "kitch". Well, maybe it was, but it seemed to be one of the few traces of real life, however "overdone."<br /><br />My strongest memory from the novel was the discovery that the main character, the infant who was to be given the name Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by relatively unknown actor Ben Whishaw, had no smell whatsoever. This comes very early in the novel, setting the scene for what is to motivate the principle character throughout the story. This revelation does not come out in the film until about 2/5 of the way through it, leaving us with no strong explanation for why Grenouille is so entranced by the smell of the young apricot seller (the Wikipedia plot summary says plums. They look far more like apricots to me.)<br /><br />The unique absence of all sent from the child is replaced in the film by its beginning with a scene where Grenouille is sentenced to a horrible execution. Most of the remainder of the film is a flashback about his life leading up to that scene, which plays out in a manner which should confirm (if nothing up to that point does not drive home this point) that the story is a fantasy. But it's a fantasy based on a very slim extrapolation of reality. What if a human had as acute a smell as a dog, for example. This is played out when Grenouille demonstrates for himself that his extract of the fragrance of his first victim is recognized by that victim's dog. We are reminded of this evidence later in the film.<br /><br />For those who are annoyed by spoilers in reviews, you may wish to stop now.<br /><br />I found several scenes in the film which were simply too unrealistic to accept, similar to a Sci Fi movie about people in outer space where they can hear sounds in the vacuum of space or they walk as if there were gravity where there can't be any. The most jarring was in the execution scene, where, having been stripped to the waist and chained to the wall of a locked cell, Grenouille manages to retain possession of not only his vial of perfume made from the 13 essences of the fragrance of his 13 victims, but he retains a handkerchief by which he can disperse the fragrance to the crowd assembled to view his execution. Perhaps the whole unreality of the scene is signaled when Grenouille arrives at the execution stage dressed like a dandy, in a carriage fit for royalty, instead of the hay cart we are so familiar with from the French Revolution.<br /><br />Less "unreal", but similarly jarring was the scene in Baldini's laboratory where Grenouille creates an improvement over a perfume Baldini was trying to copy. It was reasonable to believe that Grenouille's talent enabled him to identify the five or six components of this perfume, but as he himself states, he knows the smells, but he does not know the names or how to capture them. So how does Grenouille assemble the components he needs by selecting sealed containers, with labels. The business as Grenouille enters Baldini's laboratory suggests he can distinguish each of the smells from the hundreds of containers by smell alone. I suspect that would be beyond the capabilities of even a bloodhound.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the film is about the sense of smell, which may be virtually impossible to convey in a film. But wait, wasn't there a very successful film entitled "The Scent of a Woman" which seemed to succeed in conveying that idea. The very slow pace of this film, with precious little dialogue to speak of, tends to be just a bit boring. Which is odd, because my memory of the novel was that it was anything but boring. Here, Hoffman, pulls off a good scene or two, and Alan Rickman is almost totally wasted, with very little dialogue. If the roles of Narrator and  Antoine Richis, the 13th victim's father, were reversed, at least we would have been treated to Rickman's delightfully serious sounding voice. Hurt's voice seemed to lack character, the same way the principle character lacked a fragrance.<br /><br />The proper bookends of the film perhaps should have been Grenouille's triumph in finding a proper fragrance to replace his own lack of one.</p></body></html>

Most people would take the opportunity.  Next question:  what happens if that opportunity turns out to be more than you bargained for?  That situation is the one that Max, played by Jaime Foxx, found himself in the movie 'Collateral.'  Max's whole world gets turned around after he agrees to drive Vincent, played by Tom Cruise, around all night as he takes care of some business deals.<br /><br />Max is a cab driver.  He tells everyone that this job is just part time and temporary.  Its something to do while he makes other arrangements.  Those other arrangements are his plans to start his own limo company.  Problem is, those plans have been developing for twelve years.  Max also has a gift for getting his customers to their destination on time, and in the amount of time he predicted.<br /><br />Then one night, Vincent shows up.  Vincent appears to be a business man in town to close a few deals.  Max intrigues Vincent, so he offers Max the opportunity to make some extra money and a bonues if he'll drive him to all of his appointments and get him back to the airport in time to catch his 6 a.m. flight.  Things are going well until Max learns that Vincent is a hitman, and he has no way of getting rid of him.<br /><br />'Collateral' is a good movie.  It explores quite a few aspects of human behavior.  Amongst its themes are the stories we tell ourselves that get us from one day to the next, even though everyone else sees right through them.  This theme is at the heart of the relationship between Max and Vincent.  Its subtle in points, but it clubs you over the head in others.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the acting.  Cruise and Foxx were ideal for their roles.  For Foxx, this film continues his entry into dramatic roles and away from comedy.  For Cruise, this is a dark turn away from his good guy leading man roles.  Both of them do a superb job.<br /><br />The drawbacks to the movie is that it can be a bit preachy at times, the end sequence wasn't overly spectacular, and a few of the earlier scenes tended to drag a little.  However, most of these flaws are relatively insignificant in the face of the acting and the theme of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this film to fans of Cruise and Foxx and those that like dark gritty movies.  Kids will probably be bored with this one, and its not appropriate for them anyway.  The DVD has several features for those than look for those types of things.  Overall:  4.25 stars.</p></body></html>

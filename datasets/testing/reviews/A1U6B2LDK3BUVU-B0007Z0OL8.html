It had me laughing so hard I hurt my ribs.  Team America had a lot to live up to.<br /><br />There are some big laughs in this one too.  The single funniest laugh is during a love scene between two of the Team America members, where these puppets are doing everything to each other short of getting out the whips and chains.  At first the scene is just funny, but then it gets so stupid and hysterical.  I'm not going to tell you what they do to each other.<br /><br />It has to be difficult to maintain the energy and humor over a full length movie.  The first South Park movie couldn't do it, but gave us an amazing beginning.  This movie doesn't rise to those heights, ever.  Despite having maybe about a dozen really funny parts in it, it really didn't keep me entertained enough to give it a rave review.<br /><br />One thing I give it credit for is being completely "politically incorrect".  It is the most right wing comedy ever made, and any reviewer who claims otherwise is lying.  To say that this is even handed or middle of the road is just a flat out lie.  It is as right wing as it can be, to the point of ridiculing every left wing actor they can think of and describing them all as fags.  This movie is Newt Gingrich on ecstasy.<br /><br />I don't care.  Comedies are supposed to make you laugh, so who cares what political position they take.  It had me laughing out loud a bunch of times, but overall I can't really give it more than about 2 stars.  Maybe 2 1/2.</p></body></html>

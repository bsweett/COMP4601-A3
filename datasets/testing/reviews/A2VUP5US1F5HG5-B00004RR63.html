Though the FX weren't exactly innovative even in 1984, they're good enough to make the futuristic sets and high-octane action scenes more than believable.  But James Cameron's story of heartless cyborg murderers and an expendable humanity isn't built on FX pyrotechnics anyway, and that's why in many ways it compares favorably to its generally bigger and better sequel, Judgment Day.  Cameron and co-scripter/producer Gale Anne Hurd created a story around a skeleton of realistic characters and some clever twists on the traditional time travel plot, which Cameron himself then molded into a masterpiece of cinematic suspense.  Highlights include:  a peak ahead to an apocalyptic future where humans live like rats and cybernetic assassins stalk the earth; a sensitive love scene between the mother-to-be of mankind's eventual savior and her protector; much clever dialogue ("Come with me if you want to live," "I'll be back," etc.), and a closing shot that turns the traditional riding off into the sunset ending on its head as the female lead drives off down an uncertain road beneath hovering thunderclouds that are harbingers of the nuclear storm to come.  Odds are if you're interested enough to be reading this review, you've probably seen it already--hasn't everybody?  But if somehow you've managed to escape The Terminator this long, don't worry:  HE NEVER STOPS.</p></body></html>

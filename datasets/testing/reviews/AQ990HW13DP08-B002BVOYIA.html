That, and not so much the genocide of nearly a million Rwandans, is the theme of this award-winning film--how one person's bravery, cunning, diplomacy, deceit, bribery and wits saved over a thousand people, many of them Tutsi refugees that the Hutu extremists sought to exterminate. For a longer look at the actual genocide read We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda by Philip Gourevitch. For provocation and inspiration based upon a true story, watch this film.</p></body></html>

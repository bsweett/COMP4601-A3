<meta name="summary" content="A Sort of Fairy Tale"></head><body><p>This is on my top ten for all time faves.  I love the story and the acting is brilliant.  My favourite scenes are those with the faun and the little girl and the "enchanting" secret world only she can see.  I don't mind the subtitles, I've gotten good at reading them considering alot of the great films nowadays are foreign films.  This is a fantastic film, it should have won the oscar for best picture.</p></body></html>

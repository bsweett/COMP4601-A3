<meta name="summary" content="Whatever happened to the Man of Tomorrow?"></head><body><p>Of all the reviews I have read about Superman Returns, I feel that Roger Ebert's is the most accurate.  Don't get me wrong - I liked the movie...I just didn't love it.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />It does everything it can to draw a direct line from the original Superman movies.  The first Superman has my favorite opening credit sequence of all time, which this film copies.  The message is clear: Superman HAS returned.  The art direction does its best to be reminiscent of the originals.<br /><br />I liked the cast.  Brandon Routh is a good actor and eerily like Christopher Reeve.  Kevin Spacey is perfect for the new Lex Luthor.  (Lois Lane left me wanting though - she isn't tough enough to be a reporter.)  Of course, Marlon Brando is the only actor to "reprise" his role from the first film.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD:<br /><br />The script.  I love the original Superman movie - so I don't need the new one to keep quoting it every five minutes.  As soon as I saw that Singer had hired two twentysomething skater kids to be his screenwriters, I knew this would be a problem.  The first superman movie was great because it had wit and sophistication - things that take experience to earn.  Instead of being witty, this movie quotes lines from the first one.  Instead of giving us new magical moments, it tries to recapture the magical moments from previous films.  The result is that this film lacks a sense of fun.  Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it is not the best filmmaking.<br /><br />I get the same feeling from this film that I got from the first Spider-Man film and the first X-Men film.  This will re-establish the franchise, but you have to wait for the second one for it to get really good.</p></body></html>

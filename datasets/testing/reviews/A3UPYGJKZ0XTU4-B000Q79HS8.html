But unlike its predecessor, "The Bourne Identity", "Supremacy" isn't based on Ludlum's novel that bears its name. At best "The Bourne Supremacy" was vaguely inspired by the novel. It is essentially an original screenplay by Tony Gilroy. This film finds Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) two years after "The Bourne Supremacy" but with no more understanding of his past than when we left him. Still plagued by debilitating headaches, still unable to remember who he was or what he did, and still accompanied by his paramour Marie (Franka Potente), Bourne is living a quiet life "off the grid" in India. Unfortunately for him, someone leaves Bourne's fingerprint behind with 2 murdered CIA agents in Berlin, and an assassin has tracked him to India. CIA agent Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is intent on bringing Bourne in, believing that he has information crucial to her investigation of stolen CIA money.<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" is a character-driven action film that will find wide appeal. The film has plenty of action -fight sequences, car chases, great stunts- but they're driven by Jason Bourne's desperation, not by a need for spectacle. Bourne is a post-modern, post-Cold War hero: the victim of a corrupt system, forced into action. He's a ruthless but reluctant killer with whom the audience sympathizes, if not actually pities. Director Paul Greengrass chose to film "The Bourne Supremacy" in a gritty, photo-realistic style that keeps the audience in the center of the action and close to Bourne's point of view. On the face of it, this sounds like a good idea. Greengrass took it too far, though, sometimes allowing style to stand in the way of story. Too much of the cinematography is murky, and too much of it is handheld. The camera is dynamic, constantly moving. That's fine, but there is way too much shake. It's annoying and could be pretty unpleasant for those audience members prone to motion sickness. The ideas behind Greengrass' shooting style are appropriate to the film's themes, but the near-constant camera shake makes this big budget action film look amateurish.<br /><br />Like "The Bourne Identity", "The Bourne Supremacy" is elevated by a top-notch cast. Pamela Landy is a one-note character, but Joan Allen assures that she is taken seriously. Veteran Scottish thespian Brian Cox plays senior CIA agent Ward Abbott. Julia Stiles returns in her small role as a CIA agent and former logistics officer. Matt Damon is appealing and sympathetic as Bourne. "The Bourne Supremacy" would have benefitted from a steadier camera, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable action film. It has suspense, action, real characters, and a great cast.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes, 9 mini documentaries, text "Cast and Filmmakers" bios, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), and an audio commentary by director Paul Greengrass. Peter Greengrass, producers Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, Matt Damon, and stunt co-ordinator Dan Bradley all contribute numerous interviews to the documentaries. "Matching Identities: Casting" (5 minutes) talks about the actors and their roles. In "Keeping It Real" (5 minutes), actors and crew discuss Paul Greengrass' approach to filming. In "Blowing Things Up" (4 minutes) the stunt co-ordinator and the special effects foreman take us through filming the explosion in the house in Munich. "On the Move with Jason Bourne" (5 minutes) is about the film's locations: Berlin, Moscow, and Goa, India. "Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training" (4 minutes) discusses the fight sequence between the 2 remaining Treadstone operatives. "Crash Cam" (6 minutes) is about shooting the car chase sequence in Moscow. This documentary is worthwhile, as the chase employed some unusual methodology. "The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action" (7 minutes) continues the discussion of filming cars by introducing us to a contraption that allows actors to be filmed at the wheel of a car while moving. "Anatomy of a Scene" (4 1/2 minutes) explores the bridge and barge chase scene in Berlin. Composer John Powell talks about the score in "Scoring the Film with John Powell" (5 minutes). Director Paul Greengrass leaves technical talk to the documentaries. His audio commentary expounds on characters and story, including some insights into Bourne's character. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French, captioning in English. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></body></html>

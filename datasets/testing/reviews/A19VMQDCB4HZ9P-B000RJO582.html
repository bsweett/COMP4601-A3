<meta name="summary" content="Lives up to Romero's original Dawn of the Dead."></head><body><p>Only a few more months and Zack Snyder's true cut of his remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead will be out on a special dvd edition. This new director's cut should make an already classic in the making horror-film into something even better. Zack Snyder did Romero proud with the film he created and made fans of the zombie-film subgenre howl with delight.<br /><br /> Where Romero used his sequel to his other classic horror film, Night of the Living Dead, as a visual canvas to create an essay on the societal, political and philisophical path humanity was careening towards during the late 70's and early 80's, Snyder just decided to make the best undead-apocalyptic film he could make. This film has some very disturbing images of how a world would look like when faced with an event with &quot;apocalypse&quot; written in bold. The way some of the scenes were shot in cinema verite style looks like some of the news footage they show on tv dealing with riots and realtime battle footage on the ground.<br /><br /> From the first five minutes it kicked me and most of the audience in the gut and doesn't let up. This all happens before the opening credits even come on. I knew Dawn of the Dead was in good hands when Snyder used Johnny Cash's The Man Around The Corner as the opening credits track. The Man in Black's distinctive voice playing over scenes of the world trying to comprehend the sudden rise of the dead to feastt on those still living.<br /><br /> Even the humor that was sprinkled throughout the film had a morbid, twisted, sick angle to them. Those who have seen the original Dawn of the Dead will see some of the original actors doing cameos that fit well into the film. But it wasn't just gore and humor. There was alot of humanity in this film. I guess when one thinks they may be the only living people left on earth, sometimes living just to survive may not be enough.<br /><br /> It doesn't mean that this film is lacking in blood and brain-matter. The gorefactor in this film is high, but it wasn't gore for the sake of having gore. This film's basic premise is of the recently dead coming back to life to attack and devour the living around them. I don't think a film with this premise can escape showing a living human being being ripped apart and devoured by a mob of putrefying and hungry zombies. They've actually had to cut back on the gore to get an R-rating for the film. I'm not sure what they cut out, but they skirted the realm of receiving an NC-17. This film ups the standard upon which make-up effects will be set to. They didn't skimp on showing what a bullet and/or a spray of 12-gauge buckshot would do to a human head.<br /><br /> The acting, for a horror film, was good enough that you will care what happens to the survivors. Sarah Polley and Mekhi Phifer are two who had stand-out performances. Ving Rhames was his solid, dependable self. But the two actors who stuck in my mind were Jake Weber's Michael and Ty Burrell's Steve. Weber's Michael was like an everyman --- a calming and levelheaded presence in a world that is anything but. Burrell's Steve had every line which broke the tension and horror, giving the audience a chance to laugh and catch its breath.<br /><br /> If there was a flaw in the film it would be in the uneven feel of the script dialogue. A majority of the dialogue is good, but some weak lines are heard here and there throughout the film. And certain horror conventions and cliches are used, but not too much to turn the film into a Scream-like film that winks and shows the audience how clever the script is.<br /><br /> For those who have seen the original Dawn of the Dead and have been trying to find a reason to hate this remake, I say that if you give this film a chance and watch it on its own terms then it will surprise and entertain. Not better than the original but it succeeds in giving this subgenre of the horror field a lifegiving boost. 28 Days Later was a tease of a horror film compared to this remake.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this film to horror aficionados and to film lovers. It may not be Kubrick, Fellini, or Kurosawa, but it doesn't set out to be. It just tries to scare and disturb you.</p></body></html>

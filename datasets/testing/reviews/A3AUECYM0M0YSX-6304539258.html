<meta name="summary" content="A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, movies weren't dumbed down..."></head><body><p>The more I think about it, the more I think this would have been the perfect ending for Star Wars:<br /><br />Luke is charging down the Death Star trench, Vader on his tail. His droid has already had its lid blown off, and the same is about to happen to Luke if someone doesn't step in and save him. "I have you now!" says Vader. At that exact moment, his right wing-man erupts into flame. Vader looks around, puzzled. "Yeee-hah!" comes the voice of Han Solo. "Look out!" cries Vader's other wingman, just before exploding as well. Then Vader is struck by a laser bolt, and his ship incinerates. Luke fires at the Death Star and zips out of the trench, the battle station explodes, and the Empire is soundly defeated forever. THE END.<br /><br />No sequels. No second trilogy thirty years later. No mass merchandizing that has gone on for two generations. Instead George Lucas went on to make other movies. About *anything* else.<br /><br />Imagine that. If Star Wars had just been seen for what it was, namely a fun, escapist, very clever movie, and the world had moved on, cinema might still be for adults. People might be able to sit still for more than two minutes of exposition. Every other scene in a film wouldn't need digital effects and thudding, blaring THX sound. Just maybe.<br /><br />Because--lets spit up the Kool Aid and face facts here--there was never any need for sequels. The subsequent films didn't say anything the first one didn't, and the first one didn't say very much. Lucas once stated after Star Wars that he planned a series of 12 films all along. Then it became nine. Then six. The main message I took away from the first film was that despotism sucks, freedom is great and you have to be responsible for, and mindful of, your own actions. And that's about the whole point of all of it.<br /><br />How anyone could think Star Wars was any more profound than that is beyond me. But suddenly people who'd never picked up a philosophy text in their lives and didn't know how to pronounce Socrates began talking about the deep philosophical implications of the Force. (Oh, please.) People began telling Lucas he was channeling deep insights from Joseph Campbell. Joseph Campbell himself was one of the people who said that, but for the life of me, before Return of the Jedi, before the Lucas publicity machine began manufacturing the legend of their boss, I never heard a peep about Lucas being influenced by Campbell *while he was writing the first films.* Go read anything on George that predates 1983 if you don't believe me. If you find something from before then, post the link here. (An original source, not a cite from later.) Dale Pollack's excellent biography of Lucas, while not perhaps definitive, would probably not neglect such an important fact. On the extensive liner notes to the original soundtrack to Star Wars, some of them written by Lucas himself, he cites a variety of inspirations, but Mr. Campbell is not named. He concludes by saying "It's fun--that's the word for this movie." And indeed it is.<br /><br />But somewhere along the way in the desert, Lucas got the idea that he was a prophet. And there was such profit in being a prophet that no one dared tell him otherwise. They didn't have the nerve to say, "George, it's cowboys and indians in outer space, not profound and holy Scripture." So Scripture it became. And ink was spilled over the meaning of this and that insipid line. Was Obi-Wan's explanation for why he said Luke's father was "dead" lame? Noooo, there were all sorts of creative rationalizations. People with PhDs bought into this [...]. To a few of us, Lucas was naked rather than wearing Jedi robes, but we were and are the minority.<br /><br />I've heard countless times that Star Wars influenced a generation of filmmakers. Indeed it has. It's a tragedy, something we'll pay for artistically for decades to come. Thanks at least partly to Lucas, movies like Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and Independence Day are taken semi-seriously, instead of being laughed off the screen by insulted audiences. And today's generation is so deaf and dumb to good scriptwriting that they hand Oscars to Titanic and Gladiator. More than that, much of the sophisticated--emotional and aesthetic--that film had picked up through the 60s and 70s as it matured into a serious artform has been abandoned for marketable simplicity. Though Lucas is not solely to blame for all this, he is the genesis. I can think of no better reason for why scripts became retarded and characters turned dumb than his influence on the next wave of "auteurs," people who grew up watching nothing more than Saturday afternoon serials, as if that were a *good* thing, as Lucas seems to think. For all his talk about how the special effects aren't important and story is everything, what does he spend all his time with? Has he gone on to found acting schools or sound and visual effects companies? Do we remember Star Wars for the THX sounds or for Carrie Fisher's richly-textured performance as Leia?<br /><br />One of Lucas' "messages" in Star Wars is that you have to leave home, depart from what is familiar to grow and realize your potential. Yet Lucas himself has never strayed far from his familiar Star Wars universe. His two forays into other movie realms, Howard The Duck and More American Graffiti, were huge bombs. When he resurrected Star Wars in 1997, he was able to patch up the creaky visuals, but the creaky performances couldn't be mended by computer wizardry. That requires something technology can't provide: insight into the human condition. You'll never find it in a Lucas film past perhaps American Graffiti, unless "faster and more intense" is part of the human condition. In spite of the anti-technology preachiness about the Force, Lucas hides behind technology, the way Charles Foster Kane hid in his castle at Xanadu. Twenty-five years did nothing to make him grow. You have to leave the farm, George.<br /><br />So here we have, once again, for the umpteenth time, Star Wars. This time a new 2004 (I think) version sits next to the original 1977 film. Despite some definite improvements in the Death Star attack thanks to computer enhancement, overall I prefer the 1977 film, for a few reasons. One, the stupid Biggs subplot didn't need to be restored. It just confuses the audience. If Lucas knew as much about storytelling as he claims, he'd understand that by that point the audiences' mind is on the fate of the existing characters in the light of the battle to come, and not on meeting new people who go on to do nothing. Two, the added effects on Tattooine, with the shuttle craft in the background and the extra beasts being ridden by stormtroopers, is not only not needed, it ruins the beautiful economy of the original shot, which was a masterpiece of economy and slight-of-hand. Three, the expanded spaceport is superfluous, the "comic bits" where one robot fights with another about as "funny" as Jar-Jar. Four, what is the meaning of those "rings" around the explosions of the Death Star and the planet?<br /><br />And five, the scene at the supper table with Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen, probably the most amateurishly-filmed scene I've ever seen in any big-screen movie, is still there. No digital manipulation can make it play any better.<br /><br />It's clear where Lucas' heart is in this set. The DVD of the 2004 release is beautifully presented and anamorphic. Except for Mark Hamill's Parker Stevenson haircut, it looks like it could have been filmed yesterday. In particular, Lucas has removed much of the golden "glow" in the Tattooine sequences that he added (to cover the digital manipulation perhaps?) in 1997. The DVD of the 1977 version, on the other hand, is non-anamorphic and looks bad. How bad it looks will depend on your viewing equipment--an HDTV will really reveal all the flaws in their glory (the stars in particular look bad), but if you have an upconverting DVD player that helps *somewhat.*  No one is saying they didn't want the 1977 version cleaned up and enhanced sonically--Criterion does this all the time without damaging the integrity of the original, and Lucas knows this. He knows people will buy it anyway. And he's right.<br /><br />Some interesting points: much has been made among geek fans of the fact that after Vader slashes Kenobi, they forgot to rotoscope his light saber in a couple shots and it is white instead of tinted.  Even with this latest redo, it's still unfixed.<br /><br />After watching the 2004 version and the 1977 version back-to-back, I found the pacing of the original smarter.  Jabba, the extra Mos Eisley crap, and the Biggs scene all slow the story down painfully.  Particularly after Luke's guardians are killed and the exposition is essentially over, what made Star Wars work, I now remember from my first viewing, was that breathless quality to the cutting.  The restored scenes slow it down.<br /><br />And the extra credits in the revised versions means they had to reloop part of the closing music.  In the original, the end title music as composed by John Williams was a perfect rondo.  Now it's adulterated.  Alas, it's something many people won't notice or care about, but it bugs me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="KILLIN CILLIAN"></head><body><p>RED EYE serves as sort of a primer on the rising stars of Rachel McAdams (who plays Lisa, the heroine) and Cillian Murphy (the notorious Jack Ripner).  McAdams who has appeared in such varying roles in THE HOT CHICK, THE NOTEBOOK, THE WEDDING CRASHERS and MEAN GIRLS is a very competent young actress.  She milks the role of the damsel in distress to perfection, evoking a sense of terror, determination and guilt.  Murphy who has appeared in COLD MOUNTAIN, 28 DAYS LATER, BATMAN BEGINS and BREAKFAST AT PLUTO's plays the sinister and outright evil villain with a twinkle in those darling blue eyes.  Smoothly moving from the nice guy at the airport into the cold blooded killer seems second nature to Murphy and he's scary!<br /><br />The movie's plot is rather far-fetched but in this kind of movie, one just sits back and lets the talented director Wes Craven take them on a pretty suspenseful ride.  Fans of SURVIVOR might recognize studly Colby Donaldson as the Defense Secretary's head bodyguard and Jack Scalia is the target of the assassination.  Brian Cox, usually a dynammic presence in any film, doesn't put much into his role as Lisa's father; would have liked to seen a little more passion on his part.  Overall, RED EYE is a competent suspenseful movie, though.</p></body></html>

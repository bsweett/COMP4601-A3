<meta name="summary" content="Friday Night Lights  (2004)"></head><body><p>Director:  Peter Berg.<br /><br />Cast:  Billy Bob Thornton, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson, Lee Thompson Young Tim McGraw, Connie Britton.<br /><br />Running Time:  118 minutes.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual references and content.<br /><br />Although nothing that we have not seen before, "Friday Night Lights" makes up for unoriginality and mediocre, erratic cinematography with superb, sincere performances from a great ensemble cast of unknown youngsters, a beautifully crafted musical score from Brian Reitzell, and tremendously compelling football action.  The film ambits the trials and tribulations of the 1988 Odessa-Permian high school football squad in search of a state championship, but with an in-depth look into the true reality and significance of football on the lives of all that it touches in a small Texas community, "Friday Night Lights" proves to be more than just a run-of-the-mill sports drama.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton appends a unique role to his impressive resume, playing head Permian coach Gary Gaines, a well-respected leader of his troops but always under intense pressure from the Odessa faithful to be the best.  While Thornton may be the well-known star of the film, the film spotlights the metamorphosis of the team's courageous season through the eyes of the players:  quiet team captain Mike Winchell (performed exceptionally well by Lucas Black) not only has to lead his team to victory, but has the sole responsibility of taking care of his unhealthy mother; back-up halfback Don Billingsly (Garrett Hedlund) must live in shadow of his former Permian star father (Tim McGraw) and survive the continuous harsh criticism from the man who wants him to succeed the most; and the eccentric Boobie Miles (Derek Luke, star of "Antoine Fisher"), an incredibly tantalizing force on the football field, who must fight through injuries and life in the limelight.<br /><br />"Friday Night Lights" is based on the bestselling novel written by H.G. Bissinger (who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin) and is adapted brilliantly by David Aaron Cohen and Berg.  "Friday Night Lights" is not the easiest film to stomach (not due to violence, but because of some abnormal jerkiness of the camera), but the film is driven by the splendid supporting performances of McGraw and Luke.  Thornton is very convincing as the demanding, hard-nosed coach who believes in perfection, but ultimately shows his depth as an actor as he exponentially augments Coach Gaines sincerity and heart as the film progresses.  Not quite "The Field of Dreams" of the football drama genre, but a great sport drama nonetheless that will certainly touch those who understand the meaning of high school sports to teenagers who play them.  One of the best "half-time" speeches in film history.  A touching, heartfelt drama.</p></body></html>

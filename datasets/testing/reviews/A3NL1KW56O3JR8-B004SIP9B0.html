<meta name="summary" content="Helen Mirren makes the film"></head><body><p>First off: I can see why Helen Mirren won the Oscar; her performance was excellent. The rest of the movie, however, was a bit lacking by comparison.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I'm an American or because I never understood the fascination with Princess Diana, but I found the film a touch dull overall. Sure, there were some great moments, like with Queen Elizabeth in from of Buckingham Palace but there are long stretches in-between. Still, it was an interesting character study; I especially liked the interplay between the Queen and Tony Blair. (I found it strange, however, that the young princes were not portrayed in the film...)<br /><br />This is a good movie over-all. Defiantly rent it. "Movie of the Year," however? I think not.</p></body></html>

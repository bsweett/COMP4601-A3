It's a pretty, witty little movie about interesting albeit unlikeable folks who love drinking wine as much as I do.  When the reviews and box office begin to jettison SIDEWAYS into the stratosphere of "Blockbuster," I worried that going mainstream would detract from the simple pleasures to be derived from merely watching this cool "indie style" movie.<br /><br />That's why you'll enjoy the DVD...deleted scenes and a fun commentary track will bring the movie "back down to earth" for you.  Haden Church, particularly, is incredibly honest and clever in his commentary--there's a real genius and comic timing you wouldn't expect.  Hopefully, the attention and accolades he garnered for this role will allow him to showcase more of his talents in the future.</p></body></html>

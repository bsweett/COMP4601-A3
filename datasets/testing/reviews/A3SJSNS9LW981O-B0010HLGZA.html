<meta name="summary" content="Poor, poor Ralphie!!"></head><body><p>Ralphie... a man before his time. A victim of BB gun "gun control." Harrassed by bullies, disillusioned by Little Orphan Annie products... Ralphie is maturing despite himself.<br /><br />The funniest scenes involve the stuffed stiff little brother, whose winter garb made him "look like a tick about to pop."  I thought my mother was the only over-protective winter alarmist!!<br /><br />Even small, unimportant moments make me laugh... such as when a "Wizard of Oz" style witch garbed woman is working the crowd lined up to see Santa starts bothering poor Ralphie, and calls him a "tasty little morsel." Ralphie, obsessed with soliciting the big red guy for his Holy Grail of Christmas Presents, responds...<br /><br />"Uh... leave me alone... I'm, uh... THINKING."<br /><br />Ralphie articulates what all kids feel, he daydreams almost as much as I used to.<br /><br />Some forgivable weaknesses in this film is an over-used soundtrack, "cluing us in" as to when we're supposed to laugh... it's repetative music just gets in the way of the humor!<br /><br />Another forgivable flaw is how the movie is actually a series of events, loosely strung together by it's "anecdote master" writer. Still, that's how real life is... not every daily occurance is tied in to the next.<br /><br />The odd style profanity depictions of the father also takes some getting used to... "glabber-puss, humbuckle dash-heimer!!"  We're supposed to imagine the actual terms... which are more commonly heard on television these days than in the movies in the 80s.<br /><br />Ralphie represents the childhood experiences most of us have had... whenever they grew up. It's timeless nostalgia!<br /><br />The DVD extra features serve us well enough, considering the fact that this movie was considered a theatrical "flop" of the mid 80s. It's been a mega-force Holiday tradition in the years proceeding!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

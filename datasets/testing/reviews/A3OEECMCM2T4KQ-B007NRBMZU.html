If one scans their memory, it has been done many times before in numerous ways. There was that familiar Simpson's episode where old Homer, in his usual fashion, accidentally creates a time machine in an effort to fix the family toaster, merely stepping on a flower or insect in the distant past, thereby altering the very fabric of future society. There was also Richard Bach's much-underrated 80's novel, "One", describing his and his wife Leslie's travels through alternate realities and dimensions. This was a good novel. The basic premise for all these stories are essentially the same, and that is, the choices we make in life, however small or mundane, can have a tremendous effect on our future circumstances.<br /><br />The Butterfly Effect is a moral tale and a love story. Similar to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, traveling back in time to prevent the death of a loved one or the destiny of a loved one will not always turn out the way we want it to. The moral message in the film, I believe, is that we are ultimately responsible for our own condition, and the choices we make in life determine our destinies. But what if we could travel back in time and change our choices? And by making different choices, how profoundly would it affect the outcome of our lives? This concept also begs the question - is our future pre-determined?<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher delivers a good performance as the reluctant and later, obsessive traveler of alternate time. This film showed me that Kutcher has talent as an actor and could well go far in the profession. The two younger versions of his character also put in excellent performances, particularly the younger one of the two. It was also a pleasure to see Eric Stoltz again, as the character showed me that Stolz could just about play anything with believability.<br /><br />This film certainly cranks along and remains compelling to the end. And the film's ending, really, could have gone in many directions. The conclusion the writer's chose, however, was appropriate, as it rounded out this chaotic and at times complex tale, leaving the audience with a sense of closure. All in all, an entertaining film, with the added value of something to think about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exciting, Entertaining, and Really Good"></head><body><p>For an action film, Hostage sports surprisingly good performances. The cast features Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction),<br /><br />Kevin Pollak (The Whole Ten Yards), Jonathan Tucker (The Virgin Suicides), Ben Foster (The Punisher), and Willis's daughter<br /><br />Rumer Willis. The surprising thing is the best performance in the movie is by Foster who plays psyopath killer Mars. Anyway,<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays Jeff Talley, a former hostage negotiator who after a traumatizing accident (presented in the opening scene) moves to a small city and becomes chief of police. Then a crooked executive Walter Smith (Pollak) and his children are taken hostage in their fortress like house by Dennis (Tucker),<br /><br />his brother Kevin, and Mars (Foster), three psychopathic boys<br /><br />(Well, Mars & Dennis are, Kevin is just along for the ride).<br /><br />Talley chooses to pass up negoiating it, but then his wife and daughter (Rumer Willis, who plays his daughter, is surprisingly good for the few moments she's onscreen) are kidnapped by men who need a disc hidden in the DVD case of Heaven Can Wait.<br /><br />The film (like my title says) is very exciting, it never lets up, and it doesn't use cliches like most action films do today.<br /><br />There was one thing that was pointless (two Heaven Can Wait movies which didn't lead to anything), but you won't be dissapointed.

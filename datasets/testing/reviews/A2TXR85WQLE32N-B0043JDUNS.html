<meta name="summary" content="The Man behind the Iron Mask..."></head><body><p>Behind the armored suits and superb special effects, Iron Man 2 is a tough story of a fall from grace and redemption. Director Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. (reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man) dare to give the man behind the iron mask a mission besides saving the world: saving himself, with a little help from unexpected friends.<br /><br />As the story begins, Tony Stark faces the consequences of revealing his Iron Man identity.  The government and a rival arms inventor (an over-the-top Sam Rockwell) want the suit; a revenge-seeking Russian physicist (a perfectly cast Mickey Rourke) is after Tony; and Tony himself is being poisoned by the miniature nuclear reactor that keeps him alive.  Tony slowly self-destructs, wrecking his business, his relationships with long-suffering personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Air Force buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), and finally his status as Iron Man.<br /><br />At rock bottom, Tony gets a hand up from Colonel Nick Fury of SHIELD (a nicely restrained Samuel L. Jackson).  Fury provides Tony with a means, and a motivation, to work out his own salvation.  En route to a smashing finale, Tony gets a key assist from Fury's undercover contact inside Stark Industries.  As enigmatic SHIELD agent Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson is "all that" in a form-fitting unitard; her thrilling hallway fight sequence might have been the centerpiece of a movie with less visual firepower.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" is very highly recommended to fans of the franchise as an excellent sequel.  There are hints the next sequel may be an "Avengers" movie.</p></body></html>

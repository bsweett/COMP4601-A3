It was HALARIOUS!<br /><br /> Basically, the plot is simple: Man wants to be cool, joins gang, you know! But although lacking plot, it will bust your gut! It's a kung-fu comedy!<br /><br /> It's foreign with subtitles, so if you don't like reading, don't watch it!<br /><br /> It tickles as many ribs as it breaks! So "Hustle" to your nearest theatre and see this!<br /><br /> PS: Why is it rated R? The action is just slapstick.</p></body></html>

Anniston wasn't all that wholesome in 'Friends'.  So that's a crazy statement all on its own.  Derailed-in a word is 'transparent'.  It was painfully obvious Lucinda was involved from the moment she uttered the words "Some people don't appreciate what they have."<br /><br />Plus how many Parisan thieves in expensive suits roam Chicago pulling hotel robbery jobs?  Plus Lucinda boast about her high-profile job and her being married to a broker--yet, the thief isn't asking money from her, too?  That was highly suspect.<br /><br />Charles' character was so weak I was stunned.  Plus, he was supposedly smart, but showed no ability to sit still for a minute and truely think about what was going on.  He was too busy reacting.  When his friend was shot, why didn't he flag down the police?  He didn't shoot the guy.  Any normal person would have gone to the police to report what was going on instead of giving up their sick daughter's money over protecting some skirt's (of which he didn't get a piece of)family.  The first pay off, fine.  The second--Lucinda was on her own.<br /><br />The final showdown at the prison was just silly to me.<br /><br />I think another review had it right.  Good actors-bad script.</p></body></html>

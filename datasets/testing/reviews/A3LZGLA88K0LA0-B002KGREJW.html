<meta name="summary" content="YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE"></head><body><p>LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the surprise indie hit that charmed critics and probably took DREAMGIRLS place in the Best Picture nominations this year.  Is this movie Oscar worthy?  That's hard to say..it certainly is entertaining and original, with a screenplay that examines a dysfunctional family in a kindly light.<br /><br />The story focuses around little Olive, a ten year old who wants to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  Coached by her wily grandfather, Olive wants to win so badly.  Her father is a motivational speaker whose 9 step program to winning is his ticket for the future, even though no one is really interested in buying it.  Mama is a typical supportive mother whose family means everything to her.  Her brother has recently attempted suicide due to the loss of his male lover and his job.  She feels responsible for getting him back into life.  Her son is a strange one indeed.  He has been in self-imposed silence for nine months to prepare him for a career as an airplane pilot.  Hubby's dad is a grizzly, foul mouthed, heroin addicted octogenarian whose abrasive exterior shadows his true sensitivity.<br /><br />The movie follows their journey to the pageant with some unexpected obstacles.  The cast is uniformly excellent:  Greg Kinnear is superb as the driven dad; Toni Collette is fine as the mom; Alan Arkin in his nominated supporting role provides a nice foundation; Paul Dano is good as the strange son whose future is dashed when a small technicality arises; Steve Carell is wonderful as the suicidal brother; and cute little Abigail Breslin is charming in her supporting actress-nominated role.  (While it's questionable that either she or Arkin are strong contenders for Oscars?).<br /><br />LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a good little film and has a lot to offer.</p></body></html>

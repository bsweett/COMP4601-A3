Director Mel Brooks co-wrote the screenplay with star Gene Wilder.  Mel Brooks is known for satirical comedies such as Men In Tights (1993), Spaceballs (1987), and the Twelve Chairs (1970) among many others.  In YF, Frederick Frankenstein  (Gene Wilder) wants to carry on a quiet life as a college lecturer, but is dogged by the infamous achievement of his late father, Victor Frankenstein, of making a creature out of a corpse.<br /><br />Frederick travels to Transylvania, leaving his less-than-devoted fiancee (Madeline Kahn), and seeks to visit his father's estate.  He meets the lovely Inga, who is to be his lab assistant (Teri Garr), and the outrageous Igor (Marty Feldman) who gives many of the laughs in the film.  Despite his best self-conditioning, Frederick seeks to recreate his father's work.  The result is a creature or monster (Peter Boyle).  Yes, that is Ray Romano's Dad! The townspeople revolt, with disastrous and funny consequences.<br /><br />The movie starts out a little slow, but you will soon be in stitches.  I asked my husband just to give YF a chance, and he laughed so hard, and is still quoting lines from the movie today.</p></body></html>

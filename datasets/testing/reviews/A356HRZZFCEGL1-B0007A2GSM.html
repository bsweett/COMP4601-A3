The Marvel pantheon has promulgated that realistic but depressing notion through almost all its characters (notably the Hulk, Spiderman, the Thing, and especially the X-Men) to such a pervasive degree that DC Comics, home to the "demigod" Superman, had to follow suit. Superman, formerly invincible and infallible, suddenly became saddled with multiple vulnerabilities, inhibitions, and doubts. Again, this realistic approach is thought-provoking and an important factor in the success of the "Spiderman" movie franchise. But let's be honest; if you had a super power, ANY super power, wouldn't you have the time of your life?<br /><br />"The Incredibles" answers this question with an exuberant "yes!". I will not dwell upon the movies many virtues, since other posters have already done a thorough job of that. I wish to emphasize that "The Incredibles" succeeds to a large degree by inverting the above-mentioned Marvel superhero theory, "regressing" back to the 50's and 60's and reminding us that, in the final analysis, being a superhero is freaking great. Bob Parr (aka. Mr. Incredible) revels in his abilities and his responsibility to humanity. Unlike with Spiderman, et. al., his powers are not a curse but an unadulterated blessing and his raison d'etre. Unlike Spiderman, et. al. he does not want to be a normal member of the herd, to be equal to them. He wants to be, and is, different, and better. That's why his speedster son Dash (a.k.a. Dashiel's) remark that "when everyone is special, no one is" resonates. Mr. Incredible was wasting away in Conformityville; to survive and keep his sanity, he had to put on the tights.<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is thus not a scathing satire of superheroes, except for a few jabs at Mr. Incredible's spare tire, and Ms. Mode's hilarious montage on the dangerous absurdity of capes (for which archvillain Syndrome apparently did not get the memo). It treats superbeings with respect, and not just Mr. Incredible. As the movie unfolds, it progresses from a stately (perhaps slow) state of domesticity and family to a crescendo of Action with a capital A. Of course, "The Incredibles" does acknowledge and juxtapose super heroism with reality (at least the reality of tortuous lawsuits, oppressive "Dilbertseque" corporate workplaces, and the unpleasantness of adolescence through Dash and Violet). But the movie eventually and gloriously breaks free, and so do Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, and Violet!<br /><br />The only "flaw" I could perceive in "The Incredibles" is its somewhat derivative nature and amalgamated blend of every superhero, James Bond, Spy Kids, and Powerpuff Girls conceit ever revealed. So what? Good for the movie! I eagerly await the family's next adventure and perhaps the obligatory "origin stories". I hope the sequels continue to keep the proceedings fun.<br /><br />A few random observations:<br /><br />1. Mr. Incredible has his foibles (his expanded gut, his initial neglect of his family, and his occasional Buzz Lightyearesque imperiousness), but he is no buffoon and no joke by any stretch of the imagination. His family is recognizably human but quite laudable.<br /><br />2. In an early scene in the movie, just before Mr. Incredible in his younger days confronts supervillain Bomb Voyage, the illumination hitting his old suit makes him look like Green Lantern.<br /><br />3. The Omnidroids Mr. Incredible and family battle resemble a cross between Dr. Octopus's tentacles and a bathysphere.<br /><br />4. Brad Bird must be a Fantastic Four fan!<br /><br />5. Evangelical Christians will probably be aghast at Baby Jack-Jack's climactic encounter with Syndrome (which got the loudest cheer from the theater audience I was involved in).<br /><br />6. Though spawned by frustrated geeky fan-boy aspirations, I thought Syndrome made a formidable and even occasionally sympathetic villain, channeling both the Joker and an evil Mask (as well as, ahem, Heat Miser of course).<br /><br />7. One cannot trademark a superpower.<br /><br />8. I wonder if Marvel will ever contract with Pixar to do a comic rendition of "The Incredibles".<br /><br />9. Apparently Mr. Incredible possesses strength in the "Class 100" range, easily able to bench over 100 tons. But does he possess other powers? He cannot fly under his own power, but is he invulnerable, have optic and auditory powers, etc.? What are the extent of his family's abilities?<br /><br />10. I'm glad the Parrs did not have a super-powered pooch or other pet a la Krypto, unless that comes up in the sequel.<br /><br />11. The PG rating is warranted. Pre-preteeners will find the movie by turns a bit too intense and slow-going, as the occasional infantile whines in my movie audience can attest to. Savvy adults and older teenagers will probably enjoy the movie the most!<br /><br />By the way, I bought the DVD.</p></body></html>

On the plus side: Flat-screen TVs for every one! Also, alcohol is plentiful, and the dog track is still operating. On the minus side: The world has turned to smoldering ruins, and it's been 18 years since any woman has given birth. Also, the leading consumer product - the Coca-Cola of Dystopia - is a suicide drug called "Quietus." Motto: "You decide when."  Kyle Smith<br /><br />London, 2027 is a world upside down. The riveting scenery reminds me of Cormac Maccarthy's 'The Road'. Bleak, barren, fires burning, men chasing and killing each other. In this case it is the immigrants who are not wanted, they are all rounded up and probably  executed.  Clive Owen plays Theo, an activist brought into the picture by his ex-wife, Julianne Moore. Under a pretext of bringing her to the coast she asks for his help. It turns out that she has a pregnant young woman to escort. There has not been a prenancuy in 19 years, and we are left to guess why. Along the way through many, battles a baby is born and the drive to free the mother and baby goes on.  Theo's old hippie, pot-smoking mentor, played by Michael Caine as you have never seen him, is the epitome of excellent acting. There is no explanation for the infertility, or why a move to the coast or what has really happened in this world.<br /><br />"Based on a novel by British mystery writer P.D. James, the film works both as a thriller and as a satisfying political and social drama. It should prove a winner at the boxoffice in all territories. Set in 2027, with the world gone to hell in a handbasket, the film paints a bleak portrait of a future in which complete global human infertility has meant that no babies have been born anywhere in 18 years. Disease is rampant and military governments everywhere are out of control even in the U.K." Ray Bennett<br /><br />This is a stunning visceral movie. The filming and scenery are phemomenol. You can forgive a lot in the face of filmmaking this dazzling. The story leaves much to our imagination and much to be desired. Clive Owens, Theo, has become a true hero. Why does he risk his life? What does this all mean? It is for you to judge.

<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Spacey nails it!"></head><body><p>Beyond the Sea was a labor of love for actor Kevin Spacey, he wrote, directed, and stars as singer Bobby Darin and boy he does a wonderful job. Spacey is good in every movie but in this particular role, he shows how colorful of an actor he really is. Kate Bosworth also stars as Sandra Dee, she does an ok job but watch this film if you are a die-hard fan of Bobby Darin's classic music. This movie comes off a tad bit self-indulgent but entertaining. Give this biopic a try. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

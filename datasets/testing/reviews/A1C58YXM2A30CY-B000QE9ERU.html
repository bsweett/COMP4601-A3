<meta name="summary" content="Punishing To Watch -- On Par w/Catwoman!"></head><body><p>A strange take on the Marvel comic of the same name.  Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) in the comics is at a picnic when his family overhears some gangland stuff going on and promptly get murdered.  Perhaps a wife, a few kids.<br /><br />The film thinks bigger.  We have Castle retiring.  Just before he does, he gets involved in a sting where the son of a gangster (John Travolta) gets himself killed.  Travolta's character does some research and finds that Castle was the disguised sting operator.  The wife insists that Castle's entire family gets wasted.  That's the entire two clans of the family reunion in Puerto Rico.<br /><br />About 30 people are killed.  A bit overkill, huh?<br /><br />Thomas Jane plays the role in a bit of a subdued tone rather than an angry vengeful tone.  And in some scenes this works.  The Punisher, just like in Elektra, does not do well in hand to hand combat.  He gets punched, beat, and is wiped along the floor and smashed into concrete floors and walls.  He beats The Russian by throwing hot soup in his face.<br /><br />OK, now I'm scared.<br /><br />The film tries to be lighthearted with the family he lives nearby as neighbors.  They look at Frank as family.  The slapstick became a bit much.  And if some guy is pulling your lip rings out with a pair of pliers, you really are not going to say anything about the whereabouts of Castle?  And the little fat friend who sits with a smarmy grin on his face does not make a move or say a word as the kid gets his rings pulled out.  Geesh....<br /><br />Some slapstick as well, comes off fake.<br /><br />Strange -- why does it take so long for the gang to know where Frank lives?  His face was on every TV set in the city and people would point and say, "Hey, I know you!"  Yet half the film is over before they decide to go to his apartment.<br /><br />The Punisher does punish --especially towards the end of the film where we see he's pretty good setting up booby traps and creating false evidence, tricking Travolta's character into killing his own associates and wife.  Clever.<br /><br />Blowing up every single car in a parking lot was, again, overkill.  I mean, really.  Travolta does not do "bad guy" so well.  Similar to his portrayal in "Broken Arrow", I just don't see him as evil.  Saturday Night Fever was not happening here!<br /><br />I don't want to list every fallacy in this film.  I will say some parts were fairly gruesome and sad, the pyrotechnics were loud and unnecessary and the acting was hampered by a script that didn't know where it wanted to go.<br /><br />And, no Stan Lee walk-on!<br /><br />Recommended for die-hard fans who want to see a movie loosely based on the Punisher comics series.  On par with Catwoman.  No, really!</p></body></html>

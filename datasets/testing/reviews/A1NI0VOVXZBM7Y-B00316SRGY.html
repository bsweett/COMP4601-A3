<meta name="summary" content="Gran Torino(Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Gran Torino(WideScreen Edition DVD):<br /><br />Let me start by Saying I am a big Clint fan, however I won't go see Invictus because it seems to be typical Mandela Propaganda(he's a Communist/castrolover), So I am disappointed Clint Directed that Film,That Said, This movie Should Have won Best Movie! I am not one for Redemption movies, but Thought Clint did a Great job, The Car,Sadly A Ford Gran Torino 1972, (I like Vettes.then Chevy/GM) doesn't do much nor do you hear the engine roar(or Sputter?-Ford)But the point is the movie, the Acting, The Main Character's Family, and how they could care less about him and just want him to croak or live in a Old Folks Home*Near Typical American family* is very sad.People don't have any morals or respect anymore,especially the youth(and Btw I am 27,was raised different). The movie may not be Politically Correct for some of the puritanical people out there because of the Slurs and such,But the movie is a Winner.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="KEVIN GOES SPACEY"></head><body><p>THE USUAL SUSPECTS is an unusual, well-crafted, if ultimately mystifying movie.  Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar for his supporting role as the narrative force behind the drama.  A plot as thick as New England molasses unfolds in flashbacks and present day, and with Spacey telling the story, what's truth and what is fiction?  There are some interesting twists throughout the movie, and of course, the final one is a doozie, although if you watch the film closely, you can see it coming.<br /><br />Along with Spacey, director Bryan Singer gets good performances from Pete Postelthwaite as a conniving attorney; Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro as members of the gang; and a good performance from Gabriel Byrne, the supposed mastermind of the gang.<br /><br />The identity of Kayser Solce is key to the film, and it's revelation forms the big surprise at the end.<br /><br />Well done, but not the classic others feel.</p></body></html>

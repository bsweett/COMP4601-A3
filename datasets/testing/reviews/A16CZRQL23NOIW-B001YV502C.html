<meta name="summary" content="So you, children of today are the children of the grave!"></head><body><p>A horrid futurist nightmare that couldn't be better described by the title of the famous rock song from Black Sabbath's album, "Master of reality."<br /><br />If "Soylent Green" in the early seventies, became a cult movie due its powerful bitterness around the utopist solution of food for an overpopulated world, this somber film deals with an interesting and even sharp proposal; the question of infertility in the mankind, and the way the children are considered as a transcendental fact.<br /><br />The whole social body is mentally messy. All the world has collapsed, except Great Britain in which the conditions of life are far beyond the poorest nation of the Third World. Misery, hunger, hungry, fear, desolation, hopeless conform an apocalyptic frame in which the violence appears as the final result of antagonist forces. Terrorist cells, occupation forces, and the presence of two curious antiheros: an old, caustic and outlaw man, wonderfully featured by an unrecognizable Michael Caine and a man who works for a department who once was engaged with a woman who has become a terrorist leader Julianne Moore in a very brief but powerful performance with the only mission: to preserve by all means a young mother to come.<br /><br />An acidic gaze respect the post industrial future, that it may sin of being extremely awesome but pretty original in what concerns the exposed issues of an unthinkable reality.<br /><br />.</p></body></html>

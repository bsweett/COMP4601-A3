<meta name="summary" content="A rare treasure of endearing fun... applies to any cross culture relationships!!!"></head><body><p>May 5th, 2007. Alessandra Prado, Alex Ariano and I visited Martha Oliva who is at home recuperating from foot problems and we brought her this DVD to watch as a group... the best medicine available...  for this movie is a rare treasure of endearing fun... which applies to any cross cultural relationships!!!<br /><br />The plot is simple, a young Greek woman, still living with her parents at the age of 30, under a domineering father who tells her she is "looking old" and not yet married, falls in love with a rather handsome University professor, who does not share her heritage, her sense of belonging to a large family, or her cultural identity.<br /><br />Toula Portokalos, played by Nia Vardalos, works as a waitress in her family's Greek restaurant, "Dancing Zorba's" and one day sees the handsome Ian Miller come in to meet one of his friends and she falls in love at first sight. She is entranced by his sight, he notices her, but she can not believe it possible.<br /><br />Toula is inspired to look for more out of life and enrolls in PC classes at the University, the dialogue of her parents as they decide whether a "woman should be educated" or not, is simply some of the funniest lines ever!!!<br /><br />As she excels at the required courses to run an efficient travel agency, Toula, with the help of her encouraging mother, convinces her aunt that she should go and work for her... They sit to tell the father... or was it the father's idea that she should go to work at the travel agency?<br /><br />The day Ian Miller, played by John Corbett, happens to walk by her place of employment provides some of the funniest clips of this film, which keeps you laughing from beginning to end!<br /><br />The couple begin an endearing romance, one that we thoroughly enjoy as it develops into a beautiful love affair. But... beware! The family finds out and the father is livid at this WASP [White Anglo Saxon Protestant] moving into Greek territory, something unheard of in the tradition of this lovely Greek family.<br /><br />As the families start to get to know one another, some of the scenes are so funny that we laugh to our hearts content. Being Cuban American, many of the scenes remind us of our own struggle to bring different cultures together as we have weaved the fabric of our families with many other cultural threads.<br /><br />During the film we admire the way Toula transforms from a quiet, introverted and shy person into a rather sophisticated young woman. The wedding entrance has one of the most memorable scenes as the Greeks overwhelm the bride side of the guests... doing what is culturally correct to bring good luck to the bride... causing revulsion and shock to the American side of this couple.<br /><br />Simply... don't miss seeing this film... By now we have seen it 6 or 7 times and we find ourselves enchanted and constantly laughing. Indeed a rare treasure and a MOST own DVD!!!</p></body></html>

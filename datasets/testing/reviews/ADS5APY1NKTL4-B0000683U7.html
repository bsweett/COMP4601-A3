Excellent shots "on location" (or not?)<br /><br />[Mount Rushmore, an "abandoned" cornfield in the infamous crop dusting scene, with a low flying plane, coming right at Cary Grant's unsuspecting character.]<br /><br />2.  Wickedly sinister bad guys.  [James Mason and Martin Landau]<br /><br />3.  Wonderful music.  [A score by the masterful Benard Herrmann.]<br /><br />4.  Wonderful director [It's hard to go wrong with Alfred Hitchcock--though, there have been a couple of his films that have made us question this!]<br /><br />5.  It's available on DVD!  [It's about time!]<br /><br />What else can I say, but go see it today!</p></body></html>

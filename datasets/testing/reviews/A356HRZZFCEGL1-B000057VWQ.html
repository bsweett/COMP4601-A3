<meta name="summary" content=""A Christmas Carol" Inversion"></head><body><p>Here I am, just another reviewer acknowledging the immortal significance of this gritty but sentimental, sometimes harsh but more often joyous, deliberate but life-affirming treasure that is "It's a Wonderful Life" (hereafter "Wonderful Life").  Do I have a new perspective on "Wonderful Life"?  Maybe, but I doubt it, but here goes:  It has often struck me how "Wonderful Life" is sort of the inversion and distorted reflection of "A Christmas Carol".<br /><br />  George Bailey and Ebenezer Scrooge - can any two characters be more diametrically opposed? George is kind-hearted, thoughtful of others, beloved by the citizenry; Ebenezer is uncaring, misanthropic, and treated with fearful disregard.  The only thing they seem to have in common is that both are industrious and, surprisingly, both dissatisfied with their lots.  However, although rich with public esteem, George admits his despondent dissatisfaction with his relatively "poor" financial status. Conversely, although rich with material goods, Ebenezer harbors dissatisfaction with his relatively poor social/human status, that is, his alienation, though he will hardly admit this.  In a subtle, distorted way, George and Ebenezer kinda want what the other has - the only difference is, ironically, what Ebenezer subconsciously wants is better than what George wants.<br /><br />  Of course, both men receive spiritual intervention and of course, get a glimpse of their futures.  Only difference is, George receives a vision of what the future would be if he did not continue his altruistic ways, while Scrooge receives a vision of what the future would be if he DID continue his selfish, parsimonious ways.  For both men, both visions promise stark oblivion (in different ways, of course).  Both men's future visions, for different reasons, convince them that selfless interaction with society is the path to bliss; George just needed to be reminded of it, while Ebenezer needed a remedial course.<br /><br />  Therefore, in my opinion, many parallelisms and common themes exist between "Wonderful Life" and "Christmas Carol" besides the obvious fact that both tales are Christmas (and universal) classics.</p></body></html>

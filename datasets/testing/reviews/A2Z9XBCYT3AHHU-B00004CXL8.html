<meta name="summary" content="well acted"></head><body><p>this is a funny film, with some of the greatest lines ever written for jack nicholson--and he has had some great ones. but helen hunt has started to get on my nerves the more i watch this film. i've not been a big fan of hers and in this movie she just feels abnoxious. still, thankfully it doesnt take too much away from the great acting by both jack nicholson and greg kinnear, who was truly wonderful as the gay neighbor.</p></body></html>

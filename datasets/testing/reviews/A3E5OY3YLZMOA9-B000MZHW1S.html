I didn't want to see it because the things I was told about it didn't really make me too happy. Blood diamonds or conflict diamonds are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance the conflicts. I remember as a child my mom would tell me that there're places in Africa where you could walk down the roads and find diamonds and jewels in the ground. Of course I didn't totally believe her then cause I was like 6 but after seeing this you come to see how valuable and beautiful Africa really is.<br /><br />The film is set in 1999 in the Sierra Leone civil war the country is at a constant struggle with fights between government soldiers and rebel forces. The rebels named RUF are pretty much past crazy, invading villages, cutting off innocent peoples hands so they're unable to vote and taking strong men to mine and young children to mold into little soldiers. Everything starts with Solomon Vandy, a good man with a good family and his son is a good student. One day while walking home with his son after catching some fish a few trucks playing music come speeding behind them. There are armed men in the truck and Vandy immediately knows trouble is coming. He runs to his village in a great panic to get the rest of his family out but the men get there first and are already just killing whoever. Vandy gets his family out but he gets caught and is sent to work the mines in search of diamonds.<br /><br />While working the mines Vandy finds one of the largest and rarest diamonds ever. Somehow he sneaks off to hide the diamond and lucky for him government troops attack just as a RUF soldier sees what he's doing. Unfortunately Vandy gets caught and is arrested along with the injured soldier. While in prison the soldier shouts what he saw Vandy do and says he will give money to anyone who gets the truth out of him. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) trades weapons for diamonds and overhears the talk between Solomon and the soldier. Archer is quick to help Solomon get out and then starts harassing him to get the diamond. A number of events occur that just making everything worse, the absolute worse being Solomon's son getting kidnapped but RUF and made a little soldier. Now Vandy must get his child back and goes on a hard journey to get the diamond and his child.<br /><br />First of all things I can't believe Djimon Hounsou didn't win Best Supporting Actor for this film. Seeing him in the previews going crazy to find his son was even getting to me. I don't think I could explain how powerful his performance was in this film. It was so realistic and perfected that you had to feel his pain. The scene at the end with when he tries to bring his brainwashed sons mind back was amazing. I saw Little Miss Sunshine and not to take anything from Alan Arkin but that was nothing compared to Hounsou in this film, Hounsou should've been the one that walked out. I too have never really been a Leo fan but you can't deny that he has a great talent. He plays Danny Archer on point and never lets the character go. This film would not be what it is without the great acting and the settings of Africa were beautiful. I'm not exactly sure how accurate this movie is with the history but overall it's a great film and is a must see.</p></body></html>

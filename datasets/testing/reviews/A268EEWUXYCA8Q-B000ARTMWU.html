<meta name="summary" content="This movie is sick"></head><body><p>LOL!  So I'm not sure exactly how I got on here twice...the other review is supposed to be for the DVD release, not this one...sorry for innundating you all with my two reviews instead of one :-\<br /><br />When I originally wrote this review, it was based off of the import DVD from France that I was able to get about 5 months ago.  But, Amazon took all reviews down as it got closer to the movie release date here in the states.  So I'm redoing my review based on the American release.<br /><br />The American release is a cut version of the French film which received an NC-17 rating.  This rating means death at the US box office, so they cut it down a bit.  I'm happy to tell you that they didn't cut too much.  I think the length of the movie dropped maybe 2 minutes at the most.  Ironically, what was cut from the movie was not any scene involving sex.  Most NC-17 films that are cut to miss the rating, have their sex scenes cut.  In this case, it is the hardcore violence that is slightly muted.  In some cases this works because I thought some of the violence early on (see the weird decapitation) was over the top blood wise, verging on Kill Bill type blood.  But, it also detracts from the ending with the scene involving the wood spike and barb wire.  That scene, unfortunately, was cut down.<br /><br />This movie is sick and I don't mean sick as in cool (though it is cool, too).  Even cut down, this movie is violent and bloody.  In fact, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who is squeamish, weak stomached or scared easily.  That said, if you are tired of the current crop of American horror movies (Cursed, Hide and Seek, Alone in the Dark, Ring 2, et al ad nauseum) and want something visceral and in your face, look no further.<br /><br />I will only talk about the setup to this movie.  It's about two college girls who go to one of the girl's family farm for a weekend to study in peace and quiet.  But when a guy pulls up in the dead of night in front of their house, it becomes a cat and mouse game between one of the girls and a truly homicidal man.  And what follows is about 85 minutes of pure tension.  The movie is aptly named.  While there are few "cheap jump out scares" in the movie, there is this feeling of tension that balls up in your stomach where you constantly wonder when the protagonist will make the wrong move.<br /><br />If you have read the book Intensity by Dean Koontz, the setup is very similar to that.  It's like the director was working with that book as a starting point for the movie before moving in a different direction, namely changing the events leading up to the climax.  In fact, I'm surprised there hasn't been more mention of this fact since half of the movie is almost scene for scene from the book in some ways.  My recommendation is to not check out any other reviews for this movie.  I've read a few on some different websites and they gave away some of the plot.<br /><br />The director knows music and uses it very effectively to increase the tension of the movie.  Unlike horror music today, it doesn't peak at moments to tell you "be scared right...NOW!" Instead, he uses some ambient music that you might not be aware you're hearing but you will feel its effects.  For example, he uses a metranome that dings at a constant beat, mirroring your heart beat thudding.  It's subtle but very effective in pulling you into the movie and making you feel like even the music could give away the protagonist's hiding place.<br /><br />The acting is also really well done.  Well the physical acting.  Since this is a French film, the movie is dubbed instead of being subtitled and while the voice dubbers did an admirable job, it's still dubbed.  The dubbing in the theatrical cut is different from the version I have.  In the theatrical cut, they tried to make the characters bilingual.  I think this detracted from the movie.  I happen to not like dubbing, but I would rather them stick with one form through the movie, not moving back and forth at will for no apparent reason.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movie, I'd recommend trying to get a copy of the import version through Ebay or something.  The DVD version is rated NC-17 for a sexual scene, brief nudity and more violence and blood than you can imagine.  Overall, it's better than the theatrical cut.<br /><br />I have to talk about the major turning point in the movie.  I have seen this movie 4 times now, twice from the DVD I own and twice in the theatre.  When I first saw the twist ending, I thought it was cool.  But after thinking about it, I didn't think it made much sense and was confused about it.  After seeing it an almost obsessive 4 times, I can say that I understand the ending and that it really does make sense.  It's a different kind of movie than what most American cinema goers are used to.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of foreign films, both horror and not, and a prevalent theme is that they are usually ambiguous and allow the viewer to draw their own conclusions.  This movie falls into this category.  If you think about it, and watch it more than once, you can see how the movie falls into place.  They don't lead you along by the hand, you have to see and find the puzzle pieces that fit.  I will tell you that after seeing it so many times, most of the puzzle pieces are there.  I can see how the ending will infuriate and frustrate some.  I can also see how people will say the ending doesn't make a lick of sense.  It's true that on your first viewing it won't make much or any sense.  But, if you see it a couple times you can see how it fits together.  The question is, is it worth it to you to see how it works or not?  For me it was.<br /><br />Ending aside, however, what we have here is a truly intense and disturbing film.  Not only in what happens in the film but the themes only hinted at in the film.  Because of its content only those who truly like horror movies should see this movie.  Truthfully, why do us horror fans go to see scary movies?  To be scared.  Not to discuss the twist ending.  For me, this movie was intense and scary.  It's very in your face and not for the weak of stomaches.  But if you can stomach it, it can leave you breathless.</p></body></html>

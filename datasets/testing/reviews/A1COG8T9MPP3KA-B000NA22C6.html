<meta name="summary" content="Johnny take off your glasses or get a new director"></head><body><p>I do like Johnny Depp and most of his films, unfortunately this is his worst effort to date (even his short part in the first 'Nightmare On Elm Street' film is better than this). The director was messy and in a hurry while making this film. Why do I think this? I'll tell you why. All throughout the film, you can see the camera lights reflected in Johnny's glasses. Look for the green box in his glasses. When I see this, I wonder how a director can be so clumsy, it is as if he doesn't care about his work. And it doesn't happen once, it happens through the entire film!!<br /><br />Now as for the acting. Johnny looks as if he decided to dress up as a writer for Halloween. It looks like a bad high school costume. He is suppose to be a writer and walks around with an Einstein hair-do and a beaten up bathrobe. His acting as a writer is even worse. He sits with his legs crossed while polishing his glasses and his head cocked. Give me a break!!<br /><br />This is suppose to be a thriller. But I had my hand over my mouth trying to stifle my laughter. This movie is hilarious. The scene where he confronts his stalker by the truck which contains his 2 dead friends is beyond ludicrous.<br /><br />The ending will have you rolling your eyes. As Johnny sits eating his corn on the cob, which is suppose to be a metaphor. I just cannot believe how bad this film is. Watch if you want to laugh...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Scary Thriller"></head><body><p>Director Michael Bay, who also directed "Pearl Harbor", has made a very scary and gory remake of Tobe Hopper's classic original film.<br /><br />Five friends, Erin (Jessica Biel), Morgan (Jonathan Tucker), Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), Andy (Mike Vogel), and Kemper (Eric Balfour), are headed to Dallas to see a Lynrd Skynard concert.  Along the way, they encounter a mysterious hitchhiker alongside the road.  Erin and Pepper convince the guys to give her a ride.  This proves to be a huge mistake, as she is convinced that people are out to kill her.  Suddenly, she pulls out a gun and shoots herself.<br /><br />Shocked and upset, the others decide that they should contact the local sheriff, so they pull into a nearby gas station.  They are told to meet the sheriff at the Crawford home.  While waiting for the sheriff to arrive, the friends venture inside the house, when suddenly, Kemper is struck in the back and dragged off by a leather-faced, chainsaw-wielding maniac. What happens next is beyond imagination as the friends struggle to save themselves, and it turns out that Sheriff Hoyt, played wonderfully by veteran actor R. Lee Ermey, turns out to be just as crazy as "Leatherface".<br /><br />Unable to escape from this nightmare, Leatherface begins picking each person off one by one until only Erin remains.  Will she survive, or will she meet the same fate as her unfortunate friends?<br /><br />I saw the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre by Tobe Hopper, and I thought this movie was nearly as good as the original.  The storylines differed a little bit, but this movie is every bit as scary as the first, and Leatherface is very menacing as well.  There were some scenes that were hard to understand, such as the scene where Morgan charges into Leatherface, causing him to drop his chainsaw.  Erin, who was lying on the floor nearby, could easily have picked up the chainsaw and ended everything, but instead she tried hitting him with her fists, which did no good at all.  Overall, I found this movie to be scary and thrilling to watch.  Needless to say, this is not a movie for children due to the violence.  It compares favorably to the original and will definitely give you a good scare along the way.</p></body></html>

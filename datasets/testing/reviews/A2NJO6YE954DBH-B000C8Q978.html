<meta name="summary" content="Jim Jarmusch sends Bill Murray on a journey to discover...?"></head><body><p>I heard all of the accolades that Bill Murray received for "Lost in Translation" before I say the movie and while I enjoyed his performance I thought there were still parts where he was still acting like Bill Murray and that it was not the best thing he had ever done (that would still be "Groundhog Day").  But if you were wondering how far Murray can go in divorcing himself of his well-known mannerisms and such, then "Broken Flowers" would say the answer is pretty far.<br /><br />Murray plays Don Johnston (pay attention, people, there is a "t" there), who apparently made enough money from computers to feel comfortable sitting on his couch and watching his latest girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy) walk out the door.  For all we know her exit could write "fini" to his life, but then he gets an unsigned letter that says twenty years ago he fathered a son who might, at this very moment, be searching for him.  So the letter constitutes fair warning, but makes no impact on Don.  However, his neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright) is intrigued by the mystery, compels Don to make a list of all the women who could be the mothers of such a child, and then arranges a trip for him to check out the possibilities.  All Don has to do is go on the journey.  Giving the women pink flowers to gauge their reactions and seeing if they have a typewriter (the letter was typed on pink stationery) are Winston's helpful hints as he sends Don forth into the void.  He also promises to keep an eye out for any 19-year-old boy who shows up looking for his father.<br /><br />So it is that Don takes off to look for the woman who may be the mother of his child.  The candidates are Laura (Sharon Stone), Dora (Frances Conroy), Carmen (Jessica Lange), and Penny (Tilda Swinton).  Don must have been some sort of Don Juan (or even Don Johnson) two decades earlier because otherwise it would be pretty hard to connect the dots given that quartet of women.  As Don goes from one station of his journey to the next it is hard to tell if it is making an impression on him because Murray's performance is going for a minimalism that is quite impressive because it forces you to focus on what little he gives us to try and glean what is going on in his mind.<br /><br />Writer-director Jim Jarmusch ("Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai") makes it clear that the journey is more important than the destination.  After all the best case scenario here is that only one of the women on his itinerary can be the writer of the letter.  You may well watch "Broken Flowers" from start to finish wondering what it is all about, because Jarmusch's approach is to show instead of tell.  Some will find that maddening and others compelling, and your tolerance of this film could well be how much you like Bill Murray.  Fortunately, most people like him a lot, and that could well be the foundation for allowing his performance to be your conduit to this film, because without him it does not stand a chance.</p></body></html>

His adoptive parents gave him the name "The Nameless One" and like one who seeks to discover his destiny by finding purpose in life, Nameless studies the art of the sword for over 10 years, becoming a fearsome warrior that has taken on and defeated many other fearsome warriors.<br /><br />In this epic tale of the history of China, there is certainly more legend and fantasy than historic accuracy. The emperor of Qin has been ruthlessly taking over province after province in Asia, hoping to unite the people into one country, one tongue and one written language. His warriors kill by the thousands indiscriminantly under the authority of Qin, who has romantic notions of uniting his people by force while struggling with the ongoing paranoia of assassination attempts.<br /><br />Nameless is presented to the king of Qin as the best of warriors. He has single-handedly defeated previous formidable assassins to the king; Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung).<br /><br />Inquisitive, the king interrogates this heroic warrior and Nameless tells him the story of how he alone was able to defeat such cunning warriors. His story segues into a surreal and colorfuly rich tale with plots, subplots and twists and turns of love, hate, betrayal and jealousy. Each scene has exquisite sound as metal poles and swords clang together, you feel as though you are inbetween them. Each sub plot has its own color, season, calligraphy strokes and wind direction - a familiar theme to Asiaphiles and players of Mah-Johnng.<br /><br />The gravity-defying moves and feather-light landings of these martial artists are reminiscent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," but there the similarity ends. Like many epics, this too is a film of good vs. evil, but this film is different entirely from the Ang Lee epic. The moves are artistic and even poetic, but far more exhaustive to watch. You can literally get worn out watching these people fly across trees, water and the air and attempt to plunge swords into one another.<br /><br />The paranoid king doubts Nameless's story and accuses him of lying. The king tells his own version of events as they play out in his mind and we see the same players, wearing different colors, in different seasons and different directions of wind fighting and loving, with different outcomes.<br /><br />The king and Nameless play this verbal ping-pong back and forth and the candles that surround the king flicker ominously in one direction, then the next.<br /><br />Despite the sword play and twisted love tales, there is only artisitc, choreographed violence - we don't see severed limbs as in "Kill Bill," we don't see gushing blood & guts or squished eyeballs. There is a brief sex scene in which we see no real nudity and more is implied than seen. We see Jet Li's backside as he is stripped by the king's guards to ensure that he has no weapons hidden on his person - even his hair is iinspected. Only a partial glimpse is seen of his backside, so it's only partial, partial nudity at most. For the most part, this is a family friendly film - but I don't think I'd take a kid under the age of 13.<br /><br />If I were fluent in Mandarin and saw this in China, I would have given the film 5 stars, but due to the way the subtitles were rendered, I am forced to give the film 4 stars.<br /><br />On a DVD, the subtitles would be in the black area below the letterboxed film - but on the big screen, they stick the white letters on top of the bottom of the film, without any darker backdrop. The words are spanned from left to right almost edge to edge on the screen, so your eyes really have to dart back and forth unless you're in the back of the theater and the dialogue goes by way too fast to keep up if your eyes are having to scan back and forth 3 times to get all the subtitles. The white letters are placed above light objects that are in motion, which also makes it quite difficult to read. I have seen many foreign films and I have to say, this was the poorest subtitle rendering I have ever seen. I have never had a problem keeping up with subtitles in other films, but this one just wore my eyeballs out. My guess is that this will be resolved in the DVD version.<br /><br />So, if you see this on the big screen, you need to sit closer to the back than the front, or else you will not be able to keep up. There were many people commenting in the theater during the credits that they could not keep up with the pace of the dialogue because the subtitles were so difficult to read on non-contrasting backgrounds.</p></body></html>

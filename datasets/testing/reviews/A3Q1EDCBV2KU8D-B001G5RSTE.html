<meta name="summary" content="Cute, mostly a kids movie, but watch out for some bad messages"></head><body><p>The movie was cute and made me laugh in several places.  As with most kids movies these days, it has some entertainment for the adults.  As mentioned before the "I like to move it, move it" song part was fun and entertaining.  The one part that I found to be disturbing was the spitting out of water and worry that my little one will mimic that.  Overall I would watch this movie and if you like it, buy it, I think there will be those that will want to keep it.</p></body></html>

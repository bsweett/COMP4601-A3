<meta name="summary" content="Let's twist again in DTS"></head><body><p>When "Pulp Fiction" first made it onto DVD, the disc's images had all the charm of an over-inked Dick Tracy strip, garish and pummeled by artless contrast. This criminal neglect is avenged -- and then some -- by Miramax's terrific two-disc release of "Pulp Fiction: Collector's Edition." <p>A lot of the "Pulp" extras appeared on Criterion's laserdisc, though a few recent interviews are cut in. Those seeking Quentin Tarantino's take on his work and cinema in general have plenty to chew on. Some of the most interesting and coherent material comes on a pre-"Jackie" interview by Charlie Rose that appears on "Pulp." DVD-ROM links that lead to script/movie comparisons. The script viewer's version of "Pulp" includes scenes taken out during editing, as they would have appeared. Travolta does a lot of stunting with his lines, but they still come out Tarantino.<p>"Pulp's" outtakes are less compelling, mostly chatter cut for quality reasons. On-the-set footage includes the shooting of Travolta's big twist-contest number with Thurman, adding a few moments of music and dance to the delicious scene. Just off camera, Tarantino twists along to Chuck Berry's "You Can Never Tell."<p>The celebrated soundtrack to "Pulp" sounded OK on the original DVD; here it's elevated into audiophile territory. Dick Dale's pipeline guitar gives shivers; a cover of one of Neil Diamond's old hits erects a wall of sound. "Pulp" audio options are DTS and Dolby Digital, but the mix is mostly stereo, with some tasty reverb echoes from the rear now and then.<p> "Pulp's" video transfer takes a while to reveal its finesse, but the images are rich in leather-booth reds and shell-shock whites. Detail such as sesame seeds on a bun pop out at times, while other scenes deliberately go with the grain.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A STUNNING MASTERPIECE  9.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Sin City quite simply is jaw-dropping. What more could you ask for? An all-star cast, a striking visual look, brilliant storytelling, a crazed and rather demented cast of characters, and well-executed action scenes. Sin City is easily one of the greatest films of all time (The Internet Movie Database also backs this up, considering it's on the top 250 list). This is easily one of the best films I've ever seen. It's not quite perfect, but almost.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film is comprised of three separate storylines, all taking place in Sin City. One story focuses on a disgraced cop accused of kidnapping and child molestation after being framed by a powerful political individual who will not let his son be brought to justice for his crimes against little girls. Now the cop must protect a stripper (a girl who is now 19 he rescues at the beginning of the film from the crazed child molester.) and prevent her from being hunted down by her kidnapper, raped, and killed. The second storyline focuses on a man who is out to seek revenge for his murdered girlfriend Goldie, while running from the police because he has been accused of the murder by a powerful religious official, and now he has to find the killer and the religious official responsible for it while having the girl's twin sister tag along with him. The third story focuses a man named Dwight who defends his girlfriend from her violent ex-boyfriend and her Old Town Girls (A homicidal gang of gorgeous prostitutes who run the Old Town section of Sin City), when the Old Town Girls accidentally kills a group undercover cops, Dwight is tasked with getting rid of the bodies to protect their reign over Old Town and not anger the police and mobsters and have them come after them.<br />MUSIC: The musical score was excellent and fit the film perfectly through every moment.<br />ACTION: This film is modeled like an old black and white film, with small touches of color here and there. The action scenes are quite brutal and disturbing at times, but are loaded with shootouts and dismemberments of people. The action scenes were well done, but this film is definitely not for kids at all.<br />ACTING: The acting was really good, which is no surprise considering the all-star cast of people. The dialogue was also good, and it did feel believable. Unfortunately, I do have to complain that sometimes the dialogue got a little long-winded and dragged on. This is only a small complaint though, but it does put a blemish on this film.<br />OVERALL: This is a must-have for any DVD collection. This film is totally brilliant and well-executed in every regard.<br />THE GOOD: The striking visual style, the action scenes, the acting and actors, the brilliant storytelling, and the great music.<br />THE BAD: Moments of long-winded dialogue.</p></body></html>

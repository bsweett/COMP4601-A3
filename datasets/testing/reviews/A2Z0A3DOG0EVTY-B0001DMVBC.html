<meta name="summary" content="How Many Commandments Did You Break??"></head><body><p>I have to be painfully honest before I begin. I'm a down home protestant at heart. I spent my entire life going to Sunday school and Church. So when I sat down to write my review for THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG those pesky Ten Commandments kept jumping back into my head. Because I believe just about every commandment is represented and therefore broken it was impossible for me to not see it.<br />Philosophically I believe humans to be fallen, and therefore evil to the core. This is not a judgement but a spiritual absolute. I have lied, stolen, coveted, and so therefore I am separated from my Creator. It is only by grace that I am not lost. I also believe the Ten Commandments to be the most practical system of laws to prove this.<p>The characters in THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, is a great representation of this idea. In the film we are presented with two very flawed people. Two people who are fighting over a house that were taken by a bureaucratic mistake.<p>Jennifer Connelly (The Hulk) stars as Kathy, a young woman whose life goes from bad to worse. Her husband has walked out on her, she is recovering from a substance abuse problem, and her family has very little faith in her. When her house was stolen right out from underneath her, she is forced to live in crusty motels and her car until the legal system figures it all out.<p>You see, the government evicted her by accident and sold her house to an Iranian immigrant named Behranini (Ben Kingsly, Ghandi). Behranini has worked his entire life to make a place for his family. He once was a decorated military figure whom was forced out of his country with the Shah. He now lays gravel on the San Francisco Freeway, and works nights at a convenience store. Fiercely proud, he lives above his means so his daughter will marry well. When this foreclosed house comes on the market he sees a cash cow that can pull his family out of financial ruin.<p>These two people are thrown into a battle for a house. Both holding on for dear life and willing to do just about anything to get what each believes they deserve. No one is guilty and yet no one is innocent. <p>To make matters worse, there is this cop (Ron Elderd, Ghost Ship) with questionable morals whom is helping Kathy. At first it all seems innocent. He pulls some strings for her at the beginning. All seems well until they fall for each other and he leaves his family. <p>First time Director Vadim Perelman has crafted a film that is rough around the edges and yet filled with engaging performances. He has made a film where no one is the villain, and yet everyone is. He shows just how important it is to "Love our neighbors," what it means to be truly compassionate, and how easy it is for a regular guy to become a cold-blooded monster.<p>At every turn THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG shows its audience the mirror into our own souls. While I do doubt some of the motivations (Mostly those by Elderd's characters), Perelman has gotten performances out of the actors that feel authentic.<p>Jennifer Connelly should be up for an Oscar again. Her performance, while a little too somber, hits the right notes at the right time. The screenplay comes on a little thick, especially the scene involving the cigarette machine. But as we watch her character's slow and deliberate slide into poverty, we feel empathy and anger. She is not a hero, she is not good, but in the end she is human, and so we as the audience long to hug her.<p>Kingsly's character is also very good. He is a man fighting with the honor of his past and also for the American Dream. He is also a man who has lost his faith in his god, and wants so desperately to have everything good. His performance only suffers when the plot drags him and his son on a journey that steals the last moments of the film away from the realm of reality.<p>It is Elderd's character that steals believability from the film. The scenes where he is confronted by his jilted wife and his crying children feel desperate, and drag us away from the main story. His character also does too many things that feel forced. The last fifteen or twenty minutes of the film were adequate but still kind of clunky because of decisions he makes. They did not work for me as much as they should have. <p>The end also steals the action away from Kathy and places it all in Behranini's court. Thus stealing any true revelation from Kathy. It also features Jennifer Connelly standing on a white dock looking out at the ocean. I can think of two movies that use a shot similar to this, can you?<p>THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is so close to being perfect. I hate to harp on the entire end, because some of it works pretty well. I just hate serious character dramas that forget their characters and become slaves to their plot. But trust me, if you are looking for a film that is both challenging and really fascinating, give it a try.<p>****1/2 out of 5</p></body></html>

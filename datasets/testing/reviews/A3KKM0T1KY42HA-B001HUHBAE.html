<meta name="summary" content="Case Closed"></head><body><p>The problem with a true story is you know how it ends if you're familiar with the issue. Zodiac was San Francisco's notorious, infamous late 1960s serial killer...that was never caught. So my expectations were set for one of those unsatisfying movies that end without closure, and my expectations were met.<br /><br />Zodiac is not about the Zodiac killer as much as it is about the people involved in the pursuit of the Zodiac, and how those peoples' lives were effected/changed/...even ruined as a result of the failed hunt for the killer.<br /><br />Zodiac is chock-full of excellent actors that give you A-list performances. But in its 2 1/2+ hour run time, the action and suspense for my short attention span were much too far and few between.<br /><br />David Fincher directs Zodiac, and his resume is full of "good" movies. Se7en <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011CZRE">Seven</a> is Fincher's 1995, 5-star story of a fictional serial killer that was much more entertaining than Zodiac. If you're looking for a police story, you'll enjoy Zodiac. If you want a thrilling movie about a serial killer, Se7en is your lucky number.<br /><br />Case closed.</p></body></html>

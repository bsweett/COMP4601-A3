<meta name="summary" content="Best Cast in a musical...ever."></head><body><p>You all know the cast is All-Star. The fact that they all sing their own parts with no `Ghost Singers' makes this romp based on Abba songs all the better. And by the way, Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski can sing, and I mean very very well.<br /><br />The music, the scenery, the scenarios...all very excellent. And people, every actor/actress here can SING. While some think the `Dancing Queen' sequence is great, I think the Dancing Guys In Flippers (only 30 seconds long) is hilarious.<br /><br />The choreography is superb. The music is great, and the whole thing is just fun.<br /><br />The plot? Simple. A young girl invites three men (Firth, Brosnan, and Skarsgard) who are totally different, to her wedding. One of them, she believes, is her father. Her mother (Streep) had `encounters' with each. And each man, in return, believes himself to be the daughter he never knew of. Because of this, each man is transformed. Simple, and enough of the plot.<br /><br />The movie is about the incredible music and dance sequences. Enjoy this film for that simple fact. I know I did.<br /><br />And by the way, the movie is freaking funny.</p></body></html>

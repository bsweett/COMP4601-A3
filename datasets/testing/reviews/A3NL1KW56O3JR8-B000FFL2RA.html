<meta name="summary" content="Good enough"></head><body><p>This is defiantly no "Gladiator" but it's pretty good over all. I wish Neeson had a bigger role (and I never much cared for Bloom). The plot is a little forced--it has a somewhat choppy, pieced-together feel, like it's rushing to get to the good parts. Even so, there are a couple of really cool (if slightly clich&eacute;) scenes. The attempt to work in not-so-subtle comparisons to modern-day extremism in the Middle East was a touch clumsy, however. If you like "one-man-against-the-world" movies, then KoH will probably work for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hapless in Dunderland"></head><body><p>Alas, this is the second film I've seen in recent weeks that is rich in visuals and impoverished in emotion and intellect; the other was Terry Gilliam's "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus".<br /><br />The problem here is the characters -- not a single one, from the Cheshire Cat to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, has the slightest appeal, either in their design, personality, or dialog.  Even the voices of the CGI characters are poorly chosen here, as opposed to, say, the Shrek films, where the voices of Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz, and Mike Myers are so perfectly suited to Donkey, Puss, Fiona, and Shrek.<br /><br />As a result, the viewer really doesn't care much what happens to Alice or her new-found companions in "Underland".<br /><br />A plot of sorts is grafted onto her adventure -- slay the dragon-like Jabberwocky -- and much is made of the way she finds the courage to face her fearsome foe and her real-life tormentors, but it is far from clear what really motivates her to do so.<br /><br />If you want to show off your new HDTV, you will likely be gratified by the spectacle armies of CGI technicians have served up here.  But if you like a movie with warmth, humor, and pathos, you will not want to peer into this particular looking glass.</p></body></html>

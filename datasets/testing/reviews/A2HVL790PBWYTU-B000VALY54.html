<meta name="summary" content="You'll root for Robert Downey, Jr.  - Two thumbs up, one sliced finger"></head><body><p>On the run from the law, hapless petty thief Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) crashes into a film audition and ends up with the part. He is flown to Los Angeles, where he is taken under the wing of tough private eye and moonlighting movie consultant Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), called that because he's gay. At a party, Lockhart bumps into Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), a Hollywood starlet and also Harry's unrequited childhood love from back home. Very quickly, the three become embroiled in a complex, bullet-ridden case involving a murdered socialite and, possibly, Harmony's little sister.<br /><br />Shane Black (famed for his screenplays on the Lethal Weapon series) makes his directing debut and comes up with an unmitigated winner. In this lively, darkly funny feature, Black successfully integrates slick production values with a witty, tangled, self-referential script and smoking performances from his actors. At the same time, Black turns topsy-turvy several conventions in the action buddy genre to which he himself has amply contributed.<br /><br />The actors are very good here; one could sense the fun they were having. The three leads have combustible chemistry. Val Kilmer endows Gay Perry with a perfect balance of  machismo, intelligence and world-weary air. And wicked,  deadpan sarcasm. I haven't seen Michelle Monaghan before but she is a revelation as Harmony Faith Lane. Harmony is decidedly smart, is delightfully down to earth, and has had life experience. Yet, she retains a modicum of adolescent innocence. It's pretty obvious why Harry's jonesing for her. Hopefully, we see more of the sexy Michele in future films. But it is Robert Downey, Jr. who shines the most. His charisma is still intact, his wry, droll acting skills still very much present for us to savor. He's still very, very likable. I had fun listening to his dry, teasing narrative voice-over, which he delivers in a laid-back, natural fashion. I think Downey, Jr. is an actor I'll always root for. Two words: sequel, please.<br /><br />The Special Features section could have had more goodies. But what it does have is pretty sweet: A funny film commentary by Shane Black, Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer; an outtake reel; and a theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

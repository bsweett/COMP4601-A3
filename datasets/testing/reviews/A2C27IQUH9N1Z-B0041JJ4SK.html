<meta name="summary" content="fun, meandering, tale of two stoners"></head><body><p>Harold and Kumar, two stoners on a munchie run, meander and have a series of minor adventures as they search for a White Castle.  No great insights and no great insults.  I did laugh out loud a few times and enjoyed the film, so I would recommend this to others.<br /><br />Extras include two commentary tracks as well as an "extreme commentary", an interview with the actors, a featurette about sound, cast and crew info, 8 deleted and extended scenes, outtakes, storyboards, a trailer and a music video.  With a deft, if not subtle, touch, the tone and snarkiness of the film is maintained throughout the extras -- th extra effort is appreciated.<br /><br />English and Spanish subtitles.</p></body></html>

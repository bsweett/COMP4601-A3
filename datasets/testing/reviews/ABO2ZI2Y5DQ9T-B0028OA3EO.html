<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Awesome Special Effects, Weak Story, and We Have Waited So Long...For This?"></head><body><p>We have waited after that embarrassingly low-budget `Superman IV' and we have waited so long. We have seen TV series, yes, but what about the feature film? Now Superman finally comes back to the big screen, and maybe, just maybe, we should admit `Superman Returns' is not what we expected. Some have already panned it, even calling it `Superman Repeats,' and showing their disappointed feelings blatantly.<br /><br />[ORIGINALITY ?] Or we should call it `Superman Recycled.' The only significant difference in the unoriginal story of the newest version is that to his dismay Superman returns to find that Lois Lane is now living with another man and her little boy. But who can blame her? For five years ago Clark Kent suddenly left the Earth without telling anyone about the true reasons?<br /><br />This misguided idea of Superman's AWOL almost kills the first part of the film, in which we are told that Lex Luther returns because Superman failed to give testimony in court. We are also told that Superman travels back all the way to his birthplace only to find nothing. Yes, literally nothing. These are no thrilling news to hear, without which I can live and enjoy the film.<br /><br />The real story gets underway when Clark Kent becomes Superman and saves the life of Lois Lane and other passengers on the airplane. The exciting sequences are what we want to see, and the film gets better after that despite the fact that the dull script is virtually recycling the old materials from the Richard Donner version. It is a shame that Lex Luther couldn't come up with any brilliant plans to terrorize the world, only sticking to his old idea about the price of the land.<br /><br />Perhaps you are not supposed to find great acting here, and actually you don't find it. Brandon Routh is OK as Superman, but he looks slightly wooden and humorless, and so is Kate Bosworth who portrays non-descript Lois Lane. Director Brian Singer gives stress to the romantic side of the story, but more impressive is James Marsden as Lois Lane's fianc&eacute; who comes to realize their complex relations. Kevin Spacey is so-so as Luther, but you may miss Gene Hackman who effortlessly expressed the comic charms of this villainous role. Only Parker Posey and Eva Marie Saint know what they are doing and what they should do, especially the former as Kitty who gives precious comic touch to this film.<br /><br />Much awaited new `Superman' entry turns out slightly above-average superhero action film. In spite of its undeniable merits such as exciting actions, the results do not exactly justify our long waiting, though.</p></body></html>

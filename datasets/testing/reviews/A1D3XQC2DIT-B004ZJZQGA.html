<meta name="summary" content="A movie that gave interesting complexity to a pair of bad men."></head><body><p>Two hitmen check into a hotel in Bruges, Belgium for a two week hideout after they completed a "job." While in Bruges they are instructed to see the sights and soak in the city's charm by day and be by the phone awaiting the boss's next instruction at night. The two men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendon Gleeson), could hardly be more of the odd couple. Ray is the brash young man who feels that Bruges has nothing to offer except beer that he cannot enjoy because they have to stay in the hotel at night. Ken is older, completely appreciates the "fairytale" character of the city and has no desire to act contrarily to the instructions they were given. Besides being partners, what they do have in common is that they are clearly outsiders In Bruges.<br /><br />This movie was sad, funny, maybe too graphic, a little ridiculous at the end, and not nearly the action flick that the synopsis might suggest. I enjoyed how the movie was about two men who kill for money, yet it was not about them killing anyone for money. I thought Farrell and Gleeson worked together very well, and particularly enjoyed Colin Farrell's contribution to the film.<br /><br />I was surprised that Ralph Fiennes, a bigger name than his body of work might warrant recently, took a role that doesn't even come on-screen until nearly the end. I like him and I think he does great work which carried into this film. His part was simply an exaggerated power-hungry crime boss, which may help explain my earlier claim that the movie gets a little ridiculous at the end.<br /><br />As the table turns towards the end of the movie and the characters show themselves to be more complex than they previously let on, the movie matured along their side. I thought there was a great contrast between the beginning and the end of the movie. I liked In Bruges from start to finish, and I find myself looking back on it more fondly even now.<br /><br />I recommend this movie with the following disclaimer: In my experience it is very difficult to separate a movie from it's graphic elements. So please be aware, if not cautious, of those elements in this movie. In other words, I speak highly of this movie, but it is not for everyone.</p></body></html>

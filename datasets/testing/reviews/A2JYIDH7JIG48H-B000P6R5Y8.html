<meta name="summary" content="Best kid's film in decades."></head><body><p>Bridge To Terabithia is one of the best children's fantasy films in decades. It's comparable to The Neverending Story and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7O3I">Explorers</a>, a couple of my favorites from the '80s, and in my opinion it's even better than Chronicles of Narnia, though I don't expect many Narnia fans to agree. This one doesn't have too much fantasy, just a few sequences from the imagination of the two child protagonists. But the story around that is profoundly moving with useful lessons for the whole family, including a practical demonstration of a Teddy Roosevelt quotation: "Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing," - and much more.<br /><br />I've seen over 4,000 movies, includig at least 3 or 4 new ones a month, and this is my favorite in years, certainly the best in the past six months (my favorite last year was The Prestige), and I like it more than Harry Potter, because it's more serious. I see other reviewers making much of the fact that a movie has a sad part. But what's sadder is that so many supposedly adult viewers can so thoroughly miss the point of any movie with a message more complicated than "bang," or think children can and should be shielded from the knowledge of death by censoring it from all fiction.  Think of how many wonderful books or movies would be spoiled -<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007M5II">A Dog of Flanders</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177991">My Girl</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QBA2GA">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008MTY8">The Courtship of Eddie's Father</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z322O">I Remember Mama</a>, Bambi, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416505520">Citizen of the Galaxy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302593360">On Borrowed Time</a> - just to name a few off the top of my head.<br /><br />The cast is terrific too, with the lovely Zooey Deschanel (Elf) as the teacher, and, really getting the point across with exceptional acting, Josh Hutcherson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ES9E">Little Manhattan</a>), Anna Sophia Robb (Because of Winn-Dixie), and Robert Patrick (The X-Files).  The fact that some critics were so affected by the death in the film is a testament to the effectiveness of the movie, especially Hutcherson's acting, as well as that of Robert Patrick and Anna-Sophia Robb (there's no actual death scene in the film, so it's really Hutcherson's reaction that's so affecting).<br /><br />By the way, if you enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ES9E">Little Manhattan</a>, this one has some similarities including the same fine acting by Hutcherson and some brief special effects sequences representing the children's imagination -- though this is more serioius and somewhat sadder.</p></body></html>

He presumably is pressed into using his ability for the government.  Alicia comes into his world and as with many great loves; she sees what others call weird, as a cute uniqueness.  We follow their courtship and then life together.<br /><br />It is the little things and the interaction among friends that make the movie.  This movie captures your attention from the beginning. You may be able to anticipate what is happening however it is not meant to be a dark secret with a twist ending as much as letting you in on what he is going through to survive.  All the characters are fleshed out and you feel that you are there.  This movie leaves a good after taste.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BSGJ">John Nash: A Beautiful Genius</a></p></body></html>

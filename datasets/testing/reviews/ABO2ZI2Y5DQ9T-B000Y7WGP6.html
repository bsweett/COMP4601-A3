<meta name="summary" content="Success as Action, But Still Could Be Better"></head><body><p>I've read a BBC review about "The Kingdom," dubbing it "Syriana Meets Black Hawk Down." In whatever way you may describe this new Peter Berg film, it is obvious that the film tries to blend more than two elements in one story. Among them actions are most successful though the same cannot be said about its political "Syriana" aspect. The film tries to make a point as to American/Saudi Arabian politics in the Middle East, but I still am not sure what that really could be.<br /><br />After a brief montage section introducing us to the US-Saudi Arabia history, "The Kingdom" starts with a series of bloody and violent scenes of terrorist attack in the American facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The film convincingly shows the horrible results of the attack, which may be painful for some to see. Then after some negotiation (or threat) with Saudi Arabia, one elite FBI team is allowed to fly to Saudi Arabia to investigate the case that killed its agents.<br /><br />The team consists of Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. It is an unlikely scenario especially when you see Jennifer Garner's agent casually wears a pretty tight shirt there and the investigation part is not particularly interesting, but the interactions between American agents and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi of Saudi Arabian Police Force (effectively by Ashraf Barhom) almost make up for the lack of events and movement in the middle part of the story.<br /><br />The film includes an extended battle scene in the street and building, which looks like that of "Black Hawk Down." Director Peter Berg uses a shaky camera to capture the confusion of the place, and while some may think it is successful in creating tension, you just may not like this method as detracting. Whichever way you may feel, the actions are effective, if slightly repetitious.<br /><br />All in all "The Kingdom" is a successful thriller, but not entirely so with some sections that are simply too good to be true. Those parts, I'm afraid, might also have lessened the weight of its political messages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Helen Mirren's exquisite portrayal of "The Queen""></head><body><p>Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is as finely nuanced a performance as you are likely to see in a motion picture.  "The Queen" who suffers the woeful ignorance regarding protocol of her new prime minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen,) at Buckingham Palace is not the same woman we see with her family is their retreat at Balmoral any more than that is the same woman who jumps into her old jeep and takes off on her own at the family's Scottish estate.  But the point is that they are the same woman and while the differences between those facets might be ones of minute degree, Mirren has captured them exquisitely, which is why she is now the greatest favorite to win the Oscar in the history of handicapping the Academy Awards.<br /><br />Written by Peter Morgan (whose "The Last King of Scotland" is probably going to win the Oscar for Best Actor) and directed by Stephen Frears ("Dangerous Liaisons"), this 2006 nominee for Best Picture is primarily about the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.  For the Queen the death of Diana is a private matter and the fact that Diana was no longer an HRH dictates the crown say nothing even more than a desire not to feed the media frenzy that played a role in her death.  But for Blair (with the help of his speech writer), Diana is the "People's Princess," and he can see the threat to the monarchy by the Queen's silence in the face of this national tragedy even if her majesty cannot.  It is the middle class Blair, the first Labour PM in a generation, who has to persuade Elizabeth that her traditional quiet dignity, which has served her so well for a half century as Queen of England, is woefully inadequate to the moment at hand.<br /><br />The flaws of the film are not questions of movie making but exist because of fidelity to the events of that week.  In the immediate wake of Diana's death the paparazzi who relentlessly pursued her are vilified, but when the tabloid rags that paid for all those photographs of the princess turn the growing wrath of the public away from themselves and onto the royal family nobody calls them on their self-serving interests.  If Elizabeth, Charles and the rest of the family thought it was wrong to take the young princes away from Balmoral and back to the circus in London it is hard to fault them for their logic (if they had been at Buckingham palace they might have fled to Balmoral anyhow).  The whole point about lowering a flag that is only flown when the monarch is in residence, a tradition followed for four hundred years, still bothers me.  The flag was not lowered to half-mast for Queen Victoria or Winston Churchill, so the idea that it should be lowered for anybody still strikes me as being wrong.  Still, "The Queen" makes it clear that if there had been more from the monarch early on, there would have been less required as a public "mea culpa" later.<br /><br />For me the villain of the piece is Blair's wife, Cherie (Helen McCrory), who grins idiotically when performing a "shallow" curtsey in the presence of the Queen and takes glee in what is happening to the monarchy.  It takes most of the film, but eventually it is Blair himself who has to articulate why the woman sitting on the throne deserves respect if not loyalty.  I doubt that most Americans even know of the young Elizabeth Windsor who was an auto mechanic during World War II, when she and her mother and sister stayed in London during the Blitz, while thousands of other young children were being sent out of town (as see in the opening of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe").  Those of us who know of how Fate intervened to put this woman on the throne can only look at Cherie Blair and observe that Elizabeth did more for her country as a teenager than the prime minister's wife has done in her entire life.<br /><br />It is interesting to see how the funeral itself is reduced to almost an epilogue, although there is still a key scene to come afterwards.  Although it seem to be on point the moment where Elizabeth and the royal family stood at the gate of Buckingham palace and bowed their heads is omitted, as are such memorable moments as Elton John singing a new version of "Candle in the Wind" or the card to "Mummy" that Harry put on his mother's coffin.  For this film all that matters is that the Queen sits in Westminster and listens to Diana's brother laud his dead sister, extolling her as true royalty, because even once she gets her wake up call, the Queen has to have her nosed rubbed in it one more time.  Mirren's Elizabeth might be wrong in her reaction to the death of Diana, but once again the fault lies with Fate and not with the heart of a queen who has served her subjects the way she was taught long ago and once upon a time when she had been the princess of her people.<br /><br />Mirren must be looking forward to Oscar night when she will only have to give one acceptance speech rather than two, since at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards she won not only the top actress award for a movie for "The Queen" but also for her performance in "Elizabeth I" on television.  I have no doubt that each performance enhances the other in the minds of voters since the two Elizabeths certainly evince the range of Mirren's acting abilities (and both have her delivering speeches actually given by each monarch, which appeals to me as a rhetorician).  Mirren's acceptance speeches to date have been exemplary in being short and to the point, suggesting that some of the gravitas of her character may well have rubbed off on her.</p></body></html>

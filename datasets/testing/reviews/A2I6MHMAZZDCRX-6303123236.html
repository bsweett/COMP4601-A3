<meta name="summary" content="A true Disney Masterpiece"></head><body><p>The Disney Company has over used the term Masterpiece when referring to its own movies.  But this one truly deserves that title.  While its animation betray its age, the story and characters are still fun, and its place in history also makes it a must.<p>The story is simple and familiar.  Snow White's wicket stepmother wants her killed because Snow White is &quot;the fairest of them all.&quot;  She is saved from this fate, and hides out with seven dwarfs.  But will the queen find her and try to kill her?<p>Walt's genius here was in creating the characters.  The dwarfs have very distinctive personalities, and some of the best scenes in the movie revolve around them.  (The scene where they first come home is a classic.)  The animals add some humor as well, especially when cleaning the cottage.<p>The plot moves along well, and when I first saw it in college, I was drawn into the story even though I knew the ending.  I actually felt tears when the dwarfs were morning Snow White.<p>By today's standards, the animation is flawed, especially for the prince.  However, there are some truly beautiful scenes as well, particularly the sun set when the dwarfs are coming home.  Fans of Disney in the 30's will recognize the feel of some of the silly symphony cartoons.  The important thing to remember when watching this movie is its place in history.  This is the first animated movie ever, produced when everyone thought no one would ever see it.  The fact that we're still watching it is a testimony to Walt as a filmmaker and pioneer.<p>This is truly a classic movie.  If you've never seen it, watch it today.</p></body></html>

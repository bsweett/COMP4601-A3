Sure, the ending is a letdown and there's not much depth to the movie overall, but it is simply a fun ride along the way.  The Blu-Ray version looks great.  I'm not big into special features, to be honest, so it doesn't bother me that the disc is rather short on special features.  I do wish that this had both versions - the Director's Cut (which I've never seen) and the original theatrical version, but they've only included the original.  That's the only real letdown for me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Crazy, but that's how it goes. (3.5 stars)"></head><body><p>If the 2010 remake of George A. Romero's "The Crazies" seems familiar, well, don't be surprised. The film concerns a small town that goes cuckoo for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5E6E">Cocoa Puffs</a> after their water supply is tainted. The seemingly docile and irregular townsfolk suddently have a thirst for blood and nothing can convince them otherwise, save for a blow from a shotgun. Things go from bad to worse when the military steps in, while a band of survivors and their troubled sheriff (Timothy Olyphany) try their very hardest to get out of dodge.<br /><br />"The Crazies" smells of much of the post-apocalyptic fare we've been treated to over the past decade or so and unfortunately does very little to steer itself away from the genre's cliches. To say you'll see every jump scare and grisly death coming is an understatement; unless you're new to the genre, nothing in this film will take you by surprise. Having said that, though, the film does a good job of keeping a feverish pace from the get-go. Director Breck Eisner doesn't waste any time and the result is a film that is lean, mean and efficient in its purpose. The cast also helps amp up the energy as well, with the ever-reliable Timothy Olyphant stepping up to the plate with a performance that overcomes many of the script's flaws (flaws which concern crucial character development). Not only is the experience of following the sheriff and his crew on their mission a thrill, it's also driven home with a realistic human element which, in the end, saves the film from itself<br /><br />All in all, while "The Crazies" doesn't bring anything new to the genre, it at least serves as an efficient roller-coaster ride of a horror-flick. The direction and the cinematography is top-notch with performances from Olyphant and company making the trip worthwhile. True, horror fans will find its script a bit stale and bland while fans of the Romero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJDA">original</a> will be left wondering why more wasn't done with this update. As it stands, "The Crazies" isn't the best remake to come along in recent memory, but it's certainly not the worst.</p></body></html>

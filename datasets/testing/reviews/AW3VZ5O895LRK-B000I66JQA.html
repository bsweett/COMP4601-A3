<meta name="summary" content="The Hours: Lives of Quiet Desperation"></head><body><p>This is an excellent film made by Stephen Daldry.  Superb writing distinguishes it from novelist Michael Cunningham and its adaptation into film by experienced screenwriter David Hare.  In lesser hands, this delicate, poetic work probably would have been crushed.  That they utilized an ultra talented ensemble cast sealed this into solid A territory. It is about the quiet desperation that is the way we lead our lives in the hours allocated to our existence.  The only thing that ends the Hours is Death and, for some, like Virginia Woolf, the Hours become so untenable that death must be hastened along with suicide. The women who follow Woolf in the future face the same battles with The hours even though we/they have the benefits of more modern existence.  Some universals never change though and The Hours are etched in stone as a universal.  Every actor is first rate but the two to be singled out for breathtaking performances are Nicole Kidman as Woolf and Ed Harris as a dying poet.  I was able to more fully realize how talented Kidman is by not being blinded by her movie star looks.  She drastically changes her appearance so as to become Woolf and she also is the most extraordinary on showing what it is like to live The Hours.  Her scenes with a dying bird and at the train station with her husband are incredible.  Harris is just getting better and better from role to role.  Seemingly there is no role beyond him and he doesn't care how likable or unlikable his character is.  Whatever he needs to do to get the job done, he'll do it.  In this case, he is desperation and dying personified as a poet dying in New York City of AIDS under the bleakest of circumstances, who turns out being linked to all three of our desperate women in one way or another.</p></body></html>

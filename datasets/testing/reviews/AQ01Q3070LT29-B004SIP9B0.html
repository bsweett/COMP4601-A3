The Labour Party wins the victory with 418 seats making Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) the new and youngest ever, Prime Minister.<br /> The story forwards to the tragic night of August 30, 1997 in Paris when Princess Diana was in a fatal car accident.<br />  From then on, it becomes a matter of The Queen carrying out her duties in the upmost proper way, the only way she knows how, verses, Prime Minister Tony Blair's suggestions according to what he has read in the tabloids and he feels what the British people want.

It is as if you are watching the Queen. Now that is good acting. Helen Mirren was totally absored in the role. Just the slightest facial expression or movement of her elbow adds to the performance.<br /><br />  Helen Mirren won the Academy Award for Best Actress.<br /><br />I have no way of knowing how accurate this dramatization is, but I am sure alot of research went into the making of this film.<br /><br />Special Features: The making of...

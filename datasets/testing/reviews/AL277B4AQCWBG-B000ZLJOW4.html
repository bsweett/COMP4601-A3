<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant"></head><body><p>One of the few teen films to adequately capture the paralyzing emptiness of the post-high school blues (and most of Western pop culture). Thora Birch is particularly convincing as the too-cool-for-school teen coming to terms with her future and her friends.  But it's the minor players like Illeana Douglas as Roberta the art teacher and Dave Sheridan as Doug the crazy Sidewinder customer, who'll you'll remember forever. Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff's script is pitched at precisely the right level. It's brutally real without losing its sense of humour, and ultimately hopeful without slipping into sappiness: that's a fine line to walk, but they do it to perfection. Quite an achievement.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very entertaining action film"></head><body><p>Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon)is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea with two bullets in his back and a strange device with a Zurich address on it.. He also has no memory of who he is. After spending some time on the boat to recooperate, Bourne heads for Zurich to find out who he really is. Almost immediately he is forced to defend himself, and he soon discovers that he possesses the skills of a very dangerous man. With nowhere to go, he turns to the aid of poor German traveler named Marie (Franka Potente) to drive him to Paris. Racing to unlock the secrets of his own identity, he discovers that he is an elite government agent. His CIA superior (Chris Cooper), sees Bourne as a rogue agent, and dispatches assassins to kill Bourne. Now the government's top agent, has become its number one target... <p>I had extremely low expectations going into &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. Matt Damon has never done anything action related, and there have been many spy thrillers made over the years. I was pleasantly surprised. The action sequences are amazing, the fights are choreographed extremely well, there are tons of twists and turns to keep you guessing, the suspense is nail-biting at times, and the romance between Matt Damon and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente is great. Not to mention the fact that Damon is quite convincing and pulls the role off like he is a veteran action star. This film literally has everything that it takes to make a great movie. As far as the spy criteria goes, I was very pleased as well. The character Jason Bourne does not have any gadgets or gizmos to help him out. He must rely on his hands and his brain to get him out of jam after jam. This results in and excellent cat-and-mouse chase for the whole film. As you can see, the film does have a lot to offer. However, the reason that I cannot give it a five star rating, is due to the fact that it can be slow moving at times, which affects the overall pace of the film. Instead of flowing smoothly, it felt a bit choppy at times. But for the most part, the film is extremely enjoyable.<p>This is the best spy thriller that I have seen since &quot;Ronin&quot;. &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; works so well, because it has something for everyone whether it be romance, suspense, action, or spy related. The DVD offers an alternate ending, deleted scenes, a making of featurette, and more.</p></body></html>

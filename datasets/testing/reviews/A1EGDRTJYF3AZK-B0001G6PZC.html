<meta name="summary" content="GREAT EPIC MOVIE"></head><body><p>I rank this movie right up there with Braveheart and Gladiator as far as epics go. At first I thought this was going to be one of those "face time" movies just to get a paycheck for Tom Cruise, but to my suprise it was a great movie. While watching this movie I actually learned something, which I wasn't expecting, and that was that the samurai were alot like the native americans in the ways that they were removed from their own land.This is one of the best movies to come out in the last couple of years and a breath of fresh air compared to those movies like Master and Commander that claimed to be action movies but were really just "face time" for their leading man.</p></body></html>

With new dimensions in firey visuals, the movie gives us a lot to look at.  With semi-decent performances, the story skids over the "sell your soul to the devil" paradigm with a lot of pondering and repetition.  Sometimes it's entertaining; at other times profound, but too often the movie pauses and loses its cohesive tension.  Not that 'Ghost Rider' is meant to be great drama.  It is a comic book, yet mostly it comes off as stylish if not insipid in its development.<br /><br />Motorcycle stunt rider, Johnny Blaze, is approached by Mephisto (Peter Fonda) one night while commiserating over his co-star father's terminal cancer.  Offering a deal he can't refuse, Johnny doesn't so much consent as he does bleed over a written contract that is binding as hell on earth.  Loving the crowd's admiration as a sort of Evel Kneivel of the ault years, Mephisto covets Johnny to be the devil's own bounty hunter for hell's escaped souls and a weapon against his own son's treasonous attempts to overthrow his reign.  While Johnny's nocturnal escapades make him seem like he's just going for the ride, his willful track is to bond with his girlfriend, Roxanne (Eva Mendes).  Meanwhile, narrator/cowboy, Carter Slade (Sam Elliott) may have the key he's looking for to find an escape clause.<br /><br />'Ghost Rider' is enough of a spectacle to please an audience, but the story takes grand elements and makes a mediocre blend. It can be funny (To unwind Johnny guzzles down pots of coffee while listening to The Carpenters.)  Besides impressive combat scenes, it never really comes together.</p></body></html>

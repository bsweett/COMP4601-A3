<meta name="summary" content="Life is but a dream"></head><body><p>Mispublicized as an especially steamy thriller by its studio, and sensationalized by the presence of its then married stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Stanley Kubrick's last film enjoyed the same controversy that had dogged all his releases since the early 1960s. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's fin-de-siecle "Traumnovelle," EYES WIDE SHUT is a languid and dreamlike puzzle picture about a married wealthy doctor who, wounded by his wife's thoughts of infidelity, explores sexually straying from her and finds himself caught up in a nightmare of conspiracy and surveillance. Whether or not Cruise's Dr. Bill Harford is awake or dreaming through most of the film is somewhat up for interpretation: he lives in an unreal Manhattan created almost entirely on the soundstages of London's Pinewood Studios (Kubrick was too afraid of flying to shoot on location), and in the conspiracy he uncovers, most of the upsetting women he encounters are tall redhaired amazons who all seem doubles of his own wife. As with all of Kubrick's films, EYES WIDE SHUT is primarily about the de-humanizing cruelty of the world to the film's protagonists. The murderous wealthy and powerful cabal Bill uncovers (which practices masked hierogamous sex rituals in a Long Island mansion) really is simply a dream figuration for the mortality that dogs him, despite his handsomeness, wealth, and position; Bill's final talk with his wife Alice in a toy store during Christmas shopping suggests that sex is all that's left to them to keep the Grim Reaper at bay.<br /><br />The film is much more complex than my little summary can suggest, and since its densely allusive (as all Kubrick films are) it has acquired a substantial cult reputation. It's not one of his best films, but it's still quite good. Its weakest sequences are at the beginning, with a silver-haired Hungarian count who makes silly passes at Kidman's Alice at a holiday ball, and the much-talked about orgy that disappointed so many looking for something sexy (and instead purposefully shows ritualized sex acts drained of any eros whatsoever). Kidman surprised critics and audiences with her performance in this film, and she is genuinely quite exciting in all her scenes except for the misjudged drunk sequence at the ball, and Sydney Pollack as the rich Ziegler may be even better than she is, particularly in the scene close to the end of the film in his billiards room. As he did so often in the late 90s and the very early years of the 21st century, Tom Cruise seems cast in order for the smug fratboy type he played in the 80s to be shown to be broken and emasculated; he moves well and sometimes has genuinely fine instincts, but is not quite up to convincingly conveying anguish. Though its stiltedness is intentional, the dialogue by Fredric Raphael is the weakest part of the film.</p></body></html>

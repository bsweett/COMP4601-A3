<meta name="summary" content="The Pink Panther is a decent film."></head><body><p>This film is alright but nothing to rave about. Steve Martin plays the role of Clouseau very well. I loved his very convincing yet funny French accent. Kevin Kline was decent in the film but it's still hard to picture Kline in a comedy when he usually always does dramatic roles. Jean Reno who teams up with Martin for most of the film really makes the film enjoyable. Martin and Reno were a great comedic team. I can't even really complain about Beyonce on this even though I feel she should seriously stick to her singing career. They limited her role and it worked. She was a decent addition to the cast and remained much more as a small supporting role which I think worked out better for the overall film. I guess she can also add  this role to her resume for being featured in another detective/spy franchise (the other being Mike Myers' Austin Powers as Foxy Cleopatra).<br /><br />There is a funny moment in the casino segment of this film, which revolves around a cameo by Clive Owen even though the scene has nothing to do with the story of the film. And of course Steve Martin's memorable comedic scenes including the "Hamburger scene" and the "Did you just say" scenes.<br /><br />The problem many parents will have with this film is the number of adult jokes that seem to be in the film. I kept thinking to myself "What was this rated again?  Then I double check the disc cover and read PG and said to myself "well it sure had a lot of adult undertones" I haven't seen the original but I believe the original cut had a lot more of them then. I would have to say though the sexual undertones here are similar to movies like "Shrek" and things of that nature. While the parents see the joke one way, the little kids see it another way. If the original film had the over the top sexual content then I appreciate the director, Shawn Levy, for editing it out.<br /><br />Steve Martin made this movie. I don't think no one else could have played the roll like he did. Maybe Jim Carey, but he also is a bit of an over actor. Steve made it happen. The storyline is predictable and it's nothing to shout about. But to chase away long workday blues, then you can give "The Pink Panther" a watch, but if you are tempted to get your hands on the original series and see Clouseau work his magic (like I am) in his adventures by all means go right ahead.</p></body></html>

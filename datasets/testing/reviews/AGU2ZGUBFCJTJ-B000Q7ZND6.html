You might have somewhat of a clue as to what Keanu Reeves might be feeling with his new action-thriller Constantine right now. Though he rose to superstardom with the lead role in the cult-classic film The Matrix in 1999, his other films since then have not been such sensational blockbusters, let alone cult classics. And even the two sequels to the famous science-fiction thriller were deemed disappointments, the last entry in the franchise not even garnering close to the box office receipts of the original years earlier, and that was before inflation. Should this chalk up another disappointment for `Neo', this could spell the end to his career, at least as far as action-thrillers go.<br /><br />The story centers on a man exorcising half-bred demons from the world in order to garner redemption from God to gain entry into Heaven. As a young man, John Constantine came to see things that no living human should ever be forced to see, half-bred demons and angels disguised as average earthly citizens influencing the actions and decisions of various human beings as part of a vast bet enraging between God and the Devil for the souls of all mankind. Sadly his parents only made the terrifying situation even worse for him when they had him admitted to a mental institution where he was given shock therapy and other sorts of cruel `treatments' in order to cure him of his disease. Ultimately John, not wanting to live with his `curse' any longer, commits suicide but is brought back to life against his will. In spite of the fact that he now has a new lease on life, John knows full well that no matter how he goes out he is going to end up in Hell for throwing away God's greatest gift to humanity, life itself, unless he finds some way to redeem himself and regain entry into Heaven. He decides to use his `gift' from God to engage half-bred demons and send them back to Hell where they belong, but because he does this only in his own self-interest, God has yet to grant him his `retirement' and he is quickly running out of time. Thanks to his avid chain-smoking habits since he was fifteen years old, his lungs are riddled with cancer and every day he coughs up blood, a reminder then his time is running out fast. Along comes Angela Dodson, a police detective investigating the supposed suicide of her twin sister, Isabel, at a mental institution where she had been committed, but she suspects that there might be something else behind her mysterious death. Seeking help from the loner Constantine, Angela becomes embroiled in a conflict as ancient as time itself, a war waged between Good and Evil for ultimate control of the fate of mankind.<br /><br />The story for Constantine is meant merely as a piece of pure entertainment, in the footsteps of The Da Vinci Code, and should not be taken for theological gospel by any sense of the word. But the film does have its fair share of sensitive, contemplative issues such as suicide, salvation, damnation, Heaven, Hell, God, Satan, Good and Evil which are all addressed quite profoundly in the script, though not at the level of which influence toward a particular side is projected onto its audience.  Constantine confidently acts as a film in which the ideas are placed in the back of your mind but are given enough space in which you are allowed to still make your own decisions on the issue. Though in the end this should be nothing more then a piece of worthy escapism with no serious religious substance to its storyline other then the basic principle assumptions of characters and items mentioned in its run, the feature's more significant moments are worth contemplating, be it on a much higher level of thinking.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as John Constantine, one of the most unlikable comic-book superheroes you are ever going to come across, either on paper or on the silver screen. Constantine is coarse, cynical, sulky, standoffish, a chain-smoker, and reckless but, then again, how would you be if you knew that you were dying and ultimately going to end up to the place you had sent hundred of half-bred demons back down to, Hell. This is a picture of a man who has luck working against him in every conceivable way possible. He has always been alone in the world, not purely out of necessity but possibly for the fact that in the end he knows that this is going to be the path he alone must walk, but still being human he desires companionship. Rachel Weisz in a way pulls double-duty in the role of Angela Dodson, the police detective investigating the death of her twin sister, not surprisingly also played by Weisz, who she claims was not suicidal, though to be quite honest there is not much to the role of the dead twin who, conventionally, acts as a dead person should - limp and lifeless. Weisz works well in the role of a woman who is seriously conflicted, with both guilt and distress, over the death of her sister and the prospects of allowing to have had her committed to a mental institution for claiming to have witnessed images of half-bred angels and demons which she could also see but lied about in order to escape the same fate of incarceration. She desperately desires to make it up to her estranged twin sister but how does one save their sibling from an eternity of damnation in the fiery pits of Hell? Shia LaBeouf, who is coming along quite nicely as an effective performer in Hollywood, brings some much needed lighthearted moments to the rather bleak presentation in the role of Chas Chandler, Constantine's demon-slayer in training. Yes, Chandler's exit near the finale does seem to short change the audience who had built up so much hope and aspiration for this Constantine-in-training but, as is abundantly clear in the real world, life is not always as fair as we think it should be with terrible events befalling the righteous all too suddenly. It acts as a reminder of the cruel justice of life.<br /><br />It was actually quite clever, at least in terms of theological thinking, the way in which Tilda Swinton's take on the role of the Archangel Gabriel was presented, both in her presentation onscreen and in the way the character's actions are integrated into various parts of the script. The filmmakers, clearly not wanting to take sides on the debate of whether God or Heaven in general is a patriarchal or matriarchal in nature, give Gabriel a feminine-like quality, which is not all that uncommon with romanticized angels, while at the same time dressing him/her up in masculine business suits. It was also quite profound in the way Gabriel is dealt with near the end of the film. Though he/she has nothing but good intentions for releasing the son of Satan in order to bring about eternal salvation for mankind, one can never forget that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Peter Stormare, best known for his appearance in such Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer productions as Bad Boys II and Armageddon, enacts Satan just as you might picture him if he were based in the realm of the real world, which is that of the ultimate incarnation of evil but with a twisted comical sense of humor. The scene in which John Constantine calls upon Satan to prevent the end of the world is an intriguing piece of dialogue, probably having more to do with the way Stormare presents the character then anything else. Constantine, with every last ounce of strength he has in him, plays the fallen angel to the best of his weakness, his jealousy of the Lord and Heaven, to prevent Gabriel from unleashing his son, delivering mankind into eternal salvation and thereby losing the bet.<br /><br />Overall, Constantine will sadly leave those in search of arcane theological dissipation within the same context as The Passion of the Christ only relatively despondent but in part to its sophisticated blurring of the lines between theistic principles and Da Vinci Code embellishment to entertain even the least spiritual amongst us. In the long there are honestly only a scant few glitches located within the action-thriller that ultimately prevent it from achieving a higher status then it conveys to its audience but noticeable enough to be noted here. First off, how in God's name (no pun intended) did the `Spear of Destiny' wind up in Mexico City draped in a Nazi flag? In these kinds of situations it is perhaps better not to ask such detailed inquiries; it only ruins the effect, as The Da Vinci Code can attest to. Secondly, there were particular sequences and/or effects that failed to register any sense of logic or consistency to their inclusion and therefore would have been better off left on the cutting room floor. Take for example the scene in which Constantine upon leaving the gas station is attacked by a man, or whatever he was, made up entirely of insects and vermin. What was the exact point of this scene? And lastly, the lack of consonance within the rules of `the balance' as well as the theological elements on which the film's script bases itself upon, though not entirely damaging, does the hinder the audience's deep-seeded spiritual involvement in the premise as some would have wanted. On the other hand though, the special effects are positively sensational, especially concerning the filmmakers' interpretation of both Hell and Heaven as dark and light versions of our lives on Earth. Seriously, do not go into this film believing that you are about to receive the holy word of God himself or be shown down the path of true righteousness because that is not Constantine's purpose. It is meant as a little piece of escapism, of which it performs remarkably well as. There are some real issues dealt within this film's script but if you are truly searching for answers, or at least your investigative opinion on these thoughts, please visit church officials, such as the ones at your local parish, and discuss them in detail there without relying too heavily on this film for anything more then entertainment.</p></body></html>

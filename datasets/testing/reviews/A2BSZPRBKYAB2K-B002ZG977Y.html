<meta name="summary" content="Not a bad movie.  Good special effects, so-so story line"></head><body><p>If I could give this 3 1/2 stars I would. But there is no 1/2 stars for rating so I gave it a three.  I feel that is a fair judgement.  I really enjoyed the special effects of when the scorpions attack, when Perseus and the other soldiers go into Medussa's temple, and the ride across the river Styx and Charon the ferryman, well I like this version of him.  Now for the story...Great potential that falls short.  The lead actors and actresses do a great job with the script that was given.  From Liam Neeson(Zeus) to Sam Worthington (Perseus) whois helpless to save his family from Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld to Gemma Arterton (IO) the woman who watches, not a complaint on the acting.  The script however runs the basic same old story.  I don't like the special effects of the Krakon.  The movie thought that the more the monster the better.  Not in this case.  This isn't a bad movie to watch on a cloudy and rainy day.</p></body></html>

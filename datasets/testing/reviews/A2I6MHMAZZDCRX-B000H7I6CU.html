All he has to do is win the run off race against veteran The King (Richard Petty) and perpetual runner up Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  If he can do that, he might be able to get a new sponsor.  After all, being the spokescar for Rust-Eze is a little embarrassing for a sleek racecar like Lightning.<br /><br />On the way to the big race in Los Angeles, Lightning accidentally gets separated from his transport truck and finds himself in Radiator Springs, where he accidentally destroys the road.  Much to his dismay, he's sentenced to repave the road before he can continue on the way.<br /><br />Radiator Springs is the town that time forgot.  A former way station on the famous Route 66, it is barely surviving now that the big interstate has been build nearby, making stopping there no longer necessary.  Of course, this is exactly the type of town Lightning wants to avoid.  He's living life in the fast lane and just wants to get on his way.<br /><br />But to complete his community service, he has to deal with the locals.  Mater the Tow Truck (Larry the Cable Guy) quickly labels Lightning his best friend and wants to help him have a good time.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is cute and distracts the rather single focused Lightning.  In fact, everyone in town seems to enjoy having Lightning around.  Everyone but Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).  What kind of secret might he have?  And will Lightning take what he is learning to heart?<br /><br />This movie might bore kids.  More so then other Pixar films, the main conflict is internal, focused on what Lightening is learning from his experiences in Radiator Springs.  There is a villain, but he gets little screen time.  And this is the first movie to not have on of Pixar's patented climaxes that will not quit.<br /><br />All this isn't to say that the movie is bad.  I saw it twice in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.  The story is ultimately heartwarming, the characters endearing, and the movie is funny.  The tractor-tipping scene alone is guaranteed to make you laugh.  Plus there is lots of fun during and after the final credits.<br /><br />And then there's Pixar's attention to detail.  Watching the car's backup lights turn on and off or the bugs being VW Beetles, for example, add to the charm.  The animation in the movie is flawless, and many of the scenery shots are absolutely breathtaking.  If I didn't know better, I would say they were real.  This is a movie to watch on the big screen for those shots alone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this is the first Pixar film not to get a two disc special edition.  Frankly, I find that disappointing.  Still, the movie looks and sounds wonderful.  There's a new short with Mater, deleted scenes, and the "One Man Band" short that showed in theaters before this movie.<br /><br />While kids might not find it as engaging as Pixar's other films, they will enjoy it.  The lack of extras is disappointing, but the film more then makes up for it.  This is another triumph for Pixar.</p></body></html>

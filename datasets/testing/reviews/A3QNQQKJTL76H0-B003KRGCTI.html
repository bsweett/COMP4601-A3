<meta name="summary" content="Spoiler-free review: An entertaining, but flawed post-apocalyptic adventure"></head><body><p>As a fan of the post-apocalyptic film genre, I enjoyed The Book of Eli for its look, but felt that the story suffered as it went on. With bits of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780624890">Blade</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FBS20">I Am Legend</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA1WGS">The Road Warrior / Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB563E">The Road</a>, and a drop of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YV502C">Children of Men</a> mixed in, Book of Eli is a slickly-produced film, with the requisite bleached out colors and monochromatic/desaturated look of the genre. Like The Road, an unexplained nuclear holocaust has wiped out civilization, mentioned only in passing. Once again, our hero must get from point A to point B, traveling a road fraught with difficulties and dangers. And he must do it on foot.<br /><br />Denzel is Eli, a loner and tough-as-nails survivalist tasked with delivering the last remaining x to a safe location. In Children of Men, it was the world's last pregnant woman. In Book of Eli, it's the last remaining copy of the King James Bible. He has been walking for thirty years. The film opens with a very cool sequence of Eli in the forest stalking a feral cat with a bow and arrow, instantly establishing his resourcefulness, marksmanship, and super-badness for the audience. Visually, it just looks fabulous the way the scene is designed and filmed in monochromatic cyan with detritus raining down. Eli speaks softly and carries a big knife. In fact, it's a very, very big knife and he makes expert use of it against the roving gangs of thieves and cut-throats he encounters, hacking off hands and limbs with style. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFWAYU">Wesley Snipes</a> would be proud.<br /><br />The real trouble for Eli (and this film's story) begins when he stops off for supplies at a ramshackle town run by a ruthless man named Carnegie (Gary Oldman), who had been sending out search parties to scour the wasteland for the book. While Eli is a man of faith and cherishes the book as the key to humanity's salvation, Carnegie covets it for a very different reason: to control the masses and expand his influence to other towns. He tries to make a deal and Eli refuses. At this point, Eli is no longer a loner dependent on his wits and reflexes for survival. He picks up extra baggage in the form of an attractive, but altogether annoying and poorly-developed side-kick character (Mila Kunis) who he now has to protect. This is where the script gets sloppy. Instead of being a story of the cool, quiet, and self-reliant stranger who only has himself to look after, it now becomes the story of "save the helpless girl from the bad-guys" and running away from the gangsters.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing details of Eli's survival techniques the most and how he copes with the dangers of the wasteland, but not enough of his back-story is given. That itself isn't the problem, because I'm plenty willing to enjoy a character's unexplained and mystery past and live in the here and now of his present situation, like Clint Eastwood's archetypal loner, the "Man with No Name" from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792842502">The Man with No Name Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly)</a>. The real problem is the irritating tag-along Eli picks up, which for me, ruins the story. Gary Oldman, an actor I respect and admire, underwhelms here. He has played plenty of excellent villains before (Agent Stansfield in Leon, Zorg in Fifth Element), but his portrayal here is lackluster, devoid of quirks, and mostly uninteresting. Also worth mentioning is the wasted potential of Ray Stevenson as Carnegie's lead henchman. He has no memorable lines or scenes and dies in a cheap and inglorious manner.<br /><br />The final segment of the journey is very similar to Children of Men, though I did not mind because what happens after he gets to his destination was a pleasant twist. The very ending quite obviously hints at a sequel possibility with someone taking up Eli's mantle.<br /><br />Unlike some viewers, I did not take this film to be a celebration of religion or a condemnation of it. The Bible is arguable the most important book in western civilization and a natural choice for a film's central plot device. The Book of Eli is not perfect, but it's worth a look if you liked any of the films I mentioned above.</p></body></html>

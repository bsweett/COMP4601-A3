<meta name="summary" content="A fine musical with millions and millions of fans"></head><body><p>"The Sound of Music" was a monster hit when it came out in 1965.  It was a wildly loved by millions.  Children then and children now take to it and love watching it again and again.  The songs are wonderful, instantly memorable, and people love to sing them.  Even today, if you were to start singing almost any of these tunes many people could easily join in.  At the time of its release it became the biggest box office winner of all time and even passed "Gone With the Wind".<br /><br />The story is adapted from the stage show which came from an autobiographical book of the real life story of Maria von Trapp.  The Trapp family that is very much intact, large, and a keeper of the memory.  However, if you hear the comments about this film from self-anointed sophisticates, they drip with condescension and even contempt.  You would think the film to be unimportant commercial drivel.  Certainly, commercial success is no credential of artistic achievement, but neither is it a disqualifier.<br /><br />So, what is it about this delightful and beautifully done musical that upsets so many people (even as it brings joy to many many more)?  My own view is that there was a change in what a portion of the culture wanted in their art.  They wanted things more ironic, detached, and darker.  This movie is none of that.  While there were still musicals made after the huge success of "The Sound of Music", it was definitely a turning point that led to a decline to the present all but extinction of the form (unless you can relate "Moulin Rouge" to this film).<br /><br />However, this film continues to bring happiness to its millions of fans and this is a good DVD of it (although I wish the print could be digitally remastered and the color more even).  The commentary by Richard Wise, the director, is very interesting and informative.  He tells us about the actors, the shooting of the film, the way the actors got along, and he even presents the songs in the film as just orchestra.  It is very interesting to hear what is actually going on underneath the voices.<br /><br />There is a lot more subtlety in the film than I ever saw as a kid.  Sure, there is that abolished emotion we used to call tenderness, but it does not deserve the accusation of treacle or saccharine that are used to simply dismiss it.<br /><br />Well done.  Enjoy it and forget the pain junkies who need to be flogged by their entertainments.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A HILLARIOUS FILM ABOUT RELIGION"></head><body><p>A CATHOLIC WHO SEEMS TO QUESTIONS HER FAITH [LINDA FIORENTINO] MUST STOP TWO ANGELS [BEN AFFLECK AND MATT DAMON] WHO SEEM HELL BENT ON WREAKING HAVOC ON THE EARTH AND IT'S PEOPLE. VERY FUNNY AND KEVIN SMITH EVEN INJECTS THE HILLARIOUS AND PROFANE JAY AND SILENT BOB CHARACTERS [LIKE HE DOES IN JUST ABOUT EVERY MOVIE WITH HIS NAME ON IT] INTO THIS MOVIE. CHRIS ROCK IS ALSO FUNNY AS THE 13TH APOSTLE. IF YOU WANNA LAUGH AT RELIGION, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.</p></body></html>

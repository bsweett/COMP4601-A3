"You'll get there!""></head><body><p>To put things in perspective, when the original "Rocky" came out, my wife was still three years away from being born.  That's 30 years Stallone has been playing this Rocky Balboa.  I grew up with the first two films on endless TV reruns and saw the later ones in the theater.  My nostalgia-fueled anticipation for tonight's premiere was akin to the thrill I felt for the final "Lord of the Rings" movie, or for "Superman Returns", or even for the misbegotten Chronicles of Narnia movie last year.  Literally I've been waiting decades to see this movie.  "Rocky V" bombed when I was still in high school and I was hoping Rocky would get one last chance to knock out evil boxers with ridiculous ring nicknames.<br /><br />My advice is that you'll need to see this movie in a packed theater, as I did.  I can't imagine it would have the same effect on the small screen when you're alone with a much smaller crowd.  In many ways, the best part of this film was the spontaneous call-and-response from the audience I was with, two storeys beneath 3rd Avenue.  People shouted famous "Rocky" catchphrases at the screen seconds before the famous fanfare started playing.  "I pity the fool!", "I will break you!", "If he dies, he dies!", and, of course, "Mickey!!"<br /><br />Once all the pre-movie nostalgia was out of the way... it was time for more nostalgia.  Wisely or not, Stallone (who wrote and directed) soaked the first half of the script in nostalgia so deep for the first, small-scale "Rocky", that significant screen time was devoted to characters who hadn't appeared since the original's second reel.  I had to explain to my wife who Spider Rico was, and why Rocky needed him in his inner circle by the end of the movie.  Also great to see the return Duke, Apollo Creed's old trainer, although most of Tony Burton's lines appear to have been looped in post-production.<br /><br />The main problem with "Rocky Balboa" early on is Stallone's concept of dialogue.  Just about every character in this movie delivers a loud speech about motivation and glory and drive and passion.  Rocky's defense of his application for a boxing permit to the State athletic commission (after 20 years of retirement) is particularly ludicrous, although Stallone must think it's going to cap off the montage for his Lifetime Achievement Oscar.<br /><br />Once the nostalgia and flashbacks clears out and the plot settles in, the film picks up steam.  Antonio Tarver does a decent job as Mason "The Line" Dixon, the brazen young champ at odds with the boxing establishment.  Dixon never really becomes a villain in this movie -- he even has a Rocky/Mickey relationship with his own trainer.<br /><br />Also welcome are the numerous cable TV personality cameos.  Everyone from ESPN's Brian Kenny to ESPN Classic's Bert Randolph Sugar to the entire HBO fight team (Merchant and Lampley and I, Max) chips in; too bad Jim Rome got left on the cutting room floor.  The only thing missing from the celebrity bandwagon was Randy and Jason Sklar doing "Cheap Seats" commentary over the Rocky vs. Thunderlips celebrity boxing/wrestling match.  Maybe in a deleted scene on DVD?<br /><br />In the end, "Rocky Balboa"'s a fun nostalgia trip that echoes the original in tone and sentiment, and even has a similar bittersweet finale.  This is never going to become a TNT rerun classic like "Rocky III" and probably has no catchphrases of its own, but if Rocky's been one of your movie heroes since the 1970s, check him out one last time.</p></body></html>

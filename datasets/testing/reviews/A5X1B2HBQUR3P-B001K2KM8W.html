This is the story about a girl named Ofelia who we are shown lives in 2 world's: 1) The Anti franco post civil war regime where the spanish Maquis guerrillas are fighting a resistance against the Hitler like ruthless captain Vidal and his army men and 2) her own fairy tale fantasy land in a neverland filled with menacing and magical creatures and healing living plants. The main repeating character world from this fantasy world is an enigmatic faun. What is a faun, you ask ?. I looked up wikipedia "fauns are place-spirits (genii) of untamed woodland.....have horns and both resemble goats below the waist, humans above". Something like a hybrid unicorn I would guess. Incidentally a faun is used in  C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. That faun is possibly a classic faun, the one used by the director in this film is more of a menacing creature which is like cross between the alien and some ostrich. This faun is real creepy, freaked me out.  This is the first movie of it's kind that I have seen where a fantasy movie plays as a parallel thread to a real world movie. The movie is poignant,tragic and enchanting in its score, visual style and essense which is a very tough feat to put off all at once, credit to the director, production designer, and screenplay writer. So in that sense it's not really a fairy tale for kids. Ofelia has to block out the brutal aspects of the violence she is seeing all around her. Further the physical pain endured by her mother during late stages of pregnancy bearing captain Vidal's child (She is not fond of captain Vidal, she senses him as a ruthless and uncaring man, which is what he is when he tell his doctor "if a choice has to made between the mother and the child, save the baby"), adds to her sense of loss and despair which she compensates by creating this fantasy world that she indulges in from time to time. The real world story has a momentum of it's which could have served as one whole film, a story of Mercedes, the lady cook who in the pantry of captain Vidal. Mercedes is secretly helping her husband and the resitance. Her Husband is part of the guerrillas. Comming back to the mystical Faun from this mystical land, gives Ofelia three tasks. Completion of all three tasks is suppossed to reinstate Ofelia has the princess of this fairy land, a throne that has been waiting for centuries waiting for her re-incarnation. And now her time has finally come. This is not like the Harry potter goblet of fire tasks. The task here serve to immerse us into the believability of this world. The creatures are other worldly, kind of out of place for childeren's fairy tale. The monster in the second task has eyes on his hands and he gets activated when she picks the ripe fruits of the monster's dinner table. It is an amazing escapist movie but which has this beautiful poignant movie score, a great directorial vision and an ambience of a different kind of fairy tale interspersed with the horror of the real world. What a joy of a film to watch. I recommend one and all to see this film. This is a spanish movie by the mexican director Guillermo del Toro, the guy who made blade2, hellboy, and hellboy2: The golden army. In the end we get the subtle idea of the whole film of Ofelia. But I won't everything way lest I rob you of the joy of watching this movie.<br /><br />regards, VIkram</p></body></html>

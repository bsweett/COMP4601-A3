Mind you, this is not an accurate biography of the Von Trapp family - the real Maria was nowhere near as lovely or sweet as Julie Andrews, but this movie is a entertaining story nonetheless with some pretty awesome musical numbers.<br /><br />Julie Andrews really shines in her role as young Maria as she goes to become a governess for the Von Trapps. Her sweet asnd steadfast personality allow her to remain cool under the pranks that the Von Trapp children play jokes on her (they even feel bad for it!) and how she eventually gets through to the patriarch of the Von Trapps himself. Set amidst pre World-War Europe (namely Austria), this is a lovely if somewhat fictionalized account of the Von Trapps. The music and dancing numbers themselves make this movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An improvement over Davinci Code"></head><body><p>This was marketed as a sequel even though the book itself is actually a prequel to Davinci Code. No matter, in either instance, that isn't really important; just a side note. Another side note: I despised Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon in The Davinci Code, and my feelings have not changed regarding Angels and Demons. He is terrible for the role. But at least they fixed his hair this time around...<br /><br />As for the film itself, well, it is engaging and fast-paced. It almost never lags and gets to the point quickly without little confusion. It does help if you've read the book but it really isn't necessary. The film keeps viewers guessing and hopefully the twist entertains and surprises, as it does in the book. The visuals are quite lovely to look at and the backstory behind what goes on inside the Vatican when a Pope is being replaced is quite interesting. This movie succeeds as a mystery thriller. It has its flaws of course, but it really is a fun movie experience overall.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor is quite good in this, as usual and you can thankfully ignore Hanks when they are onscreen together.<br /><br />Overall, I was skeptical after The Davinci Code, but was glad I watched this afterwards. It easily surpasses that film in pace, acting, suspense and plot. Skip that one and see Angels and Demons instead. I'd give it a solid 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

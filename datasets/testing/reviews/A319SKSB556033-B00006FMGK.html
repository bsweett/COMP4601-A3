<meta name="summary" content="Curious 'end' to the Next Gen series"></head><body><p>The longest in production, the lowest grossing and most limbo-bound Star Trek movie of all. Nemesis is neither here nor there. It entertains without satisfying and features loads of brilliant SFX, but little awe. Perhaps we are all just too familiar with franchise and it needs to forever be increasingly far-reaching to keep it fresh.<br /><br />However, it IS a lot better than Insurrection. In terms of direction anyway. Jonothan Frake's TV movie approach to the franchise lacked any sort of class or sophistication but Stuart Baird fixes that with a darker and more menacing tone. The script is more sinister than that of Insurrection or First Contact (the Next Gen movie titles still remain uninspired) but what ends up in the film is confused and undefined.<br /><br />The plot has Picard sent out to Romulous to help make peace with the new Preator, a man who calls himself Shinzon and who happens to be an exact clone of Picard. Data finds an android identical to himself buried in the sand of a nearby desert planet. Picard and Data are suspicious of their radical finds and the suspicion soon proves to be justified as treachery and double-crosses are revealed.<br /><br />With an unconfirmed amount of deleted scenes (rumors put it around the 50 minute mark) it's painfully obvious that important plot developments have been cut out of the film. The sense of the Enterprise emptying as all the main characters leave for new career paths is lost. Worf and Crusher are hardly featured for some reason. The relationship between Data and his long-lost brother B-4 seems very thin. The sub-text is muddled and hard to get to grips with. And a sub-plot involving Praetor Shinzon's lust (and subsequent repeated rape) for Deanna Troi is abandoned as soon as it starts. What was the point of starting it in the first place? Is B-4 actually Data's evil brother Lore?<br /><br />And despite the fact that Star Trek has been around for almost 40 years at this point, the STILL do the cheap 'desert outside of LA as some other planet' trick. And the dune buggies seemed to be kind of out of place. Like it was just added in at the last minute to make the film more exciting.<br /><br />Shinzon is not the slightest bit scary and even looks like the 3rd place runner-up in a Right Said Fred lookalike competition. For all the talk of him looking slightly different from Picard due to his life of hardship, he didn't look very hard.<br /><br />Also, Jerry Goldsmith's score just seems like loads of his previous scores with some cues altered slightly. Honestly, I recognised several cues from Executive Decision, Gremlins 2, The 'Burbs and many other movies changed just a little bit to make it sound different. Though I understand Goldsmith was very ill at this point so I can forgive him for that.<br /><br />But it's hard to forgive the rest of the film. Like I said, it's entertaining, but falls apart under even the most superficial of scrutiny. It could have been handled a lot better and I'm surprised and disappointed that Paramount fumbled their flagship series so badly.<br /><br />The DVD features a perfect 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and brilliant Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. There are loads of extras but Paramount fumbles again by not including an extended cut of the film. It's like they just don't care!</p></body></html>

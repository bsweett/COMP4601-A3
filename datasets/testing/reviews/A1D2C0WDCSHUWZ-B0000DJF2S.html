If you're sick of the latest spandex hero fighting the forces of evil, LXG might give you a little refreshment. While deeply flawed in some areas, it's a lot more unique and possibly more entertaining. (Especially if you are a &quot;book&quot; person)<p>It's 1899. A monstrous tank barrels through London and into a bank, where special diagrams are stolen. In Germany, Zeppelins are blown up. The world is on the brink of a widespread war, and a horribly scarred, masked Phantom is the one responsible. So the British government calls on Allen Quatermain (Sean Connery), a reclusive hunter with many amazing adventures behind him, and asks him to help England. He's about to refuse, but a firefight and a bombed-out club change his mind. <p>He arrives in London to join the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), a vampire, an invisible thief, Skinner (Tony Curran), and Captain Nemo, a pirate (Naseeruddin Shah). They try to recruit Dorian Grey (Stuart Townsend), a beautiful and dissolute immortal, but are attacked in his home -- and aided by a young American agent, Tom Sawyer (Shane West). After recruiting Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) and his alter ego Mr. Hyde (also Jason Flemyng), the League is on its way to Venice, to protect an international conference from destruction by the Phantom. But the League soon learns that their situation is much more complex -- and that one of them cannot be trusted.<p>To some degree, this movie is in a &quot;league&quot; of its own. Most comic books center on people given or born with extraordinary powers, but not much else. LXG, instead, focuses on characters who already existed, ranging from the bizarre (Mina the vampire, Dorian Grey) to the obscure (Allen Quatermain -- how many people reading this have read H. Rider Haggard?). As a result, it may be the only truly literary comic book adaptation. It's a motley crew, but somehow they fit. Unfortunately, while the literary references are solid enough, the plot is not really smart -- the good guys are hunting down the bad guy, who is trying to rule the world. It's fun if you switch off your brain and just watch.<p>It can't be denied that the action scenes and fight sequences are amazing. Some of the characters are given more development, like Quatermain, who is still torn up over the loss of his son. For better-known people like Mina Harker (&quot;Dracula&quot;) and Tom Sawyer, not so much introduction is necessary. Not a huge amount of character development, but since these characters are already known to us, they feel good anyway. The identity of the Phantom (another literary character) is a genuine surprise (a good one, too), and the identity of the traitor becomes evident when you think carefully.<p>Among the problems are the special effects -- Hyde's first scene is particularly bad, and some of the transformations are unconvincing. And some of the shots of the Nautilus and the tank (looked like a miniature), not to mention the flaming zeppelins, were very unconvincing. The first shot of the Phantom's fortress is enough to make you groan. That said, the follow-up shots of the fortress are lovely, and the Nautilus is (mostly) enticingly gorgeous and lush. (I want to live on the Nautilus -- that thing is absolutely beautiful)<p>Connery proves that he's still a great presence at 70 plus. (He keeps beating up bad guys, and it never seems improbable) Wilson seems completely befuddled as to how to play Mina; Townsend is deliciously foppish and disdainful; Shah is likably dignified and solid; West is okay, not exceptional but not bad (he's at his best when bonding with Connery); Jason Flemyng is excellent as either incarnation of Jekyll/Hyde, switching between savagery and torment. And Curran steals every scene he's in -- or isn't in. Even though he's only a voice half the time, he's hilarious. (One of the funniest scenes is when Quatermain kicks the invisible Skinner out of his office)<p>Despite the respectable and brainy background of these characters, LXG isn't a smart movie. It's not really dumb either. Consider it a James Bond movie if you took out Bond and populated it with classic characters. Amusing for fans of classic fantasy/scifi/horror, and an entertaining action flick overall.</p></body></html>

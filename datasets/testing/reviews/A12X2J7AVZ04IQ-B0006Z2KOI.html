<meta name="summary" content="A Fine Primer, to understand Che Guevara"></head><body><p>I must admit that, when I started college in 1967, I was a product of media prejdice. The death of Che Guevara that year meant little to me because he was "a bad guy".  A later film, "Che" (1969 with Omar Sharif) was such a bomb, Che has never been given the recognition that is due. "The Motorcycle Diaries" is a well-made film by the brilliant Walter Salles, and stars the excellent Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna as Che and his good friend, Alberto Granado, as they set out to discover the South American countryside, from Argentina, to Chile & Peru, ending in Colombia; the film ends there. This is a buddy movie, with humor, adventure and purpose. Che's discovery of man's inhumanity to man started with this trip, and the rest is history. Breath-taking cinematography by Eric Gautier, and an unobtrusive but effective score by Gustavo Santaolalla add to the enjoyment. The two leads have wonderful chemistry, and it all comes together for an exciting ride, with an award-winning script by Jose Rivera. The DVD extras are insightful, especially noting that Che's daughter, Aleila, and Alberto Granado himself both give their absolute blessing to the proceedings. Whatever your opinion of Che Guevara, I recommend you see this film to gain a great perspective of the man and his ensuing motivations.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So-so monster flick"></head><body><p>The idea of throwing all the 19th Century "monsters" (Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and werewolves) into one flick was done to better affect in the goofball Abbott & Costello movies.  Making Van Helsing a renowned monster hunter backed by the Church and a team of brilliant gadget makers is corny.  If you want to get to know Van Helsing, read Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br /><br />Van Helsing has beautiful women and great special effects.  The action is attention-grabbing at times. But neither are enough to make this a good film.  There are some fun bits but the movie's definitely not worth the purchase price and maybe not even worth the rental price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Matt Damon's firsr foray into action is a winner"></head><body><p>The Bourne Identity is a better film than I thought it would. Matt Damon makes a believeable action hero and Doug Liman does the atcion thing very well. The car chase sequence is one of the best from 2002. If you haven't seen this check it out it's good entertainement.</p></body></html>

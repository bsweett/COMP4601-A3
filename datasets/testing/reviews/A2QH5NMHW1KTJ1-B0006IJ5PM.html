The actors put in that great sense of feeling that the pressure is on by the town and their familys. This isn't much of high school foot ball to the teamt, it's a high stakes job that's worlds more important than even their education. As for the town of Odessa, these boys are there movie stars and are hyped as such. The players sign autographs, take pictures with babies, and girls then turn into groupies. All this comes with the fame, but when a game is lost they all feel the brunt of it from the town as well. Even if your not into football indeed you will enjoy this movie. It gets your really hyperactive to play football. Go see this movie!</p></body></html>

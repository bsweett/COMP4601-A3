<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic film"></head><body><p>Wow! Harrison Ford really shines in this movie, doing an incredible job as a man accused and arrested for murder but who, through a remarkable freak accident, manages to escape captivity and is not idle in his stolen freedom - even as he goes in hiding, he still tries to figure out who really killed his wife. Great action scenes and intrigue - this movie is a solid class and is worth watching more than once.</p></body></html>

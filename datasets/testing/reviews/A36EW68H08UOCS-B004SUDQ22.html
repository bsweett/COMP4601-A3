"If you start to feel depressed being around them, then they probably have depression", we were told.  A different psychiatry professor gave us a lecture on the sometimes grey area that exists between "genius" and mental illness.  For example, he proposed, if modern miracle anti-depressant medications like Prozac were available, would you have treated Van Gogh - preventing him from disfiguring and ultimately killing himself, IF you knew that by treating his "illness" you might also be depriving him (and the world) of his "genius".<br /><br />That is a good question that has no definitive answer.  This film explores that nebulous area `twixt genius and madness.  It also looks at relationships, trust and "love" between father and daughter, between sisters and between lovers.  The reason I began this review discussing how it can make you feel depressed being in the company of depressed people is that watching this movie made me feel a little depressed.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow stars in David Auburn's script, adapted from his play, as Anthony Hopkins' daughter, Catherine.  Hopkins' Robert was a math genius, twice making "life-time achievement" kind of discoveries in the field before age 27, at which time he began to become ill with a mental illness that caused him to deteriorate until his death many years later.  Much of the film is told in flashback.  Catherine took care of Robert for his last half-decade.  Did she do it out of daughterly duty?  Did she do it to be near her father's mathematical genius as she was working out her own mathematical proofs?  Did she do it to avoid moving forward with her own life and academic career?  The film suggests perhaps all three, and leaves the viewer to your own conclusions.  Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Hal, one of Robert's graduate students, smart enough to understand the high world of mathematic academics, but not quite genius enough to make the kind of revolutionary breakthroughs that make you legend.  After Robert passes away Hal asks permission to read through Robert's copious notebooks where he scribbled down page after page of gibberish, hoping that a spark of genius will appear amid the mad scribbling.  Hope Davis appears as Robert's other daughter, Claire.  Although Catherine may have inherited some of Dad's genius, Claire is the one who seems to have her life in more order - for the kind of folks who think lives should be orderly.  Claire flies into town for Robert's funeral as well, hoping to interject some order into Catherine's life.<br /><br />The film does not delve into deeper mathematics.  Rudimentary arithmetic is not required to view "Proof".  The movie looks at the lives of these people and presents the characters "as is".  We see that Hal also plays drum in an alternative rock band made up of math grad students.  One of their pieces is called "I" after the imaginary number that equals negative one when squared - this song consists of the band standing silently on stage after telling the audience the name of the song.  If you're the kind of person who might find such things entertaining - this may be the film for you.<br /><br />The storyline concentrates on Catherine and explores whether or not she may have inherited her father's genius, or his madness, or both.  Although the film is filled with the fine acting you'd expect from a collection of Academy Award winners and nominees, it was not the most pleasant thing for me to watch.</p></body></html>

Seth Rogen is a weird choice for the lead role in any kind of action movie. He is basically just playing a slight variation of all the other lazy losers of his past films. He does get his moments to shine in the realm of comedy, but he is mostly overshadowed by the sidekick role, Kato, played by Jay Chou. He is by far the more interesting character, though he and Rogen do have a few moments of humorous interactions. Cameron Diaz seems to be here to just add a bigger name to the cast and even Christoph Waltz, so good in Inglourious Basterds, doesn't hit the right notes as the villain. It's kind of funny that my favorite scene happens within minutes after the start. I'll just say it involves an extended cameo from James Franco, who I had no idea was even going to be in the movie.<br /><br />I did appreciate the mixture of comedic relief to go along with the action, but I think the violence could have been toned down some. It seemed out of place. I mean, these "heroes" have a higher body count than the bad guys. I guess the Batman way of catching rather than killing the bad guys is just too much work when you can just spray them with bullets or stab wood stakes into their eyes. Yes, that does happen here.<br /><br />I must say that the large crowd I saw it with may have swayed my enjoyment to the more positive side. They laughed at almost everything. As I left the theater, most people seemed to be of the opinion that it wasn't outstanding, but that it was much better than they thought it would be going in. Those were my thoughts as well. Worthy of a future rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Random thoughts on an old favorite"></head><body><p>The original American theatrical trailer for Sergio Leone's classic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Italy/Spain/W Germany-1966) has Eli Wallach as the Bad and Lee Van Cleef the Ugly, while the film reverses these. Practically all three leads are interchangeable, as Clint Eastwood's character, mysteriously nicknamed "Blondie," is certainly a bad guy, plus after his desert ordeal, he's quite ugly (for a while).<br /><br />A bit overlong at 162 minutes, yet there would be little fat to trim here (perhaps the bridge sequence?) if cuts had to be made.<br /><br />Saw this in first run a very long time ago. With the advent of home video in the '80s I've been able to reexperience it umpteen times since. During the most recent viewing, I looked beyond familiar characters, plot and dialogue and studied other details, such as camera panning during Eli Wallach's worried search for a gravemarker while Ennio Morricone's magnificent "Ecstasy of Gold" plays, also Leone's timing of facial closeups and quick edits during the climactic three-way cemetery showdown. That all these guys are grimy, sweaty, unwashed and unshaven is certainly accurate for an age and place where fresh laundry and bathtubs could be few and far between.<br /><br />Although filmed in Spain, backgrounds suit the American West nicely. How much of the Civil War was fought in this country's more arid areas is a legitimate question.<br /><br />Morricone's main theme is heard throughout, always in variation. As a very amateur musician and singer who favors harmony, bassline structure and counterpoint to melody, an almost-syncopated downscale string countermelody in this piece, especially as Eastwood gallops off at the end, is a real attention grabber. It's an inspired bit of orchestration, at least for me.<br /><br />Few movies stand up to the scrutiny of repeated viewings as well as this one, and not many American westerns have ever been as good. Bad and/or ugly, maybe.</p></body></html>

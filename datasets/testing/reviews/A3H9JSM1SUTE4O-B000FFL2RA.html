<meta name="summary" content="A GREAT FILM"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott's majestic, provocative KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (Fox), never achieved mainstream status. Perhaps it was the contemporary "crusader" implications of the U.S. invasion of Iraq or the strong support of Israel by American evangelicals and the rise of radical Islamic terrorists that chilled the public's desire to see a film that explores and exploits the core conflicts between Christianity and Islam regarding Jerusalem.<br /><br />Criticized by both Arabs and Christians as taking the other's side, the film's an epic adventure that follows Balian (Orlando Bloom), a simple French blacksmith who discovers he's a nobleman and assumes his father's place in Richard the Lionheart's Third Crusade (1187-1192) to reclaim Jerusalem from a Saladin.  The main characters are based on real people with the exception of Balian's father.<br /><br />This convincing visual recreation of another era catches arguments for both sides and spotlights the self-serving agendas of those who influence the powers-that-be.<br /><br />The details of siege warfare in the climactic battle for Jerusalem, the huge scale of the confrontation and the fiery catapults are a wonder of modern filmmaking.<br /><br />Everyone I know who has actually seen this impressive film has enjoyed it.<br /><br />For more on this relevant theme, read James Reston's terrific book "Warrior's of God" and see the superb two-hour PBS documentary "Holy Warriors" now on DVD (Paramount).</p></body></html>

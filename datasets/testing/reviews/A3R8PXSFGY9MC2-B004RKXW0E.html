<meta name="summary" content="Toy Story 3"></head><body><p>`Toy Story 3' is another delightful sequel to finish the series up in a way befitting the high standard this has set for itself.<br /><br />When Andy goes to college, Woody and his friends end up in a children's daycare centre. But soon it comes to light that all is not quite what it seems and this rapidly turns into a prison break film, with all of the genre in-gags that that entails.<br /><br />This film has all the old characters we have grown to love, as well as some new ones to keep things interesting. These include a camp Ken doll, a fiendish pink teddy bear and a Ghibli Totoro toy. The hilarious voice-over talents are prevalent throughout and that special brand of humour unique to Toy Story films is still there. This has a great storyline to keep kids interested and the numerous smaller touches adults will notice to keep things feeling fresh and which Pixar have become renowned for. The animation is as superb as always and I really noticed how well the trees were rendered and the use of light, these may have stood our more on Blu-ray, but they are impressive regardless.<br /><br />All in all this is a worthy successor to the other films and if you enjoyed the previous films (and to be honest didn't we all!) then you should find this enjoyable too. They left things nicely tied up and hopefully Pixar won't feel the urge to rehash this particular franchise as it still has a warm place in many hearts and this film only adds to that. Well worth a viewing at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good"></head><body><p>This is a personal movie that's produced, written, and directed by Weitz who also got himself involved in "About A Boy" and "American Pie".  Referring to the extra features, some parts of Dennis Quaid's character was based on his own deceased father and he mentioned it that at times, it's hard not be emotional about scenes that he needed to edit out to prevent it to be running close to three hours long.  This is a movie that questions about the ethics of corporate raiding in modern American society where many ordinary people's lives are destroyed.  The closure of ENRON made this movie even more pertinent.  The new generation that embraces this new idea of getting successful in a very short period of time comes in the form of Topher Grace (from The 70's Show) whilst Dennis Quaid's character is the last remaining middle manager who is facing the threat of being made redundant to reduce costs.  Both of them have different values and undoubtedly, coming into conflicts.  Situation worsened when Topher got himself involved with Quaid's daughter, the illuminating Scarlett Johanssen.  Once again, she shows her versatility in portraying the daddy's girl and also, a girl that's transforming into a matured lady that gets to choose what she needs and wants to do in life.  Somehow, all comes out right in the end.  This movie reflects life as it is.  There are unexpected bumps and surprises along the way, but they seem to sort themselves out.  The movie ends in an open-ended manner but in a positive tone, suggesting of a future that's filled with hope.  A light-hearted movie that is honest and down to earth.  It's surprisingly good, akin to a chill creme brulee on a hot summer day.  Commendable watching.  Behind the scenes and commentaries shall give audience an insightful knowledge about the movie.</p></body></html>

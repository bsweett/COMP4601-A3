<meta name="summary" content="Friends with Money"></head><body><p>Everyone loves Vince Vaughn but where are the old time studio moguls who would have taken a look at VV on the first day of filming, and told him, look, you're 40 pounds overweight, you're suspended till you lost the extra baggage.  As is, he is so swollen up with fat his face has no more expression than the Pillsbury Doughboy.  It's like his facial features are being squeezed out.  In the epilogue someone comments to him, "You've lost weight!"  It must have been filmed months later because he looks completely different, more like himself again.  Maybe it wasn't overeating, but steroids?  Jon Favreau and Joey Lauren Adams also look like overstuffed caricatures of themselves, while on the other extreme, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Long and Judy Davis all put together don't weigh as much as Vince Vaughn.  A couple of time I felt sorry for him, like the one scene where he's lying down and the script calls for him to rise to a sitting position.  It's painful to watch and the director had to use a fast forward button to get him up before the reel changed.<br /><br />Right now in Sacramento humane zoo workers and the Coast Guard are joining forces to get two errant whales out of the delta.  Their pictures are all over the front page of the Chronicle, but in looking quickly at the news-stand today I said to my pal, "Hey look, it's Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau in THE BREAKUP."<br /><br />My mistake!  Okay, so there must be another version of the movie that explains how Aniston and Vaughn got together in the first place.  It just doesn't make sense that he, a pig from hell, would ever attract a woman who's supposed to be a killer saleswoman of contemporary art, a woman who has her pick of every attractive man in Chicago?  They keep putting Aniston in movies laid in Chicago, this is the third I've seen in 3 days.  I wonder why?  Does she scream out "Chicago" to you?  (DERAILED came on last night.)  We just saw the "LAKE HOUSE" with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.  Maybe it should have had Jennifer Aniston tucked into it somewhere, perhaps playing the same part as the Glengarry Glen Ross art saleswoman who can sell even the most unpromising canvas to the next gullible superhunk who waltzes into Marilyn Dean.  I must say Justin Long makes this movie worth seeing.  You totally believe him as the superfey, punked out receptionist with a heart of gold, the old Goldie Hawn part here turned into a hero for the QUEER EYE generation.  He too deserves a whole series of movies, all playing the same role, like Ann Sothern used to be Maisie and Donald O'Connor teamed over and over with Francis the Talking Mule.  He's terrific.</p></body></html>

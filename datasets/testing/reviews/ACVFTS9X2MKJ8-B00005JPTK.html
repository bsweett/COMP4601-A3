I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.<br /><br />And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does "big budget" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His "Wild Wild West", "Independence Day", "Men in Black", "I Robot", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.<br /><br />"Hitch" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.  But, I guess he's not hurtin'.  America eats this crap up.</p></body></html>

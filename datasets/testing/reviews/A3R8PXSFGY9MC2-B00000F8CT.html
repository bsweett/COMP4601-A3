<meta name="summary" content="Creepier than I remembered."></head><body><p>`Alien' is a film that has stood the test of time remarkably well.<br /><br />Following a crew on a large mining space ship, we see what happens to them when they pick up a distress signal and encounter an alien life form. Despite the age of this film the special effects are still remarkably creepy and at times could still rival films of today. The sets are the parts of this film that seem the most dated, but even these add a certain kitschy charm. This film spawned a movie franchise that went on for decades, but this is the one that held the most suspense, despite later ones having more gore and violence. Re-watching it today I was surprised just how creepy and eerie it was compared to what I remembered.<br /><br />This is acted and directed well and the alien effects are still impressive and coupled with a good storyline this makes for one superb sci-fi/horror film. A classic that should be watched at least once in your lifetime.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

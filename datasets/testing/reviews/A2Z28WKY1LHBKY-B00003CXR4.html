Exquisite chinoiserie. The fighting looked more like some sort of balletic dancing performed to some exotic kind of rhythms. With strings attached. Unfortunately I couldn't follow anything of what was going on, and I was unable to sustain the interest and concentration necessary to say that I even halfway enjoyed it.

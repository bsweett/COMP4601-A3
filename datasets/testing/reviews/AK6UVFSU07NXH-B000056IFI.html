<meta name="summary" content="A young woman with two strong men in her life"></head><body><p>It is now accepted that &quot;The Terminator&quot;, the predecessor of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is a classic science fiction film. This was not immediately obvious to a lot of people who only gave T1 the nod after the  success of T2. I am happy to lavish praise on both movies.  Consider though  that T1 had a production budget of less than one fifth of T2 and you may  start to get a feel for what an outstanding job was done on it.<br /><br />Terminator is the story of a young woman, (Sarah Connor), being  stalked. When you get down to it, that is the essence of the film and also  the source of the suspense and empathy we feel for that character. We can  all imagine what it would be like to have your life placed at risk at the  hands of a persistent murderer.<br /><br />Where this film pushes the envelope  is that the stalker is a cyborg, (part mechanical, part organic), killing  machine, (Terminator), from the future. Everyone else has said it so I may  as well. Schwartzenegger was perfectly cast in the role of an emotionless  machine of destruction. It's mission to assassinate the mother of John  Connor, who was to later in time become the leader of an army that opposed  the terminator's creator, Skynet.  Said creator being a self aware computer  that had taken control of the world by using the automated nuclear defence  grid.<br /><br />Sarah has an ally in the form of a soldier who volunteered to  travel from the future to protect the mother of his commander against the  Terminator. Played by Michael Biehn, Kyle Reese is determined to save the  woman that he loves. He managed to fall for Sarah before he had even met  her, through a faded Polaroid that John Connor gave him some years earlier.  In my opinion, it is Biehn that shines in this picture. Yes, the rest of  the actors were excellent but this was the first major film that Bein was  in and he was nothing short of brilliant. I think that a large part of the  horror we feel towards the terminator is a reflection of Reese's attitude  and reactions to it. If this obviously tough and battle scarred veteran is  brought nearly to the edge of hopelessness then you just know the bad guy  is a serious problem.<br /><br />Terminator was a fast paced film with a  relentless series of suspenseful chases and terrifying action sequences.  I  could not at the time imagine a film that could be as gripping, that is  until I saw Judgment Day, otherwise known as T2. Same plot only with the  roles exchanged. This time the victim is John Connor a twelve year old boy,  the original terminator, still played by Schwartzenegger, is the protector,  (reprogrammed in the future). The bad guy is also a terminator, but this  time it is an advanced prototype, (T-1000). No longer a Cyborg but a living  metal organism that can flow into any shape it desires.<br /><br />If I  thought the first terminator was relentless then the T-1000 is unstoppable.  Well, at least until he faced the newly buffed Sarah Conner in the dramatic  finale. The special effects in T2 were ground braking and the attention to  detail was flawless in every part of the movie. I have never met anyone who  didn't walk out of the cinema after T2 with a look of stunned awe on their  face.</p></body></html>

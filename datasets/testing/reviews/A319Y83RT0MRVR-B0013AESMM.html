This movie is best on reflection rather than as you are watching it. The themes and the characters are unusual and different and controversial. And that's precisely what makes this movie so engrossing and on-the-edge of your seat thrilling. Jodie Foster and Terrance Howard both give remarkable performances, but one doesn't expect anything less from them.</p></body></html>

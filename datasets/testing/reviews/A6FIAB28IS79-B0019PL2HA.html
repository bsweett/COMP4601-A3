Unfortunately, that's the only thing he's been bringing with him to the big screen.  In terms of the art of film comedy this one takes us back to pre-Chaplin, pre-Buster Keaton days--all the way back to Mack Sennett, who showed up on the Keystone set everyday without a clue and a bunch of guys in cop uniforms.  From that point on, the "writing" consisted of improvised slapstick called "riffing" (start with a single idea, premise, situation and go from there). At least, they didn't have the arrogance to credit "writers" in the screen credits.<br /><br />There are just enough hip allusions and racing send-ups in the movie to allow a mainstream NASCAR audience to view the film and think of themselves as being tolerant (even having a sense of humor about themselves!).  But don't kid yourself.  This is as lowbrow as it gets, guaranteed to appeal to a broad redneck mentality that simply enjoys seeing itself magnified in any fashion on the screen--proves they must be pretty important, after all.  Sold American!<br /><br />If you had doubts, what are the chances of a sophisticated, cultured adult Frenchman reading Camus' "The Stranger"?  (Even Dubya, we were told, read that book along with a couple of "Shakespeares" last summer!)  And guess what artists have a reputation for being gay.  Male ballet dancers?  Broadway actors?  Symphonic conductors?  Classical organists?  Not according to this film, which would have us believe that testosterone-driven jazz is the music with which to stereotype a gay Frenchman who obviously doesn't belong in the same bar as the film's dukes of Dixie.  So much for any pretenses at genuine satire, which depends on careful attention to details such as this.<br /><br />Then there's the physical stuff.  Guys kissing guys (isn't this getting a bit stale?), which comes off not as a countercultural slap at Southern homophobia but as a mockery of wimps like Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.  Or Farrell running around in his underwear in all his glorious mid-riff flab.  Problem is Chris Farley had more of it and used it more humorously if not gracefully.  Even the ending of the race is unclever, unimaginative, unmemorable and unfunny, given all of the visual possibilities with machines and humans racing one another to a finish line (I doubt the writers of this screenplay have ever seen a Chaplin or Keaton sequence employing the same device to always surprising, ingenious and creative effect).<br /><br />Just be thankful you didn't buy theater tickets for a family of four.  Even my son, who is a big racing and Ferrell fan, sat silent and stone-faced throughout.  With the exception of the rare "Little Miss Sunshine," today's screen comedies are making even Jerry Lewis' movies look good (a jab at the French adulation of J.L. which it didn't even occur to the writers of this movie to use).</p></body></html>

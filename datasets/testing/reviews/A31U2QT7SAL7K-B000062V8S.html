<meta name="summary" content="Second DVD reveals the real "stars" of the film"></head><body><p>Though the casting is perfect (Arnold again in his trademark role, Kristanna Loken as the sexy and equally as destructive "female" cyborg, and Nick Stahl appropriately looking like the spawn of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn) and the direction and pacing is tight and relentless, the DVD provides insight into the technical artists that are responsible for the fantastic effects of the movie, along with the preceding films in the franchise.<br /><br />The second DVD in the compilation profiles Stan Winston, visual effects director, and his talented staff as they explain the many "tricks" of the trade in the making of this movie.<br /><br />Though it might be a bit disconcerting to discover the process behind "movie magic," just revelations are informative to those that are really into the technical aspects of filmmaking.<br /><br />Much has changed in the almost twenty years since the first film was made and this sequel; and the filmmakers are anxious to explain the "how's" and "why's" of said change.</p></body></html>

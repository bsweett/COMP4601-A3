<meta name="summary" content="One of the absolute best films I have ever seen"></head><body><p>There have been a number of films over the past year that have garnered much critical acclaim, mainly because these are the kind of films that it seems just aren't made anymore.  There Will Be Blood is one of them, and is arguably the best effort that writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has ever put to celluloid, most notably thanks to the brilliant, Oscar winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as oil tycoon Daniel Plainview.  Plainview's rise is chronicled as he, along with his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), sets sights on an oil-rich land inhabited by the Sunday family, whose evangelist son Eli (Paul Dano) Plainview soon comes into conflict with.  There is even more going on in between all the proceedings, as Anderson presents an amalgamation of greed, love, redemption, and torment.  Not only is Daniel Day-Lewis a magnetic sight to behold, but every other performance (from Freasier, to Dano, to Kevin J. O'Connor, to Ciaran Hinds) are their own little miracles.  Everything else, from Anderson's direction, to brilliant and breathtaking cinematography, to a hair raising music score; all adds up to the modern day masterpiece that is There Will Be Blood.  While it is certainly not for all tastes, There Will Be Blood is a brilliant film regardless, and in that respect alone, the film is a must-see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An epic battle of heroes; the loss of ancient civilizations."></head><body><p>This gorgeous film portrays a portion of Homer's Iliad, Achilles' story. Brad Pitt plays Achilles and brings to life this ancient warrior.  Despite no overt manifestation of the gods, Pitt manages to convey possession by the god of war or possesion by the warrior archetype in his body language and facial expression.  His intense physicalization of the role is typical of Pitt's talent and dedication to studying and learning a character.<br /><br />The crux of the matter is that Achilles is not a likeable character in the original.  He was a great warrior but he was childish and petulant.  In the movie they emphasize his lust for glory.  His pride and lack of impulse control exemplifies the dark side of the heroic which manifested in other great Greek heroes such as Hercules and Medea.  This heroic dark side is often ignored in modern heroic portrayal and leads to problems in our society.<br /><br />Pitt and Peterson did not flinch from portraying this darkness and in the process provided a portrait of the ugliness of war which I find psychologically useful in this modern era of war.  Achilles is balanced by the excellent and sympathetic portrayal of Hector by Eric Bana.  Continuing the theme of the problematic nature of war is the portrayal of Agammenon as a cynical warmonger who manipulates others in order to achieve his goal of hegemony.<br /><br />Of note is the wonderful acting performance in the portrayal of King Priam by O'Toole. One of the best scenes of the movie is where Priam goes to Achilles to beg for the body of his son.  The interaction/chemistry between the two actors was savory.  Both Pitt and O'Toole clearly have studied Homer's version and provide a poignant scene which underscores the tragedy of war.<br /><br />While this movie departs from the original I find it to be a satisfying and beautiful modernization of the story--certainly there is nothing to compare it to since nothing quite like this has been attempted in film.  My only complaint might be that I would have liked an attempt to portray the gods.  But perhaps the absence of gods is apt in our literal modern age where nature is de-sacralized and we put the gods in the service of our wars.</p></body></html>

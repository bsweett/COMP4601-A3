<meta name="summary" content="Thankfully not starring Jean Claude Van Damme"></head><body><p>I was expecting this to be absolutely dreadful. It got slated left, right & centre - the film also started a rumour that Clive Owen & Jennifer Aniston were having an affair while she was still with Brad, especially since she was out pictured not wearing her wedding ring. A couple of months later, her & Brad announced their divorce, but not because of her infidelities.<br /><br />Derailed is a sort-of thriller, not starring Jean Claude Van Damme, but instead the afore-mentioned Clive & Jennifer. I hate Clive Owen with a passion, but thankfully he was working alongside Jennifer in this. Who's cool. Everyone says she can't play any other character but Rachel, which yes, is true, but what do you expect when you're stuck playing the same character for 10+ years? In this, she's actually playing Rachel again, but this time a much darker version.<br /><br />The film is quite brutal, and you genuinely feel for the characters, especially Lucinda (Jennifer) during the rape scene. Even if it does turn out to be a farce in the end. I read the book, but it was about a year ago, when Derailed was actually being filmed, and I honestly don't remember much about it now, but I certainly didn't remember the twist! The twist completely threw me, as I wasn't expecting it, although I was expecting something to happen. But my problem with Derailed is Jennifer's character does disappear for long periods of time, and we're left with Clive's miserable, one expression face.<br /><br />The cast are quite good, although Melissa George is seriously underused. But it's nice to see someone escaping the Neighbours/Home & Away curse at long last. She's no longer known as Angel.<br /><br />This film shows that anyone will have an affair, all it needs is a little spark of chemistry to start it off. Really, following in the same theme as Fatal Attraction, just without the bunny boiling, it's a film that will probably be remembered (if at all), for it's characters, and not the storyline itself.</p></body></html>

You get two versions of the movie, followed by a second disc with TONS of extra stuff.  IMHO the Scott and Cameron directed originals are still the best, but the Quadrilogy would not be complete without the other two.  Weaver looks absolutely stunning in the first one and solid performances are given by all the actors in each movie.  A must own for an Sci-Fi or Action Fan as well as any lover of great movies.  Well worth the money (especially on Amazon as I've shopped around and haven't found it cheaper anywhere else).  Incredible.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two Cowboys, Multiple Lives"></head><body><p>"Brokeback Mountain" is a film based on a story of the same name, written by author E. Annie Proulx. This controversial film received quite a bit of talk when it was first released and it was the subject of many jokes by comedians of all types. The idea of two cowboy types who fall in love while working at a mountain ranch was just too irresistible to many and it made Brokeback Mountain the common [...] (no pun intended) of many jokes.<br /><br />Today, many months after its initial release, much of the hoopla has died down. Brokeback Mountain has now been released on DVD and this provided me my opportunity to watch this movie and see what the fuss was all about. I already knew the film received rave reviews and it was nominated for many Oscars, taking home three of them before the Academy Awards wrapped up the 2005 awards evening. But would Brokeback Mountain live up to the hype, I wondered, or would it be an idiotic mess of unrealistic events, stupid one- liners, and a case of "pushing" an issue (in this case, gay themes and rights) on the viewer?<br /><br />Now that I have watched this movie in its entirety, I am happy to report that Brokeback Mountain contains none of the negative qualities I described above. Director Ang Lee presents a movie that is tastefully made and that doesn't push any social agenda. Yes, the film does portray many adult scenes (like gay sex and straight sex), but it is done in as tasteful a way as possible. What takes place in this movie is probably not very far- fetched at all for the time period that it covers (1963 to 1981) and there are likely many viewers who will be able to relate directly to the plot of this movie and the confusion and frustration felt by its lead characters and their families as they struggle to sort out their feelings. Ennis and Jack have obvious feelings for each other but they feel they must keep their affair secret. They have families to support and they want to be seen as "normal" by those around them. Jack is more aggressive and he pushes Ennis to join him and start a permanent relationship. But Ennis resists and the strain it places on them and their respective families is significant and the emotional pain on the screen is openly visible.<br /><br />Ang Lee does a superb job directing this film and its no surprise that he won the Oscar for Best Director. The cinematography is excellent, with great scenes of the vast Rocky Mountains as they majestically pierce the bright blue skies above them. The direction he takes this film is nearly flawless as it follows the two main characters on their path from lustful attraction, to emotional involvement, to resistance and beyond. Intertwined are the problems experienced on the home front. Both men get married and start families, in spite of their obvious attraction to each other. Like many people during that era, they probably did this because it was assumed to be the right thing to do. But the difficulties it causes their two families are obvious, with Ennis' character experiencing the greatest domestic turmoil of the two. Not only does Ennis get divorced, he even allows himself to get involved in another relationship with a woman; this, in spite of the fact that he knows where his true interest and feelings lie.<br /><br />Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Ray and his performance is near perfect. Ledger is only twenty- six years old but he plays the part of a man who is (at the end of the movie) in his forties. The make- up, the talk, and the attitude that Ledger projects into this character are very real and it's easy to see why he, too, was nominated for an Oscar. It took me a while to get used to Ennis' voice because he talks like someone with a hunk of chewing tobacco in his mouth. I had to replay some of the scenes to pick up on what he was saying. But the character was like this for a reason, most likely to make him similar to those who work in this type of occupation. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Jack Twist, is very different from Ennis. He is more of a straight talker who says exactly what is on his mind and proceeds to work toward his goals. Gyllenhaal's performance isn't quite as good as Ledger's but it is still notable and still memorable.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about Brokeback Mountain is that it took me some time to warm- up to the main characters. They seemed so distant and casual about the whole thing at first that it was difficult to care what was going on. I found myself feeling more sympathetic toward the families who had to deal with the volatility of their respective fathers/husbands on a daily basis. However, as the film nears its end, the frustration felt by Jack and the stubbornness of Ennis got me more involved with the characters. I just wanted them to finally make up their minds one way or the other and it was much easier at this point to feel the frustration felt by Jack as he tried to persuade his friend that he wanted their relationship to be more than just a seasonal fling.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is a very good motion picture that will be remembered for years as one of 2005's best pictures. The cinematography, the performances, and the directing are all top- notch and the story of forbidden love is engaging and vivid. The film will likely remain controversial for its subject matter but regardless of your own personal feelings on this type of subject, "Brokeback Mountain" is a film I recommend watching. It presents a realistic look at what people who lived this life often experienced back when alternative lifestyles weren't as accepted as they are today.</p></body></html>

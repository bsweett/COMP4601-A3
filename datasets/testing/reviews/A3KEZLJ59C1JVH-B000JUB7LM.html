<meta name="summary" content="Million dollar movie"></head><body><p>Why did it take me so long to see this film?! I've seen a lot of movies in my life, and I have to say that "Million Dollar Baby" has got to be one of the ten best movies of all time. It's definitely the best thing Clint Eastwood's ever done, and looking at his impressive list of credits, that's saying a lot!<br /><br />I thought that "Million Dollar Baby" was going to be Eastwood's interpretation of a female Rocky Balboa flick. Indeed, the film starts out that way. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a gym owner and boxing trainer who just lost his most promising fighter to another manager. Dunn has major relationship issues, both with his fighters and with his family: he has a daughter he hasn't spoken to in years. When an aspiring yet inexperienced female fighter (Hilary Swank) shows up on Frankie's doorstep, he doesn't want anything to do with her...Frankie Dunn doesn't train girls! But Maggie is persistent and with a little help from Eddie (Morgan Freeman), Frankie's friend and training partner, Frankie agrees to bend the rules and teach this girl everything he knows. The trainer and his fighter forge an unlikely father-daughter type bond, and they grow closer as Maggie's career continues to excel. Then tragedy strikes, and "Million Dollar Baby" transforms from a boxing movie into one of the most heart-wrenching, character-driven dramas the silver screen has ever seen before.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this film swept the Academy Awards. Swank and Freeman give the performances of their careers. (It was a real shame that Eastwood was snubbed in the Best Actor category...he truly deserved to win.)<br /><br />I don't want to give away any additional details about the movie, but the plot is full of surprises, and the ending is one that you won't expect and might have a hard time dealing with. "Million Dollar Baby" isn't the kind of movie I'll want to watch again and again...it takes too much of an emotional toll on you to watch it more than once. However, it is definitely one of the most amazing movies I've seen in recent years, and quite possibly one of the most powerful films in movie history.<br /><br />Eastwood's pictures keep getting better and better...I can't wait for the next one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rob Zombie's Halloween has more going for it than you may think"></head><body><p>This review is on the long side, but please just bare with me.<br /><br />Halloween just might be the most controversial horror remake of all time; when it was announced as a remake with Rob Zombie directing a lot of people were for it and a lot of people were against it. While I wasn't happy Halloween was being remade I also looked forward to it. I feel the last couple of installments were rather weak. Even though I do enjoy 2-5, it's all been downhill after the classic original. Also being a fan of Rob Zombie got me interested.<br /><br />The series though needed something to get back on track and I hoped this would be the movie to get things going. I know a lot of people were upset that the series wouldn't get closure now. But does it really matter? This series has so many loose ends to begin with. The unfairly bashed Halloween 3 has nothing to do with the previous 2 or anything afterwards so that will never be wrapped up. Halloween 4-6 were ignored come H20 and Resurrection. So no matter what this series would never get closure. And honestly after Halloween: Resurrection this franchise was in much need of a resurrection.<br /><br />Adding a back-story is something that can be very tough to work and that is what really made me nervous and when I heard it was the first half of the movie I got even more nervous. This may be a remake, but let's face it most people will still see this as the 9th Halloween movie. The funny thing is I happen to think the first half was the strongest of the movie and I know a lot of people felt that way. Even those who hated the movie, a lot of the times say the first half was better. The backstory here is far, far better than the lame curse of thorn. The first half was an interesting character study of a very disturbed boy.<br /><br />The screenplay by Rob Zombie was very uneven; most of his ideas play out well, but there are some cringe worthy moments. The first 10-minutes or so features some weak writing. But as a fan of this genre the writing is often the weakest part and none of the Halloween movies had great screenplays. Yes even the original; the script really wasn't all that great. The reason Halloween is the masterpiece it is, is simply because of the strong lead performances and Carpenter's directing and music. In Halloween 07 most of the poor dialogue is from Ronnie White played by the very cool William Forsythe. His dialogue is terrible and his performance is border-line of a parody. His character is entertaining, but the biggest flaw with the first half. But the good is any scene with Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and young Michael played by Daeg Faerch. Also the scenes withy young Michael and Deborah Myers played by Sheri Moon Zombie also works very well.<br /><br />The Loomis and Michael scenes actually come out well, and it was quite interesting to see Loomis actually trying to reach Michael and help him. In the original we never see Loomis working with young Michael, which is fine. That wasn't the point of the original, but it is interesting seeing Loomis trying to reach Michael. I found their relationship the strongest part of Halloween 07. In the original as well as the sequels Loomis is out to stop Michael no matter what. Even if it means giving his own life; when Loomis first comes across Michael at the end in the original his first reaction was shoot to kill. In Halloween 07 Loomis though tries to reach Michael first and if that doesn't work than shoot to kill. The scenes with Loomis and Michael are well written and acted and play out very well overall. Daeg Faerch does an excellent job as young Michael.<br /><br />Some people dislike the backstory, but it was for the most part well done some people disliked the fact Michael was given a motive. I don't think that was the case. Michael was a disturbed boy who was bound to snap sooner or later. His home life just made him snap sooner. But the things he does as a child and later as an adult isn't something people do unless they are very disturbed.<br /><br />The first half actually works well despite some weak writing at times; the performances were mostly good with Sheri Moon Zombie being the stand-out; I do think Zombie has a slight problem writing for normal characters, but he does a great job with Deborah Myers. She was likeable and very sympathetic. I do think though the screenplay could have used a touch up in the first half, but Zombie keeps the pace moving at a solid pace and makes up for any shortcomings.<br /><br />The problem with the 2nd half is basically 80-minutes of the original crammed into about an hour. The pacing is the biggest problem; characters are introduced for a scene or two and are killed off right away. There is very little getting to know them. There are moments where it does sort of become a rehash of the original, but it still works well. No doubt it's not as suspenseful and scary as the original, but Zombie's scenes do work well overall.<br /><br />With Halloween, the problem of writing for normal characters is still there for Zombie. None of the characters were really all that likeable outside of maybe Ismael Cruz played by Danny Trejo. The Strode family was Rob's attempt at writing normal characters, but the problem is they come across as really weird. It's like those people who get older, but yet try and act like they are down with the youth they always seem weird. Pat Skipper does a good job as Mason Strode as does Dee Wallace as Cynthia. Both characters are likeable though, but just come across as a little weird. Their deaths though are very brutal and work really well.<br /><br />Scout Taylor-Compton does an excellent job as Laurie Strode, but her character was just not fully developed, but than again the point of Halloween 07 was to focus more on Michael Myers. It was his story where as the original was Laurie's story. Scout gets some heat, but she was one of the bright spots of the movie. Some people say she wasn't likeable and was too mean to Tommy Doyal played by Skyler Gisondo. I have to disagree; the scenes with her and Tommy and than later with Lindsey played by Jenny Gregg Stewart are the strongest scenes in the 2nd half. She wasn't being mean to them they have brother/sister kind of relationship and it worked quite well. Zombie is getting better at writing for normal characters. His first two were all about the villains, and here the main focus is the villain, but he does do better with the normal characters, than he did in Corpses and Rejects. But The Devil's Rejects is still by far his best movie thus far.<br /><br />By the time Laurie enters the movie there is about an hour left and there was no way all these characters plus Laurie could be fully developed without slowing down the pace. This Laurie isn't the repressed virgin Jamie Lee's Laurie was. Scout's Laurie was a nice girl with an edge to her. But her first scene was very weird and that shows Zombie needs more work on normal characters. By the time Laurie came into play developing her too much would have slowed the pace down a lot. And at this point you gotta keep moving forward. There was potential with the Laurie character, but despite not being fully developed I do think the character was likeable.<br /><br />Some people complain about the lack of screen time for Lynda played by Kristina Klebe and Annie played by Danielle Harris making her big return to the Halloween series. If you go back and view the original Halloween, Lynda actually doesn't have a lot of screen time. Difference is her part is spread out more through the picture, where as here it's not. Though it does seem like Annie may have had less screen time than the original Annie did; both girls though play their roles well. They weren't all that likeable in general, but they both provide solid performances.<br /><br />I think the writing for Laurie, Lynda and Annie was good and bad. They do come across like teenagers in the things they say and do. Not all teens are like that, but a lot of them are. But they just lacked depth. But as much as I love the original there was some weak writing and Lynda had the weakest of lines. Lynda in the remake is no more developed, but in some ways she actually is. Prior to her death when she talks to Laurie on the phone does add a little bit of depth to Lynda. Her tough girl act is just that an act. Zombie's screenplay was very mixed, but there is some potential there for him as a writer with normal characters.<br /><br />Tyler Mane I thought did a great job as Michael Myers. To be honest I would rate him 2nd to only Nick Castle of the original. If the original Michael was the incarnation of evil, this Michael is the incarnation of rage. Despite his size he's still stealthy. The scene when he stands behind Lindsey Wallace as she watches TV is a very creepy moment. Tyler's Michael and Nick Castle's Michael are very much a like, but very different. But I really loved Tyler's performance.<br /><br />The good and bad of the backstory is simple. We get to know Michael so well it does sort of take away the boogeyman element. But it also brings a human side to Michael and makes him feel so much more real. I'll admit the 2nd half had some creepy moments thanks to Tyler's movements and the fact we knew Michael more makes him seem real. In the sequels he became too much of an un-killable monster. Like the original, this is the most human Michael has ever been. In the original Michael was just pure evil, he was the shape of evil in a man. But he felt like a real person. And while he kept coming back an excuse can be made for why he survived what he did. Zombie goes back to that in a sense. Again this is the most human Michael has been in a while.<br /><br />What I liked about Tyler Mane was his eyes show nothing. And what I mean by that they show no remorse. He has this empty look. The person inside of him is dead and just evil has taken over his body. Having such a big Michael may not have been the smartest move, but it works out great as Tyler Mane gives it his all and makes a great Michael. Malcolm McDowell was excellent as Dr. Loomis, though nobody can ever top Pleasence. My only problem with McDowell is sometimes he comes across as a bit shady. The major problem is a lot of his scenes in the 2nd half with Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is a rehash of the original just worded slightly different.<br /><br />Some people complain about the violence, but I thought it was done in a great way. The one thing Rob Zombie really has going for him as a filmmaker is he knows how to shoot a brutal death scene. His love of exploitation cinema serves him well with the deaths. The victims try and fight back and put more of a struggle up. The scene with Michael dragging away a topless Annie is a very creepy moment. And when Laurie finds her later on it's actually quite chilling. This is probably the most violent Halloween, but it does work well since it's very raw and real. As a director despite some pacing problems Rob Zombie is able to keep things moving forward and like him or not there was a story and I personally enjoyed it.<br /><br />Not everybody will like this flick, but I can't help but feel a lot of the hate stems from it being a remake. I saw a lot of negative reviews from people who never even have seen this and I read a lot of negative stuff before the movie was even shot. Liking the remake doesn't make you any less of a fan of the original and Halloween 07 will never replace the original. I don't get that so many people are willing to accept the sequels, but dismiss the remake before even viewing it.<br /><br />Make no mistake Halloween 07 isn't a perfect film and not as good as the original. But it does deliver some suspense and scares. I would rate Halloween 07 as the 2nd best of the series only behind the original. I didn't like Halloween 07 at first, but now I've come to love it. Give it a chance and just forget it's a remake and enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

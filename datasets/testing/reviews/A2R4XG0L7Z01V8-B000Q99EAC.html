<meta name="summary" content="Did Rocky rock me? Will Rocky rock you?"></head><body><p>I haven't seen any of the previous Rocky movies, so I watched this through completely innocent eyes. I wasn't sure about it at first, what with not having seen any of the previous five, and I was wondering if it would be one of those films, where you HAVE to have seen the previous films.<br /><br />I was surprised when I found myself not only enjoying the film, but also getting emotionally involved. Sly did the right thing when he got this up and running by NOT making the viewers feel the need to see the previous films. There were only a couple of brief flashbacks, which were necessary, and relevant.<br /><br />The film begins with Rocky, now a hero in Philadelphia and running his own restaurant, letting his old sparring partners eat for free, and telling the locals his old stories. It cuts a pretty sad story, he's a washed up ex boxer, who actually looks like he's been a few too many rounds in the ring. I did get the impression; maybe it was just me, that he's desperate for company. Rocky constantly greeted people with "Hey, how u doin'?" Practically adopted a woman he remembered walking home as a little girl, and her son, and gave them both a job. It comes across as a bit desperate in the character of Rocky. His wife is dead, he's estranged from his only son, who seems to be embarrassed of his old pa, and it's a very lonely life. His son doesn't want anyone to meet his old boxer dad at his work, even though he only got the job because of his surname.<br /><br />Of course, there's a new kid on the block, and they start comparing him to the old Rocky, and who would win in a fight. A computer whiz-kid simulates the fight. Rocky sees this, thinks about it for a nano-second, and starts training again, despite protests from the licensing committee, his son, his friends, and people in the restaurant. Many think he cannot do it, many people say he can't, right to his face, but that just makes Rocky all the more defiant.<br /><br />The training montage is definitely one of the highlights of the movie, along with the terrific song backing it. It shows Rocky trying desperately to get back into shape (and Sly himself too, since he's admitted in interviews, that he let himself slide, and can't do as many things as he could do in the earlier films), from not being able to bench press very much, to a whole lot! Honestly it made my eyes water how much he ended up bench pressing & lifting in weights. Ouch.<br /><br />The final fight scene is of course, what we've all been waiting for throughout the film. It's the climax, and wow, what a climax. I wouldn't have said I would normally go to watch a boxing match - it's more an American thing really, I think? In fact, I hate boxing, but the film captures the electric atmosphere in the stadium, and I found myself getting caught up in the excitement. If there hadn't been people around me, I probably would have started jumping up and down in my seat. Of course, you're just waiting for him to get up, when he gets knocked down, urging him to get up, and obviously, will he win, or won't he? And it's also intercut with very brief flashbacks to previous Rocky matches. Flashbacks were used from every Rocky movie apart from Rocky V, which Sly admits himself is the weakest in the series.<br /><br />I thought it was quite good how they finished it. I was expecting the ending to be clear-cut, but it's not, and it's good that it's not.<br /><br />The one thing that got me watching Rocky Balboa was the fact that no matter how much plastic surgery Jackie Stallone has, Sly is basically turning into her!!! It was scary watching him on screen and seeing Jackie, which I never really noticed in Demolition Man, or his older films. He is turning into his mother.<br /><br />Overall I think this was a good idea (some people do disagree with me) for Sly to revisit Rocky one last time, and just wrap it all up. If I'd seen the previous movies, then it would have been a good way to end it all - if I had, I'd probably have been totally fed up with it all by now! The ending does seem very final, but then that means nothing these days. I have to applaud Sly for returning to the role after 15 years, showing he still has what it takes, showing he still has the body (his shoulders are the width of me lying down no exaggeration!), and showing he can still hack it in the ring. He is 61 this summer after all. It is a good film to go see if you have seen the previous five or even if you haven't. Excellent film.</p></body></html>

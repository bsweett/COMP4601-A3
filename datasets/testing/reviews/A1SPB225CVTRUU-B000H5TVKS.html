<meta name="summary" content="It's all about the BLOOD and GORE!"></head><body><p>Saw was good, because it was creating a new genre and it was original and on a league of it's own. Saw 2 is not as good in my opinion. It's very disturbing at times, because it's so graphic and violent and so much blood and gore that by the end of it I was repulsed by it. Why was this low-budget horror film so bloody successful?! They are already making Saw 3 now. The cast had very little appeal to me in this film. Yes, it is shot in Toronto and I did recognized my friend Ho"Oyster" who played the cop and he just had two lines. I guess I am not really into this kind of nasty gore feast. I prefer horror films that have more intricate storyline and not "cutting up body parts kind of stuff". It's got a niche market and it works for that target audiences. I am not looking forward to see another Saw.</p></body></html>

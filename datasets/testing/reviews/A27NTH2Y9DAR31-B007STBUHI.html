<meta name="summary" content="A CLASSIC WITH EXTRAS"></head><body><p>I saw Jaws when it debuted in 1975 and we were late getting in because of parking issues; however, we made it to the interior and couldn't see to find a seat having just come out of sunlight into dark so we waited and while we were waiting, the opening credits ran, accompanied by that MUSIC.<br />We stood there until the girl had her nighttime encounter with the shark and our knees turned to rubber (sorry, buit the cliche fits) and were thankful when the scene changed to daylight and we could grope our way to our seats.<br />The audience was blown away as were we, and the biggest shocker came when Hooper (Dreyfuss) is taking the tooth off Ben Gardner's boat and that HEAD comes out; everyone shot out of their chairs and screamed; it was and is a truly shocking moment, We are expecting the shark to come from behind Dreyfuss, not for something to pop out of the BOAT so this was brilliant (TY SSpielberg)and the actors are all so good. LOVE Robert Shaw, but as Quint he excels himself and turns in a great performance, esp the relating of the story of the USS Indianapolis. I had never heard of it before and subsuquent research was not only enlightening, it was appalling.<br />Roy Scheider was solid as Brody, a vastly different interpretation from that in the book, thankfully, and Lorraine Gary was wonderful as Mrs Brody.<br />The quality is superb, better than I've ever seen, but the real value here is the extras, notably the Making of, which is the best I have ever seen on any disc of any moive; this was almost as riveting as the movie itself. It is quite lengthy and provides many fascinating factoids and gives a new light and dimension to the movie. HIGHLY recommend.<br />God Bless and RIP Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw, and TY for so many excellent performances.</p></body></html>

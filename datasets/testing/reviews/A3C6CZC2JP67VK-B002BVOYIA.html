<meta name="summary" content="Powerful and Intense movie"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that just anger's you and feel sadden all at once. Don Cheadle was truly Oscar-worthy for this film and 100% convincing in his role as the Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, and Nick Nolte and le grand Jean Reno give outstanding performances in their limited screen time. British-born newcomer Sophie Okonedo also gives a fine performance as Cheadle's Tutsi wife. Filmed in South Africa as an international (mostly Canadian) production, the faces of the many other important supporting characters looked more than sufficiently authentic, providing a profound human backdrop to the events unfolding on the screen.<br /><br />Regarding the film, there are a couple of points where the forced dramatic moments border on excess, but in all cases the faces on the screen included white ones, lending a certain amount of slack. When African faces were alone on the screen, the terror was sufficiently evident to never have to feel forced. The plot devices certainly owe a debt to earlier films like The Battle of Algiers, Salvador, The Killing Fields, and Schindler's List, but we should remember that this is essentially a true story. Furthermore, Hotel Rwanda's focus on one family and the strength of its bond provides an element of hope and positive feeling that brings something new and invigorating to this genre. Above all, I loved this film.</p></body></html>

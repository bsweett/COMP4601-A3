<meta name="summary" content="Great acting carries this film above what it would otherwise be"></head><body><p>Not saying that "The Jacket" is poorly written or directed; it would still be a good film on its own, no doubt...but it would be cliched, surely.  However, the acting--which, from my experience, is the most obvious and most important part of a movie--is superb, carrying this film above it's twisted genre, and into a movie that critics and viewers both will enjoy.<br /><br />Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) was shot in the head in the Gulf War.  Fortunately, he lived; unfortunately, it left him confused as to who he is.  Back from the war, set free from the hospitals, he finds himself wandering a deserted country road, where he gets caught up in a crime--and is blamed for it.<br /><br />Unsure of anything, he is sent to a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane, where he is treated by the somewhat sadistic Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson), whose specialty is solitary confinement in a small, dark chamber.  While in the chamber, Jack "travels" to an alternate reality, where he meets up with a down-trodden young women (Keira Knightley) whom he falls in love with.  But Jack is determined to find out who he is, and which reality is the one he belongs in...and his time is running out.<br /><br />It seems too confusing to summarize...I probably shouldn't have tried, for it comes out sounding like a lame science-fiction flick.  But it isn't.  It's a drama about identity...with some character study and mystery thrown in for good measure.  The great thing about "The Jacket" is that it's not too cliched (as movies in this genre tend to be).  Kristofferson's character, the sadistic doctor, defies stereotypes; even Brody's protagonist features a few surprises.  "The Jacket" is a well-written, fast-paced drama; but most importantly, it is superbly acted.  That is what makes this film so watchable; that's what will make you want to watch it again.</p></body></html>

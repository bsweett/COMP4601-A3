A girl from a prosperous family and a boy, a son of a modest carpenter.  When two are separated in order to protect girl's propriety and define clear line between their two social classes, they do not see each other for 15 years.  Eventually, boy finds himself back in Vienna, this time in a role of a train magician and entertainer, while girl is being groomed to marry a crown prince of the Habsburg empire. Chance meeting between the two during the magic show, ignites the flame of the innocent love they once had for each other as young children.  And this is where film looses its pace.  How likely it is  that girl of noble upbringing and upper class would leave it all for a travelling illusionist?  What future would these two have, other than love for each other and no other prospects.  Story of commoner illusionist outwitting a royal soon becomes more a of fable of misguided love and scam where two love birds create elaborate scheme that will allow them to be together forever without ever being found by the royal family, friends or their parents.  While I liked Norton's and Giamatti's acting and their tender German accent, Biel is nothing more but a beautiful ornament in this film.  She is very pretty to look at, but her acting is quite plain.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Pursuit of the American Dream"></head><body><p>"You have to have money to make money."  That's what they say, and, unless you're as determined as Chris Gardner (Will Smith), you don't have a chance.  Unfortunately, money does buy some happiness.  As Chris looks about the wealthy, he observes, "They looked so d---ed happy to me.  Why couldn't I look like that?"  His lot is to sell portable magnetic resonance imaging machines to doctors.  His prospects can be inferred by his description of them as "expensive...and only slightly better at creating images" than the ones they already had.  His wife, Linda (Chandie Newton) picks up the slack.  They have a beautiful, intelligent, inquisitive son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), whom they juggle from daycare to parent care, like many struggling wage earners.  She bears the burden as the chief wage earner, taking double shifts at the laundry, which can hardly be lucrative.  Her patience with him and the paper chase runs her ragged.  The IRS, the landlord, and the utilities all have a constant claim to their near future.  In the meantime, Chris gets an offer for the American Dream, a chance to be an intern at Dean Whitter, where, once accepted, bares a twenty-to-one chance of being hired after six months of grueling stock huckstering and hitting the books.  Like most people he wants a better life for himself and his family.  Remembering his own lot in life, he vows, "My children were gonna know who their father is."  Indeed some of the father and son scenes show real love, even by a father who is frayed by the pressures to succeed.  Taking place in the eighties, Chris will try the impossible, aligning his fortunes like the Rubik's cube he sets out to master...<br /><br />`The Pursuit of Happyness' pays dirt.  Every development along the way is absorbing from the first frame.  Always a stickler to detail, the beautiful background music and the well-chosen soundtrack are marvelous without ever making the film sentimental.  It's one step forward and two steps back.  This is true for Chris and the rest of us. Only the way it is revealed by Chris is truly a piece of work.  Chris tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you, you can't do something...If you have a dream, you have to protect it...You want something, go get it."  Inspiring for all of us, this film may sound off themes from `Death of a Salesman,' but the results and details are often desperate, but offer us all hope.

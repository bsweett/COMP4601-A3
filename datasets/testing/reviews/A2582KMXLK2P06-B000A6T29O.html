<meta name="summary" content="an action film that works"></head><body><p>While I'm certainly not a fan of the Tomb Raider video games (because they're horribly designed and endlessly frustrating) I couldn't believe my sees at the sight of a really good Tomb Raider action movie.  Sure, some of the lines were pretty silly and cheesy, and the action scenes were pretty predictable because you KNEW Lara would always escape danger is highly unbelievable ways.  It doesn't matter though, because I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this film.  Good watch.</p></body></html>

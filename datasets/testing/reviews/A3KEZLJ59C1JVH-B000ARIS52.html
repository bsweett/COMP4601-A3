<meta name="summary" content="A very unique film"></head><body><p>I've never read the Frank Miller novels, but from what I've heard, the film version of "Sin City" is a great adaptation of the comic books. Speaking as someone who isn't familiar with the comics, I thoroughly enjoyed "Sin City" and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in an "alternative moviegoing experience."<br /><br />"Sin City" is actually made up of three different stories. In the first one, Bruce Willis plays a nearly-retired cop who puts his life and career on the line to save a young girl from a child molestor. The second story follows Marv (Mickey Rourke) as he tries to track down the people responsible for the death of a hooker who winds up in his bed. Finally, Clive Owen plays a man who tries to protect his new girlfriend from an abusive ex (Benicio Del Toro) and accidently threatens the balance of power between the police, the mob, and the girls who work the streets in Old Town.<br /><br />The film is shot almost entirely in black and white with little glimmers of color here and there (deep red lipstick, a woman's piercing blue eyes). Almost all of the backgrounds are digitally generated, which gives everything a true comic book/film noir quality. Some people might be turned off by the intense violence that is present in all three stories, but it's my understanding that the graphic novels are exactly the same way, so fans of the "Sin City" series will probably be pleased. I enjoyed the unique filmmaking techniques coupled with entertaining stories and fabulous performances by a large and incredibly talented cast.<br /><br />See this film in the theatre if you can...even thought it's a gritty, violent movie, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. (I also got a real kick out of seeing Elijah Wood play a ninja-style serial killer/cannibal...a far cry from his Frodo Baggins days!)</p></body></html>

But in a sense it is a bite off of "SEVEN" and some other movie but i cant remember. I wont go into detail but, its an ok movie. Im a big fan of 70's and 80's horror some 60's a majority of my collection horror atleast is like I said 70' and 80's so alot of this new stuff does not appeal to me much, at all. I did buy it from best buy cause it was only $14.99 whcih is not bad and I will watch it again from time to time on rare occasion, i more or less really brought just because I like to collect DVD's and it is good enough to buy. If you want a movie with a similar plaot and IMO just way better ,Buy the movie "SEVEN" which is one of the newer late 90 movies that i actually think is an excellentaction/thriller/horror.</p></body></html>

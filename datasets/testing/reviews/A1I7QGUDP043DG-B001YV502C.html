When Theo realizes the reason behind the urgency, he plunges in to danger to protect the pregnant woman in a time when no babies are being born. She's a sought after commodity and many groups want to promote her for their own political or financial purposes. The film can be slightly predictable in spots, but it's worth watching. I'd recommend renting first to see if you really want to add it to your Science Fiction, DVD collection.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great guns'n'chases flick"></head><body><p>This summer has had some outstanding summer movies, and Salt is one of them. It starts with Angelina Jolie in the title role, Evelyn Salt, a CIA spy. A Russian defector suddenly shows up at one of their front businesses. During questioning, he announces to one an all that the visiting Russian president will be assassinated - by Evelyn Salt, supposedly a deep-cover Russian spy. The fact that the 'defector' then kills two agents escaping the building never enters into some folks' wholehearted belief his story. They take her in for questioning, she busts loose (super-agent that she is), and the chase is on.<br /><br />I really can't say anything else about the plot. There are so many reversals than anything would be a spoiler, and you deserve to see them for yourself. Of course, Jolie completely takes command of the role, and of pretty much everything else in sight. I'm sure it will surprise no one that the role was orginally written for a male actor ('Edwin,' not 'Evelyn') but, when it came time to cast the manliest action actor they could find, Jolie's name topped the list.<br /><br />This movie stands well above its genre. There are plenty of fight scenes, some pretty amazing chases, and a satisfying ending that begs for sequels. More than just that, there's an actual plot, one that keeps you guessing almost (but not quite) to the end.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

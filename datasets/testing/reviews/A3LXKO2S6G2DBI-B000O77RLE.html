<meta name="summary" content="Anti-War But Not Anti-Soldier"></head><body><p>I like a good war movie, and by this, I mean gung-ho, yee-ha shoot 'em ups that supplant the grim reality of war with the action and intensity of simple, if violent, competition.  Characters suffer in these movies, but never to the degree of reality, with the good guys easy to distinguish from the bad, and even when based on real events, they are generally more fantasy than reality.  (Having a father who was a Vietnam era soldier and a mother who witnessed as a child the death of innocents in the Korean War can clarify the difference.)<br /><br />Among the better war movies are "Zulu," "The Guns of Navarone," "Where Eagles Dare," and "Pork Chop Hill."  Every once in a while, though, I sneak in a movie about war.  They're not the same thing.  These kinds of films supplant grim reality for action and intensity.  Sometimes they are anti-war, showing the tragic futility of combat to settle differences.  Stanley Kubrick's brilliant "Paths of Glory" comes to mind, as does Terrance Malick's "The Thin Red Line."  Sometimes they are anti-soldier, depicting the utter barbarity of human beings when left to their own to act out on sadism, racism, or ethnocentrism.  These are easier to find in foreign markets than the U.S., where jingoism is so integral a part of culture, but "The Last Valley" and "Casualties of War" qualify.<br /><br />It's easy to blame soldiers -- after all, if they weren't so eager to fight, maybe there wouldn't be war.  But until someone improves upon the human condition for too many people, that just seems terribly naive.  Still, Hollywood has a habit of wanting to make an anti-war statement once or twice a decade, and the tone generally comes off as anti-soldier.  Not "Letters from Iwo Jima," a rather remarkably nuanced film in this regard, made more so because it tells its story from the point of view of the Japanese rather than the Americans.  Having grown up seeing the Japanese painted as one-dimensional villains in war movies -- and knowing full well the brutality Japanese soldiers inflicted on my mother's native country of Korea -- I wasn't expecting an American film to move me so easily in its creation of three-dimensional characters.  These Japanese soldiers are real human beings, some noble, some cruel, but all like people you actually know rather than the cardboard cutouts of most war movies.  Ken Watanabe, at times doing a poor man's Toshiro Mifune, is nonetheless decidedly charismatic in his portraly of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the commander of the doomed contingent of Imperial defenders, but Kazunari Ninomiya, as Private Saigo, carries most of the dramatic weight as a cynical teenager coming to terms with the futility of his position.  The rest of the cast is equally effective, and Clint Eastwood's direction shows him to be one of the premier American filmmakers of our time.<br /><br />Many people know the historical results of the Battle of Iwo Jima but mostly from the point of view of the Americans, who fought bravely and determinedly and suffered tremendous casualties.  But of lesser concern was that of the Japanese.  This film, sure to irk some audiences, stresses the latter, though not to the degree of showing one side as better or worse.  Instead, the film correctly focuses on the soldiers rather than the battle, and in this, despite the sometimes cruel actions of men on both sides, it becomes a pro-soldier film even if still resonating as anti-war.  I don't know if I can watch it more than once, but I'm glad I did watch it.</p></body></html>

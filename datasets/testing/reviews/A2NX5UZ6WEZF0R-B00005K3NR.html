It's very hard to enjoy Carrie. How anyone can I do not know. I've seen it years ago, but it was on tv last month and I couldn't stop crying. It is sooo depressing and not a laughing matter at all. This is a very serious issue. Kids coming to school with guns and killing their peers who teased and verbally abused them on a daily basis for years all throughout high school, is no joke. In Carrie, that sick and demented Kris girl, and the classmates who terrorized Carrie, and the whole time she just wanted to be accepted and to fit in with her peers. She finally gets a chance to go to prom with a nice genuine guy, and when she gets the nerve to go, she is laughed at, and lets not forget the pigs blood scene which is anything but funny. The movie is depressing and sad and gets worse and worse for carrie, who is a sweet, shy, and beautiful girl and the only reason she is different is because of the way she was raised by her psychopathic, religious fanatic, demented, and abusive mother, who by the way tries to kill her own daughter at the end. No happy ending. Carrie dies when her emotions get out of control, and her teleniketic powers cause the house to crumble causing her to die, after having to kill her mother in her own defense. Tommy Ross died, and he was the only good guy in the school it seemed. Schools have done hardly anything to stop the abuse of other classmates in real life. I was often teased and believe me it's no laughing matter. I did ageree with what the p.e. teacher did by punishing the snotty girls in the locker room who threw tampons at carrie telling her to plug it up, when she thought she was dying and did not know what a period was because of her deranged mother. It's just not a happy movie. You almost can't feel sympathy at the end for the kids who are killed by Carrie, the ones that tortured carrie and laughed at her, and even tried to kill her by running her over with the car (Kris and Travolta). A person can only take so much. (I'm not condoning turning to homicidal revenge. Just saying that in the movie you constantly despise the other kids, and feel sympathetic for Carrie)And that awful music that plays throughout the film is so sad, and makes you want to just shut it off. No wonder my mom, who was a teenager in the 70's, hated this sad and demented movie.<br /><br />One last thing I am sure is often over-looked. When the blood is poured on carrie, she begins to hallucinate. It was so tramatic and humuliating that she began to see and hear things that were not there. It first showed most of the kids laughing, but not the p.e. teacher, or the girl that was friends with Tommy Ross or her boyfriend. See what happened was, it showed US (the viewers) the people who DID laugh, and then showed Carrie hearing "plug it up plug it up, we're so sorry cassie, they are all gonna laugh at you, ..over and over again, and she thought that everyone was turning on her, even the p.e. teacher, who was really looking horrified once the blood bucket dropped. So all the abuse and teasing, finally had come to a breaking point, which pychiatrists call, a mental breakdown, or post-dramatic stress disorder, or temporarily insane, which are not made up disorders, they really do happen. So when that was going on, that's when her emotions came to a boiling point, and she killed everyone in the room uncontrollably, and the guilt even led to her own death. So to say Carrie is the evil one in the movie is not logical. It can happen to the best of us.<br /><br />TO THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOYED THE PIG BLOOD SCENE OR WHO ENJOYED WATCHING CARRIE GET BRUTALLY TEASED: You are sadistic and immature and don't know anything about pain and suffering, or compassion. How can anyone enjoy it. There is something sickly wrong with all of you. I know it's only a movie, but what does that say about you?? The idea makes you sick to your stomach, that people enjoy the suffering of others. Get a life. This happens everyday in schools, and when kids turn to violence and rage, it's nothing to be proud of as a teaser/tormentor, because it will come right around back to you.</p></body></html>

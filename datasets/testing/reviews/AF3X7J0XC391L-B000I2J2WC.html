<meta name="summary" content="Good movie; but taken too seriously"></head><body><p>The Da Vinci Code offers up suspense, intrigue, action, and all-around decent acting performances.  Of course, historic accuracy was not an intent of the movie nor the book on which it was based.  But such statements as implying that the Gnostic sects portrayed Jesus Christ as more man than diety is the polar opposite of what those sects taught.  Gnostics, like many sects, saw the physical world as inherently evil and therefore tended to argue that Jesus could not have been a physical man at all - or that his physical nature was subdued by his spiritual nature in some way.  Quite contrary to the theory of the Da Vinci Code protagonists.  That one inaccuracy alone should be sufficient to demonstrate the questionable theories some have claimed for the movie and the book.  It cannot be taken seriously as an historical treatise of any kind but it can be accepted as entertaining action adventure.  Those who aspire to or hate the theories of the protagonists perhaps take movies too seriously.  Sufficient is the statement that much false history is espoused by many with their own agenda as their sole guide to truth - as with everything else, do your own thinking and do not take movies or popular fiction too seriously.</p></body></html>

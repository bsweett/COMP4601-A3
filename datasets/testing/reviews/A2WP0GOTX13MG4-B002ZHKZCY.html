<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie, but More of the Same"></head><body><p>'The Bourne Supremacy' follows the life of Jason Bourne after the events of the preceeding movie 'The Bourne Identity.'  Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, and his girlfriend Marie, played by Franka Potente, have moved around the world to keep away from Jason's past.  They've run to India, and the past they tried so hard to avoid has caught up with them.  Suddenly, Jason is thrown back into the life of a covert operative that he has tried so desperately to get away from....<br /><br />This movie is good but flawed.  Amongst its strengths are a strong ensemble and good acting.  Matt Damon has nailed this character.  Bourne doesn't look like a guy capable of espionage or assasination, and that is partly due to Damon's portrayal.  He pulls it off beautifully.  Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Joan Allen also contribute admirable performances to the movie.<br /><br />Another strength are the tactics employed by Bourne.  The character is built up to be a resourceful assasination, and this portrayal is made convincing by having Bourne do clever and resourceful things.  For instance, watch how he tracks down Joan Allen's character, or how he baits the CIA into putting their men right where he wants them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie has its pitfalls.  First off, 'Supremacy' feels almost more like a remake of 'Identity' than it does its own film.  The amnesia subplot predominates this movie in the same exact way that it did the first.  Jason knows he did something, is not sure what, but it has covert operatives chasing him.  Sound familiar?  It should if you have seen the first film.<br /><br />Second, the timing of the plot.  The first half of the movie rolls along nicely.  The plot develops and when it is not developing, there are well placed action scenes demonstrating Jason's combat prowess and his resourcefulness.  However, after that, the second half of the movie is really just Jason marching towards the conclusion, which would be fine if it weren't for the third problem...<br /><br />The third problem is the much maligned camera work.  The action scenes in this movie were really pretty good.  At least the ones that were coherently filmed were.  It seems the the film was shot using hand held cameras that were operated by camera men running to keep up with the actors.  Frequently, the action becomes indistinguishable.  The point is, the action scenes were good enough that they didn't need this primitive filming style to make them more exciting.<br /><br />All in all its a decent film.  I liked some of the action better than in the first film.  However, the story of the first film was better.  The DVD has plenty of bonus features for the enthusiast.  I'd recommend this movie to fans of the first film, and as a rental to those that like spy thrillers and action movies.  I'll catch it again if it comes on cable, but I'm not adding it to my collection.</p></body></html>

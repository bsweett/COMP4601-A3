<meta name="summary" content=""All Work And No Play Makes Jack A Dull Boy....""></head><body><p>Okay, there has been much debate over this film because of how it doesn't exactly ring true to Stephen King's book. I think it's just as good either way. King should be happy. This is one of the better film adaptions of his books(the other good ones being "Stand By Me" and "Misery"). Jack Nicholson stars as family man Jack Torrance. He gets a job as a caretaker for a large hotel that's closed for winter. He brings his wife and young son along with. The eerie hotel is filled with possessive spirits. Little by little, day by day, Jack begins to go mad as the spirits start to take him over and turn him into a crazy, murderous psychopath, who turns on his family. Sound scary?. It is. There's nothing scarier than when something evil is after you and there is no escape. You can run, but you can't hide. The actors are over the top brilliant. Nicholson. What can I say?. He is one of the greatest legends we have. This is one dandy of a teriffic, classic performance. Nobody else could have done this role. NOBODY. He is creepy and mad, and will get under your skin. There are a few classic(and often hilarious)lines and scenes here. Nicholson delivers them in a pitch perfect portrayal of a normal guy driven to insanity. Shelley Duvall, as his victimized wife, is very effective as well. Director Stanley Kubrick really filmed this classic very well. Establishing the hotel and it's creepy inside was filmed just right. It's long, empty, silent corridors and rooms. Oh lord. It's scary just thinking about it. Some people have problems with the movie. That is too bad. Some others think Nicholson's performance was pure ham and was really overacting. Some times, people, what seems like ham and overacting is what's best. It's acting. Some people don't understand that. All in all, this is a good, well made movie. A classic!.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The horrors of 9/11"></head><body><p>This movie traces the story of two Port Authority Policemen, played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, who attempt to rescue survivors of 9/11 at the World Trade Center.  After they enter the building, it collapses and they are trapped in the rubble.  They talk to each other to keep up their courage, but it is evident that they are badly injured.  The movie shows flashbacks of the men and their families and also shows the agony their wives are going through as they wait for word of their husbands.  The script never properly develops the two main characters in the viewer's mind and this detracts from the overall emotional impact which the movie could have had.  However, the movie does have merit and it serves as a tribute to those who risked and lost their lives in this tragedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Old classic still worth watching"></head><body><p>I found this film tremendously entertaining and even enthralling when I first saw it as a teenager. It's held up surprisingly well for me over the years, and not all for nostalgic and sentimental reasons. The movie combines many intriguing themes and elements--the mystery of an advanced but vanished race, attacks by an unseen force, some very cool special effects, the ravishing Ann Francis, and considering it was "just" a low budget B movie, a pretty stellar cast with Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielson, and as I said Ann Francis--to produce one of the great B sci-fi movies of the period, and one which really transcends the modest pretentions of that oft-maligned genre. And last but not least, the scene with the I.Q. measuring machine even pokes fun at the captain. :-)<br /><br />Then there was Robbie the robot, who went on to appear in several other venues (including a very corny Lost in Space episode some years later, but I guess Robbie's career was on the skids by that time :-)). The movie's climax is exciting as well as different from the other sci-fi movies of the day, but I won't say anything further on that so as not to provide any spoilers, except to say that it had more do to with inner space than outer space. And finally, the energy ray gun and the flying saucer spaceship are two very cool special effects. All in all still a great classic from the golden age of B science fiction movies and still worth watching today.</p></body></html>

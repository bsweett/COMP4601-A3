<meta name="summary" content="Witty Adult Relationships, with Betrayal and Entanglements"></head><body><p>The Closer is a witty unconventional drama of betrayal and romance.  Why do people cheat and risk losing their true love?  It also delves into how much one can really know their closest companion and whether they are always strangers.<br /><br />The film is directed by Mike Nichols and is a story of four people, initially strangers. He does a fabulous job of illuminating how much one can really know about the person they love.  A complicated set of relationships showing fidelity and cheating are examined.<br /><br />The characters are Dan (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), Larry (Clive Owen), and Anna (Julia Roberts).  Dan writes obituaries, Alice is a stripper, Anna is a photographer and Larry is a dermatologist.<br /><br />The movie jumps from first meetings to humorous and sometimes raw honesty in their entangled lives.  The script is adult, edgy, and humorous.  The actors do the script justice and the story holds throughout.</p></body></html>

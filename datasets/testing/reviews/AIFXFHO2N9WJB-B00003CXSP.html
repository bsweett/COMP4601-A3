Thankfully, Hollywood showed restraint and instead of trying to write a sequel based on characters created by terrific psychological/suspense writer, Thomas Harris, and risking the destruction of a franchise, the sequel would not be put to film until writer Thomas Harris finished writing the sequel, "Hannibal".  By waiting Hollywood and MGM Studios were given a terrific starting point for their screenplay, this one taken directly from the creator's head instead of merely guessing what the author had in mind for the further crimes of Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter.<br /><br />"Hannibal" is set approximately 10 years after the events of "The Silence of the Lambs", Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is still on the FBI's most wanted list, but continues to flourish in Europe under an assumed name, while working as a musuem curator.  Sadly, FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore took the part after Jodie Foster chose not to return) has not had as successful of a career in the FBI as she had hoped.  In truth, after Lecter assisted Clarice in bringing the killer "Buffalo Bill" to justice in the last movie, she really hasn't had a really successful case, leaving many to wonder is Clarice Starling really FBI material or does she need the evil Dr. Lecter to assist her in solving crimes.  Lecter, it seems, is aware of Clarice's fall from FBI grace, and seeks to exploit this weakness by baiting Clarice to come after him in Europe.  Is Clarice only a few steps away from bringing one of the most notorious murderers of all time to justice, or merely a pawn in one of his twisted mind games?<br /><br />"Hannibal" delivered a sequel to audiences that gave both thrills and chills.  Though a different tone and type of a movie than "The Silence of the Lambs" which was more cerebral, "Hannibal" was made to be more of a chase movie, than a psychological game.  Many critics felt that this was where director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) messed up, he should have stuck to the cerebral side of the characters, or left the movie alone completely.  In my opinion this was a great way to end the story that was started in "The Silence of the Lambs" between Clarice and Hannibal.  This movie didn't need to be so intensely cerebral, because the previous film covered that angle, for this movie to succeed Clarice needed to take matters into her own hands and attempt to bring Hannibal to justice.  Where critics are wrong is in the fact that, though not as intensely psychological, Hannibal does play mind games throughout the movie in very intriguing and interesting ways, giving audiences enough story and drama to propel the chase onward, and keep them on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />One thing critics and audiences can agree on is that the acting is terrific in this film, as it has been throughout the entire series of films.  Anthony Hopkins shined once again as the psychotic Hannibal Lecter, and Julianne Moore filled the role of Clarice Starling in a very believable way, where Jodie Foster portrayed Clarice as a more naive, impressionable young cadet, Julianne delivered a colder, more world-weary agent of the FBI.  Though I missed Jodie Foster, I respect her decision to opt out of returning to a character that propelled her even farther into superstardom, but since she didn't feel the character was the same person she knew from "The Silence of the Lambs" she may not have done as good of a job interpreting Clarice for this movie, so it was probably a wise decision on her part after all.<br /><br />Overall, "Hannibal" is a great ending to what was started in "The Silence of the Lambs", though it's not as good as its predecessor, it still is an incredibly worthy sequel, and should not be missed.<br /><br />"Hannibal" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

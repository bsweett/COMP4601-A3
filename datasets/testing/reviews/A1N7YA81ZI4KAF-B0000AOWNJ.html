The central character, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) stumbles upon the tape while investigating the mysterious death of her niece and ends up watching it. Rachel must now hurry up and solve the mystery within the time period or she too will succumb to the videotapes murderous wrath.<br /><br />A remake of the Japanese hit "Ringu", this is probably the best horror movie of the last 10 years. It's no where near as entertaining or as frightening as some of the earlier classics but when compared to the numerous horror movie attrocities released from Hollywood within the last 10 years or so, fans of the genre should be thankful "The Ring" exists. It offers good performances from the ensemble cast (although the child star David Dorfman is rather charmless), an enigmatic storyline (although a tad bit confusing) and some effective visuals. I really like the fact that the film does not try to explain every little detail. It leaves alot to the viewers imagination. For instance, the origins of the "evil" is not fully explained so the viewer is left with several unanswered questions. Also interesting is the film's overall look. There is alot of grey skies and rain on display. The entire mood is dark, grey and depressingly gloomy adding to the overall tension and fear. The actors themselves have a constant blank stare on their scared faces adding to the film's tone.<br /><br />Let's not forget one of the key figures in "The Ring", the heinous, murderous "Samara". A one-of-a-kind, under-sized villian with a heart of stone and a mind full of vengeance. In "Ringu" the villian's face is never shown (only her eyes) and she does not speak. She remains a mysterious, silent, face-less character throughout the film. Not so in "The Ring". We not only get to clearly see the child monster but we get to hear her as well. There is a face to the plot's evil and despite this, it does not seem to diminish Samara's eerie hold over the audience.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this film is that it's far too long. The whole mystery could have been solved a good 25 minutes sooner. The film does drag quite a bit during the middle so patience is definately required. But considering "The Ring" is the best "fright" film Hollywood has given us in a very, very long time, it's a small price to pay.<br /><br />This disturbing little chiller is highly recommended. You might want to double your pleasure and follow it up with it's much inferior but still watchable sequel "The Ring Two".</p></body></html>

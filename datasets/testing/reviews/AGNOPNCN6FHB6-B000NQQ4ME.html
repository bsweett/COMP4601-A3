Why not come out of the closet my dearest Mel and just make a horror flick, all the elements did present well. Why bother with the diversionary costly landscape, which was breathtaking and single redeeming feature. The same plot, flute theme, final showdown, blood, gore, hatred inducing scenes, over and over again. YAWN!!! JagPaw, JagWar, JigSaw, SeeSaw, BigKflaw....</p></body></html>

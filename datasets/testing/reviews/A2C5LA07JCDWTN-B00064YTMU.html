Cruise plays his most vicious character to date as a hitman with absolutely no conscience. The best scene of Collateral has to be when Vincent's briefcase is jacked from Max's (Foxx) cab by a couple of street punks. Vincent just strolls out in time to see the kids walking off with his possession. He approaches them and has a gun put to his head, but in a split second the two young men are dead and Vincent has his briefcase back. Michael Mann tries way too hard to delve deep into character development for Max and Vincent when in fact all the audience really wants is to get an inside glimpse of Vincent's facinating lifestyle. The movie is about a half hour too long and the ending seems as if it was rewritten at least a half dozen times. The ultimate payoff in this film is certainly not worth the ride. Overall, Collateral is a marked step back for Michael Mann but a great expansion of range for Cruise. Recommended only to hardcore Cruise fans only.</p></body></html>

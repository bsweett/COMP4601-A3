<meta name="summary" content="nice and scary horror, but still the same old formula"></head><body><p>This film is OK:  there is a mystery, strange things happen with psychological realism, but you never lose your sense that it will be over in about 1.5 hours and the guy will survive it or not.  This is King's stock and trade and he does it extremely well, but after seeing the same kind of stuff for 30 years, I for one am yearning for something new, something that enters my imagination or fascinates (like, say, Polanski's Ninth Gate).  This most emphatically fails on the originality score, however strong Jackson and Cusack are, for they are truly fine actors.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly as background noise time waster.</p></body></html>

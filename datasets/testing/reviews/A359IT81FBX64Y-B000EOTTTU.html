<meta name="summary" content="Fiction!"></head><body><p>For any of you out there who care about getting the facts mostly right in a historical movie, this is a film to avoid. The "Making of The New World" portion of the DVD speaks about all the great care taken to make this film authentic. Actors learn to talk and move like Algonquins. Genuine wild turkey feathers are used. They build a replica of the fort. It's shot on location in Virginia. It's too bad they got everything right except the story.<br /><br />Just like Disney, Malick invents a love story out of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Q'orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas, even looks like the human version of the Disney Pocahontas. Pocahontas was only 12-years-old when she met John Smith. She looks like an 18-year-old siren in this film. There is no evidence that John Smith and Pocahontas felt anything more than respect and friendship for each other. At most, Pocahontas may have felt a young girl crush for the commanding presence of Smith, but even that is speculation. Since half the movie is devoted to the passionate romance between the two, this is a huge blunder.<br /><br />I could say much more about the other blunders, about John Smith and the Indians, Powhatan, the capture of Pocahontas, John Rolfe. Just about the whole story, actually. And it didn't help that Colin Farrell, playing John Smith, mumbled so many of his lines that I was forced to activate captions. Both Smith and Rolfe looked like love-struck puppies in the presence of Pocahontas. Talk about Jungle Fever!<br /><br />If you want to get the lowdown on what really happened at Jamestown, read Love and Hate in Jamestown by David Price. Take my word for it, the facts are more interesting than the fiction.</p></body></html>

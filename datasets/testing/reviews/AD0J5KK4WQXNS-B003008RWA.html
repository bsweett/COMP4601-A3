Anyone who has spent time with Moore's documentaries and heard the critics will realize in Sicko than the detractors have been semi-right all along, because when it comes to propaganda, Sicko maybe his most half-truths laden work to date... but he does do it well.<br /><br />With this ambulance it is impossible for the neigh Sayers to claim that Moore is balanced or impartial. Moore can take a topic like America's failing healthcare system and then push it so that Cuba is helping 911 rescue workers get medical care. Of course it is all mountains of misinformation built on hills of truth and we know that Cubans aren't getting what those 911 rescue workers got, so why do we watch him? Moore raises questions and does it in a way that makes his points interesting. If the same points were made in any other way it would scarcely raise an eyebrow, but Moore is capable of making something important that gets under our skin. He makes us think, and makes good arguments, even if it does mean we have to bare the hyper velocity spin, and does it go around and around at times.<br /><br />Sicko does make an important case. Capitalism at its most selfish kills. This is undeniable. The problem is has Moore sold America on a socialized healthcare system? The truth is that he does make a good case for it and seems to indicate that politicians took some nice pay checks not to endorse it. Sicko is absolutely fascinating stuff but Moore does test our gullibility.</p></body></html>

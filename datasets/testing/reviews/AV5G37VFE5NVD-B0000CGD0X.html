What could one possibly say about "Casablanca" that has not been said a million times by a million people or more?  Let me ask this: have you seen "Casablanca"?  If you have not, my friend, this writing cannot convey the strength with which I recommend that you purchase - not rent, purchase - this film immediately.  And if, for some reason, you should ask me why, I will tell you that "Casablanca" belongs in every person's cinematic library, because it is quite possibly the finest film ever released.<br /><br />The word "classic" applies to no film, NO FILM, not "Citizen Kane," not "The Godfather," none of these, so much as it applies to "Casablanca."  Every last scene is classic.  Every line is classic.  Everything about it is classic, not because it's an old film, but because it IS film.  "Casablanca" is the very embodiment of why movies are made, and it has all the elements of impeccable filmmaking.  You have a situation with which the audience can sympathize: a man's world is turned upside down when his long-lost love walks into his saloon.  The man is a classic example of the "tragic hero" who was so popular in 1940s and 50s cinema, particularly film noir: on the outside, he's a cynical, cold, wisecracking individual, but inside he's a kindhearted, courageous human being who can't help but do what's right.  That's why, when we discover that the object of his desire has a new man and loves him, we know that she should go off and live happily ever after with him, but we still root for her to wind up with our tragic hero.<br /><br />And no one plays the tragic hero like Humphrey Bogart.  One year earlier he'd delivered a knockout performance as just such a character in John Huston's "The Maltese Falcon," and two years later he'd play an identical character in Howard Hawks' "The Big Sleep" with future wife Lauren Bacall, but no one'll argue that Bogey never surpassed his performance as Rick in "Casablanca."  There's something about Humphrey Bogart that remains unexplained to this day, something that made him so powerful a leading man.  Perhaps it was his effortless cool, or total confidence, or his sour tongue, or maybe just that twinkle in his eyes.  Whatever it was, there has never been a leading man quite so charismatic as Bogart in "Casablanca."<br /><br />But a leading man is nothing without a leading lady, and so we have Ingrid Bergman, one of the screen's most dazzling beauties.  She was at her most dazzling in "Casablanca," another tragic character whose actions are as heartbreaking to the audience as they are to Rick, but in the end they're understandable and we sympathize.  Despite their charm, so many classic leading ladies just let the drama flow in their performances.  But not Bergman.  She put every fiber of her being into her performance, and she breathes so much humanity into the character of Ilse that we can't help but forgive her and sympathize.<br /><br />Equally important is the supporting cast.  It's amazing how vibrant each of the characters are, no matter how small or large their roles.  Claude Rains' character is particularly interesting: he walks the line between the good guys and the bad guys throughout the picture, sometimes swaying to one side and sometimes to the other, but we're never quite sure who's side he's on until the climax.  Rick's employees are just as charming as their boss, among them pianist Sam, played by Dooly Wilson, goodhearted waiter Carl (S.Z. Sakall), and wirey bartender Sascha (Leonid Kinskey).  Sydney Greenstreet, who also appeared with Bogart in "The Maltese Falcon," plays Rick's rival, Ferrari, described by Rick as "a fat hypocrite."  Conrad Veidt is the real villain of the picture, Nazi Major Strasser, and last but not least, Peter Lorre is the thug who sets the wheels in motion.<br /><br />So much of "Casablanca"'s appeal lies in its story and characters.  The story is timeless, romantic, and, of course, dramatic.  The setting is a character unto itself, a mangy hellhole stuck somewhere in the middle of the war, which so far has remained safe from enemy troops, but the promise of occupation grows stronger each day.  The grimness of the war is a powerful backdrop for Rick and Ilsa's love, the shining light through all the darkness.  In Darren Aronofsky's recent film "The Fountain," a character philosophizes, "Every shadow is threatened by the morning light."  That philosophy was cemented in "Casablanca," where good triumphs evil, and it will always triumph so long as people are willing to fight.  The film says that there is goodness in us all; some are destined to see this, and others are not.  In one scene, Rick asks a hero of the resistance, "Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?  I mean what you're fighting for."<br /><br />The resistance fighter replies, "You might as well question why we breathe.  If we stop breathing, we'll die.  If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die."<br /><br />Of course, Bogey cracks, "Well, what of it?  It'll be out of its misery."<br /><br />But the resistance man, the movie's "stalwart hero," knows better.  "You know how you sound, Mr. Blaine?" he asks.  "Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart."<br /><br />Heart is something this film has no shortage of - that and humanity.  "Casablanca" is as 'human' as film as ever there was.  And though lifelike characters have become a staple of modern dramatic cinema, so many characters in older films felt like just that: characters in a movie, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing for those films.  But the characters in "Casablanca" have a remarkably deep, realistic feel to them.  They each have a story to tell, a life of their own, human feelings, human desires.  Most importantly, they each have the urge to do good in the end, no matter their position in the world.<br /><br />The actual techniques employed in the film are resistant to any criticism whatsoever.  The songs composed for the movie, greats like "It Had to Be You" and, in particular, the (ironically) timeless "As Time Goes By," add so much emotion to the film.  The flashback sequence was possibly the first to ever figure prominently in a major motion picture, and it's one of the most strong and memorable scenes in the movie.  The editing is flawless - tight, concise, steady-paced, exactly what it should be.  Finally, the photography is beautiful.  Every shot is like a painting, a moment to be treasured forever and ever were it not instantly replaced by the next wonderful frame.<br /><br />In all these many, many years since the release of "Casablanca," it hasn't lost any of its power; in fact, as time goes by, the movie may actually become more powerful.  Certainly, no film has ever been more powerful than this, and none have ever been so bittersweetly perfect.  This is the crown jewel of artistic achievement.  This is why we have movies.  This is film.  This is life.  Whether it's the greatest film in history will always be the subject of much debate, but no sane person will deny that "Casablanca" is among the absolute finest masterworks of cinema.  "We'll always have Paris," Rick tells Ilsa in one of the film's signature scenes.  Until the end of time, cinema lovers will always have and treasure "Casablanca."</p></body></html>

It is an action-packed adventure with significant improvements compared to the prequel, Pitch Black:<br /><br />1) Vin Diezel talks much more in this movie; he has way more lines.<br /><br />2) There are better special effects, and<br /><br />3) Overall, it's a better plot.<br /><br />Nevertheless:<br /><br />1) There are still multiple gaps in the plot; though Dark Fury- The Chronicles of Riddick is the missing link between the two movies, there is very little information given about the Elementals and the mysterious religion of the Necromongers, thus leaving the audience in the dark.<br /><br />2) Riddick, surprisingly, gets his butt kicked left and right in Pitch Black by the "jock" bounty hunter, but in Chronicles there is this transformation that takes place and he becomes next to invincible.<br /><br />3) Another setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it), which is just average, and at times below average.<br /><br />In conclusion, the film will provide an evening's entertainment, though it's no masterpiece...</p></body></html>

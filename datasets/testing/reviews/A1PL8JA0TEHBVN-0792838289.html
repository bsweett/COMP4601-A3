<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE GREAT TOP THRILLERS!  FIRST-RATE IN EVERY WAY!!"></head><body><p>Wanna know why?<br />It has a great story that revolves around a group of men who were brainwashed into being killing machines and the attempt (from one of these men) to solve the puzzle of manipulation and assassination and put their lives back in order.<br />With a screenplay like that, you can't go wrong!!! Director Frankenheimer presents us with a deep study of manipulation vs. character. All the cast is dynamite. The cinematography is superb! The editing is unbelieveble (the dream scenes are a masterclass on film editing).<br />The music by David Amram is unforgetable as is sets the exact tone since the openning titles (the cd is available).<br />Being from a time when the curtain was made of iron, it is a bit dated, but time hasn't dimmed its power to impress us.<br />A multi-layered film that demands multiple viewings, as it deals with social and political paranoia, democracy, personal manipulation and the ultimate individual fight for happiness (which doesn't seem to exist).<p>The director's commentay gives us a lot of interesting information on how the film was made: cinematography, lenses, music, filming process, actors, etc.<p>Playing Solitaire will never be the same!</p></body></html>

What I do know is I've seen THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA several times, and I find it a clever and engaging comedy for two reasons:  Because Anne Hathaway is so absolutely delightful and because Meryl Streep is so absolutely good.<br /><br />Playing a New York newbie who's hired to be an assistant to an editor of a chic fashion magazine, Hathaway brings an innocent naivete that is appealing and genuine.  Plus she's easy on the eye; I find her to be one of the most beautiful actresses on the big screen today.  And then there's Meryl Streep as the beastly Miranda Priestly--the boss who won't take "No", or "I can't get that done" for an answer.  We've all had bosses from hell, but Miranda easily sets the bar as the most self-centered, diabolical, conniving--duplicitous.  And all the while, Streep plays this role in a soft-spoken manner; her Miranda may appear to be in control, but the volcano could erupt at any moment.  And is it ever fun to watch.<br /><br />Adrian Grenier, Stanley Tucci, and Simon Baker furnished the main male roles in this film, and none of them (count 'em) were interesting (okay, maybe Tucci's role as a frustrated fashion designer was a tad interesting); this, I think, was intentional.  THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a flick made for chicks.  Speaking of, I enjoyed Emily Blunt as the stressed other assistant willing in an instant to fall on her sword for Miranda; Blunt gets more than her fair share of funny scenes.  But she doesn't tell me what prada is.  But that's okay.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

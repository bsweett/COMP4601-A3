<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the box-office shows"></head><body><p>When I went to the theaters to see this movie I was expecting alot, since it had already earned a good sum of money. However that night I left the theaters disapointed. The reason I felt this way is because there was not a very good plot. I think the biggest reason why this movie made such a large sum of money is because of the special effects, all the transforming and Meghan Fox.<br />I thought there was good acting in this film but if there is not a very good plot good acting can only carry a film so far.</p></body></html>

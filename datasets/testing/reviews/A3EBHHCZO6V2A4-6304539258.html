<meta name="summary" content="A Science Fiction Classic-may the Force be with you!"></head><body><p>"Star Wars" stands as one of the breakthrough science fiction classics. George Lucas drew on timeless archetypes (thanks to his friendship with mythologist Joseph Campbell) to make an adventure for the ages. "Star Wars" has an outwardly simple story. Luke Skywalker,an orphan growing up on Tatooine with his aunt&uncle,wants to leave his homeworld and explore the cosmos. His grizzled mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi,leads him into an unexpected adventure. Little does Luke know what's in store for him. On the way,he meets up with the witty robots C3PO and R2D2,as well as the handsome smuggler Han Solo. Luke learns the ways of the Force, goes to rescue Princess Leia... and the rest is cinematic history.<br /><br />"Star Wars" succeeds not just because of its simple story (Lucas was daring in having it be in media res as "Episode Four") and astounding special effects,but because of its talented actors. Alec Guinness achieved cinematic immortality as Luke's cranky mentor. Carrie Fisher is spunky as Princess Leia. Peter Cushing is appropriately menacing as the Grand Moff Tarkin. James Earl Jones voices Darth Vader,giving him a diabolical screen presence. Finally, Harrison Ford is appealing as the swaggering,sexy anti-hero/heroic smuggler Han Solo. Needless to say,Han Solo was my first screen crush. Unfortunately,the original Star Wars trilogy is all about Luke's Hero's Journey,and Han is a supporting character. No director's cut can make the trilogy All About How Han Saved the Universe and Won Princess Leia's Heart.<br /><br />"Star Wars" has staying power. Nearly 3 decades later,it's still a fun popcorn classic. Once,in a galaxy,long long ago.....</p></body></html>

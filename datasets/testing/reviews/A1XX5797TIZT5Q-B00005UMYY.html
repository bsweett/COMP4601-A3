Most filmmakers playing with form -- in narrative or visual presentation -- find it difficult to marry the experiments they want to conduct with a compelling story.  Memento writer/director Christopher Nolan flies out from among his competition by finding a story which by nature demands an unconventional narrative approach, making Memento the four-aces masterpiece it is.<p>The amazing thing is that Nolan makes you hang on to a story in which you find out the ultimate outcome of the plot in the very beginning.  Memento, however, makes you care about *how* something happened, the cause of the effects, and somehow manages to generate suspense even though you're watching events unfold backwards.  An astonishing writing feat.  The actors do a terrific job -- Guy Pearce wisely holds himself back and delivers a low-key, simmering performance and a deadpan voice-over job that are instantly winning; Carrie-Anne Moss continues to make smart choices in edgy roles, not content to milk her sex-symbol status; Joe Pantoliano's smarmy charisma comes through yet again as he chomps lines with gusto, coming out with some of the funniest moments in the film.  Nolan mines the central conceit of a character with no short-term memory for fresh comedic moments, and this also helps keep your attention even if you might sometimes get lost in its complicated plot.  And of course, the bounty of story twists and revelations make this movie a terrific rewatch experience.<p>One of the best films of 2001, and certainly the most original.</p></body></html>

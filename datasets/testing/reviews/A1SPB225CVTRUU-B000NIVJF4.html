<meta name="summary" content="What a MONSTROUS character, what a performance!!!"></head><body><p>I actually went to see The Last King of Scotland at the cinemas right after Pan's Labyrinth. I found that while this movie is a bit slow-paced, it's totally character driven and the acting from Forest Whitaker is so powerful. He's portrayal of the monstrous and deceptive president of Uganda is right on the money. I just hated his character so much and it was so hard to watch this movie for that reason, but his performance is so captivating that it was no suprise that he took home the Oscar. I also like James McAvory very much, though he's obviously upstaged by Whitaker effortlessly. Kerry Washington was very convincing as one of the wives whose infidelity caused her a tragic ending. I was rather surprised that Gillian Anderson was welling to do this movie, considered that she had to look so pedestrian and her role is minimalistic and too little screentime. There is some very disturbing killing and torture scenes that might be a bit like Hostel or Saw....</p></body></html>

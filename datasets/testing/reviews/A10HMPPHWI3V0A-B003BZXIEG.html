<meta name="summary" content="Good, Summer Blockbuster Hit"></head><body><p>I have been an X-men fan for a long time and after seeing "The Last Stand" I have to admit that I was 100% entertained, this film is no oscar movie but really it's not made to be, it's made to entertain summer movieveiwers..., those of you who enjoy action as well as a few outlandish ideas and concepts will have alot of fun with X3.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman returns as the tough bladed-beast "Wolverine", he brings along the usual gang with him as well, such as Halle Berry playing the weather controlling "Storm", the Metal controller "Magneto" or "Eric", as well as a few more ("Iceman", "Pyro", Jean, Professor Xaveir, "Mystique" & Rouge), the cast throughout the movie fails to let down the audience with the unique and powerful mutant abilitys.<br /><br />Though you do get the feel (from the film, other than the end...) that 'The Last Stand" is the last installment of the X-men series you are most definatly misled, Ralph Winter, 1 of 3 of the Producers of "The Last Stand" has said to Entertainment Weekly that "This is not the last movie, there are a lot more stories. There's a wealth of charactors, we tried to fit "Angel" into three movies and as you know this is the first time we got him in!" ..... So as you can see ... dont worry there will be many more X-Men films for you to enjoy in the future!<br /><br />So as a whole this was a really fun ride that with held by far the best special-effects of the series BUT, I cant lie and tell you that this movie is great or even as good as the first film (it is better than the 2nd..) because it really isnt, the story line is actually quite basic, the acting as I am sure you guessed is most definatly up to par and the direction overall is decent if not better, "The Last Stand" is truly a smart, fun and cool way to start off you movie watching summer!<br /><br />P.S. By the way I just saw the numbers for what the film made on its opening weekend - it made a huge amount of just over 120,000,000$ dollars! that puts it on pace to easily pass all the other suppossed summer Box Office Hits such as, Mission Impossible 3, The Da Vinci Code, Over the Hedge & Poseidon!<br /><br />Overall: B</p></body></html>

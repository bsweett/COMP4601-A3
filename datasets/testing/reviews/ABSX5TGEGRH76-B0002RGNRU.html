<meta name="summary" content="Will Make A Lasting Impression"></head><body><p>This movie is definitely something new; it was produced by Focus Features, which tends to focus on films that are very anti-Hollywood in the sense that they are definitely not for everyone.  This film, along with Lost in Translation (another Focus movie), appeal to certain people, while others may not understand the content or simply find it boring.  This film also requires the viewer to think, which is a trait that many big studio films severely lack lately.<br /><br />The story centers around Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a quiet introvert who, while constantly making negative observations toward the world, never does anything to better his situation in life.  That is until one day, for no reason at all, he skips out on work and goes to the beach, despite the fact that it's February.  While there, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), who is Joel's polar opposite.  She's a free spirit with a bit of a drinking problem, and she and Joel fall in love.  After a messy relationship, Clem decides to have her memories of Joel erased.  Joel finds about this, and, out of a combination of depression and suppressed rage, he decides to have her erased from his memories.  He goes to this clinic run by a Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his unprofessional staff.  While his staffers Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) get drunk, stoned, and naked while working on Joel, he subconsciously decides that he no longer wants to erase her after he is forced to remember all the good memories he made with Clementine.  He then proceeds to "hide" his mental Clem in other memories where she doesn't belong, which creates some pretty funny results.<br /><br />For such a difficult concept, writer Charlie Kauffman did a very good job keeping things from getting too confusing.  Not only that, but he was also able to create a great twist to the whole thing.<br /><br />As I said earlier, this movie is not for everyone.  I did like it, but it was bizzare and a little trippy in some places.  This will make a very good rental, especially if you are unsure as to whether or not you will like it.</p></body></html>

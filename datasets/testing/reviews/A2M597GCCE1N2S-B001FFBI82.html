I personally liked the acting and how Jamie Foxx once again shined in a movie plus Jake Gyllenhaal showed he can act in almost any role convincingly. [Although I don't think I should remind any of you about Bubble Boy] This is one story about a man who joined the army, suffers some intensive training, and whose war lasts a mere four days and doesn't even have a chance to fire his rifle.<br /><br />Anthony Swoff [Gyllenhaal] is a young man who joins the Marines back in the first Gulf War. He leaves behind a young girlfriend to become a sniper, one of the best the Marines have to offer. He is joined by Staff Seargant Sykes [Jamie Foxx] who is a no nonsense, "Marine for life" man who wants no bullsh*t from anyone and is as tough as he is passionate about being a Marine.<br /><br /> After surviving live fire obstacle courses, scouting and learning how to judge distances with nothing more than the knowledge of the lengths of football fields, and even having to play musical instruments looking like a fool in front of his fellow marines with nothing more than his vocal cords, Swoff survives and becomes a sniper. A few weeks later the war starts and Swoff is sent off to prepare for an attack in Iraq.<br /><br />What was one unique aspect of the movie was seeing how different numbers of troops in the war steadily grew as another day passed. In the beginning it said, "Time in desert - 14 minutes. Troops in desert - 5,000." Then 3 months later it would say, "Time in desert - 93 days. Troops in desert - 100,000." Meanwhile Swoff and his friends are left to camp in their base with nothing more to do than talk about anything and everthing to keep from being bored.<br /><br />Whether it's talking about every girlfriend they ever had, to talking about different religions they believe in, and even holding a fighting ring for wild scorpions they caught, the marines desperately wait for the chance to get the word to head into fighing.<br /><br />This movie shows mostly the horrors about war including after finally getting the word to go into Iraq, Swoff and his men find a bombed out area of cars and bodies of people while patrolling along the deserts. There is even a tense moment after an altercation with several men on camels who can't be indentified as hostiles or not.<br /><br />This is one movie that you should definately check out if you want to see great acting as each character shines in their own way. Plus there is a great bonfire party scene after the men get the word that they are going home and everyone fires their guns into the air.<br /><br />Extras of the DVD:<br /><br />Deleted scenes<br /><br />Showing the interviews shown in the movie in their entirety<br /><br />plus subtitles and more!<br /><br />Definately rent this to check out. I'm not going to highly recommend this movie because I don't want you wasting your money and thinking you should have bought "Black Hawk Down" or something. I rented this movie and decided it was worth keeping. But I do recommend renting this to see at least once.</p></body></html>

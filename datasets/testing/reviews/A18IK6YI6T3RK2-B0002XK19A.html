<meta name="summary" content="DOC OCK ROCKS"></head><body><p>This is one of the few times that the sequel out shines the original.  Alfred Molina gives a great performance as Doc Octopus and the special effects are simply amazing.  Frankly, Im not a huge fan of Maquire, but his bug eyed nerdiness works ok as Peter Parker, but as a fan of Spiderman when i was a kid, i really imagined Peter Parker as hotter than Mr. Maguire, I mean a nerd can be sexy, right?..well, Maguire keeps threatening to quit the series, so maybe we will get a hot peter parker for #4, anyway, this movie works on all levels, and i was in awe of the special effects.  If you liked the first Spideman, you will love this one..and if you didnt like the first one..give this one a try, it's better and i just saw the third one..and i liked it...Topher Grace is good as Venum, as is Church as Sandman, special effects rocked as usual and Maguire, though dorky as ever, was very funny in parts, but im still not sold on him as Peter Parker, im surprised his eyes dont bug out of his head.</p></body></html>

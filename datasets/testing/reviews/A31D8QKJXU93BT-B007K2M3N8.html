<meta name="summary" content="The Singing Detective"></head><body><p>Director, producer, writer and star Kevin Spacey has made the movie he wanted to make about the 1960s nightclub and recording artist who got nominated for an Oscar and died young, leaving behind a movie star wife (the recently deceased Sandra Dee) and a son. Spacey clearly is responsible for what is wrong with this picture and what little is right. One of many 2004 biopics, it didn't impress critics or audiences and, after watching this new DVD release, no one will wonder why.<br /><br />Spacey catches the impatience that drove Darin to achieve success and the pathos of the popularity that was soon to wane. The tribulations of his parentage, marriage and evolving personality, with its later preocupation with politics, give weight to the narrative, and the show biz period detail seems authentic. The production numbers are borne of Dennis Potter's "Pennies From Heaven" and "The Singing Detective," and they are sometimes diverting.<br /><br />Spacey is too old to play the role and too ordinary a singer (it's his own voice) to snap his fingers with Darin's brio. Moreover, telling his story within a story of the singer seeking his identify in tandem with himself as a child, all told inside the conceit of filming a biopic about Darin, is needlessly confusing. The child playing the boy is a comer, however, and such dependable actors as John Goodman, Bob Hoskins, Brenda Blethyn and an urecognizable Greta Scacchi do manage to register.<br /><br />Spacey gets credit for attempting to capture a person in a period that still resonates with its take on the folly in Vietnam reflecting the current folly in Iraq. Yet any  sympathy for the real Darin and his troubled family does not emerge from the fantasy script or the performances. The potential for a better picture is there. "Beyond the Sea" is simply beyond the efforts of everyone involved in what essentially is a vanity project.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Denzel's best, and a worthy blu-ray"></head><body><p>4.6 stars<br /><br />Having seen this a half dozen times over the last decade, it just keeps getting better, entirely due to Washington's dead-on turn as the nastiest villain around, who just happens to be a cop. What are the odds?<br /><br />Hawke is decent and a solid foil, but this one is all Denzel all the time. His diner scene is so amazingly edgy, and funny in all the wrong ways, as are so many others here. He sells this guy to perfection, or whatever the opposite of that is. Along with a fine script that's all too believable, and some tight direction, he takes this flick into places few Hollywood movies dare go. Hawke's Serpico Jr. is at his best in the kitchen/bathtub scene, a true classic; those are some good bad guys, ese.<br /><br />The blu-ray features a good transfer and a nice little doc on the film as well as 12 minutes of occasionally great deleted scenes, a few of which should have stayed in the movie, the beer scene especially. Also included is a crisp commentary by director Fuqua that answers lots of questions, and poses a few more.<br /><br />The only niggles in Training Day are a few weak continuity moments, like the three bullet holes in the back window. So where'd they exit? They all missed the two guysin front, and also didn't go out the front window after leaving one inch entry holes? In a film this real-feeling, stuff like that dulls the edge. But just a bit.<br /><br />Denzel is a great good guy, we all know that. But here he's also one of cinema's best bad guys. And while we all want Luke to win, let's face it: Darth is more fun to watch!</p></body></html>

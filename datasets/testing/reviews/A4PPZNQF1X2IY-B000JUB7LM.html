<meta name="summary" content="Good, but heavily over-rated movie"></head><body><p>I was enthusiastic about renting this movie, but the realization<br />was less original or provoking than I thought.  First of all, the movie is good, and Clint and Morgan are great as they almost always are.  Here are the problems.  The boxing story is not original, it is essentially the Rocky story until after the climax. Also, the dialogue, although good, is over-the-top or just trying too hard sometimes, especially the voice over, which tries to heighten the circumstances or make things profound, but often comes off more artificial than natural.<br />I also thought the returned letters were straight out of Forest Gump, another thing that struck me as unoriginal.  Also, the lighting, which is strong and sometimes breath-taking, often is done at the expense of the story.  For instance the car ride scene, has very interesting (although unnatural) effects, but to such an extent that one hardly pays attention to what is spoken. Also, it's not very plausible that Clint, in a dirty old inner city gym, gets not one but two talented atheletes that get title shots.  Worse than that, the climax scene with the dirty boxer isn't even plausible, there is no way she is sanctioned to fight and especially not allowed to continue her match after the violations that occur.  It was more like WWF than boxing. The whole ending was touching I guess, but nothing remarkable.  Also, the red neck stereotype was overdone, and Swank's whole relation with her family was summed up in cute soundbites. Although it is a fine movie with some brilliant flourishes, it is too standard and flawed to be considered great in any sense.</p></body></html>

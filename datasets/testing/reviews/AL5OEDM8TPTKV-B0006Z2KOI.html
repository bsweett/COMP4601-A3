<meta name="summary" content="The Dance of Latin America"></head><body><p>There is something about being on the road with your best friend, a motorcycle, and thousands of kilometers ahead of you. Of course, to start the trip, you would never think it would be the stuff of change, but alas, meeting people from all walks of life would dare to tempt your thoughts, expose you to more than you thought, and expand a world before you. Such was the journey of Ernesto and Alberto, two young doctors in search of wine, women, and song, and end up finding a world in need. Such is the amaingly quiet and stunning film "The Motorcycle Diaries".<br /><br />Here we have two impressionable lads, who dare to set out on a journey around South America, and in turn, find much more than they bargained for. In order to reach a leper colony where they hope to spend some time, Ernesto and Alberto use a motorcycle, fondly dubbed "The Mighty One". Leaving Buenos Aries, they seemingly run into everything along the road, including, rather enjoyably, a cow. However, soon, when the motorcycle is history, and the two must set out on their feet, the reality of the hardships of people in the world come to them, and they experience it firsthand. While the experiences are shared between the two, it is Ernesto, who will become the infamous Cuban revolutionary Che, who takes these people to his heart and it profoundly begins to work his thinking.<br /><br />This film can rightfully be called half of a two buddies on the road picture, with the other half being a picture of great social commentary. Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is amazing as Ernesto. His depth of feeling as an actor penetrates every cel of this film, and his performance is Oscar worthy. Equally worth is Rodrigo De la Serna's performance as the heavy (?) Alberto, who plays perfect accompaniment to Gael. When Ernesto becomes embroiled in his thoughts, Rodrigo carries the audience with him until the end in tremendous fashion.<br /><br />One thing about this movie will haunt me for years. The filmmakers decided, towards the end of the movie, to film the different people's of Latin America in black and white, almost as if their pictures are being taken. They gaze into the camera, almost expressionless, but it causes us, who watch this film in our comfortable living rooms, with well stocked refrigerators, to remember the world out there, and that we are a part of it as is everyone; that if Ernesto learned anything on this monumental trip through South America, it was, we need to watch out for each other. The stares of those people are a constant reminder of that.</p></body></html>

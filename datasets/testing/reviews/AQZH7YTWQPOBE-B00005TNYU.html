<meta name="summary" content="Corny in a cute sort of way"></head><body><p>I don't think I've ever seen a movie so corny yet so cute at the same time. Despite the 1980s special effects and acting, there's a certain charm to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J09W">The Goonies</a>. It's largely from the energy of the kids - led by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VL0K2">The Lord Of The Rings</a>'s Sean Astin. The kids are loud - sometimes too loud - but they're also adorable. The movie follows them along on their quest for lost treasure - and maturity. This is a great adventure movie for kids (although Sloth might be a bit scary).</p></body></html>

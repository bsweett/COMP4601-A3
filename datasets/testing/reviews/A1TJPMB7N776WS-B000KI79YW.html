And the movie that surrounds him is pretty good, also.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" is fast paced thriller about Garrison, his once best friend, fellow agent  David Breckinridge (a "24"-ish Keifer Sutherland), First Lady Sarah Ballentine (an at first tentative, then reactive and proactive Kim Basinger) and a plot, thought to be the work of a Secret Service Agent, to assassinate the President of the USA.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" rises or falls on Douglas' performance and he does his very best to keep us interested and he succeeds much of the time. Add to this the sharp, aware direction of Clark Johnson ("Swat") and "The Sentinel" adds up to good, intelligent entertainment.</p></body></html>

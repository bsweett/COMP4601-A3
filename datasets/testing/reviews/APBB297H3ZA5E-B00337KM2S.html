<meta name="summary" content="Unexpectedly very very good"></head><body><p>1.  I'm neutral on George Clooney and definitely on the romantic comedy genre and thus wasn't expecting much from this movie.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.  However it's advertised as, this movie really defies categorization: it's very intelligently made, excellent writing, excellent acting, it's about relationships but not really a romantic comedy, but it's not an overtly deep and philosophical movie as well... It's really a movie about life.<br /><br />2.  Thank goodness there are folks out there who still make movies the old fashion way--> good writing + good acting.  Well done and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

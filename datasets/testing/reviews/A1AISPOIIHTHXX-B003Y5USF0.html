<meta name="summary" content="A better disaster movie than you would think"></head><body><p>A lot of disaster movies tend to be sold around one thing: who's going to bite it and how grisly is it going to be? You don't go see Independence Day or Dante's Peak for compelling storylines and interesting characters, you go for carnage and mayhem and big action pieces. It's rough to say but it's kind of true, so it's odd that Twister doesn't have many onscreen deaths. It does have a lot of destruction and that's probably the main reason to see it. There is a lot of more development than most films but still, it's cool to watch.<br /><br />Tornado warning systems aren't very effective, especially since tornadoes can hit with little warning time so we have stormchasers who try to take more accurate scientific measurements and hopefully design a more advanced warning system. Only we are dealing with a tornado, an incredibly destructive weather phenomena. And it doesn't help when you have your ex-wife, your soon-to-be wife plus your archrival is around.<br /><br />It's always funny when you look back on effect shots and notice how much advancements have been made. Yes the effects are most impressive but also at times it looked a bit too CGI-y such as a huge tornado near the end or the debris that they pick up, such as trailers, tractors and barn roofs. But granted this is 10 years ago and it's certainly impressive to watch in action. It's also good that we don't get a whole lot of tornado stuff since it would become very boring and too same-y.<br /><br />The casting is quite spot-on and I never saw a weak link in the cast, although some people might have a couple. There's a bit of plotholes now and then(or else there's a whole bunch that I never caught since I'm not a science geek). The film does need a bigger special edition than we have since there's so much that documentaries can explain yet we get commentaries and a making-of, nothing too big. It's understandable since Twister is actually the first movie ever released on DVD but it has been 10 years.<br /><br />It's not dumb fun like Armageddon but it's at least likable and quite entertaining. Plus it's got flying cows and come on: how can you resist "I gotta go, we got cows!".</p></body></html>

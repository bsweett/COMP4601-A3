<meta name="summary" content="X-Men: The Last Stand"></head><body><p>Scientists have discovered a "cure" for the mutant gene.  Now, all mutants can choose to become a "normal" human.  Division rises amongst the mutant community.  Some see this as an opportunity to be something they always wanted to be.  Others, like Magneto (McKellan) see this as an attempt at racial cleansing.  While Professor X (Stewart) sits on the sidelines, Magneto rallies the troops to rise up against the cure and those who are pushing it.  The X-Men must stop Magneto before he causes too much damage, but a former ally has been raised from the ashes of her former self, and she may be the deciding factor in this war.<br /><br />This X-Men movie is the best yet.  Filled with action and an always timely storyline, it does not disappoint.  Story-wise, characters die, return from the dead, lose their powers, and are changed significantly before all is said and done.  This shake-up introduces doubt into who will survive the final battle, and ratchets up the stakes.  Director Brett Ratner is taking over the reins from Bryan Singer, who left this franchise for another ("Superman").  He proves that he is up to the challenge.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

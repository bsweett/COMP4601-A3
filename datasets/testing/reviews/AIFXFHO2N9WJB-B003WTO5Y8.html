Many things or people can evoke this emotion, many of the most popular movies of all time feature villains that provoke this emotion from their prey.  Darth Vader, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, but one of the names that will always evoke fear, and is a more realistic villain, is none other than Dr. Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter.  After the successful adaptation of Thomas Harris' first novel featuring the psychotic Lecter, "Red Dragon", though the first movie based on the novel was called "Manhunter", it was later remade with Anthony Hopkins in the title role in the movie "Red Dragon", it was really no big surprise that MGM began working on a film based on the second book by Thomas Harris featuring Lecter, "The Silence of the Lambs".<br /><br />"The Silence of the Lambs" takes place directly where the movie "Red Dragon" left off.  Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) had just finished helping Will Graham, the FBI agent who imprisoned him, catch the killer known as 'The Tooth Fairy'.  Now, Lecter is being visited by an FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who was sent by her superiors to interview Lecter, and hopefully gleam some insight from him about the motives of a new serial killer calling himself, 'Buffalo Bill'.  However, the only way Lecter will help Starling is if she will answer his questions in regards to her life.  But, the deeper Lecter probes , forcing Clarice to face demons long-since buried, the stronger the fascination Lecter has for Clarice grows.  Will Clarice and the FBI gain enough insight from Lecter to stop 'Buffalo Bill', or is Lecter merely using them to accomplish his own means?<br /><br />Terrific directing on behalf of Jonathan Demme, and outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, "The Silence of the Lambs" is by far one of the most shocking, suspenseful thrillers ever to be made.  Winning over both audiences and critics alike, "The Silence of the Lambs" earned every one of its 5 academy awards, including Best Picture.  If you are a fan of thrillers, or of the novels by Thomas Harris, or if you enjoyed "Red Dragon", then "The Silence of the Lambs" is definitely a must-see!<br /><br />"The Silence of the Lambs" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></body></html>

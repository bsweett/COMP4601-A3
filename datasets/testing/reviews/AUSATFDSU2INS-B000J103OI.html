Self-confident, good looking, they only fear one person: their boss. Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).<br /><br />Looking like some high fashion version of Cruella De Vil, Miranda is terryfing, ruthless, demanding and determined; qualities that made the most powerful woman in the bussines and thus, the most feared. She is the high-priestess of fashion; she doesn't follow the trends, she sets them.<br /><br />Into this merciless world enters the wide-eyed and geeky Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway). With Miranda always scarring off assistants, an opportunity has arisen to take an opportunity at the job "a million girls would kill for." Turns out Andy is not one of them, being one of the few women in New York who isn't aware of who Miranda is and her fearsome reputation. This refreshing confession, is enough to persuade Miranda to hire her.<br /><br />Taking her position behind Miranda's first assistant Emily (the wonderful Emily Blunt), Andy learns why her boss changes assistants like handbags. She also learns what is required to make it in the cut-throat fashion business, placing her personal life second to the needs of her boss. That and transforming her plain image into a wild fashionista.<br /><br />Based on the book of the same name by Lauren Weisberger, The Devil Wears Prada is a devilicious look at the high fashion industry. The brilliant Streep loses herself in the role of the satanic Miranda. But she also humanizes her, showing us bits of the real woman beneath the designer clothes. Miranda wields a great deal of power, and knows it, but she also knows exactly what price she has paid to be at the top of the fashion game. But as Andy notes, if Miranda were a man, no one would even question that; they'd just admire how successful she was at her job.<br /><br />There lies the truth buried deeply in the heart of Prada: the world of professional careers take a higher price from women than from men. A man can be a demanding boss, so long as he's great at what he does, and people will not only put up with it, but respect him for it. A woman like Miranda, on the other hand, is considered a "devil" for doing the same thing.</p></body></html>

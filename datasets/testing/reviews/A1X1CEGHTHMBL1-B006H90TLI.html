<meta name="summary" content="Relentless killer!"></head><body><p>While out hunting, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) spots a bunch of vehicles parked in the desert. What he has found is a drug deal gone bad. Multiple men are dead and one surviving man in a truck is near death. A blood trail leads away from the site and he tracks it down. A few miles away he finds a dead man leaning against the only tree in sight and he is clutching a large catalog case filled with over two million dollars.<br /><br />Moss takes the money home and hides it. Feeling bad for the dying man he returns to bring him water and is discovered by the drug ring's partners. What now begins is a continuing chase scene where they track down Moss to get their money back and to kill him. A hired professional hit man goes after him and he is a relentless killer who never gives up and will kill anybody in his way.<br />This is an excellent movie and the storyline follows the book very well. The roles of Sherriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and the killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) are very well portrayed and the direction of the movie is well done.<br /><br />I like Cormac McCarthy's novels and he is one of the finest writers of our time. This movie is very good but bloody. I recommend it to you but you should be aware it is violent!</p></body></html>

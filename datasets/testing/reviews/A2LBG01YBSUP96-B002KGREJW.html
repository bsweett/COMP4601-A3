<meta name="summary" content="not sure why this is loved"></head><body><p>life wellness guru wannabe (kinear) and his bill paying wife (collette) try to make ends meet.this wouldnt be interesting unless quirky kids/seniors join the mix.son has stopped speaking and is training to be an air force pilot while daughter is preparing to be a future beauty pageant winner under feisty grandfathers tutelage.throw in a suicidal gay uncle and the movie is off and running.<br /><br />less than typically pretty olive has been informed she is up for the little miss sunshine crown.problem is the family cant afford the trip to cali and the event has a deadline.everyone eventually comes to terms and pile in bus pictured on cover/posters.<br /><br />im still waiting for a movie to happen........ok,i guess the ''hook'' of this hohum dramedy is olives dance routine.to be honest,''beauty'' pageants are as useful as zippo lighters are to fish.some people need to be told in public they are physically attractive while being extremely shallow.they say they want world peace and to feed the hungry,blahblabblah through insta-seal grins.i have yet to hear/read of a ''winner'' doing anything in regards to helping anyone.anyway,kids looking like adult midgets is creepy and adults allowing this garbage to take place are even creepier.<br /><br />this movie was dull and will most likely be the next trendy thing.</p></body></html>

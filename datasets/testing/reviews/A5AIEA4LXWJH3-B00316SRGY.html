<meta name="summary" content="Great Video and Audio Quality"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video of this Blu-Ray is fantastic.  I didn't see any grain at all.  In fact, even when paused, the video is perfect, and without grain.  I give it 10 out of 10.  This movie must have been recorded digitally, instead of on film.  The audio is great also (Dolby TrueHD 5.1), but don't expect a lot of surround sound, since most of the movie is dialog.  The surround speakers do kick in when appropriate.</p></body></html>

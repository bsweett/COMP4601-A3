<meta name="summary" content="War is Patton"></head><body><p>Patton was the best war movie of the 70's.  This film deals with Patton's career during WWII.  It begins with his Africa campaign and takes it through Italy and ends in Germany at the conclusion of the WWII.<br /><br />This film shows both Patton's brilliance as a general and his flaws of as a man.  Patton's was a man of passion and was more interested in what was most effective than what was politically correct (as in office politics not social politics).  His career is shown against his good friend Omar Bradley's career.  Bradley followed the rules and advanced quickly and surpassed the maverick Patton.<br /><br />George C Scott was a leading actor on stage but until Patton he was only a featured performer in movies.  This raw performance made Scott the first choice for these types of roles in the future (but he was better at comedy!)<br /><br />Karl Malden was already a star and Oscar winner but his performance of the by the books general lead him to a successful TV sereies.<br /><br />This is a well made film and for many involved was their finest hour.  One thing most people who are into film music unanimously agree is that Jerry Goldsmith's score was one of the greatest film scores ever.<br /><br />This is a well balanced film and well made.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: Audio Essay on the Life of George Patton</p></body></html>

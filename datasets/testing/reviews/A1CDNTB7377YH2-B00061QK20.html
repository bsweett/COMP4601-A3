<meta name="summary" content="Best movie of the year!"></head><body><p>First off, this movie is way better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  The fact that it is based on a legend in China makes it even better.  Some of the most amazing directing and fight scenes I have ever seen.  The fighting is about 95% with swords (Kung Fu wasn't invented until many centuries later) but it is spectacular nonetheless.<br /><br />Jet Li is a warrior who supposedly has killed three assasins who were trying to kill the emperor.  As a reward, he is invited to the emperor's home (it is not really a palace but a big building) and allowed to approach the emperor within 10 paces (nobody else may come within 100 paces).<br /><br />He is given riches and must tell the tale how he disposed of the 3 assasins.  The tale is told 3 different ways.  Each time the director uses different colors.  First, yellow and red, then green, and finally white.  Each story is very different.  The tension builds to a highly climatic and unexpected ending.<br /><br />Not to be missed!</p></body></html>

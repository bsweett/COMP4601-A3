Also, it is very much about a father's relantionship with his son.  Tom Hanks is very effective as the Irish mob hitman.  You can truly believe he is this great family guy, but also that he is capable of doing such terrible things.  Paul Newman also is very good in his role as the boss.  Well crafted and directed.  Check out the original graphic novel of the same name by Max Allan Collins if you would like to see the differance from paper to screen.</p></body></html>

Now I consider myself to be quite the history buff but I'd never heard of Braddock prior to this film. After watching the movie, of course I wanted to know what part did Hollywood get wrong. Seems there's more WRONG with this movie than right.<br /><br />That having been said, this movie is still a great one. It tugs at the heart strings and teaches a great moral lesson. It's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight in the dog.<br /><br />If you watch this movie, enjoy it for what it is. A good movie with a great moral. If you want to learn about Jim Braddock, or any other boxer featured in the film, I highly recommend you research it through books. Even the encyclopedia.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie for factual information on J.J. Braddock or Max Baer or whomever. I can't say that enough. But the movie is well worth watching, so long as you don't put too much stock in Hollywood's respect of historical fact.</p></body></html>

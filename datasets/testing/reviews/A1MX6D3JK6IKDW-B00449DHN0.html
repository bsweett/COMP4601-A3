<meta name="summary" content="....."A "RHUBARB ON THE FIELD"...Red Barber"></head><body><p>It might take eons to review a debacle like this one.The period leading up to the NYC draft riots is not well known; suffice to say that the British-Irish tensions throughout the country running rampant is obviously depicted well in this film. But, where is the Chinese-British hatred, mentioned in passing? Better yet, what of the Irish- black confrontations? Secondly, the riot involving the 'priest and the'butcher' could easily have been used to conclude this abomination with the Irish forces victorious. That would have excluded DiCaprio and Diaz and allowed these bumbling, mercurial lovers to take a well needed vacation,helping Timmy and Lassie with their farm chores. Next, we have a cast of characters, too numerous to mention, all flying around the screen, distracting the viewer, a possible prelude to "Ocean's 13" 145 years in advance.On we go! Has anyone ever seen a slower paced film with rioting as a main focus? 167 minutes of film time that was originally scheduled for 239 minutes! This isn't cricket, old man! Summing up, if this movie really did receive as many award nominations as claimed, then I've been beamed into a parallel universe by James T. Kirk,fooling around on his control panel, in a stunt dreamed up by Allen Funt and Durwood Kirby.</p></body></html>

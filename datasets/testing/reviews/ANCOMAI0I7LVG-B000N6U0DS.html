<meta name="summary" content="Smith finally breaks through into the elite of actors and gives us as all something cheer about..."></head><body><p>Will Smith carries this film on his very sturdy shoulders and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has matured since his `Fresh Prince' days into a very fine actor.  His performance is layered, structured and intelligent, but amidst all of that he still comes across natural and refreshing, never forced or mechanical.  Every emotion runs through his blood effortlessly and full of believable conviction.  I've always been a fan of Smith, but here he returns to the brilliance he possessed in `Ali', coupling his on screen fire with heart and soul that transcends the meaningless boundary's of comic relief but that which leaves a deep rooted sense of character and warmth.  Smith disappears inside Christopher Gardener but he never loses himself, his charm and his commanding presence.<br /><br />`The Pursuit of Happyness' tells the true life story of Christopher Gardener, a family man who gets wrapped up in the wrong pyramid scheme and ends up broke and homeless.  His wife Linda, played by Thandie Newton, walks out on him he's left desolate and alone.  The love for his son Christopher, played brilliantly by Smith's own son Jaden, is what keeps Gardener holding on in pursuit of a better life.<br /><br />One thing that Christopher has going for him is potential.  He's a smart man with ambition and determination and so when he sees an opportunity to rise above himself through an internship with a law-firm he takes it despite the fact of no pay and he uses it to better himself and his surroundings.  Smith's wide range of emotions are what keeps this story compelling and entertaining, from his sadness and grief stricken situation to his cheerful demeanor he masquerades in for his sons sake to that emotional clap of relief as he realizes his dreams amidst a crowded sidewalk, Smith breaks down his own barriers and builds for himself a place alongside the acting giants of today.<br /><br />With pros there must also exist cons, and those cons appear in a few different forms.  The first form is that of co-star Thandie Newton who develops a bad habit of repelling the viewer.  Her character, while unsympathetic in general, is overly unsympathetic not to mention a tad-bit annoying, and that's putting it nicely.  Where's that girl I saw in `Crash' who stole the entire show from her co-stars, who electrified the screen and screamed "nominate me"?  She's lost albeit in a mess of a character who could have been so much more but turned out so much worse than anticipated.  The flow of the film is a bit choppy as well.  Some parts flow by effortlessly while others drag on and even get a bit redundant.  The director at times tries too hard to emphasize Gardeners destitute condition when that said condition is already made apparent enough for the average viewer.<br /><br />That said, there is still a lot of good to remember when recalling this film, and Will Smith's brilliant performance is reason enough to watch it at least once.  I also must mention Smith's young son Jaden who perfectly compliments his father's passion by effortlessly mastering his performance which is sympathetic, controlled and elegant, never over the top or exaggerated like it could have been.  He comes across as poised as his father and as at home in his performance as an actor who's been doing this all his life.  One day this young actor will reach the feats his father has, and with a beginning as strong as this one he may end up there sooner than later.  This story is one to be heard, and told as beautifully as it is here makes it easy on the ears.</p></body></html>

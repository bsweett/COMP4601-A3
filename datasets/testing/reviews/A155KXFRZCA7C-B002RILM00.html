<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Film - more like 3 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>Although I'm not necessarily a Nicolas Cage fan, this film which centers around Cage's character came across very well. I think the film is very well made and it stands on its own -- I wouldn't compare it to the original from a few decades ago. The story is about a missing child on an island up in the Pacific Northwest. The island is controlled by a weird cult which is lead/directed by women -- man other than Nic Cage don't speak in this film. Of course, if you know the ending, then some of the interesting surprises will be known and then this flick may not be as interesting. My wife liked the film very much and she would probably give it five stars.<br /><br />Well, the scenery and photography is really good, and also the mood was well captured. Acting is also pretty good and Cage comes across believable. Is this movie worth watching? Yeah, I think so and I didn't think that my few bucks or my time were waisted. True, my expectations were a little higher than the actual delivery, as especially toward the end the film lost a bit of its quality and it became almost cheesy. It's not a horror movie and I didn't have any goosebumps, but again the scenery and photography were very good. This is a different kind of film and because of the cult aspect it fits more into the late 60s/early 70s era than into the present.</p></body></html>

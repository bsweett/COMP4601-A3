They push the Andy Kaufman-type "Foreign Guy" bit farther than Kaufman ever did, and with uncomfortably funny results  [This does not take away from Kaufman's genius, though.  Kaufman is still in a class by himself].<br /><br />The dinner scene, the hotel room squabble, Borat dropping his suitcase to the sidewalk when he leaves the fratboys' RV (LISTEN for it), Borat's chuckling when a feminist tells him that women should be equal to men.... I was laughing so hard I got light-headed and feared I would pass out.  Thank god I saw this film less than a half-mile from a hospital.<br /><br />Can't wait for the DVD -- can't wait to see the stuff that DIDN'T make it into the film.  Don't know how the film crew kept a straight face during all that (they would have had to in order to maintain the charade).<br /><br />Take a date to this movie -- he/she will love you so much for it that you can go home afterwards and "make sexy time".<br /><br />Even the end credits are funny.</p></body></html>

My observation of the books selections is that a few of those movie I didn't really have to see but "Memento" is one that lived up to the billing.  I admit to being scepticle at first because it seemed that I was watching the movie backwards in sequences.  I wondered what kind of movie it would be since much of it was rerun scenes.  However, I realized that this was a unique movie that keeps the viewers guessing (although I can imagine that some may have taken it back to the video rental without watching the whole movie).  The retelling of the various scenes created impressions as well as doubts and that really came together at the end.  However, the ending was not typical either.  It left us wondering what is the reality.  Along the way there were at least two or three scenes where I had to double-check to see if what I saw was real or not.  "Memento" has a plot but it seems less important to the film than the twists and turns it takes us on.  In the end, I was pretty dazed by what I had seen but I knew it had been an exciting ride.  I suggest most people should watch "Memento" at least once (excepting small children and pregnant women).  I don't know that I will watch it again but I'm sure there are a lot of people who do watch it over and over.  I wouldn't be surprized to hear them say they see something new each time.</p></body></html>

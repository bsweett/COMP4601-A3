<meta name="summary" content="Ghostly Pirates in the Fog"></head><body><p>I originally saw "The Fog" in the theater, and remember being frightened in multiple places. John Carpenter managed to make a low budget picture scary using minimum special effects and a whole lot of fog. While fog has been used in other movies (I remember the attack of the werewolf in "Silver Bullet," where the werewolf attacked from the fog around his pursuers' feet), it was pervasive and thick, and the attacks came suddenly from the dense fog and yet the fog cleared enough to let you see the action.<br /><br />Antonio Bay is a small seaside town with a past. The past includes allowing a group of sailors to die on their ship. We know that this is a horror movie, and the dead rarely rest easy in their graves, particularly watery graves. When an eerie dense fog rolls over a ship, and there are thumps and bumps and suddenly the ship is unmanned, we know there is something wrong with the fog.<br /><br />We can also guess the fog will not stay out to see. As the intensity in the movie builds we see the fog roll in and the fog roll out, accompanying a great cast. John Houseman is spooky beach narrator Mr. Machen, sending chills through his audience as easily as he did his classes in "The Paper Chase." Janet Leigh is a town mover and shaker Kathy Williams and her indignation quickly changes to fear as she realizes the fog is outside her control and her experience. Jamie Lee Curtis is free spirit Elizabeth Solley, who seems to be a hands breadth from disaster for most of the movie. Hal Holbrook is Father Malone, a priest with psychological issues who feels like a martyr, intended or otherwise, from the time we first meet him. Tom Atkins plays Nick Castle, who fortunately takes into stride that evil ghosts are wandering around town with bad intent. Even John Carpenter makes an appearance.<br /><br />With all this talent, what more can you ask? How about Adrienne Barbeau as sultry Stevie Wayne, the voice of the local radio station who manages to put movie-goers into the right frame of mind as the fog rolls over the town and Stevie becomes an inadvertent Cassandra, heard only by those of us watching the movie. Ultimately I was clinging to the edge of my seat as Stevie Wayne tried to stay one step ahead of the fog and its evil.<br /><br />John Carpenter made "The Fog" in the style of horror movies of old. The movie relies on what you can barely see and the ever-present fog to build atmosphere rather than splattering blood and organs. The tension as the fog rolls into town and the bizarre events unroll builds until you think something has to happen, and John Carpenter keeps you guessing as to if and when throughout. Perhaps the best tension of all is when the fog rolls into Stevie Wayne's radio station and she frantically and fearfully tries her best to defend herself from the unknown.<br /><br />"The Fog" has its flaws, as do most movies of this type. However, I somehow manage to overlook them each time I watch because I get caught up in the characters and the story. There are few enough horror movies that are made in the style of "The Fog," and when one is made that makes you want to watch the movie a second or third time, you know it is a winner.</p></body></html>

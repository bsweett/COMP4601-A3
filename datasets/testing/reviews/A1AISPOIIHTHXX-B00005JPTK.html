It's one of those stories that seems ripe for re-interpretations and such a simple idea can bring with it a number of tries to get the story going. This version is probably one of the better ones but it's not perfect by any means and it's either the closest we'll get to a great adaptation or it's just not the right approach.<br /><br />Robert Neville is a military scientist trying to find the cure for a virus that wiped out nearly the entire world's population. Living in New York with his dog Sam, Robert spends his day renting videos in alphabetical order, chatting to mannequins he's set up and waiting at a pier in case people who hear his broadcast show up. But when the watch's alarm goes up, he heads back home before the sun goes down as strange sounds and creatures come out at night, leaving him to fend for himself while he tries to find a cure.<br /><br />The first hour or so is one of the more well executed parts in the entire film and you're on your way thinking this is going to be a great movie. But then Neville turns out to not be entirely alone and the film kind of dips into "eh" quality. The screenwriters (one being Akiva Goldsman who's responsible for the unholy mess that is Batman and Robin) manage to keep our interest entirely by showing the various ways you can keep busy in a desolated New York. It changes a couple of elements from the book that work a bit better and thanks to the visuals which show vegetation growing out of the pavement, cars all over the streets and even wildlife showing up now and then it becomes impressive how well it's keeping our attention.<br /><br />It's the last act which falls apart as it's not a bad idea storywise it's just handled improperly and starts with a couple scenes, involving Shrek and Bob Marley that fall completely on their face and they're just strange. Then of course there's the look of the creatures which, instead of taking the "guy in costume" approach, they're entirely computer-generated and they look so bad and practically PC quality that it's distracting.<br /><br />Best thing easily about the movie is Will Smith who shows what a lot of people knew all along: he's an incredibly charismatic and likable actor that makes it hard not to want to watch him. But being the only actor for a large chunk of the film was a feat some were curious about and he doesn't just ham it up either and gives an emotionally charged performance that shows he can act and films like Ali or the Pursuit of Happyness are not his only forum for breaking his "Fresh Prince" persona, usually seen in the blockbusters.<br /><br />Since it's probably the biggest DVD/Blu-Ray release this week, I'd have to recommend the film since everyone will want to see it but I'm not sure how many will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

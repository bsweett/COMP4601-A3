<meta name="summary" content="Average Adaptation to this Swedish Thriller"></head><body><p>I watched the original Swedish film The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (translated The Man Who Hated Women) and it's amazing, after reading the book fairly recently, to watch this foreign adaptation.<br /><br />The original book was Swedish so it's appropriately a Swedish production.  Rather than Blomkvist the disgraced journalist who was the womanizer during his hiring by the Vanger Group to write a bio of the Vanger family as a front and then do the actual work of trying to solve a 40 year old murder case -- the disappearance of Harriet Vanger -- it was quite a different film!<br /><br />It's tough not to compare the book to the film but I'm glad to have watched the film regardless.  Gone is the womanizing, the affair with the married publisher of the magazine Millennium and gone is the cover story to write a bio of the Vanger family.<br /><br />The film is uneven at times.  The whole sexual predator guardian of Lisbeth (the girl with those tattoos) was faithful to the book.  The book though delved deep into her other guardian who helped her out at every turn.  The film skipped all that.<br /><br />Enough fat was cut from the book to make a smooth running mystery film without a lot of back story into the Vanger family, into Lisbeth's life or the sexual antics of Blomkvist.  At the time, the film was uneven and made enough changes to create a mildly disappointing adaptation.<br /><br />Hitchcock could take a mystery book and put his own twist to give an even better adaptation than the book would have fathomed.  On the other end of the scale, the director for Watchmen was too slavish in attempting to film every last panel of the graphic novel rather than cut out anything.<br /><br />In The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I would have liked more back story regarding the Millennium, the media's zealous hunt for a story, the commentary on financial markets and journalists -- and the extreme cleverness of Lisbeth.<br /><br />So much entertainment, but so much missing.  Rental!<br /><br />The book was better:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454541">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a></p></body></html>

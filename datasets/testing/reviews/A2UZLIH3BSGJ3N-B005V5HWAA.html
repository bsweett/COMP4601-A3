<meta name="summary" content=""Mr. Smith, before I was the thumb print killer, I've killed lots of people lots of different ways ""></head><body><p>This by far is Kevin Costner's best film he has been in about 15 years. Costner plays "Mr. Brooks" who leads a double life. On the outside he is a successful businessman and loving family man, on the inside, he struggles with his addiction, his addiction to murder. For about two years he has been able to resist until he listens to his alter ego (played devilishly by William Hurt) to play again. He then goes into the apartment of a couple and proceeds to kill both of them.<br />The next day he is visited by Mr. Smith, who blackmails him to take him to his next killing. All the while he is being followed by a detective trying to solve the "thumb print murders" and juggles his personal life which is thrust into turmoil. His daughter "drops out of school" and is pregnant, but is that all of it? Soon he discovers she shares the same addiction and sickness as he does and out of compassion "fixes" her situation as well as his own predicament. What to do with and about Mr. Smith? Fulfilling his promise to Mr. Smith he takes him on his next job and decides he wants Mr. Smith to end his suffering and make him disappear, but is this the true end of Mr. brooks?<br />This one will keep you on your toes, on the edge of your seat and guessing until the end. I haven't personally seen a film executed this well in many years, by far the best Costner has done in a decade, and I wish he would do more films of this caliber more often. A great script, cast and great performances played deliciously by both Costner and Hurt. This one is not to be missed, and I promise you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

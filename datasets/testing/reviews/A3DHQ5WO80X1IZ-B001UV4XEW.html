I remember seeing 'Knocked Up' in a crowded theater in Chicago, and thought it was one of the funniest movies ever. But seeing it again at home, I thought it was okay, but not The Greatest Comedy of the Decade like it seemed in the packed movie house.<br /><br />'The Hangover', on the other hand, was just as funny when watched at home, and it didn't need a crowd to egg me on. I'm sitting in my basement and laughing uproaringly into an empty room! And not caring!!<br /><br />Basic premise - four guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party. They wake up, and no one remembers what happens, and the groom is missing. What follows is kind of 'Memento'-meets-Judd-Apatow-movie, as they try to trace the clues that will lead them to their friend. And don't even ask how Mike Tyson and a tiger get involved!</p></body></html>

I'm not one of those psycho DICAPRIO TITANIC fans or anything, in my opinion, the real star of TITANIC was JAMES CAMERON.  But, from the trailers, it looked like a snappy, snazzy hip little movie with SPIELBERG in charge.  Come on, it can't miss.<p>I think it did though.<p>It's nothing like it's trailer.  From the trailer, I was expecting IN LIKE FLINT, THE PINK PANTHER, JAMES BOND... something quick witted, colorful and frantic, but instead it was slow.  It had some snazzy parts.  In fact, it had some really good parts, but I couldn't help thinking that this movie was more suited for a CBS sunday movie or LIFETIME NETWORK.<p>Before seeing the movie, I was expecting to see an OSCAR contendor or something.  After seeing the movie, I will be really disappointed if it is.  In fact, now I'm thinking CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND is the real TRUE STORY movie to see.<p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a true story and it's an interesting story.  The acting is great.  I don't think anything different of DICAPRIO or HANKS.  They're both top notch performers.  In fact, if anybody deserves any acknowledgement in this movie, it's CHRIS WALKEN.  He's outstanding in it.  Maybe a best supporting actor here.  <p>Although, the movie was a let down, should have just waited for it to come out on video.  A good movie, but not what I expected and not the kind of movie I wanted to see.</p></body></html>

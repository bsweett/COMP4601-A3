<meta name="summary" content="The phone rings.  Colin Farrell picks it up.  Big mistake!"></head><body><p>Hang on to your seats folks.  Slip this 2002 film into your DVD player and you're in for a ride of a lifetime.  It kept me totally involved with my eyes glued to the screen for every one of its 88 minutes, which seemed to fly by in an instant.  Funny thing is that this is a simple film, with bascially only one scene and just a few excellent actors.  I loved it.<p>Colin Farrell is cast as a fast-talking publicist who we first meet on the streets of New York, doing elaborate deals and telling lies into his cell phone.  He's full of ego and thinks he's on top of the world.  However, every day at the same time, he stops into a phone booth to call a young actress who he is romancing.  She doesn't know he's married, and he doesn't tell her.  When he's ready to leave the booth, the phone rings.  He picks it up.  Big mistake.<p>Now we hear the voice of a sniper who's in one of the buildings near the booth.  He wants the publicist to confess his infidelities to his wife and girlfriend and threatens to kill him if he doesn't follow instructions.  What follows is an intense drama in which the tension never lets up.  The screenplay by Larry Cohen is tightly conceived and there isn't a wasted word or a superfluous character.  And Colin Farrell shines in his role, which has to be an actor's dream.<p>Kiefer Sutherland is cast as the caller and Forrest Whitiker as the cop who is in charge of the police action on the scene.  Radha Mitchell is cast as the wife, Katie Holmes is the girlfriend.  And one of the best scenes in the film is when a trio of hookers demand to use the phone booth.  All the acting is excellent.  And the New York City atmosphere is definitely authentic.<p>I can't say enough good things about this film.  It even has a moral to it.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

Within the context of the film lies a buried depiction of the American Dream that only comes at the end of the film.  It is definitely a five star quality independent film that covers unique angles from a basic and complex plotline.  The film centers around a young woman wanting to break out of her conformist life where she works at a factory that makes flowers in order to help her mother support her sister and her sister's child, but she eventually becomes involved with the wrong side of the tracks.  Maria becomes a pregnant teen who looks toward her so-called rebellious friends, who convince her to quit her mundane job at the factor and to deal drugs.<br /><br />Upon Maria's arrival to New York to delivery the drugs, via her stomach, she meets up with her neighbor from Columbia, Lucy, who  is also one of the scapegoats.  Unfortunately, Lucy does not succeed in completing her mission, and is left to die in a hotel room.  Maria happens to have Lucy's sister's address, and convinces her to bring her in despite the fact that she does not know about the trouble Lucy is in as well as Maria's dealings with drugs.  In the end, Maria finds out that Lucy has been murdered.  She completes her mission, but as she is about to leave to go back to Columbia, she changes her mind.  She walks away from the airport counter heading back to New York City to begin a new life in the United States along with her unborn child.<br /><br />MARIA FULL OF GRACE appears to be an incomplete film because the narrative runs succinctly.  However, the film doesn't drag at all and will keep viewers interested in knowing what will happen in the next scene.  There's no doubt that the film is covered with much cultural and religious overtones as well main premise of the film  -- survival.  Is it a coming of age film?  Possibly, but from another perspective - a young woman attempting to live on her own terms and having much luck on her side.  This is one film with controversial issues, and where there's a happy ending.  Maria's experience could only happen in the movies.</p></body></html>

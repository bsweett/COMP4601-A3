<meta name="summary" content="A Good Dose of Psychological Terror"></head><body><p>Naomi Watts stars in this scary and thrilling film about a videotape that kills the viewer after seven days.  During the final week, the victims suffer from terrifying hallucinations and nose bleeds.<br /><br />At the beginning, two friends, Katie and Rebecca, are watching TV when Katie reveals that she has seen the mysterious video.  True to its nature, Katie ends up dying at the hands of the video, while Rebecca, being so traumitized from witnessing Katie's death, is committed to a mental institution.  Katie's death brings in her cousin Aidan and his mom Rachel (Watts), a reporter for the Seattle Post Intelligencer.  Katie's mother requests that Rachel investigate the story behind the video.  The task becomes harder when Rachel watches the video herself and then realizes she may die within a week.<br /><br />A race against time soon develops, as Rachel, Aidan, and Rachel's estranged boyfriend Noah seek to unlock the mystery of the tape.<br /><br />As Rachel conducts her research, more and more questions arise.  A woman who appears in the video turns out to be Anna Morgan, a horse breeder who goes insane after adopting a young girl named Samara.  Also, the images on the tape continue to turn up during the investigation.  What will become of Rachel's investigation?  What is Samara's connection to the story?  Will Rachel die after seven days like Katie did?<br /><br />This is a scary yet thought-provoking film, however, I recommend watching it at least twice.  I found myself lost during certain parts, but with a second viewing, any questions should be cleared up.  This movie goes beyond the traditional slasher film, instead relying on psychological "whodunnit" type terror to attract the viewer.  The ending is by far the highlight of the film.  If you're a fan of psychological terror over blood and guts, then "The Ring" is a perfect movie for you.</p></body></html>

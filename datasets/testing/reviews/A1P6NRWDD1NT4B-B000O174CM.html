<meta name="summary" content="Dreamgirls Delivers Solid Entertainment"></head><body><p>The recommendation for DREAMGIRLS is based on the performances of all the leads especially Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Hudson (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar), and Beyone Knowles. A film which is loosely based on the Motown Story and particularly the group The Supremes. This reviewer enjoyed the film, however, it is one of those films where one viewing is enough and would not want to see again. The production values and direction are excellent along with the music and their set pieces are first rate.  However, the story is predictable following a template of a typical rock'n'roll rags to riches to break-up plotline.  The audience can predict what is going to happen after each scene in the film and what characters are going to do what. Eddie Murphy should have won the Best Supporting actor in the film instead of Alan Arkin's performance in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. However, perhaps the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences was in a way gave it to Alan Arkin because of his past work (and he is getting on in his years).  Also, Eddie Murphy released NORBIT during the voting period of the Academy Awards and everyone forgot about his performance in this film. Overall, a good film which warrants only one viewing and then put it on the shelf as a museum piece.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mysterious murder--maybe?"></head><body><p>"The Illusionist" is a stylish, turn of the century mystery that manages to be engrossing while not entirely believable. Edward Norton is the son of a cabinet maker, who seems to have acquired magical, perhaps real, supernatural powers. He appears in Vienna, amazes audiences, and is well on his way to becoming a rich man, but for reasons I can't say without becoming a spoiler, he antagonizes the Crown Prince Leopold, who tries to shut him down, unsuccessfully.  Paul Giamatti is the Police Chief, who has been corrupted by Leopold but whose conscience is troubling him as Leopold urges him towards more and more extreme action to get rid of the magician. Jessica Biel is a quite believable Duchess who is Leopold's fianc&eacute;e, but comes to learn that marriage to the Crown Prince may come at too high a cost. Norton and Biel are quite good--it may take a while for Giamatti to shed his "Sideways" image, but he's almost successful in making the transition to a costume drama. A lush, intense Philip Glass score is a nice touch. My husband liked this film too, and we had a lot of fun afterwards trying to figure out what really happened. Play close attention to the final 5 minutes of the movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hard to Mess Up the Great Music; Actually Somebody Did in "Mamma Mia!""></head><body><p>For anyone who loves ABBA's timeless songs (including myself), it is hard to dislike "Mamma Mia!" In addition to those irresistible ABBA numbers, you've got nice locations (of the beautiful coast in Greece), plus the talented cast, veterans and newcomers. Sadly there are two things that "Mamma Mia!" doesn't have: story and direction.<br /><br />Well, there is a story, but a very thin one. Three former boyfriends of Donna (Meryl Streep) travel to an old hotel Donna runs on a small island in Greece after so many years' absence. The three men (played by Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsg?rd and Pierce Brosnan) are in fact secretly invited by Donna's only daughter, 20-year-old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), who is going to be married.<br /><br />You will be told that far in the first ten minutes and ... that's all. The entire cast did well (OK, Pierce Brosnan needs singling lessen, I admit). Obviously they had a good time making this film and you can feel that in the end credits, but "Mamma Mia!" stops there. The characters sing and dance and it is fun to see them doing it, but their dancing and songs, or the lyrics, need to be incorporated into the story. First-time director Phyllida Lloyd (who also did the stage version) just doesn't know the rhythm of filmed musical, missing the timing of music--how to build up the emotion and when to start and stop the tunes. The songs, great as they are, begin and end rather randomly.<br /><br />Great musicals like "Singin' in the Rain" have a good story to tell. You've got great songs and actors in "Mamma Mia!" but you need something more to draw the audience into the film's world. To do so "Mamma Mia!" depends upon the enthusiastic acting of the cast. You got Meryl Streep and she will not disappoint. Those who have seen such films as "Postcards from the Edge" and "Ironweed" know Meryl Streep can really sing. And she does not just sing, but bring energy to her performance and she does it again in "Mamma Mia!" Maybe too much of energy, but it is fun. With more subtlety, however, the film could have been better.</p></body></html>

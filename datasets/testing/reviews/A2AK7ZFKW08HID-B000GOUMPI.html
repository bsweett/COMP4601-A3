Jack Nicholson looks like a lunatic by the end of the movie, he is a man that has drove off the deep end. Great, great movie and everyone should definitely see it, but in my opinion I like the TV series version better. I think it was a little more believable, and I love the Stanley Hotel.  Watch both and decide for yourself, they both are great horror movies.</p></body></html>

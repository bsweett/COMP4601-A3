My first complaint about this film is that it is not Selena Kyle and the Catwoman of the Batman comic series.  I would loved to have seen them base it on this character and had Catwoman in Gotham City.  My second complaint is that Sharon Stone makes a GREAT villian and I just don't think she was given enough to do as supermodel femme fatal.  Francis Conroy's character wasn't really explained and Benjamin Bratt's character wasn't all that interesting.  That said, I liked Berry as Catwoman.  I though she was very sexy and given the chance, could improve in the role (thought I still like her as Storm of the X-Men better).  Pitof's use of camera angles and the way Catwoman really moved like a cat was really cool and one of the best things about the film.  With the origin of our feline heroine out of the way, the sequel (should they make one) should be more focused on action and a good story.  And, if they are gonna get someone like Sharon Stone as the villain, make sure and use her to her potential and not let a really fun actress go to waste.<br /><br />Berry fans will want this as a part of their collection but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to everyone.  Hard core comic fans will be disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite recent Spielberg films"></head><body><p>Of all of Spielberg's serious films, the ones that get the most attention are Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. The former was a masterpiece, a true testament that he's more than a blockbuster director responsible for directing Jaws and Jurassic Park. The latter was an unflinching look into war during World War II but I preferred Schindler's List better. That is until Munich where sure it didn't have the impact of the other 2 but as overall film, I find myself wanting to watch this again which is rare since the other 2 didn't even do that. While it does have its problems, the story and the filmmaking talent on hand prove to me Munich should've won Best Picture.<br /><br />The story is based on one of those "it could've happened/might not have happened" stories so it's purely speculative and dramatized. During the 1972 Olympic Games, terrorists held athletes of the Israeli Olympic team hostage. Eventually all 11 were killed so the government wanted those responsible brought to justice. They get Avner, the Prime Minister's former bodyguard, to lead the way with a team of 4 to track down those responsible. What they find though is that this is not a battle easily won and there's more on the line than just casualties.<br /><br />After shooting the cool-but-immensely-flawed War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg jumped right in and shot Munich incredibly quickly. The result was an incredibly captivating look into how we try to fix the world's heavy problems but finding it too difficult to know when it'll end. The fact it's not an incoherent mess is one thing, but the fact it's to me one of his best films is quite a feat. You can always count on him to have memorable images and certain scenes, such as a scene entirely in silence is riveting while a transition from a bullet-riddled wall to rain against a window is just as great.<br /><br />The casting is quite dead-on too with the standout being Eric Bana. He had the right idea with Hulk but it was probably just the direction for that movie but here he seems quite tortured but then you see someone get back some of that humanity he feels he's losing when his daughter calls him "daddy". We also have the current Bond Daniel Craig, Mathieu Kassovitz (the boyfriend in Amelie) as well as Geoffrey Rush who plays Avner's "handler" in a way. Also some attention to little-known Ayelet Zorer playing Avner's wife.<br /><br />One thing that's been increasingly in popularity is the dual releases where we have just the bare-bones version, usually with awful cover art while we have the 2-disc special/collector/ultimate edition but oddly Munich was barely made available. While I can still find Lemony Snickett or War of the Worlds, Munich didn't seem like a lot of copies were sent out, in fact most stores hadn't even heard of them here. So if this one is what you want, either hunt like mad or just order online since it's a worthwhile one to get, unless they forgot to put something and they'll be a super edition later on.<br /><br />Probably won't have the massive acclaim and staying power of Schindler and Private Ryan in public's eye but this is one film that I wouldn't pass up.</p></body></html>

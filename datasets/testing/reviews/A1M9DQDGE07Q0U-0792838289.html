<meta name="summary" content="Engrossing Political Caper - Fabulous DVD Transfer"></head><body><p>It strikes me that as much as I hate Hollywood remaking its past, the exercise is nevertheless fruitful in getting studios to reissue the original films on DVD and for that I am grateful. In a sort of commemorative celebration of the 2004 remake that has only just hit theaters this week MGM/UA has re-released a special edition of this perversely chilling and suspenseful 1962 thriller. At once a timely and timeless tale of espionage and intrigue, "The Manchurian Candidate" was withheld from distribution for almost a quarter century after President Kennedy's assassination - presumably because its parallels between truth and fiction were just too upsetting for star, Frank Sinatra to get over. Yet despite its disappearance from the spotlight, the film has lost none of its dark potency. The plot is an eerie foreshadowing time capsule of sorts. Former infantryman Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra) is tormented by a perpetual nightmare in which he and his platoon have been brainwashed in Korea. Through a series of conversations with other former fellow POWs, Marco becomes increasingly suspicious of his subconscious as he agonizes ever closer to uncovering the horrific truth. The indecipherable snippets focus on Bennett's decorated war hero, Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey). Like most of Harvey's subsequent roles, he plays a generally cool, aloof loner - this time with a diabolically nattering, hen-pecker of a mother (Angela Lansbury) in tow.  She's a manipulative queen bee, exporting the limited political prowess of her Senator husband, John Iselin (James Gregory) and re-channeling it into something reminiscent of the whole ungodly mess surrounding the McCarthy era. But Shaw is a "sleeper", a brainwashed ticking time bomb set to explode with the detonation of a series of precipitating code words. This is a terrific thriller, one that has suspense, realistic characters, and the kind of riddle within an enigma plot that should both entertain and edify you all at the same time. Director, John Frankenheimer presents this macabre bit of classic film making with all of his usual brilliance and flair for visually stunning and evocative images.<br /><br />The MGM/UA Special Edition DVD delivers very few extras. The best reason for this reissue is a new 5.1 stereo mix and its anamorphic widescreen transfer - both absent from the previously issued DVD. This current incarnation of "The Manchurian Candidate" exhibits a very smooth, surprisingly detailed B&W transfer. The gray scale is generally nicely balanced, though night time photography continues to suffer from a generally soft characteristic and very weak black and contrast levels. Nevertheless, film grain is minimal and fine details are exceptionally realized. Occasionally a hint of edge enhancement crops up, as well as some shimmering of fine details, but these are very rare and absolutely DO NOT distract from one's visual enjoyment. The audio has been remixed and, although sounding strident in some cases, exhibits a vintage quality with good separation and no background hiss. Director John Frankenheimer provides an incredibly detailed and compelling commentary. There's also a very short 1988 snippet from a cast reunion special. Limited reminiscences from Angela Lansbury and another all too short featurette, hosted by Frankenheimer, round out the extras.</p></body></html>

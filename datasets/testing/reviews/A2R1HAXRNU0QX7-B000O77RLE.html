<meta name="summary" content="Good but not great WWII epic from unique perspective"></head><body><p>This is a well-made, honorable movie that somehow didn't quite click on an emotional level for me.  I'm an admirer of Eastwood's understated directing style, where he let's the actors do some acting without having to add frantic editing and other tricks.  He clearly believes that well-written characters, well-played by well-cast performers is about 80% of the trick to directing a good film...and he's mostly correct.  MILLION DOLLAR BABY, MYSTIC RIVER & UNFORGIVEN are but a few examples of his "less is more" style.  They are longish movies that give the viewer time to get to know the characters...yet they never really drag either.<br /><br />LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is extremely well-crafted, and is well-acted by a group of actors largely unknown to American audiences (exception being Ken Watanabee, whom we all got to know for his excellent work in THE LAST SAMURAI).  The young men who portray the doomed troops abandoned by Japan to defend the rocky island of Iwo Jima are all very good, and it takes almost no time at all to get used to reading the subtitles.<br /><br />Eastwood also does a good job of evoking the landscape of the island.  I've never been, so I don't know if it's accurate, but my impression after seeing the film is that this rock was a pretty uninteresting place.  Lots of desert landscapes, with volcanic  hills and very dusty beaches (there are some evocative scenes of soldiers going up the dunes near the ocean, kicking up so much dust that they can barely be seen).  It hardly looks like a  place worth shedding so much blood on.<br /><br />There are some powerful scenes.  The most horrific involves a scene of mass-suicide.  A squad of troops believes they have been ordered to kill themselves because they have failed to defend Mt. Suribachi from the Americans.  Some of the soldiers know that their general has ordered them to retreat to fight another day...but most refuse to credit this order and they begin to kill themselves one by one with hand grenades clutched to their bodies.  It's brutal and amazing.  You shake your head and wonder at the mindset that could lead to this.  And you also cringe for the young men who clearly are only doing what they feel their society wants them to do...none does it with anything but sadness.  It's a gory mess, and it will rattle the toughest moviegoer.<br /><br />Another good scene features the Japanese meeting a wounded American soldier.  The frightened American meets a Japanese officer who speaks English and has good things to say about America.  The soldier draws touching comfort from this gentle contact, and after he dies, the officer reads to his men a letter the young American had from his mother.  The soldiers are all greatly moved by this simple letter...it puts a human face on the enemy.<br /><br />But a lot of the film feels generic in its scenes.  It's hard to get any sense of the strategy being employed or of how much time is passing.  I have NO idea from watching the film how much time passes from when the Americans land to when the Japanese were completely defeated.  It feels like it could be two days or two weeks or even more.  To me, this is a mistake...a context that is lacking.  The film simply got a little repetitive.  Groups of outnumbered Japanese soldiers running from one spot to another, most of them being mowed down by American firepower on the way.  To me, rather than making me feel the random chaos of battle, I just felt like I was being left to fill in the blanks of what was going on for myself.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that this style of rapid-fire, chaotic "war action" was done so well with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that it has frankly lost much of its power to stun.  Eastwood isn't quite the action-engineer that Spielberg is, so IWO JIMA suffers some in comparison.  RYAN did a darn fine job of showing me the carnage, randomness, brutality, gore, etc., etc. of men in battle.  That movie shook me to the core.  But sense that time, war movies that have followed cannot quite get the same feelings from me by showing similar (but inferior) scenes.  This is not to say that war movies have no power to stun anymore...far from it.  But these particular types of action scenes don't quite cut it anymore.  They feel derivative now.<br /><br />The best parts of IWO JIMA are the quieter times, when the men (of high rank and low) consider their impending deaths, and we feel their sense of loss.  The knowledge of all the things they won't be going home to.  Their desire to draw meaning from the sacrifices they know they are about to make.<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing, absolutely.  It is 140 minutes long, but the length was no issue for me.  I think I simply wasn't moved as much as the hype had led me to believe I would be.  I suggest going to see it without any preconceived ideas, if you can, and you will find it a unique glimpse at World War II, and at the effects of combat on those on the front lines.  Eastwood has done another stellar job on a film whose scale just occasionally exceeds his grasp.<br /><br />(On the subject of "revisionist" history...I too am a bit uncomfortable about the depiction of the Japanese as being on the same moral level as the Americans.  It is well-documented [Bataan Death March, anyone] that the Japanese commited many atrocities on a large scale level.  My own father-in-law often spoke of arriving at POW camps after they had been abandoned by the Japanese guards only to find all the detainees had been slaughtered.  Someone needs to make a modern day movie version of James Clavell's KING RAT to show some of that horror.)</p></body></html>

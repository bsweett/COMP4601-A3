<meta name="summary" content="A great &quot;Who Am I?&quot; sci-fi action thriller! great DVD!"></head><body><p>Totall Recall on DVD doesn't have a whole lot of extra features, but it does include a full-screen version for those of you who enjoy both aspect ratios. And the while the sound is great, what is really great is the picture. I owned TR on VHS for many years, and the picure quality was very poor, even for videotape. when I picked it up on DVD, I noticed very few artifacts on the screen, and the color representation was near perfect. As for the plot, Schwarzenegger plays Quaid, a construction worker who realizes that his life may not be his. There is A LOT of action in this film, and the explosions will give your subwoofer a good workout. I recommend this DVD to everyone.</p></body></html>

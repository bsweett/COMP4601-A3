<meta name="summary" content="HAHAHA!!! THIS MOVIE IS SOO FUNNY!!!!!"></head><body><p>Im not saying that this movie is comedy, but Djimon Hounsou's acting JUST MADE ME LAUGHT UNTIL MY STOMACH HURTS. I mean... I know that his character is suffering because of his family but there are like three scenes that he COMPLETELY OVER-ACTED the whole situation about his family!(specially in the final fight scene). AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!<br /><br />Another funny stuffs are the gore that is kind of fake, DiCaprios's dialoge sometime is cheesy, Connelly wasn't acting! she was modeling and the captions that even describes the music that will play on the movie!!<br /><br />The movie has a lot of action scenes but this is more like drama, and the action is choreographied as war! so don't think that the action is this movie is the same as Last Samurai by the same director.<br />I gave it 3 stars because all of that, but the movie is still entertaining and easy to understand.<br /><br />adios and have fun with this movie.</p></body></html>

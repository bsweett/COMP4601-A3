The merging of two stories in one is brilliant. On one story, you have a man (Jim) who had a bad relationship and wants his memory of her erased, but during the proceedure he discovers that he loves her and doesn't want the memories gone. Then the other story envolves those who are erasing Joel's memory and the conflicts they exchange while doing their job.<br /><br />I really do enjoy this film and think it's one of Jim Carrey's best. I think this surpases my other favorite JC drama "The Majestic". Jim Carrey just proves once again that even though he is known for his comedy roles, he can also be fantastic actor in other genres as well.</p></body></html>

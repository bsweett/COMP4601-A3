<meta name="summary" content="a really mediocre comic book adaption."></head><body><p>After being in a spaceship when a unstable cloud of molcules explode, 5 people are suddenly changed forver. Everyone of them gains a superpower. Johnny Storm(Chris Evans)can all the sudden engulf his entire body in flames. Sue Storm(Jessica Alba) can make her self invisible and create dynamic force fields. Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) turns into this stone thing that is only called The Thing, he has the ability to smash through things. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) all the sudden can stretch out all of his body parts. The last friend Victor Von Doom(Julian Mcmahon) is slowly turning into metal and is also slowly turning evil. After word gets out that there are a bunch of people with superpowers walking around New York City, The Press instantly jumps on them and wants to know more about them. Von Doom is getting angry that The Fantastic Four is taking away attention from his company and he goes out of his way to become Dr. Doom and end The Fantastic Four. another motivation behind that is that Sue had pitched nerdy Reed over him. So, he becomes mor and more intent to end all of the Fantastic Four's lives. at first, The Fantastic Four don't gel together. There is a constant grudge match between The Thing and Johnny. Also, there is some serious tension between Sue and Reed. Also, The Thing is hating being the the Thing because his wife left him and people stare at him and call him a monster. The Fantastic Four then fights Doom because he had become more powerful after taking all the power away from the Thing, and They have to do something about it or Doom will rule the city!<br /><br />This film was seriously mediocre. They could've found a better director than Tim Story. He directed Taxi, for god's sake. Also, this film had the cheesiness of a B movie, and some of the effects were horrid. They did stay faithful to the comic books but I felt that some parts were skewered by Tim Story and the writers.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if you can handle cheesiness or semi-cool effects. I don't recommend this to any fans because I feel that they will be angry at what has been done, and I was sure angry too. So, see if this film if you can handle it.</p></body></html>

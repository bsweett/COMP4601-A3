<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Vintage Hitchcock"></head><body><p>You know, maybe I shouldn't even do reviews of Alfred Hitchcock movies. I mean, anything might give away the secrets, make it less fun to try to figure out what the heck is going on. But I'll try not to be a spoiler.<br /><br />In the prologue, James Stewart plays John "Scottie" Ferguson, a detective chasing a bad guy across rooftops in San Francisco with a uniformed cop. He slips and is hanging way, way above the street by just a rain gutter. A rain gutter that is bending with his weight. The uniformed cop reaches for him, says, "Give me your hand," but how does he do that when he needs both hands to hang on? The uniformed cop reaches further to try to lift him, and falls to his death below. We don't see how Scottie finally gets rescued, but he's in his artist [female] friend's apartment with a cane next, and they are discussing how he has resigned from the force because he has developed acrophobia, and gets vertigo when he stands on the kitchen step-stool.<br /><br />He gets a call from an old school chum who has married money. Shipbuilding money. Gorgeous office, and gorgeous wife. Only problem is, gorgeous wife (Kim Novak) is haunted by her great-grandmother, and seems to think she is destined to commit suicide like great-grandma did. Old school chum begs Scottie to follow his wife, find out where she goes, what she's doing, all that. Scottie finds out about the great-grandmother, but when he reports this to his old school chum, he finds that OSC already knows about said ancestor, and wants Scottie to follow her to protect her. Sure enough, she goes out to the Presidio and jumps in the Bay. Scottie rescues her. And, inevitably (we ARE talking about Kim Novak at the height of her considerable powers) falls in love with her.<br /><br />No more. I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say that all is not what it seems, which is no surprise of itself when it's a Hitchcock film. One of his better ones, in fact.</p></body></html>

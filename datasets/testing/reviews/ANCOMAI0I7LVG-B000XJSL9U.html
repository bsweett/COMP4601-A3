<meta name="summary" content="Yippee Ki Yay indeed..."></head><body><p>I'll start by saying this:<br /><br />If you are a fan of the `Die Hard' franchise and are afraid that the PG-13 movie is going to take away from the violence and realistic action that permeated the previous three films then place all hesitation aside and rent this movie anyways.  The violence here is so above any PG-13 I've seen as of late, realistic and non-stop.  In fact, the action sequences are more realistic and look better then anything seen in the mess that was `Spider-Man 3'.  Now, if you are a fan of the `Die Hard' franchise and are afraid that the PG-13 rating is going to take away from the many expletives that littered the first three films, again, have no fear for there is an unrated version that also accompanies this disk.  I personally don't care to listen to the F-Bomb dropped over and over so the theatrical version worked beautifully for me, but either way you have your pick and both are very pleasing.<br /><br />So, now we'll move onto the movie itself.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, now in his fifties, reprises his role as John McClane and once again proves that no one can do action like Bruce Willis.  The man is god, I mean at fifty he can still hold his own against just about anyone.  In this installment John is up against his toughest villain yet, a computer.  While the plot is underdeveloped a bit (does it really matter as long as enough stuff blows up) it still poses a situation we all can get scared over.  With the whole world pretty much dependant on computers what if someone decided to take complete control over them.  In essence they would control our lives.  So this is what McClane is up against.<br /><br />The film opens with McClane being asked to pick up a hacker named Matt Farrell and bring him in for some questioning.  Picking him up proves to be a little more difficult than expected and after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt on the kid he comes to find out that this hacker may be the only person who can help him through this mess.  At the other end of the attacks is disgruntled terrorist Thomas Gabriel (played by a very one-dimensional Timothy Olyphant) and his beautiful assistant Mai.  McClane's determination to take him down (and out for the count) ends up putting him in a a tight spot when Gabriel kidnaps McClane's daughter Lucy.  Now McClane has even more motivation to kick some tail.<br /><br />`Live Free or Die Hard' is very heavy on the action.  There are some breathtaking sequences and Bruce Willis' fight sequence with Maggie Q is the best `guy on girl' fight scene I've seen since Wolverine squared off with Lady Deathstrike in `X2'.  If you are in need for an action fix then this movie will do it for you. Tag this to the back of `Transformers' and you have one awesome action-packed weekend.  The whole `18-wheeler/jet fighter' scene alone is brilliantly shot and surprisingly realistic.<br /><br />Willis is great again here.  I don't know why people don't realize he is one of our finest working actors by now.  I mean, `drama' is not the only genre that demands you command your character and Willis' portrayal of McClane (especially in the first `Die Hard' film) is award worthy.  Justin Long is funny as Matt Farrell but I've seen him do better.  Maggie Q is awesome here, better than she was in last years `MI:3' and speaking of `MI:3', how come they get the greatness that is Philip Seymour Hoffman and we are stuck with Timothy Olyphant, who is never `great' but has been much better than he is here.  I was actually very impressed with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays Lucy, McClane's daughter.  She really got a handle on her character despite lack of lengthy screen time.<br /><br />In the end `Live Free or Die Hard' is much better than expected for despite it's PG-13 rating it still manages to deliver in just about every way the previous films had.  Sure, there is no comparison to the original `Die Hard' but this installment fits nicely with the rest and proves to be, not a disappointment, but a worthwhile adventure that is a sure fire crowd pleaser.</p></body></html>

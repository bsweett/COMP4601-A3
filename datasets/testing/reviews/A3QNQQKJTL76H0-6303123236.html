Widely derided as "Disney's Folly" by journalists and industry insiders of the time for its long and costly development cycle ($1.4 million was a staggering sum in 1930's Depression-era America), Snow White was Disney's first feature-length animated film and nearly bankrupted the studio. Walt's determination won out and Disney went on to build the entertainment empire that we know today. Now, old meets new as this cherished classic comes to hi-def with a sparkling new transfer. Newly remastered and digitally restored, this "Diamond Edition" looks and sounds fantastic, having been given all the care and attention that a film of this cultural and historical significance deserves (it was added to the National Film Registry for preservation by the Library of Congress in 1989). Snow White is notable for a number of cinematic firsts and technological innovations which set the standard for the animation industry (discussed in the special features).<br /><br />For $20, this is a great value, and there is plenty on this 3-disc set for young or old to enjoy. The first disc contains the movie, audio commentary culled from Walt Disney's interviews interspersed with comments by film historian, some interactive games, and 2 deleted scenes. The second disc is a vast collection of archival footage, photos, and history, all in HD. The third disc is the DVD edition, for viewing where Blu-ray isn't available. This item is identical to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267N3DQ">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (DVD/Two-Disc Blu-ray + BD Live w/DVD packaging)</a>, except that one has Snow White on the cover art and a black DVD case. The Blu-ray edition has the evil queen/hag and a standard translucent blue Blu-ray case.<br /><br />First, the picture quality: Disney has done a stellar job restoring this 72 year old masterpiece and given the film plenty of breathing room with a 50GB disc. There is not a hint of discoloration, fading, frame jitter, darkening, or yellowing throughout the film. According to the DVD insert, 360,000 frames of negative were scanned and digitally restored in a year-long process. This TLC is evident from the first few seconds of starting the film. Colors are steady, vibrant and fresh, looking like a painted storybook come to life, as it was originally intended. I did notice some specks and uncaught artifact when I went looking for them by standing right in front of the TV, but under normal viewing conditions from 4-6 feet away on your couch, these are not noticeable. I also did notice some unnatural halo outlining in some scenes, especially near the beginning of the film. A strange fuzz encircled the pigeons in the scene where Snow White is singing at the well. Again, I only noticed these flaws when I scrutinized the video up close. Most people will not notice unless it's pointed out to them.<br /><br />New to this edition is "DisneyView", a marketing term for how Disney fills up the black bars around the side of the screen. The original film was 1:33, so watching it on today's wider HDTVs will result in black vertical bars. DisneyView is just simple watercolor backgrounds, like curtains or stone pillars. They change when the scene fades to another scene. I found them distracting and turned them off after a few minutes. It felt like I was being boxed in.<br /><br />Audio: The original mono recording has been re-engineered for 7.1 surround. I only have a 5.1 for testing, and sound is clear and strong, sounding every bit as good as a film that was produced today.<br /><br />Extras: The commentary track from interviews culled from Disney archives is interesting to listen to, although film historian John Canemaker can be a bit dull at times and a bit too academic, dropping too many nerdy name and film references that will escape ordinary viewers. Being the great storyteller that he is, Walt's segments are always a joy to listen to as he talks about various aspects of the production.<br /><br />BD Live took a minute or more to load, but it seemed longer. From previous experience, BD Live is usually the worst part of any Blu-ray  experience. There's a feature called "Scene Stealer" where you can upload your face and it'll be superimposed over the scene. It seemed a big hassle to operate and I didn't bother. Similarly, a few games are included that you control with the remote, like an image guessing game called "What Do You See", and a jewel matching game, but I'm not a big fan of such features as usually the controls are awkward.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains a whole treasure trove of historical footage, interviews, and images. The content is divided into departments (animation, inking and painting, music, etc), each represented by black and white photography onscreen, with slick fly-throughs linking the rooms all together. There's a lot to see here, although getting around the different departments is a bit cumbersome. Different objects or parts of the room light up when you push the remote control arrows (usually 3 or 4 items per room). Luckily, there is an index link that lists everything (show as a map, with subsections all listed in a column along the right). Here you'll find the famous "Steamboat Willie" and a lot of early Disney shorts like "Skeleton Dance", "Flowers and Trees", "Goddess of Spring", "Playful Pluto", and several others. Some of the segments are very short, lasting only 1 to 4 minutes. These discuss various aspects of the production process and I would've liked for them to have been longer, but it was a genuine joy to see footage from 1930's America.<br /><br />In summary, this is a set every film and animation lover should own. This is a disc you and your family will enjoy for years to come.  The $20 price tag is very reasonable and you're getting a lot of material here. The second disc alone is about 2.5 hrs of content. I hope Disney continues this level of care and attention to upcoming Blu-ray re-releases of other classics like Dumbo [Blu-ray].</p></body></html>

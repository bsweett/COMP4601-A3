He is, with Woody Allen, one of the two best contemporary American directors.  He is also the John Wayne of our times.  Eastwood gets credit for exploring the soul (and the society the poor soul lives in) in a manner that leaves us with a lot to think about.  In "Gran Torino" Eastwood tackles the issue of prejudice by showing how a man beyond repair can still come to see the light.<br /><br />The opening of the film tells us all in a few short scenes; elderly widower, unhappy with the world, uncommunicative with his well-meaning sons and their families, staying in a community that "changed" into one where he is alone in isolation.  A man whose major life-changing event was the Korean War where he killed Asian enemies who, in turn, had killed his American buddies, he looks out around his Detroit neighborhood and finds himself surrounded by Asians who are, in this case, Hmong refugees.  Either way they are just Asians to him.  Now, all alone after the death of his wife, what is there for him other than his mint condition Gran Torino.<br /><br />Obviously this movie creates a series of events that gets Eastwood off his front porch and involves him with his neighbors.  (Otherwise this would be a pretty boring film).  The manner in which things happen are presented in a believable manner.  The metamorphisis we see happening before us may seen a bit sudden at times but we'll just let that pass as the handiwork of the local (and youthful) priest.  Cultures and generations are heading for a collision and the results leave us with a bittersweet taste.  Heroism takes many forms and we get to observe one form not often portrayed these days.  Given the clerical involvement it may be fair to suggest a few Biblical parallels but I'll let you decide for yourself.<br /><br />I missed seeing this movie on the big screen.  It was in town just a short while and I heard mixed reviews about it.  I can see where some might not care for the ending and I have struggled with a 4 star or a 5 star rating.  I decided on 4 stars by rating "Gran Torino" against other recent Eastwood pictures.  It's not a "family picture" but it is certainly worth seeing.</p></body></html>

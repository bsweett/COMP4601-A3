<meta name="summary" content="bugness"></head><body><p>Uhm...this was an interesting psychological thriller but fell short of being a great movie that I'd recommend to others.<br /><br />Ashley Judd plays a small-town crack-smoking waitress, Agnes, who is helpless against her estranged husband, who just got out of prison.  Meanwhile, her lesbian co-worker introduces her to a lonely, shy drifter.<br /><br />The drifter is a soldier, who've just returned from the war.  Eventually, you'll start to see that this guy is a few marbles short.  He believes that he is part of some classified warfare experient and that he's under the constant watch of the government.  He believes that there are microscopic bugs (critters) that function as...well...bugs (spy devices).<br /><br />Agnes feels obligated to help out this drifter with his problem.  However, his paranoia starts to affect her to the point where she actually believes there are bugs around and even inside of her.<br /><br />So, this simply leads me to believe that the power of word/persuasion is a powerful weapon.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was interesting.  However, the movie moves at a slow pace.  In other words, you could quickly lose interest in the movie.  Another thing, towards the end, where Agnes has gone over to the other side, the movie loses its appeal.</p></body></html>

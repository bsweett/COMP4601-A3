<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith Shines"></head><body><p>Displaying that he can handle the lead role in a romantic comedy just as easily as he can handle every other genre in the field, Will Smith shines in HITCH as Alex Hitchens, aka "The Date Doctor."  Hitch helps average guys gain the attention and win the hearts of the women of their dreams.  He has a strict code that he follows and his identity has remained a secret.<br /><br />Hitch is hired by a tax accountant named Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is an overweight, average-Joe who happens to work at a firm that handles starlet Allegra Cole's (Amber Valleta) accounts.  Allegra Cole is a celebrity and has all the money, fame, power, and beauty that comes with her station.  Albert falls deeply in love with Ms. Cole and needs help getting her attention.  This is a romantic comedy, so even the most improbable scenarios become likely and soon Albert finds himself dating the famous Allegra Cole.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hitch has some problems of his own.  He's fallen for a national gossip columnist, Sara (Eva Mendes) who is trying to figure out who the unknown man Allegra Cole has been seen with really is.  Hitch is a true genius at setting up scenarios for his clients, but all of the tricks he uses to help his clients have the opposite effect when he uses them with Sara.  For example, A romantic trip to Ellis Island turns Sara into a raging and crying fury of hatred and a night at a make-your-own seafood place has Hitch breaking out in a serious facial reaction.  As Hitch and Sara bond with each other, their relationship becomes increasingly rocky when a spurned client turns on Hitch and Sara learns what he really does for a living.<br /><br />The poster and DVD cover for HITCH say that "Will Smith is `Hitch'".  There's no better way to explain it because Smith is Hitch.  Every gesture, move, and spoken phrase seems perfect.  Hitch is a role that Smith was born to play.  But Smith doesn't shine alone in the film.  Eva Mendes is a beautiful woman, but she's also incredibly talented.  She holds her own against one of Hollywood's most powerful actors.  From various interviews she has given, Mendes seems like a down-to-Earth person.  That reality grounds Sara and radiates through her and makes her someone that the audience cares for.  Kevin James does an excellent job as the film's pivotal-plot character Albert and in many scenes upstages Smith.<br /><br />I tend to like most genres of movies as long as there is a good story involved.  However, romantic comedies are my least favorite film genre.  Many romantic comedies made are trite and have no originality to them.  HITCH really isn't like that.  The movie has a good story, great actors, and solid direction.  It's both funny and tender.  Unlike many movies in he genre, HITCH is a movie that a person can enjoy watching by themselves just as much as watching it with a loved one.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of romantic comedies, fans of Will Smith, fans of Eva Mendes, and fans of Kevin James.  For movie trivia fans, the fire station shown at the beginning of the movie as Hitch is helping a client is the same firehouse used in GHOSTBUSTERS.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Freddy Vs Jason"></head><body><p>The whole idea of Freddy vs Jason has been like a guilty little daydream waiting in the dark places in the back of your mind for most horror fans. When it finally seemed certain it was coming, I know I wasn't the only horror fan who felt the strangest flush of excitement and trepidation, hope and fear, and above all else curiosity. I think many of us also felt that this could be the ONE, the movie that could either lift two of our favorite institutions into respectability or turn them into a laughing stock forever. The longest half hour of my life was waiting through the opening ads for the film to roll, but when it did...WOW! This is all I, a dedicated and obsessive horror fan, could have hoped for. There is murder and mayhem, excellent special effects, and non stop action. The story is surprisingly plausible and fleshed out. New scenes from Jason's past are revealed and more of his motivation explained than ever before. The teens are your typical whiny snots and their deaths are deeply satisfying and stylish. If you are a fan of either icon, see this movie.</p></body></html>

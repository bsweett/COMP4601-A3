<meta name="summary" content="Much better than the Men in Black films and with more heart"></head><body><p>Hellboy I just saw and enjoyed very much. It doesn't match up to the original source materials it was taken from --- one of the best written and drawn comics in the last 20 years --- but what film ever lives up to their books.<br /><br />For fans of the comics, this film is a must-see. There are some changes made to keep the film from becoming too much of a copy of the books. The changes didn't bother me too much. Some ideas were taken from other Hellboy stories, but you have to be a major fan of the work to notice them.<br /><br />For casual film fans, this film is a hit or miss. The film has a classic pulp, serial look and also doesn't try to make itself out to be something too serious, or life changing. This is supposed to be a fun film and I think it succeeds.<br /><br />The Hellboy comics are a gold mine for ideas. The graphic novel that this film was based on is not even the best, but good enough as an introductory film. If they give the go ahead for a sequel, I wish that Del Toro look hard at using the Wake the Devil graphic novel as a sequel: Vampires, reborn Greek Goddess, insane Nazi scientists, and more on Hellboy's origins and purpose.</p></body></html>

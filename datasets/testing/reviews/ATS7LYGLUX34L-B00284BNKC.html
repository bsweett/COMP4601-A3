<meta name="summary" content="Ellen Burstyn Got Ripped Off!"></head><body><p>Movies like Requiem For A Dream are like giant arrows that point out the flaws of voting bodies like The Academy Awards....this film should have swept the Oscars, should have won Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actress....instead we get safe pap like Erin Brockovich and Julia Roberts.....<p>  Requiem For a Dream follows four characters as they follow their dreams...and we see their dreams become nightmares. Ellen Burstyn gives maybe the best motion picture performance I've ever seen. Not HER best ever...THE BEST EVER. I have never seen an actor or actress lay themselves bare like this before. Watching the sweet, lonely Sara Goldfarb become a speed freak is bad enough, but the paths followed by her son Harry (Jared Leto), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, a true revelation..), and Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)are equally harrowing; By the end of the film I felt like I had been sent through the wringer.....<p>  The DVD has some of the most clever packaging I've seen in quite some time: It's presented like an infomercial for Sara's favorite TV personality, Tappy Tibbins, played by Christopher MacDonald. There are a lot of extras, and I was particularly happy to see Ellen Burstyn interview Author Hubert Selby, Jr.- it was VERY illuminating.<p>  As an unflinching portrait of addiction, Requiem ranks right up there with Trainspotting, and should be required viewing for all High School students thinking of experimenting with drugs.</p></body></html>

PERFECTION!"></head><body><p>It's twenty-seven years later . . . and this film remains potent.<br /><br />I have not seen the unedited version since I was ten years old and watched in a room full of screaming, slumber-party girls. And though I have seen it countless times since then, it was always on television. I just bought the DVD and was shocked at how graphic the film REALLY is!! The deaths are spectacular . . . especially that of Kevin Bacon's character, Jack . . . and, no that isn't a "spoiler" since slasher-code dictates that men die early and one woman remains ("The Final Girl"). It is a blood-fest . . . with a pretty serious twist (here, my lips are sealed!!)<br /><br />Unlike many classic slasher-films (like Prom Night and Nightmare on Elm Street) this one genuinely stands the test of time. Instead of becoming a laughable experience (like the aforementioned) it has remained genuinely engaging. The premise is simple, the horror intense, and the ending (though bizarre) is absolutely effective!!<br /><br />If you have not seen the "real-deal" in years, prepare to be surprised!! Well worth the purchase . . . even if you just want to understand what spawned ten sequels!!</p></body></html>

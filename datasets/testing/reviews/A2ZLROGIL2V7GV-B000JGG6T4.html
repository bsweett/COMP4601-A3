This is not a "happy" movie, and it's not pretty.  It's extremely violent at times and the storyline is a reflection of a parent's worst nightmare--the kidnapping and possible murder of their child.  While it can be over-stylish at times with fancy editing and camera work, it proves to be a more than effective thriller.<br /><br />John Creasy used to work for the CIA, but now he's an alcoholic who doesn't think there's much to live for.  This is due to the terrible things he has done in his line of work (we never know exactly what he did, but there are more than enough hints).  Starting a new life in Mexico, his best friend finds him a job as a bodyguard to a nine-year-old girl since the family is worried about all of the kidnappings that have taken place in Mexico.  The girl, Pita, takes a liking to Creasy right away, but he doesn't allow her in and treats her as nothing more than a job.  Amazingly, he starts to get attached to Pita and finds a new reason to live.  Not only is he her bodyguard, but he is almost like a second father to her.<br /><br />Things drastically change when Pita gets kidnapped.  Creasy does his best to take out the kidnappers when it happens, but is outnumbered and has been shot multiple times.  While recovering in the hospital, he learns that the ransom for little Pita has gone sour and that her captors have most likely executed her.  This sets off a rage inside Creasy like he has never experienced before.  He checks himself out of the hospital and wages his own war against everybody who was involved in the kidnapping/murder of Pita.  And he vows to kill every single one of them.<br /><br />Tony Scott directs this intense and emotional thriller.  He does a great job with the material and he knows how to get the performances that he wants from his actors.  My complaint is that he goes a little overboard with the fancy camera work and editing at times, but that is something that can be overlooked.  Denzel Washington gives one of his most powerful performances since "Training Day."  He really makes you feel for his character, and his absolute hatred towards the people involved with the horrible kidnapping is done in an extremely realistic and convincing way.  Dakota Fanning does a great job in her role of "Pita" and does well by playing opposite of Denzel.  And, we cannot forget the great Christopher Walken who also does a superb job on his part.  He plays it perfectly and does not try to steal any scenes from Washington.<br /><br />It must be said, this is a vicious movie.  It's not for people with weak stomachs.  There is one scene in particular that makes the ear-cutting scene in "Reservoir Dogs" look like absolutely nothing.  Denzel's  character doesn't only want to murder the bad guys... he wants to make them suffer in the most horrific ways, and he does that many times.  It's not a happy or cute movie.  It will disgust a lot of people, so it's not for everyone.  Make sure you keep that in mind if you decide to rent this.  Other than the option to watch the movie in DTS and two commentary tracks, the DVD has no special features.  It looks and sounds great.  It would've been nice if they did more with the DVD in the special features department, though.<br /><br />"Man On Fire" is a powerful and unforgiving thrill ride that will keep your heart pumping and your forehead sweating.  Other than some of the flashy and fast editing/camera work, the movie really works.  Again, this is not for anybody with weak stomachs.  It is very disturbing and unsettling.  If you're looking for a powerful thriller with a lot of "bang" and real emotion, then this is something to check out.  As dark and brutal as this movie is, I really enjoyed watching this. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

I say THE HANGOVER deserves all the good buzz it's generated. There were so many crazy and laugh-out-loud moments in this film, I was non-stop cracking up. The film's premise sets you up for a compelling mystery, turns your head with its hints of what must have been one hell of a forgotten wild night in Vegas.<br /><br />Three hung-over friends wake up in a sorely trashed suite in Caesars Palace, and with no memory of the night before. In rapid order they find, among other peculiar things, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, a chicken clucking around, and that one of them has lost a tooth. And also that the fourth guy in their group has gone missing. Much of THE HANGOVER details the guys' piecing together various clues, retracing their steps, trying to find out what the hell happened the night before and just where is their missing friend... who's due to be married the next day.<br /><br />You assume, going in, that you know what to expect. Crude humor. Maybe some silly slapstick. A healthy serving of raunchiness. And, mind you, this is the same director that did OLD SCHOOL and ROAD TRIP. And, yeah, we do visit the same landscape, all of the above stuff mentioned. Except better. I don't know if I can pin-point it exactly. THE HANGOVER doesn't have the heart of KNOCKED UP or KNOCKED UP's sweet unlikely romance, and I do think that Heather Graham should've been given more scenes. But I think the screenplay is really good. Then there's the smart execution. The dialogue is outrageous and wicked funny and there is a minefield of memorable one-liners. The core players, while not exactly given deeply explored character arcs, have sharply delineated personalities and these guys certainly play off each other effectively. The leads are each saddled with his personal albatross. Stu the straight-laced dentist is living in relationship hell, constantly bullied by his overbearing girlfriend. Phil the school teacher is larcenous and immature and an unrepentant instigator. And oh dear God, Alan... Alan is overweight and a man-child and weird as [...]-all. Doug, well, Doug's gone missing.<br /><br />A sweet-natured hooker, a simpering Asian crime lord, a singing Mike Tyson, and more. One improbable thing after another keeps piling on, and you can't help but get suckered in if only to see how everything fits. And while not everything does get explained away - like, what exactly was up with the chicken? - you'll find that enough light is shed on the unrecollected crazy that went down. It's advised that you stick around for the end credits, as even more 'splainin' unfolds.<br /><br />THE HANGOVER has no pretense about what it is. It aims for low brow laughs, and it hits the target more so than it misses. I frankly don't think it misses that often. It for sure doesn't try to impart life lessons, except that you maybe do learn one thing: nothing good can ever come from bachelor parties in Vegas. But we knew that already.</p></body></html>

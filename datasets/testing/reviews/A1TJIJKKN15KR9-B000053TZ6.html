<meta name="summary" content="Behind-the-Scenes Story is Almost as Intriguing as the 1941 Classic"></head><body><p>This lengthy examination on the large-scale, take-no-prisoners lives of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles examines just how much the two personalities had in common, how their winding roads intersected, and why a high-stakes showdown was almost inevitable once the Welles parade stormed Hollywood. It's a thorough, unbiased glimpse into both men's lifestyles, triumphs, mistakes and defining moments. The documentary is a bit on the long side, but in retrospect I can't imagine which slab of material could've been sliced away. It's all integral to the big picture. Considering all that led up to it and everything that worked against it, it's something of a miracle this film ever saw the light of day. That it turned out as good as it did is nearly unimaginable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="About so much more than horror"></head><body><p>The Shining is Kubrick's take on a horror film. Thus it contains multitudes. Embedded meanings and dark nights of the soul that underpin what is essentially a small scale story of isolation and madness in an isolated Colorado hotel. Like the novels of Samuel Beckett, the Shining strips human psychology down to the floorboards. And what is revealed is a wretched and inescapable image of terrible things that men have done in the past, are doing now, and will do again in future time.</p></body></html>

When he had visions it was scary and convincing. It's scary when Devon Sawyer is a better actor than anyone in Final Destination 2. <p>  The film starts out with A.J. Cook's character going on a road trip with her friends. She has a vision of a huge traffic accident, she then blocks traffic to save everyone on that roads life. Then of course since everyone on that road was supposed to die death starts to kill them one by one like in the first film. <p>  The death scenes are incredibly gory and detailed but also seemed like ways you would've seen Kenny die on South Park. They're silly and heartless at the same time. It's like the film is trying to make death out to be funny a lot of time. Sorry but I didn't find 2 different scenes where young boys die right in front of their mothers very funny. I found the film highly disturbing actually.</p></body></html>

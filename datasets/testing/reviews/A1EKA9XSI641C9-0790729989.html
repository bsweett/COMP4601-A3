The characters are excellently developed, and one really does care about what happens to them.  The story is sort of odd for a detective movie, leaning a little on a Christian undertone, but it's never really played up too much, which is good in my opinion, because those types of things can detract from movies (End of Days).  This is probably one of Kevin Spacey's best roles, as the serial killer, John Doe.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as Somerset.  Brad Pitt really shines because he plays a sort of average detective and not some wierdo or "seductive" guy.  Gweneth Paltrow's part is small, but in the scenes that she's in we get to know her character well.  The mood of the movie is really dark, and it's really apparent at the ending, which is one of the most brutally intense that there is.  Don't expect to walk away from this movie feeling cheery, but expect to walk away liking it.  The DVD features on Disc 2 (4 commentaries on Disc 1) are really worthwhile, with deleted scenes that look to be remastered, explorations of title concepts, an original opening and ending, and also some segments about the remastering for DVD.  This movie is worth it for fans of crime/thriller/horror movies, even though it's not really a horror movie, but it exibits some traits.</p></body></html>

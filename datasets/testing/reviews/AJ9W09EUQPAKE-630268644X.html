<meta name="summary" content="Classic Tarrantino"></head><body><p>Reservoir Dogs is, in many respects, a precursor to the bigger and more sophisticated Pulp Fiction. However it's more basic, gritty style still highlights Quentin Tarrantino's directoral masterpieces. These include:<br /><br />1: Superb characterisation.<br /><br />2: Attention to meaningless dialogue and black humour (does any director do this better?). Among the finest scenes in the film include Mr Pink complaining about his assigned alias and Mr White trying to console the recently shot and catatonically bleeding Mr Orange lying in the back of his car.<br /><br />3: Classic fashion. What other mobie has defined a generic piece of kit like Reservoir Dogs did for black suits, skinny black ties and white shirts?<br /><br />4: Brilliant acting. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, even Tarrantion himself in a cameo find their perfect roles in this film, all played out with macho attempts at gangster type compassion and empathy.<br /><br />5: Innovative soundtrack. Not to the same extent as Pulp Fiction, which used songs such as Chuck Berry's 'Teenage Wedding' and Cat Stevens' 'You'll Be a Woman Soon' to genius extents. But Harvey Keitel prancing around a warehouse with a razor to 'Stuck in the Middle With You' to torture a captured cop is a brilliantly conceived scene.<br /><br />12 Years on, Reservoir Dogs remains a classic showcase of what Tarrantio does best.</p></body></html>

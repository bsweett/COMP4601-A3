I just wants to see this movie because of "Brandon Routh" in spandex! He's first film and he's real cute...YA, he's real cute an all. But movie drags a lot & slow pasted till almost end of the movie got picked up some action an all, then was kind of to late. I lost the interest, Because most the movie was slow Pasted! I was accepting like spiderman series, type a high tank action, but was way to far, they push the damn love story to it to much makes it more drama then comic action hero flick!!!!!!!!!!Anyway not all that. I guess just a rental worth and seen just once, nothing more C+</p></body></html>

'Desperado' is an over-the-top, ultraviolent comedy starring handsome Antonio Banderas, beautiful Salma Hayak and 'Up in Smoke', Cheech Marin.  Generally speaking, I'm no fan of action-adventure but this particular 'action-adventure' is purely hilarious.  Antonio Banderas is the 'Biggest Mexican I ever saw,' whose face is always obscured by shadows.  Nobody's safe.<br /><br />My favorite scene, though, was of Salma Hayak strutting across a street in Zaragossa, Coahuila.  Cars collide all around her.  She smiles knowingly.  It's the impact she always has on men.</p></body></html>

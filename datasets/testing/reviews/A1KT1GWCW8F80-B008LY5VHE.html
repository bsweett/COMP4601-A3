<meta name="summary" content="Suspenseful Spielberg"></head><body><p>&quot;Jaws&quot; is literally the original blockbuster movie. Spielberg did a good job in building the suspense by not overtly showing the shark in the first half of the movie, only its victims (or remnants of them). In this regard it is as good or better than any Hitchcock movie. There is no big message in the movie, no big concept. It's pure entertainment.<p>As a one-time surfer in Hawaii, I remember being creeped out for a week or two after seeing the movie.<p>All the actors did a tremendous job. Roy Scheider (police chief), Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and Robert Shaw (boat owner) are stand outs, but the supporting actors, such as Murray Hamilton (mayor) are good, too.<p>Famous for the line &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat&quot; and the cello-based score that only requires 2 notes to define it.<p>The reasonably-priced DVD has the widescreen movie, a good &quot;making of&quot; documentary, deleted scenes and out-takes, and some other minor extras. The movie is currently #83 on the IMDB list.</p></body></html>

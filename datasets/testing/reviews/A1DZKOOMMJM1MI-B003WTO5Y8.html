<meta name="summary" content="What was all that hype for???"></head><body><p>Despite some truly wonderful performances and a solid plot, this film never quite takes off. I am truly angered at how overrated this actually is. Really. It is just a typical cop versus serial killer film. Jodi Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Ted Levine as the psychopath give some truly chilling performances, and Roger Corman has a nice cameo as the FBI director, but this film is definitely not as special as people make it to be. The character of Hannibal Lecter is a great one, and he has some terrific one liners, and despite a few suspenseful moments, this film is very boring. It is exactly like many other serial killer films out there, so what's with all the special attention? It's average film making at best. I do realize that many people will disagree with me, but I really didn't see what all the fuss was about. This movie didn't even make me jump once. It did have it's high points, such as the particularly creepy killer and of course, the immortal Hannibal Lecter, but I was just so bored throughout the whole thing and couldn't understand what was behind all the hype as I sat watching. This is certainly not the greatest modern horror film. The ending didn't even deliver the punch I was so expecting and after sitting through this, I was very disappointed. For a similar subject and a better movie, I suggest &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot;</p></body></html>

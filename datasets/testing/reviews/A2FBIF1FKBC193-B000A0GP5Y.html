<meta name="summary" content="The ORIGINAL is a classic this is a bore ...."></head><body><p>The only reason I gave this poop 2 stars is for the role oc Chris Rock .... unfortunately he doesn't make it through the wole movie ..... I mean what they should have done is gotten rid of the guards, the warden and Sandler himself .....<br /><br />Even Burt Reynolds performace was below standard .... I saw ther original and the charaters no matter how mean and nasty had some redeeming values and that is what made this light hearted movie great..... In the remake the mean charactrers actually came across as mean trust me no comedic value of any kind type of mean ....<br /><br />If you hear anyone lagh during this film it's probably cause they are reading messages an their Blackberry !!!</p></body></html>

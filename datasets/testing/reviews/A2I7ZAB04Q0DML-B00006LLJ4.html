<meta name="summary" content="An Intelligent Thriller With Big Budget Fun!"></head><body><p>It seems contradictory to use the words &quot;blockbuster movie&quot; and &quot;intelligent story&quot; in the same sentence, mostly because the big budget movies that fill the summer season's screens lack any kind of real depth and instead feature dazzling special effects and characters that are dazzling, but completely unbelievable.  So it is interesting to note that, while &quot;Minority Report&quot; dazzles the audience with a future that is slick, cold and high-tech, it also delivers a story that is engaging, challenging and even thought-provoking.<p>Set in the year 2054, &quot;Minority Report&quot; is the story of a new form of law enforcement, an agency called &quot;Pre-Crime&quot; that uses pre-cognative telepaths to hone in on murder victims and murderers before the actual crime takes place.  By forseeing the future, these officers can prevent murders from occurring.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) heads up this department until the pre-cognatives have a vision that depicts Anderton committing the act of murder.  <p>Anderton, confused by the vision, and desperate to clear his name, runs and goes into hiding until he can figure out the meaning of a vision that one of the precognatives shares with him that somehow has to do with his own future actions.<p>Confused?<p>I was too, initially.  The movie, which is far more intricate than my synopsis above suggests, is not a film to be viewed casually.  If you are looking for mindless entertainment, this is not the film for you.  Instead, this film builds layer upon layer, with complex and interesting dialogue between completely developed and believable characters.<p>Anderton, who became an officer of &quot;Pre-Crime&quot; did so because his son was abducted from him, and much of the story surrounds not only the physical events that are occuring to him, but also the emotional impact and ramifications that one, single event had, and how it changed him forever.  Mixed up in a conspiracy that reaches to the very heart of &quot;Pre-Crime&quot;, Anderton must deal with his own guilt, anguish and fear, while trying to determine the cause of the actions that are playing out, leading up to the murder he will ultimately commit.<p>The movie has a very cold look to it.  Spielberg, whose films are known globally, took a very definite approach to this film.  The colors are drab, done largely in blues and greys, and the film itself has a very grainy feel.  The camera work too is shaky, consistent with the type of footage seen in documentaries and shows like &quot;COPS&quot;, giving the film a gritty and dismal look that is far from the glossy images so commonly seen in Spielberg's works.<p>The soundtrack, by John Williams, whose music is heard in most of Spielberg's films, provides a soundtrack that is erie, haunting, beautiful and dark, again, adding a dimension to the stories abysmal feeling.  <p>The action sequences are elaborate, and the effects first rate.  So many films today, especially those that rely heavily on CG animation, tend to look animated, artificial.  The world created here by Industrial Light and Magic is completely convincing, and the effects blend beautifully into the film, even with the grainy look that was achieved by Spielberg while shooting.<p>As a whole, this is a complex, intelligent thriller, with a storyline that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end.  I think that the primary reason this film didn't achieve larger success in the theaters was its marketability compared to many of the other films that were being released at the same time.  Because of the darker tones, this film is not for everyone, but it is definitely a worthwhile experience, and a film that should be viewed multiple times to attain the full experience of the story Spielberg has created.<p>Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

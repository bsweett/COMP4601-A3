If he doesn't find a job, his roommates are going to kick him out of the apartment.<br /><br />He intercepts his roommate Ned's call to substitute at a private elementary school and shows up instead.  He's bored with the gig and doesn't do anything til he discovers that some of his class have exceptional musical talents.<br /><br />Next thing you know, he's got himself a new band and they're practicing for the band competition.  What's great about this film is that Dewey realizes he can't just have the non-musical classmates off on the bench.  He's got to find jobs for everyone--and in so doing, uncovers hidden talents and unites the divided class in purpose. The film may be a comedy, but there are some serious lessons to be learned for educators everywhere.</p></body></html>

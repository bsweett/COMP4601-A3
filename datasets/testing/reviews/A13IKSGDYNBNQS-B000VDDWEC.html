<meta name="summary" content="Zombies on speed"></head><body><p>The main difference between say this and Romero's first two classic zombie films is that here the infected are able to run. This makes them much more dangerous than the slow moving variety in Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Indeed Dawn of the Dead has some strong black comedy elements to it because of the zombies slowness. No such luxury with 28 Days Later, its all pretty scary and relentless. The zombies in this film are humans infected with a Rage virus which can passed on by blood or saliva.<br /><br />As most other reviewers have said the opening scenes in a deserted London are superbly done. Its hard to tell how much CGI work was involved to create the effect but I do know they had permission to close off one of the London Bridges for the early scenes.<br /><br />In the action scenes the film is full of very fast cutting and editing techniques, which I don't normally like, but in this instance it fits in with the conditions the survivors are having to deal with perfectly. Danny Boyle racks up the tension and the film maintains a fast-pace so unlike a lot of films, this one seems shorter than its actual running time (108 mins).<br /><br />Its certainly not for the squeamish, and if you are in any doubt about your horror film stamina, then I'd rent it first (unless its very cheap). However I strongly recommend it.</p></body></html>

If you have to even ask about the story, it's the same movie with a different name. I'm sure they're praying daily to the scientology God for a franchise, but I really hope it just dies.<br /><br />It's basically a chick-flick as well, because it's all about Matthew. He just adores himself.<br /><br />But hey, sometimes we want a stupid action movie to kill 90 minutes so it's got it's place.<br /><br />Wholly un-memorable.</p></body></html>

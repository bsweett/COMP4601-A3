I don't know much about those who mine the stones from the ground or what hardships are suffered by those who transport the gems between the yielding earth and the finger of one's beloved. Perhaps that is the point of "Blood Diamond," which tells the story of one Sierra Leonese family whose lives and fortunes are woven into the greed, violence and intrigue born of the diamond trade.<br /><br />The story of "Blood Diamond" is simple. In the 1980s, factions within Sierra Leone, in Western Africa, used the wealth gained from the diamond trade to buy the arms that fueled a brutal civil war in that nation. More guns made for more diamonds that made for more guns in an endless cycle of death. The interest of various groups and individuals collide in this mix of adventure, greed and brutality. Journalists seek the next big story; industrial mining behemoths seek their business interests; guerrillas seek power; mercenaries seek glory and cash; foreign soldiers seek to impose peace. Caught in the middle are ordinary families trying to live an ordinary, peaceful life.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman whose family life is torn apart by the violence surrounding the diamond trade. Finding himself literally enslaved by it, he one day finds an enormous, rare pink diamond. He attempts to hide it but is spotted by one of his captors. He escapes, and the chase becomes the plot of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a South African mercenary seeking his fortune in the diamond fields. Jennifer Connelly is Maddy Bowen, a journalist looking to make her own fortune in the publishing trade. Along the way, these three help each other toward a deeper awareness of the price of the trade, the hypocrisies of those who profit by denouncing it, and the need to succor those destroyed by it.<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" is incredibly violent, though not especially gory. The battle scenes are rendered with anarchic and gut-clenching verisimilitude. The film does oversimplify the diamond trade by showing it in its worst light. Though it sometimes veers toward clich&eacute; (as with the Wary Renegade who trusts no one but whose actions on behalf of others redeem himself) it succeeds in humanizing a heretofore faceless trade. The diamond that graces your loved one's hand or earlobe may not have caused a family to die in violence. But does it allow the one who mined to live in a shantytown while the executive who runs the company lives in obscene wealth? "Blood Diamond" suggests that the answer to that question should matter.</p></body></html>

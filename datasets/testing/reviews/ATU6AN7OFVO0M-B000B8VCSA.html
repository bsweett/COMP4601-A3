<meta name="summary" content="not as brilliant as the first part, but still good"></head><body><p>Well, it was not as brilliant as the prequel but it's still a good action movie, at least much better than some freaks they make these days. the beginning of the movie was rather intriguing that made it seem boring from the begining but it was good at the rest. its better than an average movie but the DVD was great, full of special features, thanks to the studio. anyway, It's worth to be watched once and buying it for a DVD collection will not be a waste of money. after all, it's a great special edition DVD!</p></body></html>

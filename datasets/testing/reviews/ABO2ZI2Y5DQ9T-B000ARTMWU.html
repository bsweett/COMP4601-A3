<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) 'High Tension' Lives Up To Its Name Except the last 15 Minutes"></head><body><p>`High Tension' has already garnered well-deserved attention from the horror fans, and sure, the content of the film lives up to its title. It is high tension all through; it takes itself very seriously; and it is gory, violent, and most importantly, very scary. But what is remarkable about this French horror (from Europa Corp., Lec Besson's company) is that it has its own style, which proves the talent of the director Alexandre Aja.<br /><br />The film takes up the basic storyline of the 70s horror film when Tobe Hooper or Wes Craven was young. Two college students Marie (Cecile De France) and Alexia (Ma?wenn Le Besco) stay at the house of the latter's family, which is surrounded by the cornfield. With the arrival of the merciless killer, the survival fight begins for Marie and Alexia, but the basic premise is that of a cat-and-mouse game as you will realize in the second chapter.<br /><br />`High Tension' is a literally blood-soaked experience. Extreme violence or bloodbath sometimes becomes unexpectedly funny, but that does not happen in `High Tension.' The film also has references to other films of the genre (the van the killer drives looks like the one in `Jeepers Creepers'), but they never detract the tension that prevails on the screen. Clever use of the sound effect and spooky images is a proof that Aja is a real thing. His orthodox approach has the authentic power of horror films before they become too self-referential.<br /><br />That makes me greatly regret his decision to wrap up the whole film in the way he did. He should not have shot the last 15 minutes of the film. The ending twist has so many incredibly big plot holes. This is not good, but it gets worse when it virtually negates the integrity of the first 80 minutes, which is simply marvelous. If you do something straightforward, and you do it better than any one else, you should keep that way to the end.<br /><br />These complaints aside (and the terrible English dubbing), `High Tension' proves that old-fashioned horror films are not dead. It has much gore and violence, but you cannot help noticing the brilliance of the director who makes good use of them.</p></body></html>

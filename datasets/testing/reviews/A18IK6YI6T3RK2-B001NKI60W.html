<meta name="summary" content="ABBA GOLD"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies, that the critics ravaged, but the public loved.  One thing is for sure, Meryl Steep can do anything, I mean, could this role have been any different than her recent turn as Miranda Priestly?  As for Brosnan, I liked him in this, he gave his all, and get real we all figured he could not hold a tune, I mean, everybody should have one flaw, I mean, right?  Really, you cant beat the ABBA tunes in this, they are so gloriously Disco and the Greek Island local is breathtakingly beautiful.  One thing is for sure, everybody in this seemed to be having the time of their lives and that sort of thing is contagious, whether the film is Citizen Cane or not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ALTMAN is an aquired taste"></head><body><p>A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION is not without merit. It is a quality production and there are some nice little quirky moments, but the problem I had is the same problem I have with a lot of Altman's films of this kind.<br /><br />Most noteably: The Company & Ready to Wear. The PLAYER, being the only exception.<br /><br />There is a tremendous disjointed feeling. Watching the film is like going to a party alone and you don't know anybody and nobody is nice enough to introduce themselves, or more appropriately, being allowed to go back stage of a radio show and nobody cares that you're there. Everybody is talking about random events and things and eventually, you find yourself not caring and find yourself trying to balance an olive and toothpick on your chin.<br /><br />The movie is, in my opinion, too real. Four or five people talking all at the same time. Lindsay Lohan reading a magazine. The characters are quirky and cool to see, but in the same note, 1 dimensional and unexplored.<br /><br />That is why I say ALTMAN is an aquired taste. Many may have the patience to sit through this movie and enjoy it fully. It has nostalgia. Class. High quality entertainers. The camera is constantly at a prespective that leads you to believe you are watching real events playing out in real time.  And still, I found myself bored to death within 30 minutes.<br /><br />Why is this considered to be one of the great films of the year? Beyond me. Maybe it's the respect for Altman? or the slews of A-list actors that love to do his movies, but to me, I'd rather be reading a book or playing with my kids then wasting 2 hours with the PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION. Sorry.</p></body></html>

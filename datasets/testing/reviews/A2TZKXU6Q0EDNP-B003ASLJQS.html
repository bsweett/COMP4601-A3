<meta name="summary" content="Pointlessly convoluted plot.."></head><body><p>This is a classic case of a movie being seriously overhyped by both critics and movie-goers only to prove the classic axiom "don't believe the hype" once again true.<br />  That said hype though is not all non-deserved.<br />"Mystic river" has things going for it that should've made it a great film were it not for a small lil thingie missing: a competent script.<p>  But let's start with the good news first. The cast in this movie is superb as are the performances. Kevin Bacon is not only "as usually good" but gives one of his finest performances. Tim Robbins shows once more his tremendous talent in depicting difficult characters. Lawrence Fishburne, more of the same even though he's not given too much to work with. Sean Penn, well, I happen to like his acting quite a lot, but i think he's the only one that seems to be going through the motions. But the rest of the cast too, the so-called "second characters" are all major quality-acting contributors.<p>  So doesn't "Mystic river" go on then to be a great film? Uhm, no it doesn't.<br />  From the very beginning you have the obvious impression that this is going to be a "whodunnit" flick with some very in-depth social commentary. But that's exactly the problem. As the film progresses you realise it has no depth at all, in fact the more it goes on the shallower it gets and that, mind you, is for a full 2.5 hours which is assumingly the reason the director or the scriptwriter gave themselves that much time: to develop the characters and the plot.<p>  But no. The characters, with zero exception, are all painfully underdeveloped, glass figures acting superbly yes but acting a plot that's not really there (more kudos then for the acting). The story suffers on a multi-level basis. First of all there are serious plotholes and secondly since depth is never achieved the movie also drags and becomes predictable at the same time because you know way too early on that the "killer" the director is trying to trick you into focusing on is indeed innocent and that someone else has done it. <p>By that time though, you dont really care who it is. You cant identify with any of the characters (only exception here being that of Tim Robbins but that's like shooting the proverbial fish in the barel because of the character he plays, someone who was molested as a child).<p>  The plotholes, could've been "overlooked" had the depth and the development of the characters of "Mystic river" been achieved. But instead, the scriptwriter makes a pointlessly convoluted plot that feels deep but when you ask all the questions during and after the film they all come up unanswered: "who are really these people" and "do i care?".<p>  Finding its setting in a typical "working-class" neighborhood where the murder of the daughter of one of the main characters spawns not only the investigation of the police but that of the community as well, and where archetypical concepts kick in such as the urge for revenge, Mystic river should easily have been the vehicle for a an intricate critique on human nature and the dynamics (positive and negative) of human relationships through tragedies. But no again. Whether you'd read about such a story in the papers with the lightweight analysis usually accompanying them or saw this film is one and the same: superficiality is the main dish.<p>  All in all a pity considering how many aces the director (Clint Eastwood) holds up his sleeve but i think that Clint -when behind the camera- has shown that he's mostly willing to give life as lived by humans a very simplistic and rarely convincing look.<p>  And it's this simplistic, borderline-superficial approach that ultimately ruins the whole thing.<br />  Two stars for the great cast and the even greater acting. An extra minus star for the generic and terribly boring soundtrack written by the director himself...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It has relevance, both historic and artistic, yet the originality of this film is limited by its microscopic scope."></head><body><p>Relying on flash backs, personlized lines of dialogue and that murky, colorless look that seems the staple of dehuminizing war films, I was really uninterested in what was supposed to be a refreshing film of complete originality. The idea is, of course, new and as uncharted as some of the tunnels that still remain hidden on that island. Instead of a faceless enemy, we have an intimate movie about the enemy forces of World War II. showing in desperation their cultural clash with our own. The rare glimpse of their own terrors and ideas. The terrible realization that suicide is a last option embraced by commanders and public opinion at saving face. These all make for rare, and splendid movie making, and in no better hands than the genre charging Clint Eastwood, yet smothered by stories, perhaps heard once too many times, of the soldiers lives. I just could not be energized from my cold state in watching time after time another personlized attempt to force feed my embrace of the characters by cheesy sob stories of their past. It was too hollywood scripted. I was dissapointed to say the least. The battle scenes are so scarce and hidden in smoke and fog, that you feel on the outside of all the violence to a point of frustration. No matter what anyone impresses upon me about the milestones of this film, I will never see anything beyond my own boredom of this film.</p></body></html>

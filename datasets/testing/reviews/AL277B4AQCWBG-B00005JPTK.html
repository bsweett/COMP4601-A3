<meta name="summary" content="Not the book, but not bad"></head><body><p>Faithless adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic sci-fi novel still manages to be engaging in its own right, thanks largely to the onscreen appeal of that one-man box-office juggernaut, Will Smith - and his dog. The terrifically tense staging of some sequences compensates, surprisingly, for a largely plotless and hole-ridden narrative and some clunky digital effects. Purists be warned: this is not the book you read, but it's still more speculative fiction than popcorn movie.</p></body></html>

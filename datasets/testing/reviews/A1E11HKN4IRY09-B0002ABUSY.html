<meta name="summary" content="Finally, a GREAT zombie flick."></head><body><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD rocks.  A great hybrid of action/horror/comedy, this film hits the mark where many have failed.  Where 28 DAYS LATER starts out decent, but takes itself too seriously and RESEDENT EVIL ends up a slipshod version of a video game that's actually more cinematic and eerily realized than the film, is exactly where DOTD triumphs.  Given a decent budget, a fine cast, a fun script, and inventive, assured direction by ZACK SNYDER, this is THE modern zombie movie that gets it right.  A thoroughly enjoyable splatterfest of thrills and chills that does the original film proud whilst staking it's claim as it's own great flick.  Good horror is hard to come by, but this will please fans of both ends of the genere spectrum-the actually creepy to those who like 'em bloody.  DAWN OF THE DEAD delivers.</p></body></html>

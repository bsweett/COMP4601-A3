<meta name="summary" content="An essential chapter in movie-making history"></head><body><p>Disney's first foray into full-length feature animation was unsurprisingly measured a risky move for the studio that were best known for short Mickey Mouse and Sillie Symphony cartoons. But thankfully, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was acknowledged with critical eulogize and box office achievement, prompting the studio to continue making feature-length caricatures. This is an essential chapter in movie-making history, with so many amazing features; it really does define the word `classic'. One of my much treasured Disney movies, Snow White has all the staple ingredients for archetypal animation: a great story, fantastic animation, catchy songs and amazing imagery that still impresses after nearly 70 years. A perennial favorite, it paved the way for other grand movies (Pinocchio, Bambi, Fantasia, Dumbo et all) The DVD has great 'making of' material, including never before seen archive footage.  A must-have for Disney and film fans alike.</p></body></html>

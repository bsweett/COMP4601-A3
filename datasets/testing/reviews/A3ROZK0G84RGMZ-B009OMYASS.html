<meta name="summary" content="Absolute Gore Flick, Not Scary, Worth Seeing!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is very worth seeing.  Don't expect to be jumping or screaming because that's not where the fear lies in this movie.  It is pure gore.  Doesn't every horror flick have alot of sex and violence??<br /><br />I guess the real fear in this movie is being trapped, helpless, waiting to get mutilated and die.</p></body></html>

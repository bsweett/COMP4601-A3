<meta name="summary" content="Very Funny Romantic Comedy"></head><body><p>It really has become noticable to professionals in the film industry and his legion of fans across the world, that Will Smith, since his role in "Six degrees of Separation", (1993) in the role of Paul, a brilliant performance, and Independence Day (1996) as Captain Steven Hiller, this energized and gifted actor cannot set a foot wrong. Smith's latest release in the adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, "I am Legend", is absolutely extraordinary. However, "Hitch" (2005), reveals Smith's versatility as a comedic and dramatic actor. Hitch is a light a breezy romantic comedy about an anonymous "date doctor" who teaches nerds to get the women they desire. His tecniques work every time, until he meets a gossip jounalist, Sara Melas, (Eva Mendes) who presents a challenge for this charming "woman expert".<br /><br />There are some very funny scenes in this film, including the dance scene, where Albert Brennerman (Kevin James) shows Hitch his knowledge of dances, all particulary lame and so funny, this had audiences falling off their seats with laughter.<br /><br />My only criticism of this very funny film is I believe Eva Mendes' performance slightly strained as if she was trying just a little too hard, almost appearing to be over the top.<br /><br />In terms of plot, this is a typical boy meets girl film with a joyful ending, but what makes it is Will Smith and Kevin James, a great and unexpected brilliant comedy team.<br /><br />Good Fun.</p></body></html>

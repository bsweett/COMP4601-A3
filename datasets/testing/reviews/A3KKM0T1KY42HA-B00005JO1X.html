<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Story If Your Kids Can Make It Through 2+ Hours"></head><body><p>I'll bet the kids would enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ALIG0G">Time Bandits</a>....It's a star-studded 1981 fantasy about a kid that accidentally hooks up with a band of hoodlum dwarfs as they pass through a magic time travel porthole. It moves fast, has lots of action, but the FX are very...well...1981.<br /><br />So I heard about Chronicles of Narnia where a bunch a siblings find a way into another dimension, and thought, "Perhaps this is a modern day Time Bandits for my kids."<br /><br />There were some similarities:<br /><br />Narnia: Kids travel through magic porthole in wardrobe to Narnia.<br />Time Bandits: Kid travels through magic porthole in wardrobe through space & time.<br /><br />Narnia: Good vs evil.<br />Time Bandits: Good vs. evil.<br /><br />Narnia: A Witch and mystical creatures.<br />Time Bandits: A Warlock and mystical creatures.<br /><br />Narnia: Good, of course, ultimately prevails.<br />Time Bandits: Good, of course, ultimately prevails.<br /><br />You get the idea. The story is pretty much the same, but all the names have changed.<br /><br />Narnia is a long one too. One of my kids gave up completely and another was playing Gameboy and only "1/2 watching" at the 2 hour mark. Another thought "it was okay". I also thought it was just okay.<br /><br />Narnia is visually cool. The story is pretty easy to follow for kids without a parent having to do much, if any, PGing. But it should have been cut down by 30 or so minutes.<br /><br />So if Narnia was no thrill, I wonder if the kids would prefer Time Bandits with its 1981 special effects? We'll have to perhaps give that a try after they view their most recent request: Shark Boy and Lava Girl. Oy.<br /><br />One other thing: the price of Disney DVDs seem very high. Go with a rental or buy it used.</p></body></html>

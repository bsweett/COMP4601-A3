<meta name="summary" content=""Look at little Goblin, Jr. You gonna cry?""></head><body><p>Going into this one, I was wondering if Sam Raimi would be able to top himself in the wake of his magnus opus SPIDER-MAN 2. Bluntly, the answer is no. But, listen, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much worth dropping your hard-earned dollars for. SPIDEY 2 was a five star film, this one rates as a four starrer and remains a quintessentially fun summer blockbuster picture.<br /><br />The special effects are seamless. CG Venom and the Sandman look great, while CG Spidey continues to astound. Admittedly, I wasn't too impressed with how the Goblin looked. You really gotta hand it to Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle epic superhero battles. In various fabulous faceoffs, Spidey takes on the Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom and, each time, our hero doesn't walk away without leaving a piece of himself on the floor. Even though we knew Spidey was going to come out on top, the fight scenes are credible and effective enough that he seems to be the underdog in each encounter. I have absolutely no complaints with the Spidey sequences.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 3 is again very well served with returning supporting actors J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson (hilarious!) and the sexy Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant (more, please). Sam Raimi's buddy, Bruce Campbell, has a funny bit as a Maitre d', Mageina Tovah as the landlord's daughter brightens up the room with her endearing if skeletal presence, Stan Lee provides the obligatory cameo ('nuff said), Bryce Dallas Howard is essentially wasted as Gwen Stacy, and Rosemary Harris is the usual boring fount of wisdom.<br /><br />Folks have already mentioned the overstacking of supervillains and the onerousness of the multiple plot stories. I say, "Phooey" to that. I was able to track every story arc with ease and keep up with every character. In my opinion, the villains are drawn with just enough depth and are given ample back stories. By virtue of having been in every film installment, Harry Osbourne comes off as the most layered antagonist. James Franco, whom I normally dislike, is very good here. Flint Marko, aka The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), is immediately revealed to be a sympathetic character as the audience, early on, becomes privy to his core motivation. Eddie Brock (a puny and miscast Topher Grace), however, is just plain bad egg. Now, there's a chance that newcomers to the Spidey mythos might be befuddled with the abrupt introduction of the inky, wriggly alien symbiote. Furthermore, Raimi then ignores the symbiote for lengthy film moments, opting to leave it in residence at Peter's cramped apartment to bide its time. Raimi is seemingly relying on the fans' knowledge of the alien costume to carry the day in lieu of actually sketching out some sort of a backstory. Not that there's much of a backstory on it in the comic book source. SECRET WARS, anyone?<br /><br />Hands down, Spidey's my favorite superhero. Like a host of kids, of the plethora of superheroes, it's Peter Parker with whom I identified the most when I was a mere tadpole. What makes him such a rootable underdog character is that Stan Lee and the ensuing comic book writers portrayed him as a sensitive teen/young man with relatable dilemmas who ekes out small victories in life even as he trounces heinous superbaddies. This film strays away from what makes him so likable. The start of SPIDER-MAN 3 finds a smug Peter Parker as Spiderman has become the toast of New York. His image is displayed on giant monitors and he is lauded in the newspapers (excepting the Bugle, of course). He even is presented with the key to the city. This same scene also comes up with an act by Peter as Spidey which is blatantly disrespectful towards Mary Jane. In fact, the success of his Spider-Man persona blinds him to what's going on with Mary Jane, whose career isn't flowing as smoothly. Understandibly, it's not too long before M.J. begins to feel that Peter isn't there for her. Suffice it to say, while I loved every Spidey sequence, there are moments here where I genuinely did not like Peter Parker.<br /><br />Or put another way, my dissatisfaction with Peter is actually a nod towards Kirsten Dunst's very effective performance. She's easily the best actor in this film and is so likable as Mary Jane that every thoughtless act by Peter towards her exacerbated my resentment towards the dude. I'm just not kosher with plotlines necessitating my hero to act like an obtuse jerk. And, since I'm crapping on the poor guy, I must say the hairstyle he chooses when under the symbiote's influence is less than cool. If it was supposed to emphasize his dark turn, it failed miserably, and the film, in my eyes, lost some credibility. The audience, including me, burst out laughing every time that goofy downswept hairstyle popped up. Unintended laughter - it's not a good thing.<br /><br />But I want to reiterate: Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. He got me thru junior high school (middle school, to you youngsters) and high school. I hated to criticize this movie, but it would've been wrong to merely leave it as a glowing review and to ignore the warts. Yet, with its flaws, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much a sensational movie, and I do feel that, ultimately, its positives outweigh the negatives. Tobey Maguire is the definitive Peter Parker, no matter what. I can't really envision anyone else in that role. Dunst, as always, is superlative and very lovely and oozes acting talent. The complex story, in spite of hitting a few false notes, did keep me involved. The action scenes are eyepopping, nothing at all wrong with them. Sam Raimi playfully continues to throw in insane gag bits and incidental, low key humor (for some reason, I like the doorknob bit). There's even several brief dance numbers, and it's up to you to laugh and go with it or groan and grouse. Most, hopefully, will do the former.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sweet film"></head><body><p>Juno is a sweet enough film despite the subject matter. However, it is not really clich&eacute; as far as films like this go. There is no question about what exactly Juno wants to do with the baby, there is no obnoxious babbling regretful baby daddy or angry pissed off parents. It feels different than all those other films. Ellen Page is perfect for this role. She is barely even acting, its like watching someone in real life. She is what makes this film work. There are sweet tender moments and comedic parts as well. I couldn't help getting a tad teary-eyed at times. As far as all the praise it got during awards season, that was a bit too much in my estimation. It is a cute enough film, just nothing spectacular or terribly unique.</p></body></html>

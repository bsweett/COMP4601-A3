<meta name="summary" content="A Strange Allegory"></head><body><p>Oops, should be one star. Why can't we change that?<br /><br />First of all, the movie itself was tedious. Watching Diesel in those goggles is painful. Hearing him deliver those lines ... more painful. Not that anyone in this movie fares much better; there is a lot of grimacing and gritting of teeth - probably a physical reaction from having to deliver those lines - while the numerous sci-fi cliches play out (the prison being the most tired of all).<br /><br />But in the core of the movie, there's a surprise!<br /><br />Let's see ... the guards of Helion Prime look like Christian Knights ... there's that Muslim Imam from Pitch Black ... Judi Dench talks about fire and water, air and earth, perhaps representing paganism or Greek philosophy ... or, as she says, calculation, which would be cold logic ...<br /><br />Oddly enough, this movie seems to be an allegory - Darwinism's (or liberalism's) long war against religion and reason - convert to our way or die. No other faiths are allowed, as in Richard Dawkins' wildest fantasies. (Dawkins has intimated that doubters of evolutionism are evil or wicked. As Behe has pointed out, it's not a big step from saying people are wicked to doing something about that wickedness.)<br /><br />The Darwinist's weapons are technological, perhaps representing their faith in science and progress. Their reasoning is soupy and, along with their faith, is quasi-religious, demanding the surrender of individual reason and choice. Conversion is not of the mind of heart, but by coercion. Join or die; like join or your career dies, like that of Virginia Steen-McIntyre, whose radiometric dates for ancient tools were a couple of hundred thousand years too old and was banned from her field of science, or the hapless graduate students who dared to write papers pointing out Darwinism's flaws.<br /><br />Thus the Lord Marshall's "Take it on faith," the Darwinist mantra.<br /><br />The Necromongers' fascination with death mirrors the neo-liberal culture of death, and Darwinism's faith in the creative power of death. The communication device using some sort of human being brings to mind Darwinism's and Marxism's machinistic view of human life - we are just tools to spread our genes, we are just instruments of the State.<br /><br />As the Lord Marshall has seen the Underverse and returned, so has Darwinism died a thousand deaths, stabbed to death by evidence ("Forbidden Archeology" by Cremo, OOPARTS, etc.) and reason ("Darwin's Black Box" by Behe), only to be resurrected by unreason.<br /><br />Who would've thought?</p></body></html>

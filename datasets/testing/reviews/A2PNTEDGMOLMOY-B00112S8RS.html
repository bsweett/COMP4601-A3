<meta name="summary" content="Grim, depressing film of the death of a horrible family"></head><body><p>Sidney Lumet's "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a two-hour romp for any sadist who revels in emotional rather than physical torment.  It's hard to say if this is a good movie - I am in such a foul mood after watching it that I can't appreciate its merits.<br /><br />I guess if the movie aims to make you depressed, and you emerge depressed, then it must be good.  Oh well.<br /><br />A first-rate cast elevates a dark story. Two brothers, Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke), are circling their respective drains.  On the surface, Hank is the worse off - divorced and crippled by child support payments and an incapacity to think for himself.  Andy is apparently more successful - a high-flying corporate executive, married to Marisa Tomei (who we see a *lot* of), and suave in his chunky way.  But in many ways, Andy is much worse off.<br /><br />To save themselves, Andy and Hank agree to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store.  This goes badly, and the movie follows Hank and Andy's downfall.  This is dark, tortured stuff as the botched crime rips open old family wounds and exposes new secrets.<br /><br />This is a feel-bad movie.  Unfortunately, unlike "Boys Don't Cry," this isn't a great feel-bad movie.  A chopped chronology reeks of dozens of indy movies since "Pulp Fiction," and there is hardly a moment of hope or levity to lighten the mood one iota.  Save for the good performances, this movie is not a recommendation.</p></body></html>

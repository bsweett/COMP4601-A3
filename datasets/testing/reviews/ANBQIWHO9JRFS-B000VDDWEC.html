Well, I guess I'll say right up front that '28 Days Later' may be the greatest zombie movie ever.  Or perhaps what I'd actually say is that '28 Days Later', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'Shaun of the Dead' are all both so great and so different from one another that I couldn't really say that one was 'better' than the  other.  'NotlD' is the masterpiece of despair, 'DotD' is just so distinctive and odd, and 'Shaun' is funny. (duh) I suppose '28 Days Later' may be the most straight forward of them, as it works most from a dramatic and human interest standpoint.  As others have said this isn't just  a horror movie, it just kinda qualifies as one by default, due to it's apocalyptic nature and the zombies and whatnot.  The horror is largely clustered at the beginning and end, and although it is very good, it's really no more significant than the more dramatic material between it.  '28 Days Later' is populated by some of the most sympathetic, likable characters you're likely to find in any genre, and this is what makes the movie works, as much as anything.  It's quite a powerful movie, really.  Thematically, it's primarily interested in resiliency of the spirit and the ability to deal with tragedy.  These are terribly common themes, of course, but this film makes them work a lot better than most others do.<br /><br />Of course, lotsa people out there are gonna try and tell me this isn't a zombie film, but these people can piss off.  I'll admit it, upon first hearing about this movie, prior to the US release, it didn't sound like it was really a zombie movie: they aren't dead, they don't eat flesh, as far as we can tell.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the infected individuals in the movie *look* and *act* just like zombies: They attack humans on sight, without weaponry, while ignoring other infected individuals; they have no apparent intelligence; they spread disease through physical contact, and they're all icky.  The fact that they're alive shouldn't matter, because being undead doesn't actually signify anything, necessarily.<br /><br />As you certainly know, this film involves the decimation of England due to an outbreak of 'rage', a disease which, naturally, causes people to pretty much act like zombies.  Our main character, Jim, was injured in a bike wreck just prior to the outbreak, and wakes up in the hospital 4 weeks later.  Other than this, the film doesn't really have that much of a plot.  It's sorta a slice of life from the post-apocalyptic world, as it is primarily interested in Jim's meeting with and bonding with other people, and the continued search for any other survivors.  This is a reasonable arc, as the film is more about character and mood than it is about any over arching scheme.  The film also develops a real sense of tragedy and desolation that is often inexplicably missing from this sorta film.  Sure, we all know that it would be highly upsetting if the world were to end tomorrow, but most of apocalyptic films fail to make me feel the loss. This one succeeds.<br /><br />The endless, severe tragedy of the opening gives way to the generally violence free and relatively lighthearted middle section, as our group searches for a military base.  Nothing much happens in most of these scenes, but they reveal the humanity of the characters, and show that most of the time, life just goes on.  Here the central theme comes out.  Early in the film, the hardened Selena says, flatly, `Surviving is as good as it gets'.  The film itself counters this, more or less saying that if just surviving is as good as it gets, than their really isn't much point in surviving any longer.  Again, perhaps an obvious point, but the film really makes you believe it.<br /><br />As always, I finally lose patience with looking at it in an overall perspective, and just have to talk about some specific scenes.  Early in the film, the Mark character gives a brief monologue about the death of his family.  This is a truly chilling scene, which can't help but remind me of Ben's monologue from `NotlD'.  Also, `28 Days Later' has one of the most tragic, gut-wrenching death scenes I've ever come across.  I can't go into specifics, naturally, but it's really powerful.  Finally, though many have complained about the climax, I like it quite a lot.  It's truly intense, with some brutal, if not particularly gory violence.  It's largely helped by the slowly building and brilliant post-rock score. (People love to rave about the use of GYBE towards the beginning, but I think the original score at the end works even better.)<br /><br />I have no real complaints about the film.  The performances are all great, and the direction controlled and adept, with a kinetic, visceral feel without being so formless and out of control as so many recent films.  They do perhaps over use the frame removal stuff a bit, but this is no big problem.  Overall, I think it works quite well, but it woulda worked even better  if they'd held back a little more.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  Great movie.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

In the film, Superman (Brandon Routh) left Earth five years ago when astronomers discovered the remains of his home planet of Krypton.  Having to be certain that there was nothing left there, Superman left on an odyssey across the universe.  In the meantime, life on Earth went on.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) was tired of waiting and became disillusioned and wrote an editorial entitled "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" which finally netted her a Pulitzer.  She also birthed a son and became engaged to Perry White's nephew (James Marsden).  Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) went to jail and after years of good behavior was released early and immediately began planning his next diabolical plan.  All the while, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) kept taking pictures.  As for the rest of the planet, the Average Joes struggled to live in a world that increasingly became more violent, turbulent, and destructive.<br /><br />Having been released from prison, Lex Luthor befriends an extremely wealthy heiress and on her deathbed has her sign a will that leaves her entire fortune to him.  Using his newly acquired wealth, Luthor travels with his new squeeze, Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), to Superman's hideout, The Fortress of Solitude.  Once there, he ease drops on some of the boy in blue's personal tapes from his Dad and steals some of the crystals.  Later he breaks into a museum and steals some kryptonite.  Meanwhile, Lois is having an emotional breakdown as she tries to figure out her life now that Superman has returned.  As for Clark Kent, he's busy trying to fit back into work at the Planet after having been gone for a five-year world tour and Superman is out saving the world: everything from stopping a space shuttle from crashing to rescuing a stray animal from a tree.  Everything seems to go according to Lex Luthor's plans.<br /><br />Superman has always been one of my favorite superheroes and there's not a whole lot that one can complain about in SUPERMAN RETURNS.  It is true that in style and structure, SUPERMAN RETURNS closely follows in the footsteps of SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II while completely ignoring SUPERMAN III and SUPERMAN IV.  There are scenes in the movie that are very similar to scenes in SUPERMAN, several lines are copied directly from that movie, and Luthor's motivation is the same as the first film, too.  Nevertheless, with some solid acting from most of the cast (Routh doesn't get an opportunity to do much of his own acting--most of the time he's re-enacting Reeve's performance), state of the art special effects, and a great story, director Bryan Singer does an excellent job of keeping the golden boy tied to his roots, but allowing him to enter the 21st Century.  As Lois Lane discovers, maybe the world really needs Superman after all.</p></body></html>

The story is, you know, not so great as some say, but not so bad either.  In a nutshell, Jason, still haunted by the fragmentary memories of his past, is framed again by someone whose identity is so obvious to us.<br /><br />[ONE GREAT ADDITION] But despite the film's many plot holes and contrived (and often silly) situations, Matt Damon is in great shape as Jason, the hero or deadly killing machine.  But most remarkable acting comes not from him, but from Joan Allen as Pamela Landy as leader of one botched CIA operation, who doggedly searchs for the truths behind the failure, Jason Bourne and his backgrounds.  Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, and Brian Cox return as the same characters as before, but their characters are not as memorable as Joan Allen's, who is most convincing in otherwise completely fictional world.<br /><br />[CAMERA WILL SHAKE, RATTLE, ROLL]  But what a hectic actions!  Sadly director Paul Greengrass nearly ruined the otherwise hair-raising actions with his shaky handy camera shots, which made me dizzy while looking at the screen.  Don't get me wrong.  His method might have worked in another field, like a suspence drama with a more social theme.<br /><br />In fact, the final car chase is one of the best in recent years, accompanied by a rousing score.  My vote goes to that of 'Ronin' but 'Bourne Supremacy' comes very close to that sphere.  But Paul Greengrass's ducumentary touch camerawork which follows the objects in a too hectic fashion should be called an utterly misguided idea.  Who needs a documentary touch when you see a film based on Robert Ludlum (no offence).  It's 100 % escapism in a good sense.<br /><br />Nest time please use a steady camera angle, show the stunts's jobs clearly (and the stunts themselves must be simply great, I imagine), and give us more thrills.  That's what we want in actions, not a documentary touch.  And more Julia Stiles, too.</p></body></html>

It can happen here, and a society that abandons  its youth to lives of hopelessness and impoverishment will learn the  lessons of history if it doesn't do more to rectify the causes underlying  such hate and discontent. This is a tough, gritty, and violent look at the  complex problems associated with race, poverty, and hopelessness that  pervade our inner cities and prey especially upon the young and vulnerable  teens trapped by life circumstance into these kinds of confrontations.  While George W. Bush waxes on so dreamily about his proposed Presidency not  "leaving a single child behind", the reality of the situation is quite  different; the stark economic realities of contemporary America is that  more and more urban youth are being abandoned and isolated in the midst of  all this unbelievable affluence for others. <p>The movie is set up as a  kind of morality play; Edward Norton is a newly ex-convict hoping to turn  his life around by disassociating himself from the neo-Nazi group that led  him astray into a life of hate, violence, and murder a few years before.  Still, his younger brother, played well by Edward Furlong, is fascinated by  the power and allure of the neo-Nazis. As the movie progresses, we become  more familiar with just how it is that both brothers have become so  indoctrinated by hate, and left so susceptible to the racist messages of  the extremists. All of the cast, from Norton to Furlong to Eliot Gould to a  host of others are excellent, and this gripping story of how easily hate,  distrust, and violence beget more of the same is a sorry statement of what  the not so benign neglect of the society toward its less fortunate sons and  daughters can result in. This is an excellent movie and is one I highly  recommend.</p></body></html>

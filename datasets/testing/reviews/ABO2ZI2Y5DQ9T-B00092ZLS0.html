<meta name="summary" content="Freewheel Thriller with a Twist Which Is Not Exactly New"></head><body><p>A recently widowed doctor Robert DeNiro leaves the city with his only daughter Dakota Fanning.  They start to live a new life in quiet countryside, a deserted summer place this time, and he comes to realize that his move might be a mistake.  If you find any originality in this story, 'Hide and Seek' is your film.  If I sound a little sarcastic, I say I'm sorry, but so many thrillers seek their background in this kind of land of nowhere that I started to feel like yelling 'Not again.'  Oh, and the title!  This unoriginal title should not be confused with another 'Hide and Seek' made only 6 years ago.  At least they should have done something to that.<br /><br />But DeNiro's 'Hide and Seek' is not without entertainment value.  Though the film's main body is made from parts from other thrillers, it starts mildly interesting.  DeNiro plays Dr. David Callaway, who lost his wife Alison (Amy Irving) in a terrible situation, and their only daughter Lucy (Fanning), witnessing the scene, is traumatized by the shock.  They leave the city, and begin to live quietly in the countryside (which is conviniently only one hour's drive away from the city where Lucy's doctor Famke Jansen lives).<br /><br />But you know, Lucy starts to act weirdly, talking about her imaginary frined named Charlie.  She insists Charlie often comes to their house, and does a wicked thing or two.  The tricks Charlie (or whatever) does on them get worse as the story goes on, and finally Lucy herself is out of control.  Well, it seems so at first.<br /><br />Like M. Night Shyamalan thrillers, 'Hide and Seek' tries to be atomospheric, and at times it succeeds.  See, for example, who plays the local sheriff jingling the bundle of keys, who might be a bit too officious.  It's Dylan Baker, yes, who played the daddy who did a very bad thing to a kid in 'Happiness.'  It's good casting, for Dylan Baker could be very unpredictable, and he is a good actor.<br /><br />But it turns out differently.  For all the participations of ever-reliable Dylan Baker and equally-reliable Elizabeth Shue, the things go on like autopilot.  For all the good (and in a sense, very scary) acting from Dakota Fanning, any fans of thrillers can read the next step of the film.  Here's a doll!  There's a cat!!  The girl is looking at the sinister-looking woods!!!  You can guess what will happen next.<br /><br />Yes, I know, except that part, which the Fox Studio is so eager to protect that to reavel it here would involve you and me into an unwelcome lawsuit, so I won't write it.  You have to see it, and perhaps, just perhaps, you may be impressed with it.  Me?  Well, I admit it was unexpected, but at the same time the twist does not heighten the suspence at all.  Actually, it is an amateur's touch which destroys the professional acting from Fanning, whose Lucy character is the only mysterious part of the film.  In short, Fanning's well-measured performance is wasted to show this big, implausible, and silly surprise.<br /><br />Finally, here is what I want to ask: how many people still remember Robert DeNiro in the 70s or 80s?  Oh, he was such a sensation.  Not exactly a money-making star (which I do not say is a bad thing per se), but the name of DeNiro meant something awe-inspiring.  I enjoyed 'Analyse This' and 'Meet the Parents,' but I didn't expect 'Analyse That' was coming.  Neither his awful self-parody of Travis in 'Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'  Then, the mafioso boss in 'Shark Tales.'  What ever happened to him anyway?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Interesting Movie with a Twist"></head><body><p>I had been curious about this movie for awhile and was glad to have the opportunity to watch it.<br /><br />The key to the movie is Sam Rockwell who is effective and convincing as Sam Bell who is the only Moon based employee of a large corporation with a mining operation on the moon. Sam's "companion" a computer named Gerty reminds one of "2001 A Space Odyssey;" there is a major point of deviation in the ending with Gerty responding very differently from the HAL computer during the climax of the story.<br /><br />The story starts as Sam is nearing completion of a three year contract and is more than ready to go home and see his wife and little girl. The suspense begins to build very nicely when it appears he's not alone on the Moon and then hints begin to be dropped as to what might be actually going on and finally suspicions are confirmed by the end of the movie.<br /><br />If you are a science fiction fan I think you will definitely enjoy it; I found it interesting and worth the time.</p></body></html>

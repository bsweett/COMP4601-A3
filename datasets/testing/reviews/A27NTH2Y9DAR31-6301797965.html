<meta name="summary" content="&quot;PARDON ME BOY...IS THIS THE TRANSYLVANIA STATION?&quot;"></head><body><p>&quot;Yah, yah, track twenty-nine...I hope you make it in time!&quot; Non stop gags; a terrific atmosphere, worthy of the classic Universal Frankenstein movies we all know and love...James Whale would have LOVED this! Whenever the name Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) is mentioned, the horses go into a frenzy of neighs; GREAT stuuf. At night in the graveyard, Igor (Pronounced EYE-GORE) and Wilder are digging up a corpse (digging because Igor took the wrong brain...Abby Normal!) for their nefarious lab work; Wilder starts complaining and Igor (Feldman) says: &quot;Could be worse....could be raining.&quot; No sooner are the words out of his mouth then we hear a terrific crash of thunder, then see lightning, and then the skies open up. Then Igor says: &quot;I have a hunch...&quot; This is so funny it can make you sick from laughing; when Peter Boyle, as Frankenstein's Monster, launches into his famous &quot;Puttin' on the Ritz&quot; you are pretty much over the edge and barely able to breathe any more. One of my favorite lines is when Igor is driving Wilder to the Castle and there is a howl in the distance; Wilder says nervously: &quot;What was that?&quot; And Igor replies: &quot;Werewolf.&quot; Wilder: &quot;Werewolf?&quot; Igor: &quot;There...wolf.&quot;<br />Feldman, Wilder and Cloris Leachman are wonderful in this, and it was shot, appropriately, in black and white. I was fortunate enough to be at the studio when this was being shot and went onto the set and opened a door in the Castle and there were Peter Boyle, Wilder and Feldman all sitting around a table, taking a break...and Boyle had the most sickening shade of green make-up all over his face; he looked terrific. the sets were fantastic, and it was a thrill to be allowed to see them all. Great stuff and a very funny movie.</p></body></html>

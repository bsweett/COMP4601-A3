The time of the film is 1805, when Napoleon was seeking to conquer Europe, and England had declared war.  The film is based on the historical fiction novels of the same title by Patrick O'Brian.<br /><br />Russel Crowe heads an excellent cast as Captain "Lucky Jack" Jack Aubrey, a hard-headed, disciplined military man bent on capturing the Archeron at all costs.  Paul Bettany plays Aubrey's opposite, a gentle, intellectual doctor who is ship surgeon and naturalist.  Maturin and Aubrey are constantly butting heads, making M & C kind of a high-seas buddy pic.<br /><br />The story is tightly paced and the music score is low-key.  It is music you might expect to hear watching a chess match, rather than swelling orchestral strains one expects during these types of historical pictures.  But indeed, the deadly stalking of the two ships is very much like a chess game.<br /><br />I loved this exciting, old-fashioned movie.<br /><br />The film is available to watch in Spanish and French dubs and subs.<br /><br />Unless you have a remote on whatever machine you are watching this DVD on, you cannot access special features.  I watch mine on a laptop, so I was out of luck.  Shame on the DVD designers for this poor menu design.  The only thing I could access was something called an "Inside Look" that I thought was an inside look at the film.  Instead, it was just previews!  Boo!</p></body></html>

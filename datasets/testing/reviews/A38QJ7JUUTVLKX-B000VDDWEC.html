<meta name="summary" content="Okay it's scary as what?"></head><body><p>Okay, now that I've watched this again, I can now say that it wasn't as bad as I thought. The reason I lashed out at this film like a child is because of the hype. Believe me this movie is over-hyped. It's not as scary as the previews and critics would have you think. The psychological part of the film is pretty scary and plausible, and the scenes of the movie are geniunely creepy. But anyway on to the plot: Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find London deserted--until he runs into a mob of crazed plague victims. He gradually finds other still-human survivors (including Naomie Harris), with whom he heads off across the abandoned countryside to find the source of a radio broadcast that promises salvation. 28 Days Later is basically an updated version of The Omega Man and other post-apocalyptic visions; but while the movie may lack originality, and intelligence, it has a plausible premise. This is NOT A ZOMBIE FILM! They are people infected with a disease that causes them to go mad. With plot holes galor this film is no Citizen Kane. And what was with that stupid soldier scenes? They were stupid! Their are alot of faults in this film, but it's fun for a horror film. More of a sci-fi movie though, cuz it isn't particualarly scary. I mean the audience I watched it with weren't scared that often, and a 5 year old girl was laughing basically at all the "scares". I will admit that this film wasn't genuinely scary, but it is interesting, even though it lacks common sense. For better and real zombie movies check out Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Return of the Living Dead. 3.5 Stars for this average horror flick.</p></body></html>

Are you satisfied when you love somebody and that somebody love you back?  Do you yearn to have the feeling of love even when you know that both of you are living a pack of lies?  When the love is gone, do you let that other person go?  Isn't it that when you love somebody, you set them free?  Isn't love selfish, though?  When you can't have them or won't have them, do you intentionally wish to inflict hurt and emotionally scar to others?  Love is an intangible and subjective being.  It's not there and yet, it's there.  "Closer" is an autopsy (deliberately clinical in this instance) of love, loved, in and out of love.  Jude Law portrays a character, Dan that is a splitting image of his true self.  Can readers recall of him having a fling with his nanny when he was already engaged to Sienna Miller, and who he had a relationship with when he was not technically divorced from his first wife?  Talking about art imitates real life?  Then, there's Natalie Portman in her breaking or coming of age role as a stripper.  She does reveal a lot of flesh in this instance and I simply couldn't get over the fact that Princess Amidala was doing lap dance for Clive Owen!  Julia Roberts plays a photographer who captures portraits of sad and lonely people.  Perhaps, she sees her own self in their reflections and in this movie, she would bounce from one relationship to one another and back again because she doesn't wish to be hurt emotionally no more.  Clive's character as a dermatologist is the most lucid character here, brutally frank and honest or a straight shooter.  From outset, he might look like a brute but as the movie dwelves deeper, we start to understand that what you see is what you get from him.  To simplify the description here, ladies here in the form of Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are those that have built fortress around themselves so that their emotions become unscathed from any relationships that didn't work out their ways, Jude Law is a conniving and selfish lover who interprets love as he pleases and guys that rationalise their doings as the right things to do when they leave a lot of casualties along the way and lastly, Clive is those men that are caught in the crossfire, someone who is realistic about relationship and someone that differentiates between love and lust and someone who is there to ensure the relationship he commits himself into works.  A very intelligent and well-made movie from a veteran Director.  Highly recommended.  Not much extra in DVD other than subtitle and the MTV of the theme song.</p></body></html>

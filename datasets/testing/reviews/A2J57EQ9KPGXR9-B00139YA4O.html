<meta name="summary" content="Great start at least..."></head><body><p>This show started off really well. High drama, good acting, interesting subplots...<br /><br />Then it turned into a soap opera version of "Land of the Lost" - Where are the Sleestak when you need them? The way this show is spinning out of control, I bet that those scaly guys will make an appearance soon.<br /><br />I think that the problem with shows like this is that network television writers are'nt that talented. So even if you hand them a good idea, they'll eventually mess it up.<br /><br />The first few episodes are worth watching at least.</p></body></html>

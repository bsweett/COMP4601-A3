Its one of those rare comic vehicles that attracted the cream of the crop: from Frank Miller to Harlan Ellison. It is still a great read, but how is the film compared to the comic? Well, it is so-so. Ben Affleck did a decent job as Matt Murdoch, the costume looked good, but the character who played Electra did a poor job (I forget her name). <p>  Colin Farrell stole the show (as expected) as Bullseye; the fight scenes were OK but some of them were poorly filmed, the lighting was insufficient and you could'nt really tell what was going on. However the movie was pretty faithful to the original comic story. I say "original" because none of the Frank Miller storyline was used: Matt's mentor, Stick, or the Hand. That was disappointing but the storyline focusing on Daredevil's origin and his father was compelling.<p>  Will they make a sequel? Probably, the producers should make one, maybe next time they'll have Frank Miller help with the script.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scott + Washington + Crowe = Wow!"></head><body><p>The former bodyguard of a Harlem mobster decides he wants to corner the heroin market in New York City.  He not only wants to corner it, he wants to sell Grade A pure dope by cutting out the middleman and getting his supply direct from where it is made:  in the jungles of Southeast Asia.  So he goes to Vietnam himself (during the height of the Vietnam War) to establish his contacts, then smuggles the heroin into the country via military cargo planes.  His dope becomes such a runaway success he quickly becomes the biggest underground kingpin in New York--a mobster who effectively eludes the clutches of the city's corrupt police force, which wants in on the action--and the target of a 24/7 investigation by a handful of honest police officers.<br /><br />Such a story, if fictitious, would defy believability; but truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  Based on the true story of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, director Ridley Scott's AMERICAN GANGSTER is an outstanding depiction of the gritty, violent underworld, set in the turbulent Seventies.  Scott doesn't just film a scene; he presents a powerful visual that makes the viewer flinch.  From smoke-filled bars in Saigon to filthy Harlem tenements, Scott tells this gripping story through impressive, thought-provoking cinematography.<br /><br />Equally impressive is the cast, headlined by Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts.  Both actors are superb:  Washington as the brooding, sometimes sinister gangster; Crowe as the honest cop with several vices of his own.  Both roles are on an inevitable collision course; yet when this collision ultimately occurs, it's anticlimactic and almost glossed over, which was my only disappointment with this most remarkable film.  I was also impressed with Josh Brolin, the ringleader of the corrupt New York detectives on the take.<br /><br />Packed with action, drama, suspense, and intrigue, AMERICAN GANGSTER brings a difficult story to uneasy life, and shows that Scott plus Washington plus Crowe are a winning combination indeed.<br />--D.

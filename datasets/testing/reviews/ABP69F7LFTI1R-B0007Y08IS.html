<meta name="summary" content="Absolute genius - Matt , Trey and their team are so original"></head><body><p>I found the puppets in this movie more life-like and interesting than the multi-million dollar puppets and CGI used in big blockbuster movies.  This movie isn't for children, but Trey and Matt are so childlike (not childish) in presenting the issues it really wasen't offensive at all. I found it sharp, witty, well detailed (loved the lit cigarette the puppet was holding), very original story, and pants wetting funny! Even the songs the characters sang were well written and to the point.  Keep up the good work, guys, a lot of your fans really appreciate it.</p></body></html>

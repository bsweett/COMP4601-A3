Poor script, action-sequenses so overdone it makes the Lethal weapon-movies seem deep and realistic. The characters are so unsympathetic you don't care about who gets run down or not. The beginning was promising yes, but not longer than when the train takes a stroll on its own, if I'd been a railroad-worker I'd really be offended by this movie. These guys here appeares as idiots one by one. The "best" part is when Denzel becomes Indiana Jones and jumps his way across the runaway-units before one of the worst endings I've ever experienced at the cinema.<br /><br />Based on a true story?? "Runaway train" - watch that instead. Not a true story, but far more believable!</p></body></html>

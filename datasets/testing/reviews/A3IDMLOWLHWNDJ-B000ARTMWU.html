It succeeds only until the plotholes show up. Still, "High Tension" lives up to its title & is worth a look.<br /><br />Marie & Alexandra are two college friends who are going up to Alex's parents farmhouse for the weekend, to study for upcoming exams. Arriving late, Marie meets Alex's parents & her little brother & everyone settles in for the night.<br /><br />Just as Marie "settles" in, the front door buzzer rings steadily. Alex's father answers the door & is savagely slashed across the face by a homicidal maniac. The killer makes it's way into the house, just as Marie gets her senses together, narrowly avoiding an encounter with the killer. Trying to find a phone, Marie hides in the master bedroom (the bedroom closet) & gets a front-row seat to the killer's next act of mayhem - slitting Alex's mother's throat clean across & slicing off her hand - that's holding the only phone in the house (Marie finds out later that the phone lines are cut, anyway). The killer kidnaps Alex, tying her in heavy chains with a piece of tubing for a gag, bringing her to his beat up van. While the killer dispatches Alex's brother, Marie sneaks down into the van & while trying to free Alex is accidently locked in, unseen, by the killer. It's up to Marie to free Alex & slay the killer. After all, as Marie says, nothing can come between her & Alex.<br /><br />"High Tension" is one of those films that you are either going to love it or leave it. If you can get past the plotholes, you'll find that "High Tension" is better than a lot of American slasher films of late. The film is unflinchingly brutal when it comes to the killings & isn't for the squeamish.<br /><br />There are problems with the film & I won't talk about them here  because it would kill the film for future viewers. I did, however, find the film only half-dubbed in English annoying, but, with most of the dubbing at the beginning of the film where the film sets itself up, it isn't too bad.<br /><br />There isn't to much with the DVD release. The usual behind the scenes featurettes are here, but, there are no deleted or extended scenes. The film is presented in the widescreen with Dolby Digital french or English dubbed.<br /><br />"High Tension" is worth the rental, even if something comes between you.</p></body></html>

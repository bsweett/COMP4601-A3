But her phobia morphs into terror when she learns that a fellow passenger (Cillian Murphy) has plans to murder the deputy secretary of Homeland Security -- and wants to use Lisa as part of the plot. Master of horror Wes Craven directs this psychological thriller set at 30,000 feet.<br /><br />I found this one VERY GOOD! I would definitely watch it again. If you have seen Batman Begins then you already know that Cillian Murphy can play an awesome bad guy. Rachel McAdams is just an incredible actress. Very good pairing in this movie. Wes Craven has done it again!!</p></body></html>

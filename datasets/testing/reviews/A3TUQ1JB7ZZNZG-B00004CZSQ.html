<meta name="summary" content="Slow moving and ugly."></head><body><p>I first read about this movie saying it was one of the best horror films ever and then a good friend of mine,Rich, told me he had it and I watched it. What a dumb film.<br />The story is about an American dance student who attends a European ballet school only to find it is a witches coven. As with all Argnto's films there is a good deal of unneeded blood and graphic scene's to keep you woundering why the hell you are watching this. The story developes very slowly so by the climax you really have lost intrest and you watch it to see what happens almost out of obligation.<br />Over rated and dim witted this film leaves a bad taste and an even worse memory.</p></body></html>

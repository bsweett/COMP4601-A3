<meta name="summary" content="An obscene laugh riot"></head><body><p>If you take one of the funniest "sports" movies from recent years -- "Cool Runnings" about the Jamaican bobsled team -- and mix it with the one liners from "Airplane" and throw in the inappropriate sexual references from any fraternity movie, you've got "Dodgeball", a sort of "Putney Swope" of sports movies.<br /><br />This movie is creative, predictable, obvious, profane, tasteless...and is one of the funniest movies of 2004 or any other year. It is a laugh riot where acting, situations, one liners and a nincompoop plot all merge to create a comedy that's more entertaining than most movies.<br /><br />The one liners come often and are usually laden with sexual conntent. "Useless as a lollipop that tastes like a (male genitalia)" is a line from one actor. Another, recounting the miracles he's seen in life, says, "I've even seen a grown man satisfy a camel."<br /><br />Ben Stiller is protagonist to Vince Vaughn's antagonist in this flick about competing health clubs, good guys and bad guys. Stiller is more in character throughout this movie than anytime I've ever seen him, while Vaughn plays himself. David Hasselhoff, Chuck Norris, William Shatner and Lance Armstrong all play small roles parodying themselves along the way.<br /><br />The title action plays the deciding role in whether the good guy or bad guy will prevail, although everyone knows from the beginning who's going to come out on top. Another one liner about the dodgeball competition is that it is broadcast nationwide on "ESPN 8, the Ocho", a comic parody of ESPN2, which is known in the industry as "the deuce."<br /><br />While there is no denying this is one of the funniest films of recent years, you are warned not to share this video with your kids unless you want to incur the wrath of your wife or answer question all night like, "Daddy, what's a dyke?" The sexual content in this profane film is heavy and consistent. It never relents and takes a new twist at the very end.<br /><br />But it's still a funny movie and more entertaining than 90 percent of the movies out there. Enjoy it all you want but beware its juvenile sexual content.</p></body></html>

It's the story of an ugly duckling, Toula Portocalas (Nia Vardalos) who (stop me if you've heard this one before) turns into a beautiful swan by the end. This transformation is made possible by the love and respect of Toula's floppy-eared fianc&eacute;e cum groom, Ian Miller (John Corbett). Though both of Toula's parents, Gus (Michael Constantine) and Maria (Lainie Kazan), are initially opposed to the marriage they eventually they warm up to the idea that their daughter loves a Catholic.<br />Written by Vardalos, who clearly thought this was some sort of homage to her middle European heritage, the plot is excessively burdened with middle-European clich&eacute;s that get overplayed, tapping into the bias that all Greeks are warm-hearted simpletons and all outsiders are clearly cold fish. Perhaps a more fitting title would have been, "My Big Fat Greek Stereotype". Really, there are maybe four instances in the entire film where I found myself genuinely smiling. The rest of the jokes fall somewhere between middle of the road and "oh God, I can't believe they did that!" Clearly, this was a movie written for and marketed to a very specific audience, and in so far as that goes, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" hit its target right on the money and all the way through to a failed television spin off and lucrative Hollywood career for its star. Never has so little originality been stretched such a long, long way. But this is not a great comedy or even a mediocre one. It's just big and fat.<br /><br />At least there's some redemption to be found in the widescreen transfer. Anamorphically enhanced, colors are rich, bold and well balanced. Contrast levels are admirably presented with a remarkable amount of fine detail present, while blacks are both solid and deep. Edge enhancement is present but is kept to a bare minimum. Pixelization and shimmering crop up now and then, but here too, they are nothing to quibble about. The audio is 5.1 and nicely presented.</p></body></html>

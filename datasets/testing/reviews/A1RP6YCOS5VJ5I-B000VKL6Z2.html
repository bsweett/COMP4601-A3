<meta name="summary" content="Waaaay Better Than Some of the Other Movies In This Series"></head><body><p>This remake of Halloween is one of the best movies in the series. I loved how it gives a very in-depth look into the childhood of Michael Myers and showed the abuse he suffered from his step father and his parents weren't Leave It To Beaver parents like they are portrayed on the original movie. I don't know what there is not to like about this movie. When I watched this movie in theaters, I literally had to check my pulse I was jumping so much. Rob Zombie had a big mountain to climb and he has achieved its height.<br /><br />I thought McDowell was fantastic as Dr. L and was a worthy successor to DP who played the character originally. I also enjoyed all of the cameos of other horror movie icons. Dee Wallace who played Laurie Strode's step mother was on the awesome werewolf movie the Howling and of course Chucky himself, Brad Dourif.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great comic book movie / OK movie for non comic fans"></head><body><p>Watched this movie Saturday. I really really liked it. Of course the first 30 minutes or so was a little slow and all, but they had to show you why he becomes the punisher. I love how they made the Punisher the sorta Punisher he is in his newer comics (newer as in the last 2 years or so). Him living in his apartment building was very cool to me and seeing the guy with all the piercings was also very cool since both are in the comics. And the Russian is too. So when they said, "Send in The Russian.", I started saying HECK YEAH!!! Cause he is INSANE in the comics. Just about everything the Punisher does to him, he just takes it like a toddler was hitting him. He talks a little though in the comics and it's funny as hell and I sorta wish they made him talk a little in the movie... but I think Keving Nash probably wouldn't have a good russian accent. He also wore the red and white striped shirt too. So I think they did us comic book fans justice with that stuff. Another thing that did us fans justice were the ways people died. Some of them were just crazy. My friend was saying things like..that was kinda cool, but there is no way that would happen. I then would say, yeah, but thats the kinda ways he kills people in the comics. The writers/drawers think of some INSANE ways to kill people and make you laugh with it.<br /><br />As for a regular movie not revolved around a comic, I would give this movie a 3/5. It was sorta slow in the beginning trying to get you to feel for his family and feel the love he has for his family. Some of the action scenes were a little over the top. Travolta is a GENIOUS at playing a bad guy. He's got that cold killer look when he wants it. Tom Jane I think did a great Punisher. He has the build and what seems like, the right voice.<br /><br />As for a movie based on a comic, I'm gonna have to give this a 4.5/5. It had a lot of good cameos from people we've seen in the comics. It had some really messed up/funny deaths. It shows that the Punisher is actually human cause he gets his butt BEAT. I really liked it and thought it did the Punisher justice.<br /><br />If there is going to be a part 2, I bet it will be much better than part 1, since we dont have to go through and figure out why he becomes the Punisher.</p></body></html>

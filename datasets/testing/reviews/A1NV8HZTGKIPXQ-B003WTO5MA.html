Old TV shows are being made into movies, and old movies are getting updates. Most of the time, they don't turn out well, and are unnecessary. But this film is a little bit different than the other horror film remakes of late. The original film is not really held in high regards or is much of a classic, really. It's not "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Psycho", or "Dawn Of The Dead". The original film was a film that was in need of a remake. It was open for a change and a bit of a face lift. This is the first time a horror movie remake was done that needed to be done. And it proves quite effective. Based on a true story(well, half of a true story anyway), the new film seems to take some liberty with the original material and changes some things around. All for the better if you ask me. Super buff Ryan Reynolds and lovely Melissa George star as George and Kathy Lutz, a Long Island couple who move into a big new house on the waterfront. It doesn't take long for weird things to happen, the little girl to befriend a dead girl, and for George to start snapping and acting like a crazed lunatic. Why?. A year earlier, Ron DeFeo killed his entire family with a shotgun. He claimed that he heard voices and they told him to do it. Apparently, those same voices are now invading George's psyche. The movie is a lot quicker and more brutal than the original, but I would of preferred the movie stuck to the original's longer running time. Horror movies today are so short that everything happens so fast and is over before you know it. The end credits begin 81 minutes into the movie, while the original was hitting the 2 hour mark. The casting was great. Reynolds, who was still in "Blade" condition, played the role well. He got the James Brolin beard going, and he played crazy very well. Was very believeable when he would go from good to bad. Melissa does an adequate job as the put upon wife. Phillip Baker Hall has the Rod Steiger role here as the priest who comes to the house. It's a small role, but Hall does what he can with it. The kids are well cast. They are not typical cute kids who walked out of a Gap ad. They look real. The look of the film is exceptional as well. The direction and cinematography is sharp, vibrant, and alive. It is very nicely done. Plus, the year is 1975, and the film really does a good job of capturing the look and feel of it, and has everyone wearing appropriate clothing. The opening minutes of Ron DeFeo's shotgun outburst towards his family was strikingly done. It's quite easy to say that this movie was better than the original and first two sequels combined. But what about the actual story?. We all know the murders are real, but anything else?. Personally, I see the "hearing voices" thing as something DeFeo made up seeking a shorter sentence, and something that the new owners heard and carried further. I don't believe in the Lutz' ghost story, but a great ghost story it does make. So, there are a lot of great set pieces here. The mood and vibe is felt, and the music is good without it being too over the top. I think the film would of benefitted a bit more if it were a bit longer, and not have everything come together so incredibly fast. Plus, who wouldn't want a babysitter like that?. There are chills and thrills here and there, and some startling visuals. Things go crazy and the acting is pretty darn good to back it all up. In this day and age, things are becoming too safe and PG-13 rated. That's okay if a movie calls for it, but some don't and are watered down for more butts in theater seats. I'm glad to say that this is an R rated horror film. That alone is worth praising.</p></body></html>

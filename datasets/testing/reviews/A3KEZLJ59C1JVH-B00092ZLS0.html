<meta name="summary" content="Isn't this the Johnny Depp movie that came out last year?"></head><body><p>80% of this movie is fantastic.  I was actually sitting in the theatre and thinking, "Wow, I'll be able to give this a really good review on Amazon!"  Unfortunately, though, the last twenty minutes or so ruined the whole moviegoing experience for me, which is why I'm only able to give "Hide and Seek" three stars.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is good: Robert De Niro plays David, a psychologist whose wife recently committed suicide. His young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) saw her dead mother in a pool of blood and has been left traumatized by the experience.  Her father decides that it would be best if they leave New York City and move to the country to make a fresh start.  As soon as they arrive, Emily makes a new friend, Charlie, who is presumed to be invisible.  That's when all sorts of creepy things start happening, and the events get deadlier as time goes on.<br /><br />As far as the casting goes, this movie is up to par.  Robert De Niro gives a solid performance (but then again, this is De Niro...the man is good in everything he does).  The real star of the film is Dakota Fanning, who is amazing in her role in a troubled (and creepy) young girl. Famke Janssen (that's right, it's Xenia Onatopp from "Goldeneye") shines in a supporting role as a friend of David's (who also happens to be a shrink).  The only possible miscast in this film is Elizabeth Shue.  Her character is pretty bland and seems to serve no purpose except to fall victim to Charlie.  (What bothered me most, though, was the fact that Shue had to show her cleavage in EVERY SINGLE SCENE.  I just didn't need to see all that!)<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for everyone, but the final twenty minutes of the film basically turns into "Secret Window," which is a very good movie, but why did they have to copy it almost exactly?  "Hide and Seek" had everything going for it in the beginning: it was scary and suspenseful, but then it just threw everything away at the end.  What a shame.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Edge of your seat thriller that goes for the gut."></head><body><p>When watching DERAILED, written by James Seigal, the author of the book, you have to get fully into the characters that your viewing. This is no hard task considering that the characters are everyday people. Charles shrine had a simple life as a comercial executive. He had a loving wife, a dog named beanie, and a daughter who has diabetes. Everyday he would catch his train on time until one day he accidently missed the one he always takes. Oddly enough, when he boards the next train he is short on cash and forgot to buy a ticket. Thankfully, a woman a few rows ahead of him pays for him--This is where the two characters come together and eventually start another little train in motion. A train of intrigue and friednship and . . .possibly . . .adultry.<br /><br />The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was that it was formulated in the same way as THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT in where the hits and the shocks just keep coming. It makes you sympathize with Charles and even gets you in suspense from one event to the next. The villian is perfectly illustrated in this tense thriller as a man who wants the dough no matter who you are and will keep asking until eventually he gets paid. But this movie is far beyond blackmail, adultry, and a foolish man who should have looked the other way when another passenger paid for his ticket. In fact, he should've gotten off the train in the first place. But, be aware, there are a lot of shocking twists in this movie.<br /><br />As for the plot, I disagree with some of the other reviewers and say that this is a Hitchcock plot with a modern feel. Two people, meeting on a train, who end up in a world of trouble that they can't get out of. I mean, come on, that's hitchcock.<br /><br />However, this movie was done surprisingly well and I'm shocked that it only made 30 million at the box office. It will probably become one of those sleeper hits on dvd. This movie makes you want to read the book by james seigal just to see if all the peices fit or if the characters were drawn up right.<br /><br />It's really worth a look.<br /><br />This thriller proves that even though ordinary people misses their train; Fear arrives just on time.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Delightful adaptation of a deliciously frightening children's classic -- the 3-D version on the DVD looks fantastic!"></head><body><p>Coraline is a clever and inventive young girl, whose overworked and absent-minded parents tend to ignore her.  She discovers a portal into elsewhere, with an other mother who is all too eager to please.  If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  Luckily, Coraline's got the courage and pluck to face up to the absurdity and horror she faces on the other side.  Based on Neil Gaiman's inventive modern children's classic, it's a brilliant stop-motion adaptation, comparable in depth and theme and mystery to Lewis Carroll's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144042909X">Alice In Wonderland</a> and Hayao Miyazaki's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLEU">Spirited Away</a>.<br /><br />I saw this in 3-D in theaters, and just finished watching the 3-D version of the DVD on TV - on a 42" LCD flat screen, which may account for part of why it looked so good.  I was very impressed by the 3-D look - this is the first time I've seen a home version 3-D that really worked.  Of course the theatrical 3-D version was the first one I'd seen that didn't feel like a gimmick.  There are moments of "in your face" shock designed to surprise and impress - but what's really impressive is  the immersive character of the world.  It feels like a lived-in fantastic world with depth and texture - quite exciting.  The music sets just the right mood.  The voices are perfectly meshed with the characters - and unlike many contemporary animated films don't call attention to themselves.  I never once thought "that's Dakota Fanning" or "Terri Hatcher."<br /><br />While the colors seem slightly muted in the DVD's 3-D version, the depth is definitely there, and it looks nearly perfect if you watch it in the dark, as recommended.  This DVD set comes with 4 3D glasses, and includes both the 2D and 3D versions of the film, plus a digital version of the film and the standard "making of" and deleted scene features.  Highly recommended for parents and children whose imaginations haven't been blunted by the much less risky visions on display in most Disney and Dreamworks productions.</p></body></html>

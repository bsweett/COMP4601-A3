He's also the type of guy who dreams about cheating on his wife, and even make plans to do so, lying to a young aspiring actress (played by the ever wonderful Katie Holmes) just to get in her pants...but at least he has the decentsy to remove his wedding ring (even when calling her from a pay-phone) and that pay-phone is where our movie begins, and ends, never leaving the booth for the entire run (close to an hour and a half)...but that in itself does no harm to the intensity of the film, it actually adds to it because we never leave the forefront of the action, never leave the midst of the drama.  This is Colin's best performance to date, and Keifer is equaly creepy...he just has the perfect voice for somthing like this, it makes the hair on your neck stand tall.  Great movie, solid performance and a grave overlooking at oscar time for Colin (he deserved at least the nod) leave me wanting to watch it again and again...</p></body></html>

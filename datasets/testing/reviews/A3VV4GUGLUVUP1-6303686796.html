From "MASH" to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Network," "Nashville," "Days of Heaven" and especially "Taxi Driver," the 1976 Martin Scorsese-directed grungy, street-level study of alienation.  Robert De Niro, memorable as the young Don Corleone in the second "Godfather" movie, brings us into the closing decades of the 20th century as Travis Bickle, the obscure and troubled cabbie.  This remains one of his signature portrayals.<br /><p>Primarily a character study with only a bare-bones plot, "Taxi Driver" reveals Bickle, whose experiences in Vietnam have left him a shell, a soft-spoken insomniac with a never-ending monologue about the sordid things he encounters while prowling the mean streets of New York.  He drives his cab through rain-washed streets and kills time in porno theaters, cut off from the rest of humanity for reasons even he can't fully comprehend.  Eventually, he meets and attempts to woo two women who will change his life:  Jodie Foster as a teenaged prostitute, and Cybill Shepherd as a dedicated campaign worker.  Unfortunately, Bickle's inability to articulate his torment and his mental problems inevitably lead him down an increasingly shadowy path.<br /><p>The film's climactic confrontation (between De Niro and Harvey Keitel as a pimp) scorches and burns but fails to provide a catharsis for De Niro's character (as it would in a lesser film), and its enigmatic ending remains much debated.  This is a dangerous film, seemingly as lethargic as Bickle's speech but, like the character himself, capable of erupting in violence.  John Hinkley would later use this film's political assassination plot as inspiration in his own pursuit of Jodie Foster; it's difficult to view the film without that association.  But this is a must-see, must-own film for serious buffs, DeNiro and/or Scorsese fans.<br /><p>Brilliant comedian/filmmaker Albert Brooks has an amusingly neurotic role as one of Shepherd's colleagues.  The always excellent Peter Boyle also stars.</p></body></html>

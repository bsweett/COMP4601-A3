It was different and had a great cast. All Ang had to do was end it after the army battle, but NOOOOOOO! Ang had to go all Brokeback Hulk with 20 extra minutes of daddy issues and a WTF was that ending? The Incredible Hulk is simply put: AWESOME! It is a reboot that kicks Ang Lee and his daddy issues movie's ass. It pays homage to the HULK t.v. show most of us all loved (see opening sequence and listen for some familiar music). The cast is even better than last time. Eric Bana was good, but Bruce Banner was made for Ed Norton! And for the record, Tim Roth is one of hollywood's best actors and plays a fantastic antagonist, again (i.e. Rob Roy and Planet of the Apes). The movie follows Banner on the run still searching for a cure. General Ross is desperately seeking to capture the Hulk and turn him into the weapon he intended. Once he tracks him down the mayhem ensues and Ross' top soldier Blomsky wants the power of the Hulk for himself! It all leads to a knock your socks off battle that is one of Marvel's best!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The Incredible Hulk rages on this transfer. Universal does it again with amazing picture and sound. I thought that the CGI Hulk would look less real on Blu because the clarity would only highlight flaws...I WAS WRONG! The blacks are great and actually the finer detail is picked up and makes the Hulk more lifelike! All the special features are carried over (watch the Alt Opening and see if you can find Captain America)! FINAL VERDICT: Seriously, I will HULK OUT if you don't upgrade. HULK IS STRONGEST ON BLU RAY! UPGRADE!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Goodman wins..."></head><body><p>This is a great and very funny film. A case of mistaken identity leads Jeff Bridges 'Dude' into all sorts of problems. The Dude is extremely laid back (stoned a lot) - the Coens wrote the part for Jeff Bridges.<br /><br />A number scenes standout, but the Bowling Alley ones are particular favourites of mine. The cast are fantastic, and for me John Goodman as Vietnam Vet Walter just steals the acting honours. Walter is obsessed with Vietnam, to the point where he introduces Vietnam into any conversation regardless of whats being talked about. One of the very last scenes is an extremly funny example of this.<br /><br />I've lent the film to a lot of people and there is a split with this film between those that love it and those that really don't get it. So if you're unsure catch it on TV or rent it. If you like it you will have to buy it and watch it again very quickly.</p></body></html>

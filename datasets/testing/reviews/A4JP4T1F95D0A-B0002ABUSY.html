The unrated version is even better, leaving in some of the more gruesome killings.  While it is titled the same as the classic Romero picture, it is more of a homage to the man.  Aside from taking place mostly in a mall, the film has all new characters and plots.  Also, the zombies are not the plodding Romero dead, these creatures can move fast.  Some people don't care for it, but I found the movie was very effective with the running zombies.  This is worth having in your collection.</p></body></html>

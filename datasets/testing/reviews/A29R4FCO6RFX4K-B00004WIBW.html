An unsettling and sometimes shocking film, this is stylish, sexy and wonderful cinema that should not be missed by any fan of the genre. A long-time fan of Johnny Depp and owner of 25 of his movies, I have always loved Hollow since it scared the hell out of me in the cinema. Depp turns in one of his best performances yet, playing the queasy doctor Ichabod Crane to pleasing effect. Danny Elfman draws on past BATMAN music for the unsettling but refreshingly original score. STAR WARS fans should also note that this is the only film to have actors Ian MicDiarmid, Christopher Lee and Ray Park (Darth Sidious, Count Dooku and Darth Maul respectively) Considering this, it would have been good to sneak in David Prowse (Darth Vader). Anyway, this is my favorite Burton film and a modern classic, worthy of the title "Most beautiful horror movie ever made".<br /><br />After the hiccup that was Mars Attacks, Tim Burton, Hollywood's most eccentric director, is back on form. Adapted from Washington Irving's classic tale The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Burton's stylish take on the story of the headless horseman (Played occasionally by a freaky Christopher Walken) is Burton at his most macabre. Everything from the Burton outr&eacute; culminates in the film; the bats from Batman, the jack o' lantern from A Nightmare Before Christmas, and, as Ichabod Crane, Johnny Depp from Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Burton's visionary touch takes the tone much deeper than the animated 1958 Disney version, with the headless horseman lopping off heads all over the place. The desaturated color and stunning cinematography goes a long way to making the action and shocking decapitations just that bit more gruesome, yet at some times, strangely poetic. The screenplay, written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en and 8mm) is fitting to the film's thematic touch and overall bizzaro Burton. Danny Elfman's downright chilling score takes the darkness even further. But there is humor amidst the full-blooded ghost story; Depp's fainting at the sights of the Horseman's handiwork, and the sharp script lets the actors, mainly Depp, have more fun. This is Burton's weirdest film since Batman Returns. Excellent.</p></body></html>

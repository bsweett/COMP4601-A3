<meta name="summary" content="Fan's review"></head><body><p>During the years of Fascist oppression in Spain, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) moves to a creepy mill in the countryside with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) and violent stepfather (Sergi Lopez), who is a military officer hunting rebels in the surrounding mountains.  Ofelia discovers that she has a powerful connection to a grotesque, wonder-filled world of magic and fantasy and undergoes great drama as events come to a head in both the realms of magic and reality.<br /><br />Director / writer Guillermo del Toro has established himself as one of the premier fantasists of cinema.  His distinctive visual sense is used to great advantage here.  This fairy tale is not so much for children as for adults who may have forgotten the horror at the root of all fairy tales in this Disneyfied era, as well as their mythic connections to real world events.  Del Toro remembers and incorporates this understanding in his powerful film.</p></body></html>

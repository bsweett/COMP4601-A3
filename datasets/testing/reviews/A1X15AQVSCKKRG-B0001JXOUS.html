<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful movie, one of the best epic movies out there."></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this movie  Edward Zwick , it was a masterpiece it had it all. Action, suspense, a love story, sympathetic characters. That musical score too man that was almost overwhelming. I really dont understand the criticisms for<br /><br />the movie, except maybe its the biased, attitude that Americans have because this movie is a hit. Roger Ebert and Roper gave this movie critical acclaim. Its gathered a great rating on IMDB, the movie is beautifully acted, has a good story and has an epic feeling like the movie "Glory".<br /><br />The movie also was a labor of love by all involved, the costume designs and background were absolute genius, and  even Tom Cruise was one of the producers for the film.<br /><br />Catching an HBO special on it, you could tell Tom realized<br /><br />he did something special with this film.<br /><br />The story is that Tom plays a confederate like soldier ordered<br /><br />to kill a group of Japanese warriors during the middle 18 century. He encounters and is captured by Katsumot (Ken<br /><br />Watanabe). However instead of killing Nathan Algren, Katsumoto<br /><br />keeps him alive so he can get info about the Emperor's men<br /><br />that are attacking him and the American soldiers.<br /><br />Algren then during his capture sees both sides of the story,<br /><br />he realizes that Katsumoto is not the enemy, its the very<br /><br />people that hired for the job that are the enemy, from<br /><br />the corrupt officials in Asia who want to turn the country<br /><br />into a capitalistic state with the salivating Americans<br /><br />like Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwynn) ready to take advantage.<br /><br />"The Last Samurai" simply stated is an excellent movie, you will<br /><br />not waste your time watching this movie, its an excellent flick<br /><br />that deserves your viewing.</p></body></html>

First vaporizing a trio of Klingon battlecruisers, the cloud similarly dispatches a peaceful Starfleet outpost.  Frantic officials of the United Federation of Planets scramble to meet the cloud, which is apparently some sort of spaceship housing aliens, origins unknown.  Only one starship is in position to intercept the cloud before its arrival on Earth - the USS Enterprise.  Unfortunately, the Enterprise hasn't completed an extensive re-fitting, and barely anything works.  Kirk isn't even in command (though that changes quickly).  Meanwhile, on Vulcan, Spock is in the middle of a refit of his own.  Having cast off Starfleet, Spock embraces Vulcan meditation that will free him from his emotional human-half.  Before he can complete the transition, he receives a mental cry from space - a confused plea that he can scarcely understand but one he can trace to the heart of the mysterious cloud.  Having no choice, he leaves Vulcan to rejoin Starfleet.<p>This film took a lot of lumps from those, unlike Trekkies, who weren't willing to forgive any film that had nothing more than an uninteresting plot, some good FX and the name "Star Trek" (most would have preferred to start the franchise with something like Wrath of Khan").  The plot is thin and turns out to have been borrowed from an episode of the original series - "The Changeling".  Much of the film is slow and whole sequences amount to an excuse to show off the special effects and other aspects of the cinematographic look which both excel over the 60's campiness of the show.  The characters don't play as much with their older TV selves' persona as they would in the latter movies and most of the time, they're passive observers of an immense alien intelligence - unable to do anything to help Earth.<p>Yet this Trek is special - mostly because it was the first and could have set a worse tone for the sequels, but also because it created a futuristic look which was neither that of the clean and high-tech future of the old-style movies, nor the gritty and junky style of movies like "Alien" and "Blade Runner".  The Enterprise here is a masterpiece of technical design, but the film's makers show its faults (an horrific and fatal transporter accident; wormholes; very narrow hallways)  It's more streamlined than its TV version, but not so carefree looking that it's a cruise ship like the Enterprise-D.  As the Enterprise accelerates into warp space, you can almost feel the throb of the engines vibrate through your TV.  The characters are appropriately serious yet show that glimmer of their campier selves ("Spock, so help me I'm actually glad to see you!").  Even the danger's of space seem more palpable here than on the show (or any of the shows).  Though a rip-off of an older episode, real Trekkies know this as a common occurrence, and the movie actually kept me guessing until the last 10 minutes as to the identity of the aliens and their mission.  Even the special effects seem still fresh, despite the passge of over 20 years (and a switch to "Industrial Light Magic" after this movie).  With its emphasis on a mysterious alien and the dangers of space, this is perhapos the closest any trek has come to pure science fiction.  Perhaps the new show "Enterprise" will finally match the promise offered by this first movie.</p></body></html>

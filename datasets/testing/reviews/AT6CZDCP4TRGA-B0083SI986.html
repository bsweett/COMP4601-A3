<meta name="summary" content="Unexpectedly good, warts and all"></head><body><p>Since so many reviews here have provided a plot summary, I'm just going to write comments...<br /><br />There were many, many points in this movie that made me cringe, expecting to be run over by sentimentalism and stereotypes.  For example when Kowalski takes Thao with him to teach him "how to be a man"---I thought they'd wind up in a bar with a bunch of K's buddies competing to see who had the biggest wanger, but no something else entirely (not all that believable, but at least it was rather original) happens.<br /><br />So this movie is a lot like that.  It directly addresses and traffics in some all-too-common racial stereotypes and bigotry, yet somehow manages to transcend them in a way that is not hopelessly corny or preachy.  The ending is rather surprising, kind of Buddhist in fact---true self-sacrifice, a little idealistic perhaps, but at least not the usual macho-superhero-vigilante fantasy.  Considering Eastwood's filmography and iconic image, "Gran Torino" is actually very subversive, in its quiet and understated way.  There is a subtle element of satire and parody here, which most viewers will probably miss: Eastwood is actually poking fun at cranky aggrieved old white guys and their cartoonish ideas about masculinity.  At the same time he presents an alternative scenario in which that bitter old geezer finally becomes a TRUE man, i.e. a FULL HUMAN BEING, by growing beyond his own petty prejudices and, at the surprise ending, transcending his own ego and truly sacrificing himself wholeheartedly and voluntarily---in contrast to being a frightened overgrown boy forced to play soldier by the Army.<br /><br />My only reservations, and the reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, is that Eastwood could have been a better director in terms of eliciting better performances from his two Hmong leads, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who reminded me of kids acting in a school play.  Bee Vang is especially amateurish, especially in the last part when Kowalski locks him in the basement to prevent him from following.  Surely Eastwood could've hired acting coaches to better prepare and train these two?<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the Special Features on the DVD...basically it's a vintage car fan's wet dream, and there's lots of sophomoric babbling about cars and "masculinity"---but what about for the rest of us?  A little mini-documentary snippet on the history of the Hmong and their dealings with the US military in Indochina would have been much more interesting and apropos. Well, unless all the macho car gushing is part of Eastwood's hidden joke.</p></body></html>

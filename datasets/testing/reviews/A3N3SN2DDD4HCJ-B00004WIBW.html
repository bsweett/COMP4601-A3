<meta name="summary" content="Rich In Art, Great Storytelling."></head><body><p>&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; could be called the best film by Tim Burton, it shows him moving up in the world from the &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; stuff which was good, but this is better. &quot;Sleepy  Hollow&quot; is visually hypnotic and frighteningly fun. It works best as  an art film, filled with so much richness in set design, costume design and  cinematography. Burton takes us into his own little world here, and it's a  great experience. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven, 8MM) is in  the tradition of great storytelling, filled with entertaining characters  and ridiculous situations of gothic fantasy that never keep us from being  entertained or from having a good time. I do not condone it's R rating and  would take a kid to see this movie. It's great, visual storytelling that at  some points has the feeling of classic cinema. &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is  a rich, dazzling work of the imagination. A great blend of creativity with  storytelling. Burton's true masterpiece in atmosphere and art.</p></body></html>

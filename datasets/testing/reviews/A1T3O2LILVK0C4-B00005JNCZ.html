And to create a film to represent the lives of complex historical figures is a daunting task, yet Walter Salles has proven that he is more than capable of creating such a film. In The Motorcycle Diaries we are shown an approximation of the early life of Ernesto Guevara, the man who would eventually recognized worldwide as the revolutionary Che Guevara.<br /><br />The story begins in Argentina where friends Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) and Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) decide to take a motorcycle trip across South America. Both are studying to become doctors but are restless and wish to see more of their land, learn more of its history, people and culture. Their trek will take them on an amazing journey of over 8000 kilometers and will end in Venezuela at the Guajira Peninsula. Their route will take them through Buenos Aires, Patagonia, Chile, the Andes and into the Peruvian Amazon. They get off to a rough start, barely avoiding serious accidents and experiencing numerous mechanical problems. The motorcycle, a Norton 500 from 1939, is dilapidated and causes many difficulties. But their early misadventures are soon overshadowed by their realization that much of South America is divided, culturally and economically. Ernesto and Alberto witness the turmoil of their land and it changes them profoundly. While Alberto acknowledges the troubles of the people and sympathizes with them, Ernesto takes them to heart and understands the need for action. The faces of the downtrodden, the diseased and the impoverished haunt him. A new conviction is born within him, a new cause for his existence and he is given something to fight for. He craves revolution and the unity of Latin America.<br /><br />The film gives a humanistic portrait of a man who has been idolized by young political radicals, respected by social reformers and admired by philosophers. But the man known as Che is more than just a symbol of revolution. He was above all a complicated man capable of sincerity, compassion and instituting great change. For those who are already familiar with his life, this film will deepen your understanding and appreciation of him. For those unfamiliar with Che, the film is a wonderful introduction to a fascinating man.<br />The film is driven by powerful performances from its two leading men, who enrich their characters with impetuosity, angst, empathy and humor. The music ingeniously captures the flavor of South American culture while imbuing the film with the angst of youthful rebellion. The Motorcycle Diaries is a film that should not be missed.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3462034499">The Motorcycle Diaries</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9562915719">Guerrilla Warfare</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1876175451">Che Guevara on Global Justice</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1876175699">Che Guevara Reader: Writings on Politics & Revolution</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557046395">Traveling with Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810957183">Che Guevara: Revolutionary and Icon</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1840725028">The Che Handbook</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802135587">Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life</a></p></body></html>

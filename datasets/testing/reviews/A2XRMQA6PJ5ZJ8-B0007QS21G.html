<meta name="summary" content="Pretty funny.  Wait, this is not a comedy?  What gives?"></head><body><p>Yeah right.  Global warming causes a modern Ice Age.  Come again?  Oh, well, forget the science.  (After all, this movie does.)  I can never get enough of watching New York City and other urban blights get destroyed and this flick has great special effects.  I loved the shots of the superhurricanes from the space station.  The escaped wolves prowling the streets of The Big Apple were a nice touch too.  Ice Age here we come!<br /><br />I cannot believe how bad the acting and dialog is in this one.  Dennis Quaid is a good actor, but I guess his Yacht payment was due the month he made this film; nothing else explains why he would agree to star in a turkey like this.<br /><br />This is a flimsy, politically correct end of the world flick.  To the limited extent it is worth seeing, watch it for the special effects.  I don't know but that this flick would be a better viewing experience with the sound turned off.  The cheesy dialog is nothing but a distraction anyway.<br /><br />Two stars because I was able to watch it to the end, but just barely.  Just barely.  By the way, the end of this one is so awful as to make one want to gag.  Geez, I am a tree hugger myself, but here the politics are so in-your-face as to defy belief.  Awful, just awful.</p></body></html>

Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in his role, as were Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan.  The three had fantastic chemistry and every scene showed that synergy.  I loved the layers of the murder mystery allying goofball antics and smart twists.  Color also played an important role in the film--vivid comic book-esque scenes enhanced the edginess of the dark comedy.  Downey's narration was consistently amusing.  This film's ability to mock itself made every scene move the plot at a pretty intense pace.  As I am wont to love, really smart lines abound.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not a romantic comedy"></head><body><p>Yes, this may have been billed as a romantic comedy in some places, possibly to alert the audience to the fact that Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston are normally more well-known for their comedic roles. Reviewers going to see this expecting a romantic comedy are the ones giving it bad reviews. This is a shockingly serious film, and a side not often shown in romantic films. This shows what happens when the relationship starts to go sour, what happens when you break up, the emotions that surface, and yes the actors do play a good job of it.<br /><br />From the baseball game start, to the photos of the relationship showing behind the credits, this is a film full of conflicting emotions. And it's so simple how an argument can go from "why did you only buy me three lemons, when I wanted twelve" to "I hate you, you never do anything, we're through".<br /><br />I was left feeling quite sad afterwards, and haven't managed to perk up since. I certainly felt reminded of a lot of my own life in some parts of the film, as many women will, but I must insist it's in no way a date film! I can just imagine a petty argument after viewing of this film.<br /><br />It's an alright film to watch and feel sad (just don't watch it on Valentine's Day for god's sake!) but it's lacking a certain something, and I'm still not sure what. It could be potentially not very good to watch if you've just experienced a breakup, but if not, lets laugh at other (beautiful) people's misfortunes shall we?</p></body></html>

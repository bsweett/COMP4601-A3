<meta name="summary" content="Horrifying Mess!"></head><body><p>The Amityville Horror is a ridiculous remake; one of the worst horror films ever made. I never had expectations going into this mess, but the filmmakers had the chance to make a suspenseful and atmospheric horror film. Instead they opted for fast shots, cheap scares, and loads of blood. That's the problem with modern horror films. They aren't scary or atmospheric, they just try to shock the audience with violent images that never work. What really ticks me off about this film is that, even after the fact that the legend of the Amityville house was proved to be a fabrication between the Lutzes and DeFao's lawyer, this is still being advertized as a true story. In the words of George Lutz, the only truth in this film was  "that we moved into a house where murders took place. It's true that we knew about the murders before we bought the house and moved in. It's true that the people that moved in where named George and Kathy Lutz. And that we were married recently. That when we moved in, we were five months married. It's true that the house we moved into had a boathouse. And that we had a boat. It's true that we had a dog named Harry. And it's true that we had Kathy's three children. And that we had a telephone. That's it."<br /><br />The film portrays Lutz as a homicidal maniac trying to kill his family, which is not true. Nothing in this film is, so don't believe the 'true story' crap. Instead of Lutz suing MGM, they are now suing him for going against the film. If that's not reason enough to boycott this, I don't know what is,<br /><br />I am shocked at all the good reviews, this was horrible from beginning to end. Despite the fact that it takes place in the 70s, it does not have that feel. There is a reason this film was not screened for the critics. Skip this and watch the far superior 79' version instead. Despite the fact that hardly any of the events in that film were true, at least it has atmosphere, suspense, and scares; everything this film lacks.</p></body></html>

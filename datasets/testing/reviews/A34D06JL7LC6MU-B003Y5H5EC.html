<meta name="summary" content="A Little Predictable, But Very Well Acted"></head><body><p>"Hard Candy" has an interesting premise that could've made a great movie. Instead, it makes a riveting and O.K. movie. With a total of 5 actors and only 2 with significant roles, the movie is set up more as a stage play than a film...It's almost like a rehashing of Roman Polanski's "Death and the Maiden." Ironically, there's a reference to Polanski in the film. Looking at the cover of the movie you see "Two Thumbs Up" and "Riveting & Terrifying."<br /><br />All these are fairly accurate descriptions, but I still think the subject matter could've been handled a lot better. Hayley (Ellen Page, "X-Men: The Last Stand") is a 14-year old girl who has spent two weeks chatting with a guy named Jeff (Patrick Wilson) over the internet. Jeff is thirty and from what we gather in the opening sequence, a little creepy. Hayley suggests they meet, Jeff agrees. They meet at a coffee shop, playfully flirt, and pretty soon Hayley is at Jeff's house drinking screwdrivers. Then, Jeff collapses and wakes up tied to a chair. Hayley, you see, is under the impression that Jeff is a pedophile (which he no doubt it) and also a murderer...Of her friend. The filmmakers present the characters; Hayley never elaborates just how close she was to this girl, but to go to the lengths she does...They must've been pretty close. The movie clocks out at about 100 minutes; 85 minutes focuses on Hayley torturing Jeff, both physically and mentally. Problem is...What she does is pretty predictable. During the "torture" scene, I knew what was really going on and her final speech to Jeff at the end of the film sounds like it was plagarized from every other film with a vaguely simalar subject matter (Who am I? I'm every girl you've...). The movie does have it's high points though. It does create suspense well, sometimes keeping you on the edge of your seat. Most people won't notice this, but the opening scenes are pretty brilliant. If you listen to the way the two characters are speaking with each other, it sounds as if each of them is choosing their words carefully as to not scare the other person off. The end of the film is built up too much for it to be any surprise, but when the film ended...I questioned something? In this film, Jeff is supposed to be the villain. While watching the movie though, I couldn't help noticing that it's Hayley who seems to be playing the evil character. We never see Jeff do anything violent, unless it's in self-defense. Hayley seems like an insane, sadistic little girl. If this film does nothing else, it should jumpstart the careers of the two leads. It takes a lot for two characters to carry a movie and the two do the best job they can with the script. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong. It's just really nothing special.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></body></html>

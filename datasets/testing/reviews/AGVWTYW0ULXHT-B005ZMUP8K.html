<meta name="summary" content="This one feels much more like the amusement park ride it was based on"></head><body><p>When I saw the first film in this series, I had fairly low expectations and mainly went to see Johnny Depp.  The film exceeded my expectations in a number of ways, and was quite fun to watch.  While this film is obviously more expensive, and has many more expensive "set pieces" it is much more like what I had expected from the first film: basically a roller coaster ride with a few amusing things to look at and a couple of semi-predictable moments where you get submerged in darkness and are whooshed along up and down the tracks.  What made the first film a nice surprise was that it transcended the "amusement park ride made into a film" genre.  That is to say: if such a genre had existed, that film would have transcended it by having characters who were fairly interesting, played quite well by excellent actors who were clearly having fun, and who "grew" along the way -- in addition to being taken along for a roller coaster ride.  The problem in this film is that for the most part these characters are taken for granted and then taken for a ride along with the audience.  The idea seems to have been: let's take every one of the exciting parts of the first film and make them bigger and more exciting and let's take all the "boring" parts of the first film (like characterization and plot) and see if we can fit them in there in between without interrupting the action.  A series of events takes place that washes the characters along, and the characters sort of move up and down along roughly the trajectories that their characters already followed in the preceding film: Jack Sparrow sometimes seems like he cares about others (the point he had seemed to arrive at by the end of the first film) and sometimes seems to be out only for number one (the point where he began in the first film), mostly in this film he seems to be playing up the caricature that in the first film seemed like just the surface of a fairly interesting character; Elisabeth sometimes emerges as a clever swashbuckling hero who takes a back seat to no one that she seemed to have become by the end of the first film, and sometimes, unexpectedly, she mopes and sits around while the men fight or pines over the fact that it seems she will never have the storybook wedding she had dreamed of.  This film is bigger than the first one, and as a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, there are a number of subplots that the filmmakers have set into motion making this a more complex film (I guess), but that just shows that bigger and more complex is not necessarily better, except in the amusement park.  On a rollercoaster the twists and turns are inevitable, and since you can't get off the anticipation mixed with anxiety is just part of the ride; in a trilogy you can get off and by the end you have to care about the characters and believe that it matters.  In this film (without giving anything away) by the end I had mostly lost my interest in the characters (since the film wasn't much about them, and primarily used them as a vehicle for "big events" like chases through the jungle, Krakens destroying boats, and swashbuckling fights on a rolling waterwheel).  Yes, Will's father shows up.  But their relationship is assumed rather than developed.  Yes, there is another cursed group of pirates that threatens to destroy stuff, and there are more allusions to Jack's past and the animosity and admiration he has inspired in others -- but other than his remarkable knack for getting out of sticky situations (which is mostly inexplicable dumb luck, combined with a Columbo-esque tendency to put people off guard by seeming oblivious while actually making plans, that are never foolproof but are of the sort that are "so crazy they just might work" and almost invariably and remarkably do), it is hard to see why he inspires such fierce loyalty or hatred.  I don't mind implausibilities in this kind of story, as long as the characters and their motivations are plausible, and I care about them enough to maintain interest in what happens to them, and in this case I gradually lost it.  Mild spoiler warning: The final scene, in which every one of the characters is devastated by the apparent loss of one person, and willing to go to "the ends of the earth" to save that person (because, in one of the Deus Ex Machina moments that was necessary to keep the franchise going, a strange gypsy woman explains that it is inexplicably still possible to save someone who has been eaten by a giant squid), in spite of the fact that lots of other people had died, and completely overlooking the fact that some of them had already found what they'd been looking for, and others still had other pressing and still pending obligations, and others had proven never to be motivated by loyalty but only by greed.  Nevertheless, they all "heroically" stand up to the task of undertaking another mission, i.e. they all symbolically agree at the end of the film to appear in another movie and we are supposed to say, like eager children who have just completed a rollercoaster ride "let's get back in line to go again!"  I'll probably see the next movie with my kids when it comes out on video -- but I'm no longer waiting in line, eager with anticipation.</p></body></html>

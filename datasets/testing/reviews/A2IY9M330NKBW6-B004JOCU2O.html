And I don't care as much if someone likes or doesn't like a particular film as much as I care why they like or don't like it. You can't put a film like "Independence Day" in the same category as "The Seven Samurai" but that doesn't keep me from viewing either repeatedly. Each film needs to know what it's looking to do and each needs to succeed in its own right.<br /><br />Tony Scott is a seasoned director. He usually exercises great authority over his projects and "Unstoppable" is no exception. This is just a way cool flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of it. A runaway train, loaded with toxic goo and explosive goo, is barreling down the tracks and it's going to make an awful mess of things unless our heroes save the day.<br /><br />I never thought much one way or the other about what goes on in a train yard. This gave me a real eye opener on that count. I got to know about trains, routing, switching, union politics and a lot more. The viewer gets a good sense about how involved it all is. It's set in Southern Pennsylvania in late autumn. Again, Scott does a good job of giving the viewer a sense of people and place. You feel like you're there.<br /><br />The characters are good. The action is relieved by scenes of the two leads getting buddy buddy with each other, so you have a reason to care about them. Rosario Dawson is always a treat for the eyes and she has a good roll here. A note on this. The main three actors all need to do their thing in very confined spaces. Washington and Pine are in the locomotive for most of the movie and Dawson is in her office. These actors have to deliver most of their lines sitting down. If that's not a testament to their abilities I don't know what is.<br /><br />The action is good and it's smart. The writers did their due diligence on the tech stuff so the viewer gets the whys and wherefores on the gravity of the situation. There is a logical progression to the things that happen. And as they unfold I found myself getting more and more involved. It draws you in and doesn't let go.<br /><br />Is this the best movie ever made? No. But it delivers the goods in spades. If you're at all disposed toward this sort of thing, spend your money at the box office. It's a bit loud (maybe more than a bit) but seeing it on the big screen is the way to go.</p></body></html>

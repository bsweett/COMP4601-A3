<meta name="summary" content="A Review of the HD DVD Only, Not the Movie"></head><body><p>This is a review of the HD DVD only, not a review of the movie or the actors.<br /><br />With the advent of the new HD DVD players, movie studios are releasing movies in that format.  Some aren't even really changed at all, and those who purchase them are only getting a repackaged product that will allow them to place it on the shelves with the other HD DVDs.<br /><br />CONSTANTINE is one of the movies that will really make an HD DVD system and surround sound system shine.  The movie is jam-packed with special effects that look great on an HD monitor.  Pausing the movie allows the viewer to look at a crystal-clear image that has to be seen to be believed.  The audio portion of the film will slam through the surround sound system.<br /><br />Anyone who loved the movie but hasn't bought the 2-disc special edition of CONSTANTINE can pick this one up.  The HD DVD comes fully loaded with all the extras.  The smooth, new interface available on the HD DVD formatting that allows a viewer to effortlessly switch back and forth between the movie and the special features is well worth the upgrade.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Wicker Man Should Be Burned!!!!!"></head><body><p>If you have ever read my other reviews and have grown to trust my judgment even a little bit, then please trust me here and avoid this dreadful film which is a remake of a small classic.<br /><br />There are no words to describe this monsterous disaster.  Even Nick Cage's bizzare performance, and the good Lord knows he can create some wickedly interesting ones (Ghost Rider, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792838963">Moonstruck</a>) can't save this film and nor can a cast of "A" actors who should all be embarrassed that they had any part in this inept film.<br /><br />If you rented this film for $5.00 you would feel like you got ripped off.  It's that bad.  This is NOT one of those "it's so bad, it's good" kind of film.  This is a film that is just bad.  Period.<br /><br />The script is incoherent, silly, and eventually predictable.  The acting is cartoonish at best and totally inept at worst.  The direction is all over the place as he couldn't decide if he wanted to make a thriller, a comedy, a mystery, or satire; therefore, he tried to do it all and succeeded at none.  The film is a disaster at every level.  Go rent and enjoy the original and forget this farse was ever made.<br /><br />Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it!  :>(</p></body></html>

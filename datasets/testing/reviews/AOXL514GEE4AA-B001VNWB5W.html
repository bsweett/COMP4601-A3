<meta name="summary" content=""I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with ME!" Blu ray review"></head><body><p>Based on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It is set in an alternate reality in 1985, where Nixon has been reelected for a 3rd term, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are on the brink of nuclear war, and masked vigilantes are outlawed. The movie opens with the murder of one of those vigilantes and what appears as a plot to kill old superheroes turns out to be so much more. This movie is a great mystery, action, thriller disguised as a comic book movie. The story challenges you to think about society, liberalism, violence and morality as you ponder the possibilities of "what if superheroes existed?" If so, what would they be like and how would they act with all that power. The R rating is well deserved and young kids shouldn't be watching this. A great movie that makes you say "who watches the watchers?"<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing picture and ear popping sound. All the spec features are ported over with some BD exclusives. FINAL VERDICT: DEFINITELY UPGRADE! A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

Can you guess what it was? Dinosaur bones? Indian arrow heads? Wild camels? Nope! It was a portal through time to the planet Mars. So humanity, being what it is, turns that portal into a scientific laboratory and starts digs on Mars to find out who used to live there. Being the way these movies are, nothing is ever done easily and all hell breaks loose in the lab directly next to the dig site. All contact is loss with the area and the six scientists inside are missing. Who you gonna call? The military outfit with the biggest PR department: the Marines!  The marines of course find out that the crap has hit the fan and try to contain the situation. Things don't go as planned and soon it becomes a game of survival. No I'm not talking about "Aliens," I'm still talking about "Doom!" Why would you get so confused?<br /><br />When you get down to it, it's your typical special-team-goes-to-investigate, with all your needed characters: the wise cracking black guy, the dumb guy who gets "Shut up" yelled at him a lot, the normal guy who becomes the hero, and the tough and serious main guy, that being the Rock. The Rock's character is very oddly used in the film, however. At first he's the tough guy who's cool, calm, collective, ready with a plan, and they were building up a lot of cool stuff with the use of the BFG. (yes, its used in the movie) However, this is all ruined in the last 30 minutes of the film when the Rock goes crazy, killing off his own men and ordering the death of civilians. Then at the very end he becomes one of the beasts and attacks our nominal hero in a scene that looked like it came straight out of a Jet Li film with high jumps, lots of throwing against walls, and kung fu boxing. What the heck? This comes especially after the first-person-shooter gunfight. Yes, that's right - you DO have that in the movie. Granted, it's not as much in the movie as some people led you to believe, but the sequence is in there. It's actually not all that bad and is used pretty well. Sad thing is the main monster who watch the hero fight is what the wheelchair guy turns into it. When you think about it, that's kind of lame. The character in a wheelchair is named "Pinky," so that means the main boss monster is something called Pinky. Still...it was kind of cool.<br /><br />Granted, I didn't go into this movie expecting "Citizen Kane." I went expecting a craptastic film, and on some parts it succeeds and on some parts it doesn't. The special effects are nice, and it does have some decent gore and violence in it, and some parts were kind of scary. It suffers from some terrible writing too, with some corny lines like "Kill them all, let God sort them out," or even the quote I've used in my review title. I wouldn't expect superior acting either, and you shouldn't expect it. The girl playing Samantha couldn't have been more bland - read these words: "Oh God!" You just put more emotion into them than she did in the respective scene. And the Rock...I'm sorry, but what the heck? Did he read his lines directly before filming? Read this line normally: "Semper Fi, mother f***er." You sound like the Rock! Yay!<br /><br />I would almost give this three stars for entertainment value, which believe it or not this movie does have, but they nearly ruin it all with the last bit, cutting it short of being a craptastic feature. Watch the "Doom" movie the way you would any original Sci-Fi Channel original film.</p></body></html>

No, the real surprise is how sweet and touching is the love story that emerges through all of the imaginative convolutions.<br /><br />With, perhaps, Jim Carrey's most sincere and accomplished "straight" acting job, matched in full by a fine performance by Kate Winslet, we finally get beyond adroit inventiveness in a Charlie Kauffman script, and get down to some real heart: very touching and ringing true.<br /><br />Well done in all departments, it is the bittersweet longing for love in the eyes and actions of the leads that brings this film home.  4-1/2 stars.  Well worthwhile.</p></body></html>

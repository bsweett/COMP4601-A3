<meta name="summary" content="A tale of two egos"></head><body><p>What a treat it must have been for the ladies: two magicians, each trying to outdo the other, and both far too good looking and well built for their own good. Yes, a good time to be alive.<br /><br />Bale's and Goodman's characters (Borden and Angier, respectively) were not nice men. There was no one to root for in the film, and as good as it was, that might have been one of the reasons it didn't do as well at the box office as the filmmakers would have liked. But it made for a more realistic story, and for that, they get high marks.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it is a story of one-upmanship. Each magician is desperate to outdo the other, and will do whatever it takes. When Borden develops a trick unlike any other, The Transporting Man, Angier will stop at nothing to learn the secret.<br /><br />The plot meanders a bit, and the ending doesn't feel organic, but it still makes for excellent cinema. Just don't expect to have your villains laid out for you. You'll have to make those decisions yourself.<br /><br />It seems I'm saying this a lot these days... 4? rounded up to 5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jake Gyllenhaal Performance is Brilliant"></head><body><p>Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist is brilliant and gives a very restrained and heartfelt performance. Jake Gyllenhaal brilliantly underplays his role. Unfortunately Heath Ledger seems to have received all the kudos for this film and Gyllenhaal efforts have gone summarily unnoticed. For some reason Ennis Del Mar, Heath Ledger's character gets all the histrionic kudus.  Gyllenhaal needed something more from the Ennis character to really bring out Jack Twist's heartbreak. Unfortunately, Heath Ledger curiously did not make this openly apparent in his performance and I found Ledger's character a rather frustrating person to discern. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist was just waiting. He was left out in the cold. This is true in so many of life's experiences yet still unforgivable. The indelible image of the forlorn looking Gyllenhaal is indelibly etched into one's memory.</p></body></html>

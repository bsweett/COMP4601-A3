One thing I loved was that it took place during the 1950's, because that's my favorite era. I also loved all the gothic dream sequences, and the look of the film. It gets a little confusing toward the end. DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshal named Teddy Daniels, and Ruffalo plays his partner named Chuck Aule. They are investigating the disappearance of a woman named Rachel Solando at an asylum for the criminally insane. Due to bad weather, Teddy and Chuck are stuck on the island, and must deal with the crazy inmates. and Teddy is forced to face his demons. I'd probably recommend SHUTTER ISLAND!!!</p></body></html>

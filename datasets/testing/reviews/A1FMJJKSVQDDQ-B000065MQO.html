Unfortunately, Full Metal Jacket didn't become a part of the upgrades. Why? It's not only one of Kubrick's most outstanding films, it's also one of the greatest war films ever made. It's full of Kubrick's vintage camera work, Lee Ermey's excessive profanity, and some odd dark humor. The first half of the film deals with physical training in a boot camp. What makes it so unforgettable and so fantastic is R. Lee Ermey (a former Marine drill instructor) with his incredibly brutal dialogue (most of it being ad-libbed). The second half involves the real inferno: the war in Vietnam. Here, Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, and many others are in the city of Hue. And here is where Hell makes its mark, as we watch undeniable chaos ensuing until the end. The second half of the film may be a bit weaker compared to the first half, but I see that all of the boot camp sequences prepare us for what really goes on in Vietnam.<br /><br />This masterpiece by Kubrick may not have the same effect that Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove have, but it's still a great one by the God-like filmmaker. Kubrick's usual treatment on war and on human nature is probably why many people call him a genius. And a NOTORIOUS genius, I would add.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

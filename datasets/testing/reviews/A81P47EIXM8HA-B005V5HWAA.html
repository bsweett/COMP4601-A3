<meta name="summary" content="I really enjoyed this movie...."></head><body><p>hi Folks,<br /><br />I saw this at the theatre and enjoyed it very much.  I just  watched it on DVD and enjoyed it as much or more.  Costner is solid in the role..but the surprise is Dane Cook , who I think is an overated comedian..way overated but was spot on  perfect in his  part. William Hurt on the other hand was even better..oh my goodness he  is diabolically devilish and just delightful  beyond the words  I find. Moore is  perfect as the manish  girl/cop and the story twists  and  turns  I  greatly enjoyed.  There  is  violence  and a little gore  but really not problematic levels of either.  I wish there were more movies of this caliber out there.</p></body></html>

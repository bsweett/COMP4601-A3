The funniest moments in this movie are the cameo appearances of Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Spielberg and others...after that runs its course, not much is left.<br /><br />Someone else here says the outtakes are funnier than the movie itself, since they feature Mike Myers improvising.  I'm fulloy prepared to believe that.  Iron-poor blood otherwise dominates this effort.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One bored over the KooKoo's nest..."></head><body><p>Sydney Pollack? N.Kidman and S.Penn? Does such heavy artillery need to be utterly wasted in order to make a remarkably boring film? Questions, questions...And who wrote the excuse for a script for this? Whoever it was he/she needs special mention. One needs talent to write something as low quality as this.<br /><br />  Nitty gritty time. A blond woman (guess who) is being hunted by bad, bad, bad african characters who work for a corrupt, corrupt, corrupt african leader from an imaginary country which according to the script has a major blond and/or white  population but is otherwise in no way connected or influenced/manipulated by the west. This was by the way a touch i seriously loved. Kudos to the scriptwriter again.<br /><br />  A black haired cop (guess who) comes in to save the blond african girl (the tears, the tears). The blond african girl is an interpreter who -we're told speaks "Koo" but in the process of the film winds up speaking several other languages in a moment's notice. Now, pay attention, the blond african girl overhears some bad Koo-speaking black Africans plotting the assasination of the soon to come to the U.N to give a speech in English bad African leader of Kurduboo (or something like that, the country is fictional) who also speaks Koo. Koo is very trendy in the film.<br /><br />  This sets off the slowest hunt in the history of bad movie making. The bad Koos chase the good Koo and the Brooklyn accented copper almost learns Koo himself in the process cuzz he spends more time doing the Koo thing with the blond african girl than anything else. Oh no, this doesn't mean they get to do the hot thing if you get my drift. But they sure beat it a lot around the Koo bush trying to get there. Confused? Hey, it's not me, that's the film i'm describing here.<br /><br />  A bus explodes, some more Koo gets spoken, Penn and Kidman seem to be undetered in their quest for the slowest advancing romance ever, and the world meets in the U.N to hear some more Koo. You get the picture.<br /><br />  I really dont know (not sure i want to either) why actors of such caliber chose to participate in a heavily disguised mediocre comedy such as this. I suspect in horror they thought the script was good. But i dont want to believe it. The film is promoted as a "political thriller". It's neither political nor does it thrill. It fails even as a comedy. It fails in fact in so many aspects you can easily lose count. But it sure inspires you to write about it.<br /><br />  As a last note i'll say this. The holes in the story were only outmatched in number by the sheer size of them. In a display of pure professionalism the scriptwriter kept the biggest hole for the very last scene where the entire security force of the U.N watches Kidman through a camera hold a gun to the head of someone (plus breach all levels of U.N security in the process) only to walk breasy-easy free afterwards cuzz she was doing the right thing.<br />Brilliant, simply brilliant.</p></body></html>

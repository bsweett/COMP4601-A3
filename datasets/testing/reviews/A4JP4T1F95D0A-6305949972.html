A twisted tale of the characters of Halloween town taking over Christmas after kidnapping Santa Claus.  Though some of the characters are a little frightening for the young ones, the tone is mostly upbeat and funny.  This is a charming, though very short movie.  The dvd itself is loaded with great extras and worth the price two times over.</p></body></html>

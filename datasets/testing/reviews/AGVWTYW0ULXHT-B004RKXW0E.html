Funny, clever, and moving ... and looking better than ever!!"></head><body><p>I tried to convince my wife to be the one to take my kids to Toy Story 3.  My youngest son, especially, was begging to go, but while I was impressed by the first two, a long ways back, and saw them as showcases for the increasingly sophisticated animation techniques at Pixar, I didn't really love either one of them as much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LVCM">A Bug's Life</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWEO">Wall-E</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBJEEG">Ratatouille</a>.  Perhaps it's just the devoted toy concept that didn't quite move me.  I'm not quite sure why, but for whatever reason, I went into this unenthusiastic and only doing it for the kids.<br /><br />As it turns out, I really liked it.  As far as I'm concerned right now it's the best of the series - of course, now I'd actually be willing to go back and sit through the others and maybe find I liked them too.  It's clever and inventive, with sight gags and visual puns that are underplayed, almost in passing. Its big, blockbuster animation, but the humor manages to be subtle, rather than in your face like so much popular animation these days.  While, like the other films and like everything Pixar, it's not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve it's never sappy, and the storytelling earns its sentimental payoff rather than wrenching it from you.  I never felt manipulated.  The look is nothing short of astonishing.  The visuals are intricate and full of rich details, but it never feels busy or crowded.  I'd like to see it again just so now I can pay more attention to the details now I know what's happening.  The opening reminded me a bit of the surreal and (even more) hilarious stop motion toy fantasy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H0ZHGM">A Town Called Panic</a> (also highly recommended), but the rest fit nicely into the general pattern of the series without feeling like one of the generic and uninspiring sequels that are so common these days.<br /><br />The basic story should be familiar: Woody and Buzz and their buddies are facing a new abandonment crisis.  This time, it's because Andy is going to college, and they fear he will leave them behind in storage, or worse, throw them away.  What is surprising is how fresh they manage to make it all feel.  Nothing was predictable or generic, and I was sad to see it end.  Perhaps best of all, though, was the amazing short film "Night and Day" with which it began.  It's better not to say anything about that, since it's best just to see it unawares.  Still it's a magical film, one of the most exciting and intriguing animated shorts I'd ever seen.  A perfect beginning for an inventive and moving film.  Not to be missed.</p></body></html>

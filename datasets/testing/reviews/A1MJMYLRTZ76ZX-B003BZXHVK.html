I myself don't know enough to say; all I know is that I enjoyed the story and all the non-stop action and special effects. Dozens of new X-men with different talents are introduced, and part of the fun is just seeing what will happen there next. Relationship-wise, this movie focuses on Wolverine and Jean, who is now the only class 5 mutant known, even more powerful than Magneto. I note one reviewer here who said he wasn't happy with Patrick Stewart getting killed--but he should have stayed through the end of the credits--there's one final brief scene where we learn that isn't final. The climactic scene with the Golden Gate Bridge has to be the best special effects scene of the year. My only criticism, which is small (and the reason I rate it four stars instead of five) is that I think they made too much of Jean's mental instability. I don't see why a super powerful X man (or woman, in this case) would automatically be mentally unstable and need to be psychologically conditioned and controlled as Stewart was doing with Jean so that they wouldn't go crazy and cause harm. But all in all a fun movie and worth seeing on the big screen.</p></body></html>

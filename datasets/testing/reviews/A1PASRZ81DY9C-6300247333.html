<meta name="summary" content="I Believe the Word Is Plagiarism."></head><body><p>Viewed: 3/08<br />Rate: 1<br /><br />3/08: *sigh* Webster's dictionary defines the word plagiarism as "to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own: use (another's production) without crediting the source" or "to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source." I don't know what to say when in fact that there is no such thing as plagiarism in Hollywood these days. The remake of The Omen is a lot like the remake of Psycho minus the masturbation scene, and comparing both of them, even though the latter got a rating of `1', the remake of Psycho was better. Watching this turd, The Omen remake is predictably boring because of two reasons: I already saw the original plenty of times (and it was almost word-for-word and I remember it all and there is no fun in it) and nothing seemed to be human about it. There is no creation of real emotion or suspense. It was just fake...fake...fake. Instead of paying the admission price of seeing her to act in anything, I rather want see Julia Stiles be given a Chinese torture. I have a hard time believing in her face because she looks exactly like a teenager in an adult role. Who was the loser that said that Liev Schreiber can play the lead actor? Mia Farrow, your career is officially over. John Moore thought that he was directing a horror flick but instead fails to know what constitutes one. There is an excessive use of thunder throughout the picture, and higher emphasis is placed on the thought of "the gorier, the better." Well, if I must complain, the original, I know it wasn't a great movie, is thousands times better than the remake, and why bother doing a remake when the original had done it already? All in all, The Omen remake is one steaming pile of horsecrap.</p></body></html>

But who cares?&quot;"></head><body><p>In 1997, French director Luc Besson (who directed &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; in 1990) wrote and directed an unusual sci-fi film entitled &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.  (Also known as &quot;Le Cinqui&egrave;me &eacute;l&eacute;ment&quot; in French.)  The film begins with a scene that takes place around 1900 in Egypt, when an archeologist, Professor Pacoli (John Bluthal), and his assistant, Billy (Luke Perry), are studying pictograms and hieroglyphics in an ancient pyramid.  Suddenly, an assortment of strange beings, the Mondoshawans, arrive to remove the contents of the pyramid (the five elements), but tell a priest (John Bennett) who guards the pyramid that they will one day return when the five elements are needed.  The film then moves several hundred years into the future when the Earth is somewhat overpopulated and humanity is space-faring and technologically advanced.  A lowly cab driver, Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), who is a retired army major, begins his day in his tiny studio apartment; but deep in space, a strange planet appears and is headed for Earth.  The Mondoshawans announce their return with the five elements to the delight of the current priest, Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), but their ship is attacked.  The Earth's President Lindberg (Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr.) tells Vito that it's now a military matter, then finds out that there is one survivor from the Mondoshawan ship.  From a few living cells, the survivor is clones back into existence and turns out to be a very strong, but beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich) that speaks a strange language.  She escapes and ends up crashing into the cab driven by Korben Dallas.  She is able to give Korben a name, Vito Cornelius, and he takes her to him.  Korben is then able to get her name: Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat, or Leeloo for short.  Korben leaves Leeloo with Vito Cornelius and his assistant David (Charlie Creed-Miles), but is later enlisted to help find four missing stones that are four of the five elements.  <p>&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; received a mixed response from American audiences when it opened in 1997 because many thought that it would be a typical Bruce Willis action film.  Hence, it received no Oscar nominations, but it won three C&eacute;sar Awards in France for Best Cinematography, Best Director (Luc Besson) and Best Production Design.  The film's very colorful set and costume designs, techno music and unusual characters were not what many Americans expected; but its story, which is often humorous, is both engaging and compelling.  One of the more unusual, but very funny characters in the film is the outrageous and famous D.J. Ruby Rod (Chris Tucker), who entertains millions with a wild radio show and gets to escort Korben during a cruise to the planet Flostin. There, Korben meets the famous alien Diva Plavalaguna (Ma?wenn Le Besco).  Other memorable characters from the huge cast include Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), General Munro (Brion James) and Mr. Kim (Kim Chan).<p>Overall, I personally rate &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars.  Clearly, the film is not for everyone, but if you enjoy French cinema and sci-fi, then chances are very good that you will enjoy the film very much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A truly awesome foreign film"></head><body><p>1.  I'm not one that typically watches nor gets excited via foreign films.  And thus was truly amazed with the... power, amazing story line, acting of this movie.  On a tangent, I happened to read the book  on Hitler's last days in the bunker prior to seeing this film and the film is very true to the reality as is best known.<br /><br />2.  Whatever you're preconceived notions of what this film may or may not be about--> just get it because it'll be well worth it.  As noted above, I'm not a foreign film expert, but this is definitely the best German film I've ever seen and among the top films I've ever seen in general.  100% a worthwhile film for most folks.</p></body></html>

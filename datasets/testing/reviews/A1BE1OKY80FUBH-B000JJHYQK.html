However the film never really takes off as promised.  So why does it earn three stars?  As I wrote above, the cast is quite good and it is watchable so long that you do not have high expectations. Eva Longoria shines as a beautiful rookie and Kiefer Sutherland plays a role that mirrors his tv character is 24.</p></body></html>

It sets an express objective of offending as many different people and kinds of people as possible.  And it succeeds.<br /><br />Surprisingly, though, not as many reviewers below discuss the tour de force of puppet usage, a la "The Thunderbirds."<br /><br />It's a shame.  What these guys did with cutout construction paper on TV, they attempt with puppets here.  The total artistic control puppets afford them is not squandered.  They use this medium to express their contempt for everything and everybody.  But what's new is...<br /><br />Artistry.  Just as "South Park" might work because it is firmly visually anti-artistic, they attempt "art within art" on this film.  The special features (which are pretty good, actually) go into great detail about what went into this movie:  sets, decorations, real pyro...no or very little CG.<br /><br />And these marvelous puppets.  Strangely enough, the movie sort of does not work unless you watch the special features.  They had to "dumb down" the puppet movements to make comedic points.  And what a shame, because the capabilities of these puppets are absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />In a weird way, this film reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope:"  a technical experiment which because a near obsession.  And, in our case here, a rebellion against movemaking techniques which have brought to perfection the computer creation of a convincing alternate reality, like Star Wars Episode 3.<br /><br />Viewed with that discipline in mind, this is a fantastic movie.<br /><br />Just like viewing "Rope" and knowing about the 10-minute take.<br /><br />However, as entertainment, it's mediocre like Rope, in this case because it indulges in gross humor and cheap jokes.  My hat's off to the fellows for the near-historic technical exercise, but man, I couldn't watch this thing twice.<br /><br />Cartman's right.</p></body></html>

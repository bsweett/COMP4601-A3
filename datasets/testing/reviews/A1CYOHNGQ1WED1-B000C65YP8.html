To get out of his crappy life in Little Odessa, he begins selling guns to local mobsters. His business becomes larger and larger until he is the top gun runner in the world, besting a rival who had looked down on him. When communism falls in the Ukraine, he goes to see his uncle who is a Colonel in the Red army. Together they sell Russian guns, tanks, helicopters and missiles because the government is in such disarray no one is watching.<br /><br />Along the way, Orlov marries his dreamgirl, a model and struggles to help his brother stay clean of drugs and alcohol. The wife knows her husband isn't on the up and up but doesn't want to know because she says she doesn't want him to lie to her. In the end, when she finds everything out and leaves him, it's hard to have a lot of sympathy for her. Ethan Hawke plays a Javert-like Interpol agent trying desperately to put Yuri away. He knows he's guilty but can never get the proof he needs.<br /><br />This was a very well-made film. All the performances are top grade and it's a beautiful movie to look at. There is an undercurrent of very black humor throughout a serious story. The end result of what happens with all the weapons that are bought is shown bluntly and can be quite jarring. Cage does a good job playing a man fighting with the immorality of what he does while knowing, as he says in the movie, that he's good at it, and if he quits, someone else will take his place tomorrow. There are missteps along the way; a few plot points you'll see coming before they happen and some of the music choices were too obvious, but overall this was a very good movie.</p></body></html>

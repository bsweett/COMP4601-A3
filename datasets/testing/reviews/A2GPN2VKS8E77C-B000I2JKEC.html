<meta name="summary" content="The Role That Launched Christopher Reeve To Stardom!!"></head><body><p>The late Christopher Reeve skyrocketed to super stardom, launching a new genre of movies along the way, as "The Man Of Steel" in 1978's "Superman". Sadly, Reeve passed away October 10, 2004 from heart failure after suffering either a heart attack, slipping into a coma from which he would never awaken. The movie itself is classic: Oscar winners Marlon Brando ("The Godfather", "Apocalypse Now", etc) and Gene Hackman ("The French Connection", "The Poseidon Adventure", etc.) shared top billing for this movie, with Christopher Reeve, a relative unknown at the time, though he had appered in bit parts in movies like "Midway", coming in third. The strategy worked like a charm, because not only did he closely resemble the hero of the comic strip, but also because he played the part perfectly. The special effects were flawless (the film won an Oscar for Special Achievement in Visual Effects), proving that a man CAN fly. Marlon Brando was paid $10 million for 10 minutes of screen time (he appeared in the beginning as Jor-El, Superman's real father). Gene Hackman proved he could play a cartoonish villain after violent roles in films like "The French Connection". Glen Ford ("Blackboard Jungle", Midway", etc) appears in a small role as Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father. Terence Stamp and the other two who played the Krypton renegades on trial at the beginning would appear in "Superman II". Margot Kidder, who played Superman's love interest, Lois Lane, did a wonderful job, becoming one of Christopher Reeve's closest friends, both on/off screen. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty provide comic relief along with Hackman (as Lex Luthor, who would go on to appear in "Superman II" and "Superman IV") as his henchmen Otis and Miss Tessmaucher (who becomes good at the movie's climax.) John Willaims' score is irrevocably classic, identifying itself immeadiately as the main theme from "Superman", adding it to his scores from the six "STAR WARS" movies ("Episode III" to be released in theaters next summer), "Indiana Jones" and "Jurassic Park" movies, among others. Richard Donner ("The Omen", "Lethal Weapon" quadrilogy, "Ladyhawke", etc.) provides 8 minutes not seen in theaters, which enhance the film's exposition and moves ahead with the action. Also, the sound has been remixed and the widescreen format allows you to experience the picture the way the director wanted it. I have no idea why the two scenes that show up under 'deleted scenes' were cut from the film. The 2nd one would've been better if it had been restored into the picture, because it gives us an idea of the cruel way Lex wanted to punish Miss Tessmaucher. But, its showing up on DVD is okay.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Superman and Lois are flying over New York City, that is just beautiful. Although the film is based on a cartoon character, I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5 years of age, though there might be some who'll enjoy the movie, no matter what. It would be nothing less than an insult to Christopher Reeve's memory to make "Superman V". The majority of people consider Christopher Reeve to be the only person who could play Superman. Memo to Warner Bros.: If you persist in making "Superman V", it'll be the biggest mistake you've ever done, because "Superman" is one of your most popular film franchises (not only yours, but in the history of movies, there has never been such a thing as a movie franchise, like the "James Bond 007" or "STAR WARS" movies that haven't gotten A TON of hype prior to its wide release). It'll be a DISASTER for you, unless you make it (if you persist on it), do what Blake Edwards did for "Trail Of The Pink Panther": put Lois Lane (Margot Kidder, of course) to remeniscence about Superman/Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve, showing up only in shots from the four films) before he was killed by kryptonite, making it a montage of footage from all four movies, releasing it in theaters nationwide. That would be,in my opnion, the best option if you want this franchise to end with a bang. Or, if you're thinking of continuing the series (bad idea unless you want the franchise to stink after four successful movies), you could put Dean Cain (TV's "Lois And Clark" and "Clubhouse", airing on CBS) in the role instead of another actor and release it straight to video/DVD. Do that, I think it'll go a lot better or don't make it at all. Why did the MPAA say that this movie had sensuality, even making it 'mild sensuality'? There was no sensuality in this movie and the 'mild language' was only one 'damn', one  'hell' and one 'a--'. Nothing worth mentioning. Same thing with "STAR WARS Episode IV", the 'brief mild language' only consisted of two 'damn's and one 'hell'. No big deal. Also, the packaging for this movie could've been better, instead of those cheap cardboard boxes. Rated PG for peril.</p></body></html>

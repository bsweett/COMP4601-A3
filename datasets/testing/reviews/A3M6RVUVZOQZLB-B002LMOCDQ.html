It's dramatic--some of the time. And it is entertaining ALL of the time! I laughed! I cried! I cheered! I sang! I love this film--and the best part was Meryl Streep dancing and singing in all parts--whether as part of the story or in her trio.<br /><br />Everyone was delightful in his/her role. It is true--the singers are not trained professionals--they are more like real people singing in real situations. OK, most people don't blurt out in song, but wouldn't you rather have Meryl sing her own songs than have her lip sync as Audrey Hepburn did in "My Fair Lady?"<br /><br />Or to see and hear Pierce Brosnan sing so painfully in his role? His struggle lent credence to his role as a once-heartbroken young man who finds himself 20 years later in a place make amends. His singing was sweet and heartfelt.<br /><br />Or Julie Waters' show-stopping number toward the end of the film. "Take a Chance on Me!" Indeed! Or the concept of the Greek chorus (you get it?!!)--Greek chorus, made up of local villagers in just the right places for the numbers. Especially the women following Meryl/Donna scene.<br /><br />Mamma Mia--my mamma is known, but who is my dad? Sophie finds her mother's journal the summer she was conceived only to learn that her dad could be one of three men. How this is resolved is one of the great moments of the movie. It's a Greek wedding under the summer sun with a touch of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream of magic and confusion. As in the Bard's play things are set back in order, maybe a new order by movie's end.<br /><br />To get there the viewer will experience a brouhaha of ABBA melodies (the musical is based on their hits) rousing, funny, and serious. When Meryl/Donna sings to Pierce just before the wedding, my heart broke with hers. Wow, that was as powerful a scene as anything she's done dramatically in other roles.<br /><br />But enough. I want to finish watching the Feature Commentary in which Director Phyllida Lloyd explains each scene: where, how, purpose. I must confess that I didn't know outdoor scenes are often shot in studio simulations.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, I am in the Camp of "Mamma Mia!" enthusiasts. This is Review #178.</p></body></html>

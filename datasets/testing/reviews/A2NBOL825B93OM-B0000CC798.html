Now, all main characters are already introduced to those people who watched the first one, but have not a close relation to the comics. <p>At first, I thought X-2 would focus mainly on Wolverine, but that&#65533;s not true. Sure, in the moives Wolverine is still the most popular character, but he&#65533;s not alone. Every major mutant character has the chance to be a good time on screen. Every one of them is given dimension, I could see they were well-developed for screen. Even so, X-2 is not, as may happen in other similar situations, a show-case for every hero to automaticaly and pointlessly display what he/she is capable of. Every mutant&#65533;s actions is made acording to a good script, and Brian Singer&#65533;s competent direction is able to give credibility to the movie (of course, credibility based on the premises of such a movie). <p>I said the scrip is good. There are no boring fight scenes every two minutes, I could find no major sequence-continuity mistakes, no rushed conclusions, and what is best, the story doesn&#65533;t treat the viewer as an idiot. The only flaw I noticed is that the movie starts a little too fast, but that may be one more reason to keep the eyes on the screen. There are some funny moments too, mainly with Ian McKellen and his out-of-date uniform. <p>Speaking of Ian McKellen, pay attention to the casting: we don&#65533;t see this reunion of stars every day. McKellen, Patrick Stewart (the perfect Xavier), Brian Cox (as the common enemy of the mutants, that&#65533;s why the title &#65533;X-Men united&#65533;), Hugh Jackman, Allan Cumming (amazing as the dark, catholic-fervorous Nightcrawler), everyone of them exeperienced, competent actors. And the women: all of them beautiful and talented: Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen (her best role so far), Rebecca Romijn (remember to close your mouth in the scene where she is not wearing make-up). <p>Not to mention the great visual effects. X-2 was an expensive movie, but one that will easily pay-off. <p>First class entertainment, movie grade 9.2/10</p></body></html>

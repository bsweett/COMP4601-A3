<meta name="summary" content="Shrek the Third"></head><body><p>King Harold (Cleese) is dying, and names Shrek (Myers) as his heir.  Shrek wants none of that, and sets out to find Arthur (Timberlake).  Aided by Donkey (Murphy) and Puss `n Boots (Banderas), he finds Arthur only to discover he is a bit of a loser.  Meanwhile, back in Far Far Away, Prince Charming (Evert) stages a coup, imprisioning Fiona (Diaz), Queen Lillian (Andrews), Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, and others.  Shrek has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />"Shrek the Third" is move of the same.  There is nothing remotely new about this installment of the franchise.  It exists only to make money, and will make a lot of it.  But, the story feels tired this time around.  Sure, it is good to see the familiar characters once again, but they give us nothing new.  Adults may be bored, but children will probably love it (my nephew did).  I really cannot recommend this film though.</p></body></html>

I found it totally entertaining and enjoyed every minute of Meryl Streep's wicked and devilish rendition of Miranda Priestley. She managed to make the most of lesser screentime and chews up every scene effortlessly. She's so good at her expressions and body language that she upstaged everyone else in the group scenes. Her character is totally unlikeable, because she's heartless, cold, ruthless, but her performance makes it so delightful. It's unfortunate that Anne Hathaway's unfashionable Andie role took up most of the screentime. Her scenes with the boyfriend and friends really took away from the focus of the film. I wanted to see more of her opposite Streep, and how she worked around the Devil. Yes, I did find the scenes of Miranda's nasty treatments towards Andie became too repetitious, but it was pretty much the funniest moments of the film. It's obvious that Hathaway's performance is not as impressive as Streep and the scene stealing Stanley Tucci who helps her to transform from an ugly duckling into a fashion chick. Emily Blunt who plays Miranda's first assistant gets to have some funny moments to work with. I couldn't stop thinking that she looks so much like Cilian Murphy in Breakfast in Pluto. Overall, the film is very stimulating comedy with lots of high fashion moments, not to mention that they got all the top designer wardrobe for the cast especially Streep who had the most lavish wardrobe changes. Even Valentino made a cameo apperance! I must say that Patricia Field did a marvellous job with the costume, even the "stuff" she put together for Andie looks so hideous that it was perfect. I won't be surprised if Streep and Field will receive an Oscar nomination for their memorable works come 2007.</p></body></html>

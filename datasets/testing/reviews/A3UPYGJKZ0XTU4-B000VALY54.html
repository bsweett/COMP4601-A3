<meta name="summary" content="Superficial Spoof of Hollywood & Hard-Boiled Detective Stories."></head><body><p>"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is a comedic murder mystery written and directed by Shane Black, based in part on the novel "Bodies are Where You Find Them" by Brett Halliday. It honors and spoofs many of the stylistic conventions of film noir and hard-boiled detective fiction: subjective voice-over narration, flashback sequences, an Everyman caught in desperate circumstances, an aloof, savvy private detective, tough-guy masculinity, and six-shooters. The titles that introduce each chapter as the mystery unfolds are titles of Raymond Chandler stories.<br /><br />Harry Lockart (Robert Downey, Jr.) was a small-time crook in New York when he stumbled into an audition for a detective film, was snatched up by an agent, and whisked to Los Angeles. Attending a party at the home of socialite Harlan Dexter (Corbin Bernsen), Harry is introduced to private detective Perry Van Shrike (Val Kilmer), who is consulting on the detective film. Harry also spots a pretty aspiring actress at the party, Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), whom he discovers is his old friend and big crush from high school. Harry's agent has arranged for him to take detective lessons from Perry, so he accompanies Perry on a surveillance job. It turns out to be a harrowing evening when they witness the disposal of a murdered corpse and then learn that Harmony may have killed herself. Are the incidents unrelated, or is everything connected, in the style of a pulp detective novel?<br /><br />"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" has some fun moments. It sends up both film noir and Hollywood culture but seems to be primarily concerned with getting laughs. I don't think I laughed. The parody is a little too in-your-face, cheesy, and superficial. Film noir and Hollywood lifestyles are so present in American media that I think audiences will find the spoofs in "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" too simplistic. People have a relatively sophisticated view of these subjects at this point. I was distracted by the film's lighting, which is oddly inappropriate in some scenes -to the extent that I repeatedly found myself wondering where the light was coming from. Harry and Harmony could not have attended high school together. The actors are 10 years apart and look it. "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" does have a quick enough pace that it didn't bore me. But it never engaged me either, so details that are amiss became glaring.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): There is a "Gag Reel" (4 min), a theatrical trailer (2 min), and an audio commentary with writer/director Shane Black, Val Kilmer, and Robert Downey Jr. The commentary is conversational, with Kilmer talking a lot, Downey hardly ever, and Shane Black contributing some comments on camera work, audience reactions, performances, and filming. There is some commentary in every scene, though it isn't always informative. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

Spike Lee directing has always impressed me but his movies are not usually for the whole family. In fact it is rare that the whole family can sit down and watch an adult movie these days that will be only slightly offensive to some. Here is such a movie. At first you will think you know what is happening, then you will figure it out. That is until the next scene. This is one of those, so you think you know what is going to happen next movies. The ending will make you satisified and on many levels, including lack of real violence. After all it is the perfect bank robbery.<br /><br />We are led to believe this movie is about bank robbers and hostages with a tense stand off with police. Okay there is some of that, but it goes much further. Do the robbers intend to take the money? No, but perhaps not what you think to substitute for it. The story unfolds so that we now think an outside negotiator will settle the deal and that's the end of it. But no we have an honest detective that wants the whole story and that is where it will all end when he lays all the cards on the table. I recommend this to the whole family. It is slick enough that it has replayability and I suggest those that like movies like "The Italian Job" buy it since it has the suspense and con stuff less the violence.</p></body></html>

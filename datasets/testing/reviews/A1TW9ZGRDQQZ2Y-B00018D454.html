<meta name="summary" content="5 Stars for the Movie..but also 5 for the Package &amp; Features"></head><body><p>This is my second favorite horror remake right behind &quot;Dawn of the Dead.&quot; I have already reviewed the film once, so now I will talk about the features on the Platinum Series Special Edition. First off you get three commentary tracks, which I don't care for, but lots of people seem to like to listen to this sort of thing. Then you get an awesome 75 minute making of feature that talks about the old TCM and the new one. Then you get a 25 minute documentary feature on the real life sick pycho Ed Gein who influenced the making of the original TCM and many other horror films. This documentary contains real footage and some disturbing photographs and it's quite hard to fathom what Gein actually did to people's bodies. Very morbid feature, yet somehow very interesting. Then you get about 8 deleted scenes. The only one that stands out is Alternate Death of Morgan. In the film Leatherface hooks him up to the ceiling and you hear his chainsaw, but it never shows what he does and Morgan dies almost instantly. But in this deleted scene, lets just say the scene left a much bigger impression in my mind and the film could have benefited from more chainsaw gore since you don't really see the Pepper girl killed either. You also get your promotional stuff: Trailer, Photo Galleries, and DVD-Rom Feature. Make sure you buy this Special Edition version, because for only around $10.00 more you get loads of stuff. Also included in the set is a cool metal display cover featuring Leatherface and 8 Crime Scene Photos. Not to mention the dvd display folds out with a chainsaw background. This Disc is worth every penny to all horror fans out there.</p></body></html>

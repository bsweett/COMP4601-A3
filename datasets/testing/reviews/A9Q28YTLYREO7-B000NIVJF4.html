<meta name="summary" content="Forest Whitaker was great,but the film was so-so"></head><body><p>i saw this Movie last night and thought that Forest Whittaker did a great Job as Ugandan Leader Idi Amin. Whitaker captures the Rawness and the Charisma that was Amin. the film during the last  forty minutes brings all the rawness and coldness. the Maddness and and varous other things are all here. I thought that Dr.Garrigan was interesting,but while the Movie had strong points, i just felt that Forest Whitaker was the main reason why this film worked because alot of the film was kinda there.if this film had have matched Whitaker's Intensity then this film would have swept at the Oscars in a Breeze.</p></body></html>

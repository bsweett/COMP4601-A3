<meta name="summary" content="AN INCREDIBLE FILM THAT HAS BEEN COPIED TO DEATH!"></head><body><p>This movie was so original at the time of it's release, but it has been copied so many time we forget this is where it all began. A gritty ingenious taunt thriller/horror/mystery film that is just the best of it's kind! Another golden performance by Freeman and Spacey is at his chilling best! It seems that every horror film I see now has ripped this film off in some way! Forget the phonies and check this one out again and if you haven't seen it......be prepared for an unforgetable journey! The 2 disc set has a great transfer and loads of extras!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best football movies ever"></head><body><p>Living in Texas it's almost a right of passage to watch this film.  A true story it's sure a touching one when you see what these young men with subject themselves to for a trophy because it's so much more than that.  I watched this film with a good friend who was brought to tears.  This is a film, not about football but about comrodery, about devotion and dreams and acheiving those dreams through devotion and yes, comrodery.  What's starts off somewhat like a documentary on 'making the team' or 'meeting the team' turns into a heart tugging event as you watch these young men go through quite a bit in order to realize their dreams.  The QB and his devotion, not only to the sport but to his ailing mother.  The running back who lives under the shadow of a former famous father (played BRILLIANTLY by Tim McGraw) who is now quite the drunk and abusive to boot.  And then there's Booby Miles...the star of the team, but with a hurt knee he because a loose link in the chain.  You can really see how these kids rely on each other to pull through.  The scene where they are all crying on each other in the locker room is especially touching.  What stood out to me was the end, the 'where they are now' type part and you see that only one member of the team is doing anything football related now...it shows that these kids are just normal kids, and now they are normal men, but it was the dream that was so real it made them almost superhuman.  This is a great film to watch over and over with brillant acting by most of the cast.  Billy Bob Thorton is fine, but outshined by Derek Luke (brilliant kid) and Tim McGraw (I was floored...but he STOLE every scene he was in) as well as Lucas Black, a relative newcomer who played the QB and real heart of the team.  Wonderful movie that will tug at the heartstrings and by the end will make you feel proud to be a Texan...err...well, you fill in the blank _______________.</p></body></html>

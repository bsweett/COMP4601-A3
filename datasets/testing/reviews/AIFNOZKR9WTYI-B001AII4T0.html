During the opening scene the movie actually seems like it might be watchable.  Then everything goes right down the can for good and all.  What's that?  You want examples?  Well, again, maybe I'm just nuts, but I just can't sit still for one more movie make out scene where big name actor and actress unconvincingly, passionlessly grope eachother and then kiss eachother openmouthed without tongues.  I mean what IS that?!?!  Its like the make-out equivalent of those movie telephone numbers that all start with 555 in order to give you to understand that its fake, not real, so you don't go out to the lobby and dial the number because you've got nothing else to do and you wind up bothering some old lady in Phoenix.  But exactly what prank are we prevented from by the fake french kissing?  And, if there is some law that stipulates that people in movies can't french kiss, then why bother at all?  Are the audience members supposed to count themselves lucky they got on board with this picture because now they're sitting there in the theater and there's kinda sorta some almost making out?  Anybody who gets turned on by this crudola has got more serious problems than going to a movie is going to solve.<br />Then, there's the matter of dialog.  For example a scene in which Ben Affleck's girlfriend - whom he's just been fake-kissing - is at her post as a med student, scrubbing up before some nameless operation with another female med student who is asking about Affleck's job.  Now, first of all, isn't this talking while scrubbing up scene a bit run into the ground?  I mean do we have to see it yet one more time because the screenwriter just couldn't be bothered to think of something original?  And THEN... so the girlfriend tells her coworker that Affleck is a historian.  THe coworker, who is obviously supposed to be a highly educated if not intelligent person says "Ya-awn!" as if she is twelve years old and palling around with her idiot friends at the local mall.  I mean listen, maybe this person is a piece of garbage, but she as a med student must be no stranger to the mind-numbing tedium of endless details that must be crammed into one's brain to get that big degree.  I'm sure much of medical study is profoundly boring, so where does this chick get off?!?!?</p></body></html>

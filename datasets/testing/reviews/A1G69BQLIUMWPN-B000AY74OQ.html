(there was an little while where the story gets boring.)  But, I love the penguins and the fact that they are always so sneaky; they really steal the show from the main characters.  If you have kids this is a definite must see, we had kids laughing the whole time and most loved the bright colors, music and especially dancing.  You saw a lot of little kids dancing in their chairs.  People without kids or older kids will also enjoy the movie as it has a lot of jokes for adults to keep us entertained and laughing; the bright colors are also great for us as well as the dancing and music.  I felt this cartoon lived up to its previews and the way it was perceived.  My only hope is if they do a 2nd one that they include more of those sneaky penguins.</p></body></html>

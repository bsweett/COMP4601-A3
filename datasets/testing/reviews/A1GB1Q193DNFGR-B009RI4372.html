<meta name="summary" content="A Horror Die-Hard's Horror Film"></head><body><p>Though definitely not for everyone, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead is the quintessential Horror Comedic Gore film. Filled with outrageous decapatations, bodily dismemberments, bleeding plumbing, exploding chest  cavities, tons of Kayo sryup, a perfectedly cast Bruce Campbell, and an  abundance of Three Stodges physical humor, Evil Dead astounded 80's  audiences with it's warped comically tinted interptation of the  conventional horror film. Though reportedly made for a scantly 50,000, the  film's low budget didn't hamper Sam Raimoi's stylistically virtuoso  direction brimming with oft-kilter camera angeles, hyper-kinetically  panning, and alrmingly ubrupt close-ups from engraving Evil Dead as one of  the most extraordinary enthralling horror opuses in the history of cinema.  A Must-Buy. Definitely a stellar DVD package filled with everything a  Dedite fan could possibly desire.</p></body></html>

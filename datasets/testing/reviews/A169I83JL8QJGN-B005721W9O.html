<meta name="summary" content="Why did I like this movie in the theater?"></head><body><p>I saw this movie in the theater and loved it, but when I rented the DVD to  show my uninterested family I found it uninteresting myself. I wonder what  happened. One time I see it, I love it, the second time I'm board and want  to go play video games. Odd, must be a one timer.</p></body></html>

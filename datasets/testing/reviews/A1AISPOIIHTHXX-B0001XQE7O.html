<meta name="summary" content="Different than typical ones but one of his better ones"></head><body><p>It's funny that despite films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands on his resume, Tim Burton is always known as director behind Batman and its sequel, Sleepy Hollow and Beetlejuice, very dark gothic films. So it's quite surprise to see Big Fish, not only because it's tonally different but also cause it's good.<br /><br />Will is trying to figure out the kind of man his father is, only problem is his father is Edward Bloom. He's particularly known for telling wild stories to the point where they become just mere fairytale-like which is exactly what Will hates. So before Ed dies, Will wants to know his dad once and for all.<br /><br />In flashback mode, Edward as a young kid got a glimpse into his death by means of a witch with a magical glass eye. So he decides what anyone would probably do: go nuts and explore the world. His adventures find himself finding a colorful town, in the war, meeting the girl of his dreams from the moment he first saw her and being his own boss. He ends up meeting a wild assortment of characters including a really big giant, a Ron Jeremy look-alike circus runner and a poet.<br /><br />It's quite a change from film like Sleepy Hollow but his trademark visual style is still here. I think what sets this fim apart from other films with similar set design is that here it feels natural and not too flashy. Meanwhile something like Chocolate Factory where yeah it was really vibrant but it felt rather plastic oddly enough, as if it was designed solely to get a rise out of people. Here it falls in naturally.<br /><br />Acting-wise is pretty straight across the board. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney do great jobs as young and old Edward Bloom and always dependable and cutie Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange plays his love Sandra. The rest of them are kind of one-note but they're endearing anyway so we don't really mind.<br /><br />For people wondering whether it's worth the double dip if you have the original, ask yourself one question: do you want a book? Because that's pretty much what this release does that's different. It's a book filled with artwork. The DVD is essentially the same, probably right down to its packaging too(I didn't buy the old one).<br /><br />If you're a big fan of Edward Scissorhands, you'll probably get into this one. For all others, give it a try. Might surprise you.</p></body></html>

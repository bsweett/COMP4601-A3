<meta name="summary" content="A classic of the horror genre - 4 stars"></head><body><p>There have been so many reviews written on this movie that I won't give a detailed review. Read the other 800+ reviews for a more thorough analysis of this classic movie and its plot, etc. However, I just want to make a few observations and give some personal opinions.<br /><br />The Exorcist is referred to as "The Scariest Movie Of All Time" on the DVD cover. Well, perhaps it may well have been up to that time (1973), though that of course is debatable (personally, I don't think it is at all). I can think of 20 + other horror movies that I feel are scarier than The Exorcist. To me, this movie is more bizarre and twisted than it is scary. A demonically possessed 12 year old girl who demonstrates increasingly bizarre, twisted behavior certainly is scary, but I find humor in a lot of her comments and scenes in general. Every time the scene comes on where she delivers a left hook to her mother's face and spins her head around, I laugh.  That is laugh-out-loud funny.  I find her filthy language humorous. To me, the viewer shouldn't be laughing during a movie that's supposed to be scary. I'm sure these scenes were meant to be scary, but they come off as funny sometimes, to me, anyway. Another thing - she's confined to her bed most of the time, so she's only scaring people who visit her room.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie is that it has a lot of slow moving and boring scenes. Had a lot of these scenes been cut down or eliminated, the movie would retain a more consistent horror feel to it. Instead, the movie kind of meanders around at a slow pace, showing everything from boring conversation over a cup of coffee to a man jogging around a high school track. What's really bad is whenever the movie seems to be gaining some momentum, suddenly it slows down again with some of the above mentioned things.  I know that the goal of the director is to have a gradual buildup of tension/suspense, but again, this buildup is inconsistent.  One positive to the movie is the fact that it's fall and it's late October (one scene shows some kids running along the sidewalk dressed in their Halloween costumes with the Tubular Bells song playing).  That's pretty creepy.<br /><br />The Exorcist Tubular Bells theme song is one of the classic horror movie themes of all time, but it's hardly ever played in the movie. Its absence lowers the scare level. A great musical score can make a movie scarier than it normally would be without the music. It can make all the difference in the world. Think of movies like Psycho (1960), Carnival Of Souls (1962), The Haunting (1963), The Omen (1976), Halloween (1978), The Amityville Horror (1979), movies like these. Also, to me, one of the elements that a scary movie needs is a lot of darkness. A lot of nighttime footage, both indoors and outdoors. The use of shadows, dark shades, and low lighting. The Exorcist lacks this. Most of the scenes are during daylight hours. Some of the daylight scenes are pretty creepy, though. I also value suspense and psychological horror, such as in The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), and The Changeling (1980). I know that The Exorcist is a different kind of horror movie, but it lacks these two important qualities that I feel qualify a movie to be considered very scary.<br /><br />In 1973 there was another movie that was released that had to compete with The Exorcist, and that is The Legend Of Hell House. This movie is scarier than The Exorcist, in my opinion. But it got buried as a result of The Exorcist's popularity. There have been many other movies since 1973 that have been scarier than The Exorcist, such as The Omen (1976), Burnt Offerings (1976), Halloween (1978), Salem's Lot (1979), The Changeling (1980), The Shining (1980), etc. Many movies that came before The Exorcist are scarier, such as Psycho (1960), The Innocents (1961), The Haunting (1963), etc.<br /><br />I first saw The Exorcist back in 2000 and was expecting it to be the scariest movie I've ever seen. It wasn't. Not even close. It does have its moments, though. I rank it maybe the 23rd scariest movie I've ever seen. I have an arsenal of horror movies. Whenever I want to watch a really scary movie, I never make The Exorcist my first choice.<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie?  Yes. It's a horror classic with a memorable theme song. It's a brilliant mix of horror and religion. It should be in everyone horror fan's collection. I give it 4 stars because it's a classic, well made, has a memorable score, and has good acting. But I hardly nominate it as "The Scariest Movie Of All Time".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Citizen Kane"></head><body><p>There has probably been more pearls of wisdom cast at CITIZEN KANE than any other movie.  I just did a book search on the title here on Amazon and came up with 43 results.  There are `Perspectives on,'  `Focus on,' `Casebook on' and a `Making of' or two, as well as a waggish `Raising Kane.'  Tossing out the strays - Jeffrey Archer's `Kane and Abel,' for instance -- that haven't a thing to do with Orson Welles' masterpiece, you're still left with a shelf full of books on the movie.  And that doesn't even begin to count the magazine and journal articles.<br /><br />  So what's a rube to do?  Any `insight' I might offer on CITIZEN KANE has undoubtedly been gurgitated and regurgitated a dozen time.  The best I can come up with is this: The last time I saw this it was a cheap vhs tape and I remember disliking it quite a bit.  The Warners' Home Video disk is extremely clean and the movie benefits tremendously.  You've really got to watch a clean print of this one to appreciate it.  This will never be my favorite movie - or even my favorite Orson Welles movie - but I've watched it three times (the disk has a separate commentary track with Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert) and I've seen something new in it each time.  Not just because the commentators point it out, either, although the commentaries help in appreciating the nuances of Welles' direction and Gregg Toland's camera-work.<br /><br />The two-hour long `The Battle Over Citizen Kane' documentary on disk two, an episode of PBS's `American Experience,' gives a welcome and complete overview of the controversy surrounding the production and distribution of the movie.  The clutch of specials on disk one - ad campaigns, call sheets, etc. - are interesting but, unlike the `Battle' on disk two, unessential.  CITIZEN KANE, however, is essential viewing for anyone with an involved interest in movies beyond the current hits.  I didn't love it, but after watching it three times in a short span I can now appreciate why it's considered by many the greatest movie ever made.</p></body></html>

It has brilliant animation, delightful characters ("Mike Wazowski!"), and a really endearing storyline about a little kid who makes her way into the monster world.<br /><br />The monster metropolis of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of frightened children, which are gathered every night by specially-trained Scarers that pop out of closets. The top Scarer However, Monsters Inc. is suffering from a shortage, since kids are getting harder to scare.<br /><br />The top Scarer is James P. "Sully" Sullivan (who resembles The Beast with a bad blue dye job), accompanied by his talkative pal Mike Wazowski (who resembles a giant green grape with one big eyeball). But one night, Sully finds a child's door left activated on the scare floor... and while trying to hide from the treacherous Scarer Randall, he inadvertently lets a toddler into the monster world.<br /><br />Since children are considered to be toxic, the child (whom Sully named "Boo") causes a mass panic -- and somehow Sully and Mike have to find a way to return her to her own world without implicating themselves. But when Randall tries to strike a deal with Mike and Sully, the monster pals uncover a dangerous plot that could be deadly to both them... and Boo.<br /><br />Pixar has a way of making the weirdest plots seem natural and logical. Imagine a city populated by all sorts of weird creatures -- a jellyish creature that slips through a grate, a sluglike janitor who is constantly mopping his own slime, a giant chameleon, monster kids jumping rope with their playmate's long tongue, a Medusa-haired secretary, and the fuzzy-faced Adorable/Agreeable Snowman.<br /><br />The story is simple, quick-paced and full of physical comedy (mostly provided by Mike) and delightfully funny dialogue ("What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?" "I get a time out?" "Everyone goes to LUNCH! Which means the scare floor will be....?" "... painted?"). There's a draggy section in the middle where Mike and Sully are racing around Monsters Inc., but the rest of the time it's a wild, funny little story (Sully having to sneak Boo into the bathroom).<br /><br />However, since this is Pixar, they manage to sneak some truly touching moments into the story -- Sully's paternal affection for Boo is really adorable, making it all the harder for him to think about sending her away. And Mike and Sully's relationship comes under stress because of it ("I am now stuck in this frozen WASTELAND!").<br /><br />John Goodman and Billy Crystal are simply PERFECT as Mike and Sully -- one is the enormous genial buddy-buddy, and the other is a shrill-voiced, high-strung little weirdo ("One of these days I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson!"). Steve Buscemi's Randall is deliciously bad (no misunderstandings or tragic backstory -- he's just bad. And Mary Gibbs (Boo), Jennifer Tilly and James Coburn all put out brilliant performances in their well-developed roles.<br /><br />It's whimsical, funny and a cute fantasy twist on the usual "working joe" environment -- "Monsters Inc" is one of those rare movies that the entire family (and not just the kids) can enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Land of the Dead"></head><body><p>Kaufman (Hopper) is a very wealthy man who owns a high-rise in zombie-free Pittsburgh called Fiddler's Green.  All the privlidged live there, while the rest live on the streets.  Riley (Baker) and Cholo (Leguizamo) are two of Kaufman's henchmen.  Their job is to journey outside the city and bring supplies back while avoiding the zombies.  They are two sides of the same coin, Riley wants to help people and Cholo wants to help himself.  Both manage to anger Kaufman though.  Riley saves a woman (Argento) from being thrown to the zombies, and Cholo's ambition marks him as a threat to Kaufman.<br /><br />Cholo steals Dead Reconing, a armored vehicle capable of doing some serious damage in the wrong hands, and Kaufman must ask Riley for help.  After all, Riley created Dead Reconing.  This involves leaving the city again to find Cholo.  Of course the zombies are not helpful as they stalk the living and find out that perhaps thay can get into the city after all.  All to this the beginnings of thought abongst the undead, and there is a whole lot of trouble brewing.<br /><br />This is the fourth zombie movie from George A. Romero, creater of "Night of the Living Dead".  Those with a fondness for zombie movies will not be disappointed, although I found it inferior to last year's "Dawn of the Dead" remake.  There are lots of zombies and clever deaths, and the story takes us down a somewhat new path in the zombie genre.  Dennis Hopper is great as the Trump-lik Kaufman, and he steals every scene that he is in.  The rest of the cast gets the job done, but they are nothing spectacular.<br /><br />"Land of the Dead" gives you exactly what you would expect, and perhaps a bit more.  There is some commentary on the world today, but not enough to interfere with a good old fashioned zombie movie.  I recommend to fans of the genre.</p></body></html>

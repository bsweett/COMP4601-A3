<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Bloody Good Time!!!"></head><body><p>This is the movie my friends and I have waited three long years to see. It's very bloody, gory, sexy, kinky and funny and that's what makes it a good movie to see with your buds. I noticed there were a few scenes from the faux trailer that weren't used in the movie, but it won't ruin the fun. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a former Mexican Federale turned renegade. Three years after a druglord named Torrez killed his family, Machete is in Texas trying to find work. Machete is soon hired by a businessman named Booth to kill the corrupt Senator McLaughlin. After Machete is set-up, double crossed, and left for dead, he puts together a team of illegal immigrants to kill the bad guys. If you wanna eff with the wrong Mexican, I highly recommend MACHETE!!!</p></body></html>

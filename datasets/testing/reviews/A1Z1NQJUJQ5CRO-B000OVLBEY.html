<meta name="summary" content="Ghost Rider-The Devil's bounty hunter"></head><body><p>Ghost Rider(released Feb/07) is yet another comic book incarnation of a character brought to the big screen.This one stars Peter Fonda,Nicholas Cage and Sam Elliot,and the results are a mixed bag.The plot and back story can be a little too stop and go for my tastes,while the movie itself only comes to life when the action starts in and the S/FX range free.<br />The movie opens as Sam Elliot narrates the legend of the Ghost Rider.It seems one Carter Slade(Elliot),once a cowboy now doing the Devil's bidding(Fonda),was under orders to retrieve and deliver a contract which contained about 1000 souls.Slade,figuring this was too much power even for the Devil himself,fled with the contract and hid it.Fast forward a hundred or so years and a young 17 year old Johnny Blaze is in a motorcycle show with his dad.However when he finds out his dad is dying of cancer,the Devil steps in to offer a cure for his dad,in exchange for Johnny's soul.Tricked,Johnny inadvertently signs the pact and his father is cured.However the following day just as Johnny is about to elope with his girlfriend his father is killed during his show.The Devil reappears telling Johnny to forget his life as he knows it and that he now owns him,and will return for him when he so wishes.<br />Fast forward once more and Johnny is now an older professional motorcycle thrill rider,doing the most spectacular stunts the world has ever seen.He has a team of workers that travel the country with his show,but he has been alone since his dad's demise and remains a solitary figure.Johnny continues not only to push his limits but looks for a sign that one day may turn his life around for the better.That sign comes one day in the form of the girl he stood up the day his father died.She is now a reporter who asks and gets an interview with the reclusive motorcyclist.<br />From this time on his attitude starts to change but as things would have it the Devil comes a-calling,and he is in need of his property.It seems the Devil's own son is bent on finding the lost soul pact and kicking his father off the evil throne.The Devil recruits Johnny to stop him and enhances his abilities by turning him into a Ghost Rider,replete with jacked up bike and leather accessories,all to go with the flaming skull Johnny sports whenever evil is present.<br />In a lonely cemetery after his first nights ride,he meets the caretaker there.He seems to know more about Johnny and his alter ego than he should.Several nights pass and Johnny encounters the Devil's son and his minions.One by one he slowly takes them out.One day the caretaker reveals that he is THE Carter Slade and he gives Johnny the pact the Devil is searching for.Together they ride to the original town where the souls were collected.Slade leaves Johnny,telling him to keep to the shadows,as he disappears.Johnny indeed confronts the Devil's son,known as Blackheart and after obtaining the pact,unleashes the 1000 souls which pour relentlessly into his body.What might have been an advantage for Blackheart turns out,in the end,to work in Johnny's favour.Johnny had a Pennance Stare with which he neutralized enemies previously.He tried it once on Blackheart previously to no avail,as he did not have a soul.Now filled with 1000 of them Johnny tries it again and it succeeds.<br />Johnny is reunited with his love and the Devil reappears.He tells Johnny that there is no longer any need to keep his powers as he has fulfilled his contract with him.Johnny however decides to keep his powers,telling the Devil that anywhere there are injustices to be righted and innocent blood spilled,in his fathers name he will be there to right it.The Devil is beyond mad and disappears.<br />Peter Fonda makes a good Devil here but I don't think it was quite good enough.He just didn't have that extra oomph,like Peter Stormare had in Constantine,playing the same part.Cage is,well Cage,and does a good job in his role as J.Blaze.Sam Elliot does a very good job as Carter Slade and it is easy to see why he has played so many cowboys in films in recent years;he is just a natural at it.That easy going drawl goes down like a good swig of southern iced tea on a sweltering day!<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its' original a/r of 2:40:1.This is a two disc edition.The first contains some rare footage and numerous commentaries.The second disc contains three features on the making of the film,the animatics of the film and a featurette on 40 years of comic Ghost Rider.More than enough to satisfy your curiosity about the film and its roots.<br />In conclusion an entertaining romp with a generally good cast and excellent special effects.It could have garnered more stars from me,but the movie only really gets going once the action starts and can be slightly slow going between times.3 1/2-4 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - 'Gangs' of Disappointment"></head><body><p>The idea for Gangs of New York, a film about the oppression of the Irish immigrants in 1860's America, had been floating around the head of Martin Scorsese for nearly thirty years and after continuous production delays and release date changes, his dream film is finally making it to theaters. Most of the buzz generated for the film had been created by the film's problems both on and off the set. Such rumors included fights on the set and Leonardo DiCaprio delaying production over money issues. Whether or not it was over money, the film was delayed several times over the course of a year being moved from December 2001 to July 2002 only to receive a release date on the week before Christmas Day 2002, one year after it was originally planned. If the film is truly another masterpiece from the famous director then all these headaches will be worth it. But could all these problems overwhelm the $100 million budgeted film?<p>The story for Gangs of New York focuses on the oppressions of the Irish Americans forced upon them by the "native" Americans. Amsterdam Vallon returns to the city of New York after spending nearly sixteen years in jail. New York was once his home before his father, leader of the "Dead Rabbits" gang, was killed by Bill the Butcher, the leader of "natives" who opposed immigration in America. Amsterdam returns to the mean streets seeking revenge and joins the "natives" in order to get closer to Bill. Bill forms a special bond with Amsterdam and treats him like the son he never had, not knowing that Amsterdam is secretly plotting his demise. Along the way, Vallon sees the horrible conditions the Irish are living under and decides to raise up a gang not only to fight against the "natives" but the corrupt government of New York. The story of Gangs of New York may seem great on paper but when it is brought to the screen, it just becomes too confusing by the end. The main focus should have been the historical aspect talking about the time period and political corruption but by adding the Amsterdam subplot, the two stories get too jumbled together to find a clear perception on what is going on. <p>The Martin Scorsese flick is impressive for its large assemble cast alone but the main characters are well done as well for the most part. Gangs of New York is the first of two films Leonardo DiCaprio opening around Christmas Day 2002 but both roles show that he can't boast his acting ability outside of Titanic. He does a pretty good job at making the audience accept him as an Irish immigrant but the main problem is with the character's story involvement. Amsterdam is way too complicated to fully understand that the plot never fully clears up unanswered questions about him but that is not DiCaprio's fault. Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent as Bill the Butcher. The accent he gave the character as well as the stirring emotions sets the mood for a "native" New Yorker in the 1860's. The only character in the film that seemed out of place was Jenny Everdeane, played by Cameron Diaz. Once again it is not the actor's fault but the fault of the script. Diaz does a wonderful job with the character but there just seems to be no point to her outside of being attractive eye candy.<p>Overall, Gangs of New York, as good as the buzz tries to make it out to be, is a big disappointment. The story of the film is the most noticeable problem. The era of the 1860's is a fascinating time to set a film against but the problem is that the film fails to remind people what is going on at this time. When they join the historical aspect of the script with the Amsterdam revenge plot, the whole thing just becomes too jumbled together to get a straight story out of it. How the historical aspects were handled was also a problem. The fact that the Union and the draft were shown in a bad light was probably the most upsetting part of the entire film. The three hour time length of Gangs didn't help the story as most just seemed drag on. When one part of the story seems to be going in one direction, it ends up just being turned into another direction. Scorsese could have saved at least a hour and a half of the audience's time by cutting out many unwanted scenes to direct us straight to the ending instead of dragging it out. Speaking of the ending, this has to be one of the most disappointing endings in quite awhile. They built all this emotion and intensity into the characters but that is just ruined with this ending. There are good things about Gangs of New York but they are so few and far between that they can be mentioned right now. See the film by all means if you really want to see it. If not then wait for the rental on DVD.</p></body></html>

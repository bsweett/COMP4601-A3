<meta name="summary" content="Awesome movie!!!!!"></head><body><p>Since its release in 1999, I have had 7 or 8 people tell me how good this is, but I have always stayed away from it simply because of its use of the electric chair, the last thing I want to see is someone eletrocuted I have thought over the years, well, I decided to give it a look, & man, I can't believe that I ignored it for so long, this film was awesome, I still can't get my mind off it, there is nothing I can't say here that hasn't already been said, except to say, that it is truly inspiring & sad, that I teared up at the end, I hate it when movies do that to me, but this is one of the best films I have ever seen, It is over 3 hours, but trust me, you won't notice, Highly Recommended!!!</p></body></html>

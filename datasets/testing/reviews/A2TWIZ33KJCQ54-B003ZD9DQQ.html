In Downfall, the viewer has a front-row seat and there is much here one may not wish to see or to allow children to see. Essentially, this is gritty, harsh stuff depicting the end of the most tragic and convulsive period in history. That's right, Berlin during the last week of April, 1945 and, more specifically, in and around Hitler's bunker with Adolph Hitler as the central character.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL -- DOWNFALL MAINTAINS AN ATMOSPHERE OF TRAGIC DESPERATION FOR 2.5 HOURS<br /><br />Basically, everything that is depicted in this film has been documented and is true to historic fact, so there are no real surprises to anyone that has studied the Third Reich. Nevertheless, from beginning to end, the viewer is steeped in the tragic circumstances of the soon-to-be beaten Germans. Somehow, it seems very sad and pitiful. Hitler seems like a tragic figure, while Doctor and Frau Goebbels seem like the parents from a horror movie and their sweet, cute children don't know that their parents are the monsters. There is a whole subplot involving the final disposition of the Goebbels' children that might best be skipped over for some viewers. It is all quite true, but truly gruesome.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT -- HITLER'S GERMANY IS DISINTEGRATING & WE ALL HAVE FRONT ROW SEATS<br /><br />The real question here is --- DO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE IT? Put simply, this film is an honest-to-goodness downer! If you are prone to feeling blue or miserable from witnessing human misery, you will feel pretty low after this. That's because this is both very realistic and based on historic fact so that, after the film, one cannot take comfort from the knowledge that this was only a movie. The truth is that this film gets as close to the truth as any has to date, but the actual gut-wrenching experience of being in Berlin during this final curtain call for the Third Reich is beyond description. Frankly, those that survived [and so many died horribly] like Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) were put into such a state of shock that they never recovered from the experience. Having Traudl Junge's experiences incorporated into the film as a viewpoint character adds perspective and humanizes this last week of the New Germany beyond where the historic source material, provided chiefly by Joachim C. Fest, could have taken it.<br /><br />ABOUT BRUNO GANZ AS ADOLF HITLER:<br /><br />Ganz gives the best rendition of Chancellor Hitler to date. He is a surprisingly-sympathetic character who is literally being buried alive by the weight of the calamities surrounding him. He appears to be poorly served by his inner circle who are waiting around for him to come up with some brillant master stroke to save everyone's bacon. Of course, Hitler knows he can't pull a rabbit out of his hat this time, and that fact is killing him right in front of our eyes. His coping skills fail him as he turns first on his followers and then the German people as a whole. Clearly, Hilter was pretty much losing his sanity at this point and everyone seemed to simply lean all the more on him as things grew darker. Small wonder he shot himself and took poison along with his new bride [she took only poison in order to avoid tarnishing her looks, before the petrol treatment, that is.]<br /><br />PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT IS SHOWN IS HORRIBLE [ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE HORROR WAS NOT SHOWN]:<br /><br />Yes, we see children being armed and then killed defending Berlin. We see the wounded and the civilians being pushed aside like fodder and we see the death of a great culture in Berlin itself. Throughout this film, one indeed gets the impression that it is far easier to destroy than to create. We see a lot of destruction and self-destruction, such as Germans executing their own people at the very end and then killing themselves. Generals of the Army [Jodl - Keitel] were later executed anyway at Nuremburg, so perhaps they had the right idea.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz deserves an Academy Award and Alexandra Maria Lara and Julianne Kohler are true standouts. The casting and the acting in this film are first-rate and many of the characters (Joseph Goebells, in particular) bear uncanny resemblance to their true counterparts.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: RAW HISTORY -- SORRY, NO HAPPY ENDINGS HERE<br /><br />"Downfall' is a phenomenal film that uses the cold historic facts of sources like Joachim C. Fest's "Inside Hitler's Bunker" to get the story correct. It then adds the additional humanizing effect of Traudl Junge's memoirs, which are effectively inserted into the film from its first scene until its last.<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED: HITLER: THE LAST 10 DAYS, 1973, ALEC GUINNESS</p></body></html>

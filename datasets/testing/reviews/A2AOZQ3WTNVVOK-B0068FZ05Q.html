Well, I did it once again and was disappointed. That does not make this a bad movie, just a movie that has very little in common with the book, so I was confused nearly from the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />A man with two bullet holes is discovered floating in the ocean. When the man wakes up he has no memory. Why is he in the ocean? Who shot him? Who is he? He follows clues, including a clue to a bank account implanted under his skin, and learns that he may be Jason Bourne. However, he also learns that he may be someone else. He also learns that he may be an assassin.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie has Matt Damon trying to keep alive and periodically killing people to do so. However, while his nemesis in the original Robert Ludlum novel was Carlos the Jackal, and he did his very best to avoid killing the spies from his side sent to kill him because they thought he might be a traitor, in the movie there is no Carlos and everyone with a gun he encounters is out to kill him. In substitute for Carlos the Jackal is Treadstone, which was a secret project to field highly trained assassins.<br /><br />The action in this movie is reasonably good, with the requisite chases and fights. However, given that Jason Bourne was a highly trained and expensive assassin, I kept thinking that Treadstone would try harder to find and recover him rather than continually sending people with guns after him. But, just like watching a movie after reading the book, some action movies should not be analyzed, just watched.<br /><br />Jason Bourne was written by Ludlum as a tormented man who hated the thought that he might be an assassin, in spite of the mounting evidence that he was a ruthless murderer. Jason Bourne in this movie is a cold-blooded killer. He is not tormented, just efficient. I struggled to see how Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) could take a liking to Jason. Jason did show mercy to a family and its children, but there was so little emotion in his face when he protected them that I wondered how emotionally involved he was in saving them.<br /><br />As an action movie "The Bourne Identity" is above average. However, I thought Jason Bourne was too cold-blooded. I thought Bourne's motivations for killing were thin initially. After killing the first agent or two the others were definitely out to get him, but you have to wonder how much of that was his own doing. "The Bourne Identity" has lots of action, but very little compassion; lots of adrenaline, but very little heart. For a better rounded story, read the book instead.</p></body></html>

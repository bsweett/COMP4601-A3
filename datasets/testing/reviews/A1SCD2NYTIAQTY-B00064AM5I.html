<meta name="summary" content="It is a Game of Degradation, Violence and Exclusion!"></head><body><p>"Dodgeball" is something from left field on more than one count, and something quite new for Ben Stiller. Neeedless to say, I laughed until I nearly saw lunch again, and laughed some more.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple: small time gym owner nearly loses gym to big time, flashy competitor who is so full of himself that it defies description. Add a love interest, and some excellent comedy, and you have "Dodgeball".<br /><br />I have a very violent sense of humour, (I thought "Hannibal" was a laugh, just to give you an idea), so "Dodgeball" really appealed to me. As others have mentioned, the "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball" scene is priceless in its comedy. To see the poor guy squirming on the floor in abject pain was truly hilarious.<br /><br />Additionally, Rip Torn and Hank Azaria as Patches O'Houlihan are both brilliant. Describing the game as "degradation, violence and exclusion" was genius, followed by more violent humour.<br /><br />Ben Stiller deserves special mention for his performance as White Goodman, the owner of Globo-Gym, the evil rival. Getting way outside his usually anal-retentive characters, Stiller makes a disturbingly good prick and general nasty type.<br /><br />"Dodgeball" has it all: feel good story, violent humour, sexual innuendo, situational humour, satire and just great fun all round. For a seriously good laugh, this movie is the funniest I have seen since "Team America"!</p></body></html>

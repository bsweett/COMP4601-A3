<meta name="summary" content="Equilibrium is a bit off balance."></head><body><p>I read all the underground buzz about this film being a neglected scifi film that was excellent. I remember such films as Dark City and Donnie Darko receiving the same acclaim and to that I decided why not discover another unknown film to add to my collection and spread the good news about to others. Maybe I was a bit too hyped over it, maybe I expected more gun fights, or maybe it was the all too similar aspects between this and the Matrix that leads me to say it may not be all it's hyped up to be.<p>The action IS really cool but don't expect alot of it, I did enjoy that it wasn't all karate like most action films today, it reminded me of the gun totin days of Chow Yun Fat in such films as Hard Boiled and The Killer. It certainly follows the Matrix formula. Philosophy + Action + SciFi = ??? Well I don't know what it comes out too, it certainly takes after such books as Brave New World and Farenheit 451. At times it works but with such scenes as the puppy scene you wonder if their trying too hard to make us understand what it is to FEEL. <p>The acting was decent although inconsistent. If the Cleric (and everyone else) do not know emotion. How come Tay Diggs grins through out the whole movie, I wanted to slap him and say "Hey your not supposed to feel emotion dummy stop smiling!" Last time I checked, anger, wit, and suspsicion, are all EMOTIONS. The acting is not at all consistent with the idea of having no emotion. Even the villian shows anger, which again, is an emotion. Maybe their was too much Dashboard Confessional played on the set, who knows. Those little things did bother me but if you ignore them than the few moments of genius matched with the few and far between action sequences (which are very cool) than you have a decent movie that in no way matches the wit of Donnie Darko, or the gothic atmospher of Dark City, and let's face it steals alot of it's look from every scifi movie ever made.<p>A noteworthy mention is a really great audio commentary by Director Kurt Wimmer. He honestly and boldly confronts all the criticism he's heard about the movie and even admits to many of the mistakes he made in the film. He addresses alot of my concerns with the logic of the no emotion thing and after hearing his explanation for them they don't seem to  bother me as much (Tay diggs smiling, the villian gettin angry). It's a great commentary for would-be film makers because he focuses on his first  time directing and the techniques he used. It's one of the most earnest and humbling commentaries I've heard in awhile and it's definetly worth hearing. (Unlike most directors  who seem full of themselves)<p>It's worth watching at least once, but don't go in expecting to "Forget the Matrix" as the cover suggests. It's decent SciFi and I will enjoy it on repeat viewings despite it's flaws.</p></body></html>

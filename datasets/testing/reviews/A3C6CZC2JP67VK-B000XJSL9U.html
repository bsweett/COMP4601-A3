<meta name="summary" content="[2.5]--Totally different from the other films in the Die Hard series"></head><body><p>After a 12 year wait, we are finally treated to another Die Hard film and despite the PG-13 rating, I was still pretty excited to see the movie. Overall, it's a decent action flick, but it pales in comparison to the other three films. Yes, the PG-13 rating contributes to this sequel's downfall. While the other "Die Hard" flicks were edgy, violent, and full of swearing, "Live Free or Die Hard" is like the airline version of those three movies. The story is relatively to post 9/11 action films or TV series like 24. It's all about terrorism and villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) being the best computer programmer of all time hacks into every system that depends on the US government. This cause chaos and havoc in Washington DC meaning people are running around in misery and wondering what is happening and means attempting to kill a few hackers to stop them from stopping the cyber-terrorism such as Matt Ferrell (Justin Long.) Except he fails to kill Matt as John McClane saves his life. This gives us a good partnership for the rest of the film creating wit during the non-action scenes for example Matt taking the Mickey of McClane's lack of technological knowledge and good teamwork with McClane taking the Mickey of Matt's lack of knowledge on how to handle himself in a gun fight. With Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Lucy McClane being as mentally strong as her dad these three good guys make a very good team.<br /><br />Unfortunately the bad guys are less impressive as Maggie Q's Mai seemed stronger than the main bad guy that I nearly thought she was a character cross-breed from House of Flying Daggers and The Matrix which for a full throttle no holds barred film such as Die Hard 4.0 it is a tad bit silly. Timothy Olyphant did act his role well but he wasn't sinister enough or scary enough to be a memorable bad guy unlike Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in the original Die Hard or else wouldn't the character of Lucy McClane be scared of him. MPAA has wrongfully put "Die Hard" under PG-13 where as apposed to it's predecessors had the wonderful R rating. You would think this would be outrageous which at times it is, there's no cursing and McClane's quote is nearly spoken in a whisper along with his legendary quote, "yippee-ki-yay motherf****r" is cut off by a gunshot.<br /><br />To sum up, I don't acknowledge this as a Die Hard film and don't consider it in the same canon with the previous films. To use the term from the movie, it's a firesale and one of the biggest sellouts in movie history. A PG-13 Die Hard? Please. Same goes for Bruce. He was my idol before he did this movie. Now, he's a sellout who claims that this is the best of the series. Not only that, he constantly bashes the 2nd and the 3rd films which is an insult to all 'Die Hard' fans, just like Live Free or Die Hard is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Horrible"></head><body><p>Be cool proves that a big cast full of big names do not make a good movie. With so many actors, you'd think it would be a good movie. There a very few funny scenes, and the plot is boring and long. It really goes no where in it's 120 minutes. A potential movie turns to mush.</p></body></html>

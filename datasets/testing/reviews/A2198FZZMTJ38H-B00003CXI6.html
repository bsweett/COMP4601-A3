This is as good as adult contemporary thrillers get; with a little bit of the elements of &quot;The Blair-Witch Project,&quot; &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; and the famed movies of Alfred Hitchcock, Zemeckis is able to bring to the movie a complete sense of unease, while adding diversity and intensity to the intelligent story. <p>Claire Spencer is having a little trouble coping with her daughter moving away to college, and just when she thinks she is feeling better, a frightening cry from the other side of her fence leads her to believe that her new neighbor, Mary Feur, is in danger of her husband. After many strange events and a ghostly apparition in her house, Claire believes that Mary has been killed by her husband, but is dismayed and thinks herself crazy when she discovers otherwise. But the apparitions still keep coming, little by little: strange whispers fluttering through the house, an overly-anxious front door, and falling picture frames, all of which lead to the clues Claire needs to put the puzzle together. When she discovers the shocking truth, she realizes that her husband, Norman Spencer, is not who he seems to be, and what lies beneath his outward appearance is something that can mean her end. <p>This movie is a terrific example of the fact that a movie can have a PG-13 rating and still deliver on the grounds of suspense and chills. In using the techniques of previous films, Zemeckis makes them his own and keeps the story solid and fluid. You might say that the first part of this movie is a first-class take on the element of suspense from &quot;The Blair-Witch Project,&quot; which is highly acclaimed for its ability to scare us without showing us what's behind the creeps. &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is able to carry this technique off as well as Claire begins to hear and see strange things without ever being able to fully make out what is going on. A small fragment of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; plays a part here, as Claire begins to understand that the entity making contact with her wishes retribution for something done to her. <p>Of all of the elements of this film, Hitchcock's techniques and brilliance are clearly evident throughout this film, from small, minute camera angles to the music and the way certain shots last so long without a cut-in. In one scene, Pheiffer walks out of her darkened bathroom, into her bedroom, and then out into the hall again, where she sees steam rising out of the bathroom doorway. This is all done in one shot, a typical Hitchcock technique that works so well with the story at hand. The music of certain scenes, especially in the climactic ending, will have you thinking back to classics like &quot;Psycho,&quot; which set the standard in horror movie soundtracks. Instead of seeming played out and dull, the way in which the film uses each of them in its own way is quite fresh, inventive and new. <p>While the filming techniques have been used before, the idea for the story also adds to the originality of the film as a whole. The aspect that adds the most uniqueness is the source of the entity that haunts the Spencer household, and the reasons for which it does so. I've never seen this done before in a movie of this kind, and it fits the mold perfectly in keeping with the idea that Claire is in danger not from the apparitions that plague her, but by something alive and real that she holds very dear. Without giving too much away, the ending is a bit of a stretch, but nevertheless keeps moving like the rest of the film, and once it is over, you'll find that it was well worth the wait. The special effects, which mostly take the place of using actual people in the roles of ghosts, add so much to the script and the overall effect of intensity. Alan Silvestri's frightening score will also make you jump when it strikes a high chord in the most thrilling moments of the film. <p>While the actors in all parts do a terrific job bringing the movie to life, this is clearly Michelle Pheiffer's movie, for she will carry most of the action, the emotion and the story with her. She portrays Claire Spencer, the happy wife who discovers secrets permeating through her marriage. She is by far the most complex character, and when she starts putting the pieces together, her entwining emotions are played to perfection by Pheiffer, who is superb. Harrison Ford is the other leading character, the husband Norman Spencer who has more secrets than truths in his life. Ford is excellent in this role, which is strikingly different from many of his other roles in which he plays the good guy, the hero who saves the day. But he carries it off with intelligence and, at times, wit. Diana Scarwid adds the needed comic relief in the form of Claire's best friend, but it turns out that she will play a minor yet important part in unlocking the mystery. <p>With so many elements of past films going for it, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is a classy and intelligent ensemble of complex characters wandering through a world of lies, deceit, fright, and secrecy. It makes the audience jumps at the right times, while keeping their hearts beating juts a bit faster in between. Be sure to try and catch all the eerie ghosts and entities the are all throughout the film; there are a lot.</p></body></html>

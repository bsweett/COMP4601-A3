<meta name="summary" content="Quite a remarkable find"></head><body><p>It's always interesting when a newcomer or a little well known actor/actress comes out with a film and just astonishes people, moreso when they find out that the newcomer is quite young. Such is the way with Catalina Sandino Moreno, the main character of this film and interestingly, the first Oscar nomination for someone of Columbian descent.<br /><br />In Columbia, Catalina's character Maria works in a flower plantation de-thorning roses before they're shipped out. Her boss is pretty much an ass, she has a very loser boyfriend that ends up getting her pregnant and her family relies on her completely for money, including her sister who has a son.<br /><br />She meets a guy that offers her a job: travel to New York with close to 60-70 thumb sized pellets in your stomach and get through US customs without getting detected. Deliver the pellets and you'll get paid a large sum of money. These pellets however contain heroin, and if one breaks or dissolves in their stomach, it will mean death. She meets up with Lucy, someone who's done it before and has to deal with Blanca, her friend who also ingested the pellets and is tagging along.<br /><br />One nice thing about Catalina's performance is that she's playing the role like someone calling out to the audience and not demanding sympathy. She does things that are quite bad, she's a bit naive at times yet somehow you feel sympathetic towards her and want her to come out clean in the end despite her actually going through with being a mule. I'm hoping she doesn't turn out like Carrie Henn from Aliens who did quite a great job for a little girl but didn't make another film afterwards.<br /><br />It's not a typical Hollywood film, it is in subtitles and it's not the most happiest of topics but Catalina's performance makes it stand out(too bad she lost the Oscar to that damn Swank girl, bah).</p></body></html>

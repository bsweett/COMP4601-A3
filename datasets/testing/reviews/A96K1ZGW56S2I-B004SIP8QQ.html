However, after seeing the film, I was kind of impressed and was curious to see how things would come to together in VOL 2. Well, everything fits together rather nicely and this Volume makes a nice conclusion to what began in the first.<p>The movie begins with a black and white montage with the Bride talking about what had happened in Volume 1 and about how nothing was going to stop her from her goal to kill Bill. This version is much more story and dialogue driven than the action/violence driven Volume 1. Tarantino is the kind of filmmaker that most people either love or hate. I tend to fall more on the side of hate, simply because he often over emphasizes violence. However, I do think the man is an extremely talented writer as the dialogue in his films is usually extremely witty, bright, and full of substance. Anyway, Volume 2 isn't anywhere near as violent as the first volume and focuses more instead upon character development and the relationships between the chracters. There's really only one new character introduced in this edition (Pai Mei), but he forms a crucial part of the background the Bride's story. There are a view violent scenes (especially between the Bride and Elle Driver), but overall it is dialogue and characterization that drive the picture.<p>KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is longer and a bit more slow than KILL BILL VOLUME 1. There were a few things that could have been cut to make the film a little shorter, but I guess Tarantino decided to put a little more stuff in to make up for cutting this movie into two separate parts. Other than that, KILL BILL VOLUME 2 is a fitting end to this part of the Kill Bill saga. As a sidenote, though, don't be surprised if this is the last we see of The Bride: there was a little incident from the first volume that might lead to another part of the story.</p></body></html>

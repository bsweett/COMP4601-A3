Therefore, I had never read the book when I watched the movie.  I just want to get that out in the open to begin with.<br /><br />I enjoyed THE POLAR EXPRESS. It's an entertaining movie with a lot of profound themes that, though dressed up in the finest that humanism has to offer, are really deeply religious in nature.  Nevertheless, even if one is unable to extrapolate those spiritual nuances, the movie offers enough visual eye candy and action to make it worth watching and, despite the film's criticism, it is destined to become a Christmas classic.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the adventures that arrive at a young boy's house on Christmas Eve. The boy is never given a name and is listed in the credits as Hero Boy.  The Hero Boy is at a critical time in his life: he is on the verge of adolescence and is having serious doubts about the existence of Santa Claus.  He lies in his bed on Christmas Eve listening for the sound of reindeer bells. However, instead of bells his ears are greeted by a sound unexpected, that of a train whistle.  As he looks out the window and opens the front door, he is greeted by a splendid engine pulling a train called The Polar Express. He's invited aboard by the Conductor. At first he hesitates, but then chooses to ride.  And thus begins a somewhat harrowing journey that takes the boy from the top of the moving train, across a frozen lake, and all the way to the top of the world at the North Pole.<br /><br />The animation in THE POLAR EXPRESS is at times amazingly realistic.  There are times in the movie where one cannot tell at all that this is a cartoon. Non-living objects are the ones that are consistently most brilliant.  There are times when it is clear that the characters are cartoons and not actors, but almost all of the nonanimate objects from presents, to hot chocolate, to the engine of The Polar Express itself look completely real. When presented in the moments when the human characters appear least "real" it is as though we are watching some strange world akin to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.<br /><br />There are several moments in the movie where the main characters partake in dangerous situations that should in no way ever be attempted in real life. Younger children might find these scenes frightening. However, in the tale the film tells, the adventures are needed.  Every hero lives a life of adventure full of danger and the life lived to the fullest is one in which danger cannot be avoided.<br /><br />I did finally read the book by Chris Van Allsburg a few days after seeing the film.  The book is full of incredible illustrations but is also very short (32 pages).  I felt that the filmmakers did a wonderful job of expanding upon the pages of Van Allsburg's writing and illustrations. I felt that the film also did a great job of staying true to the spirit of the book, presenting the message of the book in a way that gives it even more meaning, depth, and interpretaion.<br /><br />The children's book is a simple tale about a boy's struggle to believe in Santa Claus and how he came to believe. It's a message the children love and brings back nostalgia and causes reflection in adults.  The movie was created in such a way that this message is seriously expanded. The simple tale becomes a profound allegory of faith. There are messengers (the Conductor). There companions who believe (Hero Girl), disbelieve (Know-It-All), and are profoundly confused (Lonely Boy).  There is the Jesus-figure (Santa) and his often unseen angels (elves).  And there is also Satan (Hobo), who is allowed to ride along for the ride and tempt.  Much more could be said about the religous implications of the film, but these illustrations make the point.<br /><br />Overall, THE POLAR EXPRESS is an entertaining movie. It's a different kind of Christmas movie, but one with enough substance and charm that ensure it will become a Christmas classic.  All you have to do is believe.</p></body></html>

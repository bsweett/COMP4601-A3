<meta name="summary" content="I've Been Fockerized"></head><body><p>"Meet the Fockers" is a funny film with an all- star cast of Hollywood big wigs. This movie is a sequel to the fun film "Meet the Parents" from many years ago. This time around, the soon to be married couple is driving to Florida with the bride-to-be's parents to meet with the groom-to-be's parents. The bride's father is a conservative stick in the mud type who dislikes anything he doesn't consider normal. The groom's parents are throwbacks to the 1960's- strong believers in free love, hugs, and unconventional living.<br /><br />Barbara Striesand and Dustin Hoffman play the roles of the two liberal parents, and they offer some good, entertaining on- screen chemistry. There is plenty of contrast among the different characters, and this adds to the movies appeal. There are also a few surprises in the plot and some original humor, making the movie that much more enjoyable. And the basic premise is something most people can relate to. We all feel a little bit of anxiety when we meet our significant others' parents for the first time, and this movie uses this scenario (in an exaggerated way, of course), as its main plot.<br /><br />Director Jay Roach moves this film in a few different directions to keep it from becoming a boring, standardized comedy. In the middle and near the end, he introduces a new segment to the plot involving a young teenage boy who looks very much like Ben Stiller's character. The bride's father, played by Robert DeNiro, decides that his future son in law is the actual father of this boy and he sets out to prove his point, with the ultimate goal being to eliminate Stiller and convince his daughter to marry someone else.<br /><br />This movie isn't a comedy classic, but it does have its moments. Whether it's the contrast between the characters, the contributions from the baby, the comedic timing, or something else, you will probably like "Meet the Fockers". It isn't quite as good as the original, but it's still a fun flick to watch for its good humor and fun plot.</p></body></html>

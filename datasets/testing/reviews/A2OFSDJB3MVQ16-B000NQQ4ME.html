<meta name="summary" content="Mel's Mayan culture"></head><body><p>I wasn't prepared to like this film since I was not a big fan of Mel's "Passion of the Christ" due to the gruesome violence of the film more than the controversy surrounding it. And of course we've all heard of his meltdown in Malibu but don't let that deter you from enjoying this excellent film.  The visuals and the sound are particularly impressive in Blu-ray and it fully captures what I experienced in the theatre when I first saw it. If you want an example of Hi-Def at its best do put this on or "Blade Runner" to test your set-up.  Am looking forward to Mel's next directorial effort!!</p></body></html>

Unfortunately I couldn't see the film in 3-D (the theater I went to showed only 2-D version), so please read my review as such, in which "effects" means only traditional 2-D special effects.<br /><br />Probably you already know the film's story as you have read the original book or seen the 1959 version starring James Mason as Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook. For the new adaptation the Hollywood studio decided on a story that they think is fit for effects. The new adventure story is much simplified: Brendan Fraser's hero Prof. Trevor Anderson is looking for his missing brother; Josh Hutcherson is his nephew Sean who follows his uncle's (and father's) quest; and Anita Briem is a mountain guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (a nod to "Hans" of the 1959 version?) whose father is one of the "Verneians." Actually the film is slightly self-referential as our hero finds a clue about his brother in the titular Jules Verne book.<br /><br />And ... that is all. No "villains" appear (except, perhaps, a mean-spirited boss of Fraser's character, a very small role you may forget soon) as this is a family-friendly picture and each scene is obviously borrowed from other films like "Indiana Jones." The Jules Verne fans would lament, or even is angry with, the changes done to the source material.<br /><br />Still as the film is fun. Yes, it may be silly kind of fun, but fun nonetheless as first-time feature film director Eric Brevig (also, visual effect veteran) has provided enough actions to keep the ball rolling. Even seen in 2-D the images are not bad if not great. Yes, I know, the characters are flat and its romance is uninteresting, but still I like the film for what it is, a 90-miinute roller-coaster ride.</p></body></html>

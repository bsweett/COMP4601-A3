I didn't really expect an artsy killer wolf movie.<br /><br />I love Liam Neeson (usually) but really felt his acting was wooden and one-dimensional in "The Grey."<br /><br />Another problem - I rented this on Amazon as a 24-hour rental and as such, I don't get Closed Captioning. And with Neeson's heavy accent and my poor hearing, I had to keep backing the film up so I could catch what was being said.  That took a lot of the spontaneity out of watching the film.<br /><br />This was a crazy story.  Neeson is the hunter, keeping the wolves away from the oil workers - and kind of "wolf whispering" them into the next life as they die.  He does the same for the airplane crash survivors as they die during the film (kind of odd for a self-proclaimed atheist).<br /><br />The scenery was beautiful, the wolves were spooky, and the acting was so-so. So unless you just have to see every Neeson movie made, I would skip this one.<br /><br />  Once more into the fray,<br />  Into the last good fight.<br />  Live and die on this day;<br />  Live and die on this day.<br />  - written by Joe Carnahan, director of "The Grey"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Definately Not 'King' of Arthur Tale"></head><body><p>I expected more from "King Arthur."  I found the pacing s-l-o-w and the battle sequences non impressive.  The movie was over produced, and under cooked.  The story ventures from the familiar tale, having Merlin as some kind of evil General out to get Arthur.  Guennie kicks [...], but is still somewhat out of context.  I kept thinking there is something missing, perhaps a better movie lurks underneath.  A little long, but still it does have some moments.  It is beautifully filmed.  The locations are spectacular, and you get to know more about the other knights.  Quite frankly they were more interesting than Arthur.  Takes itself way to serious and has no comic relief to ease the tension.  Maybe there will be a director's cut one day and I can see what was missing.  One good scene could elevate this film and make it clearer and easier to watch.</p></body></html>

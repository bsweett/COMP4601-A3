<meta name="summary" content="Exciting, but lacking in strong characters."></head><body><p>A group of scientists and crewmembers set out to travel to a distant planet to discover the meaning behind some ancient cave drawings. It is the year 2093 and there may be life present on this remote planet. This prequel to the great 1980 film Alien contains the pre-story to the discovery of the species that terrified the crew of that film. Modern-day expertise has improved the visual capabilities that filmmakers can achieve, which are enhanced further by 3D technology in this film. Unfortunately, Ridley Scott populated this film with characters that you don't get to know well and don't particularly care about, sans one. However, the movie is exciting and visually stimulating enough to make it a worth while film-going experience.</p></body></html>

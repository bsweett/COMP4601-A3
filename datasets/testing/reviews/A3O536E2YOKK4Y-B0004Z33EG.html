<meta name="summary" content="An action/adventure masterpiece (tainted somewhat by two cartooney sequels)"></head><body><p>Like the title blurb says, "First Blood" is an action/adventure masterpiece of the first order. It's easy to forget this in light of the two cartooney sequels that made a caricature of John Rambo: "Rambo: First Blood Part II" (1985) and "Rambo III" (1988).<br /><br />Most people reading this know the plot: Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into a Rocky Mounain town looking for a war buddy, only to learn that he died due to exposure to Agent Orange the summer before. The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and ends up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army. He easily escapes into the local forests where he takes on both the police and the National Guard in jungle warfare. Before all is said and done he almost levels the entire town!<br /><br />The picture was filmed in beautiful Hope and Golden Ears Provincial Park, British Columbia. Yes, it's drizzly and dreary with absolutely zero sunshine, but it's incredibly picturesque nevertheless. A wonderful place to commit suicide I'm sure.<br /><br />Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy and intimidating sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western "Silverado" (1985) albeit the character in that film is ten-times WORSE.<br /><br />Stallone is physically in his prime here, although he's not as bulked-up as in the two sequels. In fact, he's almost skinny in "First Blood." His waist is obviously only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing "First Blood" is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape (or get in better shape).<br /><br />Stallone sort of blows his initial lines talking to the black woman about his war buddy at the beginning, but aside from this he's outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally screams out and lets out all his pent-up rage. This is a potent scene. He screams: "Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!!!"<br /><br />I'm not normally into dvd commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition dvd (the one with the red cover) by writer David Morrell is truly worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the film set many precedents in the action/adventure film genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of films, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how many times you've seen "First Blood." The film has such a captivating anointing you'll be spellbound from start to finish every time. If your a sucker for lost-in-the-woods/survival pictures "First Blood" is a must.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Messy, boring and forgettable, I'm very unhappy with the result..."></head><body><p>I'm not one who usually gets excited about cartoons.  I mean, lately with the birth of my daughter around the corner I've been watching quite a bit more of them, but in general they are not my thing.  `Happy Feet' though was one I was determined to see.  You see, I adore the little creatures known as penguins and a cartoon devoted to them just seemed to be almost heaven sent.  I rushed to watch it, given all the praise and rave reviews, and have to say that after watching it through I was thoroughly disappointed.  Yes, I said disappointed.  In actuality I'm floored that it received all the rave reviews, and while I'll stand by the fact that it is indeed a better cartoon than that tripe known as `Cars' I still can't believe this mess won the Oscar.<br /><br />The storyline is a bit of a bore.  The whole `heartsong' aspect of this film kind of left me with this overly cheesy `I can believe I'm watching this' kind of feeling.  You see penguins love to sing.  That's how they find their soul mates.  They find their `heartsong' and thus find their mate.  The problem with little Mumble is that he can't sing.  He's practically tone-deaf and this has made him the outcast.  But he's not without his talent.  He can dance, but no one else seems to care much for that.  In fact the other penguins resent him for his talent and ultimately blame him for their lack of food.  So he's banished from the colony.  His banishment was the best thing for him though for he meets up with some Spanish penguins who embrace his ability to dance and help him change the world in effect bringing back all the fish.<br /><br />If I said anymore I'd give away too much so I'll stop there.<br /><br />So, while the plot is a bit on the `meh' side, there is more to hate in regards to this film.  First off the singing is ridiculous.  Instead of all new original songs (whatever happened to the good ol' days when animators and storyboard creators actually invested some originality in their work) we have a bunch of penguins running around singing songs we hear on the radio with lyrics changed slightly.  What makes it worse is that some of the songs are heavy on the sexual innuendos and are really inappropriate for children.  The voice over work is decent, but is it just me or is Nicole Kidman a little too breathy and somewhat annoying?  Personally, I don't feel she fit very well.<br /><br />In fact, the only really `good' thing about this movie was the incredibly talented Robin Williams who is just brilliant in this kind of work.  I've said this before, but I'll say it again.  I think it should be mandatory that every cartoon have at least one character voiced by Robin Williams.  The great thing about `Happy Feet' is that they give him TWO characters, and both of them are equally hilarious and memorable.  In fact I'm really upset that the remainder of the film is such a dud because both of Williams' characters are two of the funniest cartoon characters in recent memory.  I wish they would have given his characters a different movie to inhabit.  Alas, maybe they'll give him his own spin off.<br /><br />So anyways, I don't really think I have much more to say.  The film ends up getting way too political for its own good, and the ending is such a waste it's almost hard to watch.  I really wanted to like this, I really did, and I expected to love it, but I can't lie to myself.  `Happy Feet' truly is a bore of a film, a missed opportunity, which saddens me for it could have been so much better.</p></body></html>

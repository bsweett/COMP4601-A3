Religion..."></head><body><p>This movie was to my surprise a very good film about what is supposed to be a true story about a poor, unfortunate young woman who people either said was crazy or possessed. Was she just ill, as doctors called it, or was she truly possessed? Which is right this time- science or religion? This movie showed the battle on each side, and both the lawyers in this film were the two opposing sides pretty well, the problem was they cancelled each other out, making good points on each side which were interesting to hear and observe. To make such a decision I would have found hard. Emily Rose could have been ill, and most probably would say after watching this movie she probably was, but everyone knows there is doubt in the back of all of our minds, that goes beyond our logic, that says there are some things that we just do not know for sure, and this story could have very well been one of those things we could not know. We were not there, we could not know what was going on. Yet it is hard to just automatically believe the story as well, and frightening to even consider.<br /><br />The acting was pretty well done in this film, I liked the way they played out the film and the story itself will leave you thinking about the situation even after the film, making it a story you'll never truly forget.<br /><br />The only problem? I found that they could have shown a little more on Emily Rose. I wanted them to show more of her and what was going on with her, just to shine a little more light on her. Most of the movie is set in the courtroom which is fascinating but I wished they had shown a scene or two more of Emily Rose's tragedy, that's the main reason everyone wanted to see the film so a star goes off from that. Yet I really liked the courtroom part of the film, for it showed the very dilemma of the whole story, and it was a hard one. I think...the jury made the right decision. I feel in my heart of hearts they did. That was not an easy decision, and I think they acted with both logic and faith, which indeed was best.</p></body></html>

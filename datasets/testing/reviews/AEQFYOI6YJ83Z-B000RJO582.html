<meta name="summary" content="A modern-day horror delight!"></head><body><p>Remakes of classic horror flicks are largely failures.  Zack Synder, however, has reinvented "Dawn of the Dead" for the modern audience--and it comes out a sure-fire winner!<br /><br />Something awful is happening the world over: the dead aren't staying dead.  Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse, wakes up to find a small girl on a murderous rampage; escaping out of the city, Ana meets Kenneth (Ving Rhames, delightfully stoic throughout most of his role), a cop who's searching for his brother.  They meet up with a rag-tag bunch of survivors (led by the enigmatic Michael, played with charm and finess by Jake Weber).  Taking refuge in a nearby mall, they watch their numbers grow...but as more survivors appear, so do more zombies.  And it's only a matter of time before they break in, and the living become the living dead...<br /><br />This movie is suspenseful and horrific.  Not as gory as it's been toted to be, but that's ok; the atmosphere is what really counts in a horror movie anways, and the atmosphere here reeks of pure terror.  Surprisingly, the characters are three-dimensional; the acting is superb, by both the living and the "dead."  The special effects are memorable, and the pacing is fast and frantic.  Yet, there's enough dark humor thrown in to give you some genuine chuckles here and there.<br /><br />Let's not call this film a "remake," after all.  Sure, it borrows the storyline...but it is good enough to stand on its own as a seperate horror film.  I don't know if it, too, will become a classic...but it should.  It's that good.  It's that scary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No character"></head><body><p>The original Star Trek movie was a really big missed opportunity for the Star Trek franchise. The Original Series was defined by its wonderful characters, particularly Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. In this movie, the characters take a back seat. We still see Kirk, Spock, and McCoy but they seem muted and relatively uninteresting. They seem like accessories to the plot, not drivers of it. Even relatively emotional scenes like Kirk ordering the self-destruction of the ship had almost no tension or emotional impact. It's a shame, because the concept behind the story was really interesting.<br /><br />I will say that the Director's cut for the DVD and blu-ray does improve the film. Some of the special effects are tastefully improved. It looks good - in my opinion a visually more beautiful film than 2001.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another special film from Paul Thomas Anderson"></head><body><p>Even braver and deeper emotionally than Paul Thomas Anderson's<br />wonderful 'Boogie Nights', and in some ways a more mature, if less<br />blazingly dynamic work. Full of amazing shots, amazing performances.<br />The epic, multi-layered film 'Short Cuts' wanted to be.<br /><br />That said there are a few flaws. The biblical ending doesn't quite work<br />for me. I appreciate the ideas behind it, but it's an ending that's<br />less emotional than the film that proceeded it. And a few<br />moments of irony are forced. That was true in 'Boogie Nights' too, but<br />because that film had a lighter, more self-mocking touch, even the<br />heavy handed moments didn't stick out.<br /><br />None-the-less, this is a must see film, overflowing with great<br />performances, unconventional storytelling, heartbreaking moments, and<br />an honest look at where we are and who we are as a society.</p></body></html>

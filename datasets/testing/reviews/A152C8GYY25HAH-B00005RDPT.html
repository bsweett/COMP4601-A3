So, in the category of `Most Entertaining Big Budget Hollywood Mainstream Movie', there is an easy answer for 2001. It's "Ocean's Eleven" by a nautical mile. This is one of those classics that gets overlooked at awards time, but, I suspect, it may be fondly remembered long after some prize winners have been forgotten.<p>The original "Ocean's Eleven", released in 1960, was a big hit because it starred Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack friends. It's not a great movie; in fact, if I made a list of a thousand movies someone should remake, it would not be on it. Director Steven Soderbergh obviously saw things differently. He lifted a few savory elements out of the original, added in his own ingredients and came up with one delectable movie. He reversed the order of things by taking a very ordinary film and turning it into an original. <p>Charming con artist Danny [George Clooney] is fresh out of jail. Learning to make license plates has done nothing to reform him. He used his time in jail to dream up his ultimate heist. Soon he's presenting his plan to his favorite partner in crime, Russ [Brad Pitt], who has been reduced to teaching the Hollywood elite how to win at poker. The idea is to relieve three Las Vegas casinos of $150,000,000. Russ is skeptical to say the least, since security at these casinos makes Fort Knox look like easy pickings, but he agrees to round up a crew. Meanwhile, in Vegas, Danny's ex-wife, Tess [Julia Roberts], is now the mistress of the three casinos' owner, Terrance [Andy Garcia]. Knowing this, you will not be surprised to discover that this heist is also a bit personal for Danny, who conveniently forgets to tell the rest of the gang about this little fact. <p>There is enough star power in Ocean's Eleven to light a small country, but this is less of a vanity project than you might expect. It's more like watching an acting troupe that happens to have some very famous members. The script is smart and sophisticated and provides enough interesting characters and memorable dialog for all the players to sparkle without resorting to upstaging. <p>This is NOT a `guy' flick, even if it is all about a bunch of guys doing guy things. Julia Roberts, the only `chick' present, has the weakest role. And everyone involved, including the lady herself, knows it. In a sly wink at the audience, her credit reads "and introducing Julia Roberts as Tess."<p>Soderbergh has become one of my all time favorite directors in the last few years. He's something special, a brilliant director who seems dedicated to reviving the notion that popular entertainment can also be intelligent entertainment. Instead of `dumbing down' the audience, he's out to smartening it up. What a cool guy! And what a cool movie! [NOTE: Admittedly, this is entertainment pure and simple. I try to rate movies within the range of what they seem to be trying to accomplish. So, within the confines of 'purely entertaining', I gave "Ocean's Eleven" Amazon's highest rating because it succeeds brilliantly on that level.]</p></body></html>

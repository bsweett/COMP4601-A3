"Raiders" suffers from the same flaws that "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" and "Batman" did: all dazzle and no substance. This one has the same non-stop action, character development, humor and incredible situations and juxtapositions that made "Temple of Doom" and "Last Crusade" so entertaining. However, there's a HUGE Spielbergian element in the hokey mysticism/science involved with the storyline. This is the childish way Spielberg handles ALL his science and/or eldritch goings-on in his movies, and you'd think Lucas would have held that aspect in check in this movie. Alas, he did not!<br /><br />You know the story by now: Indy's closest buds are now dead, (his dad, Marcus,) and Sullah is nowhere to be found. However, another character, Charles Standforth, played by Jim Broadbent, has taken the place of Marcus and has very little to do with this episode outside of being the bearer of bad news in the beginning of the film. Well, after having a run-in with the U.S. Govt. over the elaborate goings-on that open the film, (Indy being coerced into helping Russian operatives track down a mysterious artifact stored in Area 51 in New Mexico,) he's fired from his university job and then gets sucked back into further dealings with der Russkies after a mysterious young man yanks him off a train he was taking home. (*Spoiler Alert!*) What follows are chase scenes from hell involving Indy, a Russian cutlery freak straight out of central casting played by Cate Blanchett, an old colleague whose integrity he overestimated, his old flame, Marion Ravenwood, and surprise, surprise...LITTLE INDY!!<br /><br />After the SPECTACULAR image of the a-bomb going off in the New Mexican desert in the beginning, (and it's a major distention of suspension of disbelief to accept Indy surviving all that radiation,) it was obvious that the visuals in this film were going to be a major focus, as well as action, and the movie doesn't disappoint on either level. It's a non-stop art-director's extravaganza from beginning to end, and MUCH more substantial, I think, than "Raiders", still, to my mind, the weak link in the Indy oeuvre. Make up your own mind on that count....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Phone Booth (2002)"></head><body><p>In 2002, Joel Schumacher, director of THE LOST BOYS and FLATLINERS, brought us a whole new reign of terror and suspense with his 2002 flick, PHONE BOOTH.<br /><br />  STU SHEPARD (played by Colin Farrell) is a philandering celebrity publicist, who holds nothing but lies and deception. At a nearby phone booth in Manhattan, Stu gets a call from an unknown and unseen sniper (played by Kiefer Sutherland), who plans to murder Stu if he does not tell his lies to the whole world. But that's not all. Stu is married to the beautiful KELLY SHEPARD (played by Radha Mitchell), but is having an affair with Pamela (played by Katie Holmes). The sniper wants Stu to reveal "everything"; his lies in his publishings and his lies to his wife, Kelly. Is it possible that Stu will come forth with his lies, or is it possible that he will be so eagerly stubborn to the point of being murdered? The only way to find out is to watch this suspensful thriller.<br /><br />  I was really amazed by this movie, although, it really does not deserve five stars, but four. Kiefer Sutherland is the only actor, who was able to fit the role of the unknown sniper. His voice was so scary and so evil that no other actor in Hollywood was able to fit it. That is because Kiefer Sutherland, whether playing a good character or an evil character, is the best frigging actor on God's green earth. No argument. No disagreement. I state a true fact about Kiefer Sutherland. He made this movie.</p></body></html>

The story of a virus turning people into zombie like monsters seems a little too much like the Resident Evil series, but there is a lot to keep you from making that connection. To wake up in a world all alone, like Jim does at the beginning of the movie, is a fear that no one wants to face. From the start, you know that this will be one memorable thrill ride. It is just incredible how the movie starts off setting the mood by almost complete silence, it almost feels like the entire country is abandoned. It's just incredible the way they present the monsters. There is a scene when the survivors are trying to drive to an army base and they get a flat tire in an underground tunnel. It's extremely dark and while they are fixing the flat in the dark, they see shadows moving coming from the only light being seen. It's terrific, this is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time. Bravo!</p></body></html>

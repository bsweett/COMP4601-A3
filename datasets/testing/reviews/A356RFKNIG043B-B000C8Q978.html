<meta name="summary" content="Michelangelo's Plumbing Service"></head><body><p>Dear Bill, Why are you doing this to us, to yourself, to future generations of potentially giddy viewers? The Razor's Edge is one thing, Lost In Translation another, and now this. But, they're all pretty much the SAME thing!<br /><br />You're one of the truly great comic actors of your time. If you weren't so funny and so successful at it, you'd never get to make these "serious" movies, because you are NOT a serious dramatic actor. So why keep humping that dead camel? The truth becomes clear when there is easily more entertainment in the 7-minute blooper reel than in this entire film.<br /><br />You pick good directors, but these scripts seem designed to let you sit expressionlessly, scene after scene, as if a tiny tic will convey your inner Brando essence. Your picking these static characters in these inert movies is killing us! It's not that we want to see Carl chase gophers forever, or Todd give noogies. It's just that your making this kind of plodding film is like Michelangelo running a plumbing service. He can do it, sure...but what's the point? There are lots of plumbers in the world. There is only one Michelangelo. Let him do what nobody else can.<br /><br />And there is only one Bill Murray. He's the guy in the blooper reel who can't help but be funny at every turn with everybody. He's the guy who fills our hearts with joy and mirth and feeling. But he seems nowhere present in this and your other "serious" movies, and the guy who replaces him is, well, rather boring.<br /><br />When you go halfway, as in Rushmore and the Tenenbaums (though not so much in Aquatic, but Wes knows who you are and uses you well), you get the dramatic approval you seek, but framed by your comic perfection. Take away the comedy, and nothing happens.<br /><br />Maybe I'm way off here. But there was so much life in that blooper reel, and so little life in this movie. Jarmusch says in a dvd extra here, "It's not my job to know what a film is about. It's my job to make it. It's the viewers' job to tell me what it's about." Well, say no more. Please tell Jim that this viewer thinks it's about not knowing how to write a well-paced, continually engrossing film. It's about taking a handful of good actors and giving them little to work with. But most of all, it's about using one of the great comic actors now working and watching him be funny all day, except when the cameras are rolling. Then he just sits there and projects nothingness, in a film that could have taken its conceits twice as far in less time.<br /><br />What a waste. So much more could be done in this turgid bore, but instead we get a kind of college-level faux Bergman flick that uses good music as filler for the dramatic tension that the writer/director just can't produce. It worked ok in Down By Law and some others; here it's just a crime.<br /><br />Bill, it's your life and you've given us more than enough. You owe us nothing. But perhaps you owe it to yourself to find more scripts that let your true genius come to the fore. You could go halfway again: what if Nick falls in love with his lounge pianist and then finds out she only has a month to live? Just kidding, but man I miss your humor! You're a master at it.<br /><br />Put it this way: if you can't hit a one-iron but are great with the five-wood, bring it home on the 18th at Pebble with what you do best.<br /><br />Thanks for the laughs, Bill.<br />Regards, A Fan</p></body></html>

The acting is unconvincing, and the direction is sloppy, but all elements of production design are first-rate. Mark Isham's score is appropriate, but a little too much like Jerry Goldsmith's "Chinatown" music, especially the use of the solo trumpet. Mr. de Palma missed on this one, and his cast seemed uninterested in their material. James Ellroy can be given brilliant film adaptation ("L.A. Confidential"), but not this one. What a bummer. I was hoping for so much more.  The DVD extras are more entertaining and informative than the film itself.</p></body></html>

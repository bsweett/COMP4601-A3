<meta name="summary" content="The Anti "Sixth Sense""></head><body><p>What a great surprise "the Others" was! In the wake of a glut of "Sixth Sense" clones, I see the dead, I talk to the dead, I help the dead, the haunted house/ghost movie sub-genre was getting as stale as the overworked Zombie sub-genre. Dozens upon dozens of films, both big budget & straight to video haunting every rental DVD shelve in six continents! I was tired of seeing people in movies seeing the dead, ad nauseam.<br /><br />So why was "the Others" so different? First of all, it was not a "Sixth Sense" clone, if anything, a anti "Sixth Sense." It was not a modern day haunted house/ghost film at all, but harkened back to "The Innocents" from 1961. It also reminded me of another great early 60's film, that was not a horror film at all, but had it's spooky moments, 1962's, "To Kill a Mockingbird." Both these films had a brother & sister as main characters. Both these films had a single parent main character, or in the case "of "the Innocents," a nanny/governess, who was hired by a single parent. Both those films had strong bonds between the siblings. "The Others," mother character, & "the Innocents," governess character, were both overwrought to the point of insanity. All three films share a very intimate almost child like opening soundtrack. "The Others" & "To Kill a Mockingbird," especially. All three films were intimate, not a large cast, nor did they need one, though "To Kill a Mockingbird" did have a larger cast of characters, though it still remained a intimate childhood story of a adult world.<br /><br />It has been said that Nicole Kidman's performance as "Grace Stewart" in "the Others," is the greatest of her career, & I have to agree. Nicole is the epitome of a woman pushed over the edge of insanity. A nervous break down performance if there ever was one! It must have drained her, not only mentally, but physically. The siblings, Alakina Mann as "Anne Stewart," & James Bently as "Nicholas Stewart," provide this film with some of the strongest & most believable child performances I've ever seen! The supporting cast was excellent as well.<br /><br />"The Others" work so well because a taught & sturdy script, claustrophobic cinematography, spot on directing, & a soundtrack that is subtle, & when need be, crashing down like thunder. But it is the totally convincing acting, the effective spooky yet elegant mansion, & the tense well done sound effects that make this movie genuinely scary. It is the imagination of what could be lurking around the corner or behind a door that raises the prickly hairs on my neck. The thump in the dark. It is the twist ending that just blows me away every time I see this film! It is truly, the anti "Sixth Sense," just when the badly over trodden haunted house/ghost sub-genre needed it the most!<br /><br />This Blu-ray is highly recommended as a upgrade. Colors, images, lighting, & sound are about as good as it gets for a film like this!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece</p></body></html>

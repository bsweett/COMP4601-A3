Well... maybe not so secretly.<br /><br />In '13 going on 30', Jennifer Garner plays Jenna, a 13 year old girl stuck in a 30 year old body. When Jenna was 13, she made a wish to be `thirty and flirty' since she just saw that statement on her favorite magazine `Poise'. With a little help of some magic dust her friend Matt got her for her 13th birthday, her wish comes true and she's now a 30 year old woman. And it's not like it was in `BIG' with Tom Hanks. He was older the next day. She is actually older, 17 years later.<br /><br />Within those 17 years, she's made a lot of money doing the job she loves, and she's lost a lot of friends, and has become, well, just a very bad person.  And this is what I really enjoyed about the movie. Unlike `BIG', we get to see how her life has become and we get to enjoy seeing the surprise with her. Watching the mostly sweet 13 year old Jenna see how mean she has become was fun to watch. Also it was a lot of fun to see how people reacted to her now that she was this new nice girl. Also seeing a grown woman acting like she was 13 was pretty funny also. I actually enjoyed the scenes where she was drinking the non-virgin pina coladas. When she took out the piece of fruit and dropped it (and it landing into someone else's drink a floor below) actually made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Another thing that made me really like the movie was the 80's references. I love me some 80's. So when the movie starts off and has all  the 80's music going with the old videos playing (like Rick Springfield's `Jessie's Girl'), I was having a good time. Also later at a party, Jenna starts a `Thriller' dance, and though it was awkward at first, it was still kind of fun to watch. And it sounded pretty good on the hard floor they were on.<br /><br />The only real bad thing I would say with '13 going on 30' is that you have to throw the word `believable' out the door once you start watching it. There are many things in the movie that really shouldn't make since or should really be weird. Once she's in the future, in my opinion, she should remember everything since she's the same person. It's not like `Back to the Future' where there are two Marty McFly's. She's the one and only Jenna, but she doesn't. Also when she gets kissed by older guys, it's kinda gross if you think about it. Cause she's 13 ya know. Kinda icky, but I just don't think about it like that.<br /><br />In the end, I would say definitely watch this movie if you like the RomComs and you haven't seen it. Guys, it's funny. Girls, it's sweet.<br /><br />P.S. - In the 80's I was in single digits, but I loved Michael Jackson. He was the man back then. When `Thriller' came out it was the first tape (I had the record to) I owned. I remember moon walking (at least my version of it) in my red Michael Jackson jacket with zippers all over it, blue jeans, and cowboy boots. That tape was amazing.</p></body></html>

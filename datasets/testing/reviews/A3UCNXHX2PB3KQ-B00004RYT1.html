But low and behold, the Bates Motel, with the 12 and 12 is available. She arrives at the motel, and nothing but terror ensues. Hitchcock finds all the right nerves and tingles them here, with some infamous murder scenes and that huanting score which captivates you. The last 25 or so minutes of this film work perfectly, and this movie just keeps on getting better from start to finish. There's no reason not to see why this is arguably the most influential movie in history.</p></body></html>

I was excited to see it in the Blu-ray format, and I wasn't disappointed.  The film looks spectacular, and the special effects -- state of the art at the time -- still look magnificent.<br /><br />Robby the Robot, of course, came away from this film a huge star, and it's fun to see him again.  You might be interested to know that the voice of Robby is actor Marvin Miller, who played the executive secretary of an eccentric wealthy man who, each week, gave away one million dollars tax-free on the TV show, "The Millionaire."<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen (playing it straight... this was well before his days as a comedy star in such films as "Airplane!) star.  Included in this release is the feature film, "The Invisible Boy," a follow-up film that capitalized on the popularity of Robby the Robot but had nothing to do with "Forbidden Planet."<br /><br />A sequel to "Forbidden Planet" was never made.  This big-budget epic, filmed in color, was MGM's first venture into the then emerging popularity of science fiction.  Most sci-fi pictures of the 1950's were black & white, low-budget efforts.  Only a few were made in color.  This and "War of the Worlds" are the most famous and best color sci-fi features of the Eisenhower era.</p></body></html>

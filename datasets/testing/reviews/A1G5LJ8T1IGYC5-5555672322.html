<meta name="summary" content="VERY GOOD FOR A JASON MOVIE"></head><body><p>IN THIS ONE, JASON REGAINS CONCIOUSNESS AND CONTINUES HIS VIOLENT SPREE AT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE ON ALL LEVELS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES. THIS MOVIE WAS ORIGINALLY IN 3-D, BUT IN THE VIDEO AND DVD, JASON'T JUST HIS REGULAR TWO DIMENSIONAL SELF. GOOD MOVIE AND IT'S VERY THRILLING. WHAT ALSO MAKES THIS SO SPECIAL IS THAT JASON IS FINALLY SEEN IN HIS FAMOUS HOCKEY MASK. I'D RECCOMEND THIS TO ANY HORROR FAN.</p></body></html>

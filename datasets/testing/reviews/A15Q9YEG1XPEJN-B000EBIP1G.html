<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but somehow not as robust as expected"></head><body><p>The Chronicles of Narnia is a massive film. To compare to Lord of the Rings is unfair (and I won't since I didn't really care for the Ring Trilogy - never read the books either...). I think the more fair comparison would be the Harry Potter films. And even that isn't dead on.<br /><br />Let's start with the actors. The children are all engaging, but I couldn't help thinking that they could have found more earnest and, yes I'll say it, talented actors. Now...to give the devil his due...these children were forced to "act" with nothing! They were working with green screens and disks on sticks. It's extremely difficult for a trained and aged actor to perform their craft in those circumstances. However, it would still seem that the director should have coaxed some better performances out of the kids. Peter, in particular, seems uncomfortable at times acting. His delivery is often stilted and amateurish. Does it make him unlikable? Far from it. Undoubtedly these young actors were chosen, in part, because the expectation is there to carry on the film franchise and these kids are deemed to be up to the task. Having not read the books, I can only assume that the young actor playing Peter was chosen for his angelic looks and his earnest demeanor.<br /><br />Now to the film overall. It's definitely good. It, I understand, is somewhat true to the book (which I think is always good). However, I wanted a bit more. Why is the white queen bad? Why has she turned everything to ice and snow? (By the way, Tilda Swinton is great in the part!). In what is the childrens' appearance foretold? Is it a book? or merely a legend? You get my idea. It would seem that just a couple of sentences of extra "backstory" and expositional material could have made the film as robust as the detailed telling done in the Harry Potter films.<br /><br />The CGI effects...Aslan doesn't always look great. Sometimes he's uncannily real looking and other times, no. The fox never looks real. Occasionally the beavers look quite cartoonlike. I'm willing to bet the CGI effects will improve as the series continues. After all, Dobby, in Harry Potter, looked quite CGI to me and even Golum looked cartoonish at times in LOTR.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great family film and one that adults and kids alike will enjoy. Please don't let my criticism be viewed as anything more than it is. We're lucky that such films can now be made and our expectations of them are for that of reality. We've come a long way from the Ray Harryhausen days of stop motion animation...so much so that we can now criticize the animation and compare it to "reality".<br /><br />Get this film and you'll be happy you did.</p></body></html>

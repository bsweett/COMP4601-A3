<meta name="summary" content="fascinating and quirky treatment of a doomed man's life in how own words"></head><body><p>Herzog has a certain vision of life.  It is nakedly brutal, raw in its rapacity and ambition, and ruthlessly egotistical.  These themes occur in all of his fictional films, perhaps most successfully in Aguirre.  Well, here he had found a remarkable subject, the Grizzly man, who left a record of his unusual life and even of the moment of his death.<br /><br />He started out as a misanthropic alcoholic, failing at everything he tried, but with the ego to push forward.  Believing that he found something in nature and the most unpredictable predator of all, the grizzly bear, he carved a unique niche for himself as an educator and conservationist.  In this, he was a pioneer, in his attempt to breach the barrier between man and bear that had stood for 7000 years, bringing back a film record of his adventures and stories to enchant children and adults alike.  Though a failed actor, he developed a persona and ideals that he claimed saved him from drinking himself to death.<br /><br />But something far darker lurked beneath the surface, which perhaps Herzog was the best person to plumb.  Herzog gained access to his film archive of hundreds of hours of revelatory solitary conversations, statements, and images.  He went over them carefully and pieced together a record of wonderfully human complexity, showing a conflicted man who was deluding himself as to the nature of the world (at least as Herzog sees it) and creating an act for his career as well.  Herzog also interviews many friends, family members, and critics, to gain a full perspective on a life at the limits.<br /><br />While critical, Herzog was also deeply respectful of the talents and drive of this man, which is one reason why he did not include the footage of his death for consumption by a bear.  I thought that he chose to respect the proper distance and discretion in his approach, which he did not overtly use to titillate the macabre minded.  It is a difficult balance brought off perfectly.<br /><br />If you are a Herzog fan or seeker of starkly unromantic realism, this film will fascinate you.  Many will disagree with his conclusions, but no one can ignore this masterpiece.  Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Adequate but Forced"></head><body><p>This movie is an example of the type critic Pauline Kael describes as a &quot;Boo Movie.&quot;  The handle refers to the fact that, intermittently, monsters jump out, yell &quot;Boo,&quot; and then return back to the woodwork from whence they came.<p>The first problem is that the movie is set in 1945 a house on the island of Jersey, one of the Channel Islands that belongs nominally to England, is set just off the shores of France, and is functionally independent.  This choice of setting appears to be an attempt to emulate classic movies like &#65533;Rebecca.&#65533;  The problem is that &#65533;Rebecca&#65533; was set in what was then a contemporary atmosphere.  Placing the action on an island few people will ever see, at a time more than half a century removed, enables the casual viewer to keep events at arm&#65533;s length, unaffected.<p>Nicole Kidman, the graceful and stunningly attractive redhead who was the basic reason anybody went to see &#65533;Moulin Rouge,&#65533; stars as Grace, a wife and mother who&#65533;s lived in isolation in her sprawling mansion ever since her husband went to France to fight in the war.  Though the war in Europe is over, her husband still hasn&#65533;t come home, but she steadfastly refuses to give up hope.  Her two children, however, are convinced they&#65533;re going to live the rest of their lives in this sepulchral, unlit building.<p>Are we supposed to believe that Kidman, who has a waist like my ankle, is the mother of two children as old as the kids in the movie?  Kidman and her ex-husband Tom Cruise are the adoptive parents of two young children, but most women who have given birth twice, and have children as old as these, have figures that reflect that fact.  I for one wouldn&#65533;t mind seeing a woman with such a figure cast in the lead of a movie, as I find that figure attractive.  But Kidman, who is extremely thin and graceful, simply doesn&#65533;t look like a mother of two.<p>Grace&#65533;s children suffer from a rare (and very real) disorder that causes them to suffer severe burns, asphyxiation, and other gruesome symptoms on exposure to bright light.  Left to itself, the disorder will eventually result in the children&#65533;s death.  This plot twist is interesting and offers a few material contributions to the storyline, but essentially, its purpose is as a macguffin to keep most of the house as dark as possible for as much of the movie as possible.<p>The movie tries to move through a series of suspenseful interludes, complete with a few red herrings designed to throw viewers who aren&#65533;t paying exacting attention off the true path.  The effect isn&#65533;t what the director had in mind, and where there is anything scary, it tends to be more startling than deep-seatedly frightening.  Slamming doors, unexpected music, moving furniture, and more seem to be contrived to make viewers jump out of their seats, but fail to establish a necessary environment of underlying dread.<p>The hired help, three people of mysterious background who simply show up one day and get hired that quickly, serve to create interplay and tension.  By showing us scraps of their conversations and giving us hints at unseen actions, we are led to think that they are trying to manipulate Grace and her children, in the style of Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper from &#65533;Rebecca.&#65533;  However, we see such short snippets of the characters that we get no real feel for them, nor do we understand why they&#65533;re doing anything they do.  This undercuts the desired tension, leaving us with a trio of characters who say one thing, do another, and serve still another purpose in the plot.  Indeed, some of the shots featuring these characters seem designed to willfully deceive us as to who they are.  Red herrings are fine and most critics appreciate them, but we are simply lied to as to what these characters are about, setting us up for a payoff that never comes.<p>The movie prides itself of its surprise ending.  This is fine, except that it&#65533;s not a surprise.  Because it&#65533;s deeply reminiscent of another recent movie (I won&#65533;t say which in case some reader of this review is actually going to be startled), careful viewers see it coming well in advance, and it actually serves as something of a letdown.  What tension is built up through the course of the movie is never effectively released, and viewers who are accustomed to horror in the style of Daphne du Maurier, whom the movie&#65533;s creators seem to be consciously imitating, will be disappointed.<p>In total, the movie is adequate, creating a few startled squeals and a few jumps from the seat.  However, it fails to create the desired dread seasoned suspense fans have grown to appreciate, and the setup fails to equal the payoff.  The creators of this movie seem to be testing the water for a more mature, sophisticated attempt at horror later; here&#65533;s hoping that, next time, they pay less attention to dress-up atmospherics and more to the actual events that cause us to feel fear.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic film!  Makes me grateful that I can go to the dentist!!!"></head><body><p>OK, while going to the dentist is probably not on most people's top-10 list of things to do, whenever I have a trip to the dentist on the calendar, I like to watch "Cast Away" the night before.  I am especially likely to do that if I have a major dental event the next day...you know, like a root canal, getting a crown, or even cavities that need to be filled.<br /><br />This film is almost entirely a solo effort by Tom Hanks, and he does a fantastic job of being a time-obsessed FedEx exec who spends his time flying around the world trouble-shooting and instructing FedEx centers about how to be more efficient and time-conscious, until tragedy strikes.  The time flies by for me each time I watch this film as Hanks works to find ways to survive alone on a small south Pacific island where he washes ashore.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely top-notch.  The storyline is great, and the combination of acting, story, and music rates a solid 5 stars.<br /><br />Again, if you dread going to the dentist, watch this film and you'll be grateful that you can.  Now, I didn't say happy that you can go to the dentist, but you will be grateful.  Why do I say this?  Well, I'll give you a two-word clue, "ice skate."<br /><br />5 stars all the way!</p></body></html>

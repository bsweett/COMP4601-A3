The sets were fantastic and the actors did their best.<br /><br />The movie starts upbeat enough with a romantic scene where Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) see each other across the room.  They start a conversation about their dreams and a hopeful future.  They get married and become "the Wheelers."<br /><br />The next scene shows Frank embarrassed as April is in a play and it is just awful.  The fights start and continue throughout the movie of this mismatched couple.  April's failure as an actress (minor) and Frank's failure to take the family, quit his job and move to Paris to find out what he really wants to do in life.  The movie focuses on Frank who hates his job in New York City, and has the daily grind of going to work and coming home to a wife and two children in a nice home in suburbia, that is on "Revolutionary Road."  This gives a clue to what is coming.<br /><br />April and Frank both feel the middle class malaise, however, April feels it acutely.  Like a 50's wife, she is willing to submit her desires so her husband can succeed.  On Frank's birthday, April asks him to follow his dream - got to Paris (I never figured out why location made a difference in a goal - she later said it could be "anywhere").  April talks Frank into taking their savings, sell their home and quit his job to move the family to Paris.  She will get a high-paying job as a secretary in some governmental office.<br /><br />Feeling free and not tied to his job, Frank submits a proposal that is unexpectedly welcomed.  He meets with a high ranking member of his company who offers Frank a better position and more money.  Frank decides he rather stay in his home on Revolutionary Road.  April is devastated.  She wants Frank to go to Paris to find out what he really wants in life.<br /><br />The realtor that sold them the house (Kathy Bates) becomes a friend and introduces them to her grown son who has psychiatric problems.  He has had shock therapy and yet he speaks of the evils of conformity.  He told the Wheelers to go to Paris - break out of the mold - find individualism and the spirit of youth.  This causes rough fighting and brutal words between two beautiful people.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is drama and fighting.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet act well, but the lines did not ring true.  The problems they had were not big ones, they could take a trip to Paris with the kids with all their money and see if that is what they really wanted.<br /><br />Instead, April and Frank keep fighting and hate grows.  April gets pregnant and Frank does not want her to have an abortion.  She wants out of her shackles and self-aborts the baby and dies.  We are told that Frank adores the other children and takes them to a different house to raise.  It is a sad ending to a disturbing movie.  She cannot accept boredom and conformity.</p></body></html>

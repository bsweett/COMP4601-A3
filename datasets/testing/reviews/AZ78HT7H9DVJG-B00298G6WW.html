<meta name="summary" content="Brosnan funny?  Who knew!"></head><body><p>I could not believe that Pierce Brosnan could be funny!  He wasn't even this funny in *Remington Steele*.  Greg Kinnear was a compatible actor with Brosnan.<br /><br />Brosnan plays Julian Noble, who is an assassin or rather a "facilitator of fatilities".  He travels around the world to eliminate his targets.  When he gets to Mexico City, he meets Danny Wright (Kinnear) at a hotel bar over margaritas.  Danny is an unlucky businessman who is trying to get back on the rise.<br /><br />This particular introduction is the best part.  They're trying to have conversation yet they keep misunderstanding each other, even to the point of being completely rude.  Yet they stay around to continue chatting.  Finally, to smooth things over, Julian invites Danny to a bullfight event.  There, Julian reveals what he does.  Of course, thinking Julian is joking, Danny doesn't believe him.  At this point, things are even funnier especially when Julian asks Danny to help him out on a target in Mexico City.<br /><br />The weekend quickly comes to an end.  Julian continues to travel around the world to do his job.  However, Julian makes a mistake and then another.  On the run, Julian shows up at Danny's residence in Denver...6 months later.  Once again, Julian asks Danny for his help.  Of course, they go through this whole drama that was played out earlier.<br /><br />There are a few things why I loved this movie.  Brosnan plays Julian well, nothing similar to Steele or James Bond.  Julian is mysterious.  He bops women but then there are hints where he just might be bisexual.  There's one particular scene that keeps coming up but isn't really shown completely.  You can't help but wonder what happened.  Julian is wacky as he'll walking around a hotel in speedos and cowboy boots.  Kinnear is equally funny as this naive man trying to survive in this cruel world.  He's a trusting man who cannot decipher truth from fiction.  And Julian wants this man help him out on a "job"?!?!<br /><br />So, check out *The Matador* and enjoy a few chuckles.</p></body></html>

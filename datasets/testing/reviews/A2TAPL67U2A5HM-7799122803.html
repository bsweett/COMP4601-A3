<meta name="summary" content="Alice in Wonderland"></head><body><p>Alice in Wonderland is a splendid movie by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as the mad hatter, and Mia Masikowska as Alice. The special effects are amazing and the storyline is very well-written. The music is effective and overall it is a movie that I very much liked to watch. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter also play their parts to perfection. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

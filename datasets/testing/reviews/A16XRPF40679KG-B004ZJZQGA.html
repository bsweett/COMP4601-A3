<meta name="summary" content="drama does not equal comedy"></head><body><p>This movie is advertised on the box as being a comedy.  It is not a bit funny at all. The premise of gangsters shooting it out in the beautiful city of Bruges is what is supposed to be the comedic element I suppose.  This may not be the fault of the people who made this movie however.  It is clearly a dark drama that they tried to inject a little humor into but it's not a dark comedy at all.  I guess a small boy getting his head blown off in a church is funny to a drug addict mentality; but for most of the people on this planet , this is not humorous.  And even worse than this is that you have to sit through  a 15 minute scene in the middle of the movie in which people do alot of drugs and say stupid rascist comments , and scenes in which people think about things on drugs which distort all reality anyways are always the ultimate bore.  The acting however is first class in this movie and the characters are well developed.  The box warns that this movie isn't P.C. and that's fine but if they had said this is a dark drama with a few comedic elements they would have been saying the truth.  Still colin ferrel and the rest of the cast do make the characters engaging enough to forgive the weaker elements of the movie.  I don't think this was sold to the theaters as a dark comedy so I can at least cut the filmaker some slack on that issue.<br />He clearly has talent and he may have been trying to be hip by adding the endless boring drug taking and talking scene; but a good editor would have shortened that scene and focused more on the solid acting of gleeson and ferril as these two men bond together.  And the best friends you have are not party friends, but  are those who are  bonded to you by your real experiences in life. Ironically the character that Brandon Gleeson plays understands this and this means the filmaker did too, he just got sidetracked by the now outdated idea that showing alot of drug usage makes a movie cool.</p></body></html>

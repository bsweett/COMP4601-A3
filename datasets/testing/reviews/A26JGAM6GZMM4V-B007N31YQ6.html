I have no idea how  &quot;true&quot; its screenplay is and now comment on the film itself.  First off, I think Roberts's acting is solid but hardly worthy of the  lavish praise it has received. True, it's hard not to notice her but she is  hardly in the same league with Field and Streep who portrayed similar  characters. Albeit less photgenic and certainly less energetic, Albert  Finney (as Ed Masry) does much the better job. Given the tragic and  potentially tragic circumstances presented in the film, I expected them to  be the primary source of tension rather than whether or not Erin will get a  job, win the lawsuit after the automobile accident, etc. As is, the film's  priorities seem to suggest that Erin's sense of self-worth is more  important than a cancer which has killed or will kill less glamorous folk.  I enjoyed the movie. I wish I could admire it more.</p></body></html>

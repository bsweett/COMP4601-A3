<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Perfromances by Broderick and Washington"></head><body><p>Even as the Civil War was being fought, it was history in the making, and one of it's many chapters involved a stretch of beach on a peninsula in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, where in July of 1863, the Confederates had ensconced themselves in the strategically prominent Fort Wagner.  And the Federal command had determined that it must be taken at all costs.  But it would be a veritable suicide mission for the regiment that served as the vanguard of the assault; therefore, volunteers were called upon, rather than being chosen arbitrarily by the General in command.  At this point, a young Colonel from Boston, Robert Gould Shaw, stepped forward to offer his regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first unit comprised of black soldiers in the history of the U.S. Army, for the job.  "Glory," directed by Edward Zwick, is their story.<p> Soon after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the Army was opened up to blacks; and the first to respond were those who ultimately made up the 54th.  Shaw, an abolitionist, was approached about taking command, and he accepted, putting his beliefs on the line and determining to make real soldiers of these men.  And he did.  In the beginning, however, he had no idea of the formidable task awaiting them in the not too distant future, when they would face an enemy bastion that was heavily fortified, well manned and which maintained a decidedly advantageous position geographically.  But leading up to that, Shaw had his men trained properly and stood by them as they formed the bonds amongst themselves that ultimately saw them through the battles they had to fight, on the field and off.  It was rough going; but under Shaw's command, they were able to secure something they had never had in their lives-- dignity as human beings.<p> Going into this project, director Zwick was adamant about adhering to historical accuracy in all areas of the story, from the events themselves, to the smallest, seemingly insignificant details they would put on the screen.  And he succeeded.  When the soldiers of the 54th, for example, are informed that their pay would be ten dollars a month, minus three dollars for clothing expenses-- seven real dollars pay-- instead of the thirteen they had been promised (which was the pay the white soldiers received), Shaw and his officers, in a show of solidarity, tear up their own pay envelopes and refuse to accept their wages until their men get their full pay.  The battles, as well, from Antietam to Fort Wagner, are authentically represented.  The assault on Fort Wagner, especially, seems like an almost romantic notion of gallantry, but the fact that if happened just as depicted here makes it all the more involving.  Zwick painstakingly recreated every aspect of the battle, and sets it up geographically and in such a way that the viewer is able to anticipate, without getting lost as the action unfolds.  The outcome of the battle is, of course, a matter of historic record, and especially for those well versed in the history of the Civil War, this film should be an entirely satisfying experience.<p> Matthew Broderick gives an engaging, understated performance as Shaw that  captures the essence of the man, whom we get to know initially through his own words, from the letters he wrote home during his time in the Army (which are now kept in the Houghton Library at Harvard University).  The film begins, in fact, with one of Shaw's letters being read over the action.  Throughout the film, Zwick uses this method to move the story along, as well as to give some real insight into Shaw, and through his thoughts, the men of the 54th and the events in which they are engaged.  And Broderick seems to embody the man you picture as being the author of the words being read.  He portrays Shaw, not as a cinematic, John Wayne type superhero, but heroic in a very real sense; as he leads his men against Fort Wagner, you see a man obviously afraid, but determined to uphold his principles and ideals, for which he is willing to die.  It's not a flashy role, but Broderick, by creating a character to whom virtually everyone will be able to relate and sympathize, is clearly the strength and the star of the film.  <p> There are a number of outstanding performances in supporting roles, also, particularly Denzel Washington, who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Trip, the embittered former slave who is at war, not only with the Confederates, but with life.  Trip is a complex character, and Washington gets to his soul, awakening the bitterness as well as the somewhat caustic humor with which he wages his daily battles.  From the first scene in which he appears, Washington dominates the screen, even in the scenes in which Trip is not the center of attention.  It's a powerful performance, without question deserving of the Award.  Morgan Freeman gives a memorable performance, as well, as Sergeant Major John Rawlins, the elder statesmen of the 54th, who in his way sets an example for the younger soldiers, and eventually even Trip.  Also worthy of mention are Andre Braugher, as Thomas, and Jihmi Kennedy as Jupiter Sharts.<p> The supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Major Forbes), John Finn (Mulcahy), Donovan Leitch (Morse), Bob Gunton (Harker), Cliff De Young (Montgomery) and Jay O. Sanders (General Strong).  Beginning with an accurate and insightful screenplay (by Kevin Jarre), Zwick uses all the tools at his disposal, including great cinematography (by Freddie Francis, who received the Oscar) and some memorable performances, to deliver an unforgettable and historically significant film.  Zwick is to be commended for the honesty of this film, and for maintaining the integrity of the story, which he never embellished simply for dramatic effect, which simply wasn't necessary; the drama that the 54th Massachusetts played out in real life was enough.  And that is what Zwick presents, in "Glory."</p></body></html>

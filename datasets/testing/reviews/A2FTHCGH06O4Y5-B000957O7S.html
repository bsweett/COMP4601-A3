<meta name="summary" content="okay"></head><body><p>Since generally Will Smith is charming, versatile, and generally deserving of his celebrity status, this movie is never intolerable and is enjoyable enough the first time around.<br /><br />The problem arises when you try to watch it again.<br /><br />The main problem is the script, it seems to me, wasn't too well-thought out.  Here the Hitch character was supposed to be so super-smooth with women that bumbling men paid him thousands to give them advice, yet at the same time he was so dorky that, for example, he kicked his girlfriend in the face.<br /><br />The whole thing didn't add up.  It seemed like the filmmakers had two scripts:  one with Will Smith as a loveable dork moving around in the dating scene, and another with Will Smith as a ultra-slick master of the same scene.<br /><br />It seemed like they just combined the two scripts into one movie, hoping no one would notice.  But I did.<br /><br />Some precious quotes, though.</p></body></html>

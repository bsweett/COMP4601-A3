<meta name="summary" content="Snatched by brilliance"></head><body><p>"Snatch" is a British crime-fiction film which contains a multi-layered story featuring several characters.<br /><br />As has become a trademark with Guy Ritchie works there is interaction amongst all the protagonists which shapes the narrative, and this at times is presented overtly and subtly.<br /><br />The casting of Jason Statham (as Turkish) and Brad Pitt (plays Mickey O'Neil) was masterful and both provide tremendous resonance to the story.<br /><br />It is a lively movie with plenty of surprises as the narrative unfolds and reaches a dramatic ending.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

When he was at the height of the form, he had no rival, and TOTAL RECALL stands as a testament to his greatness.<p>With top notch special effects along with a story inspired by the master Philip K. Dick, Arnold proved that not had there been life on Mars long ago but life today was possible for humans with the right combination of scientific events.<p>Along for the ride were a youthfully sexy vixen named Sharon Stone, an equally sexy rival in Rachel Tinochen, a wonderfully evil villain in Ronny Cox, and genre fav Michael Ironside chewed scenery as well as Arnie did.<p>The commentary track adds some depth into the preproduction, filming, and postproduction process -- with a healthy amount of anecdotes thrown in for the average viewer -- making this Special Limited Edition (a tin in the shape of Mars, nonetheless) worth the view.</p></body></html>

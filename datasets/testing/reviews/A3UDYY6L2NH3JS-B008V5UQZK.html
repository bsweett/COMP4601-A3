<meta name="summary" content="Don't laugh yourself to death"></head><body><p>This film is the perfect adventure in experimenting all kinds of laughter, from an ephete smile to an uproarious bursting-out explosion. Every single detail is supposed to made you laugh, and you better do it if you do not want to be righteously considered as a party pooper. The film is hilarious and that is its only real quality. After a while though, you start wondering what your are laughing at? The melting pot that is working upside down, to the benefit and profit of the Greek immigrants? The salad bowl which is all mixed up and confused since good American people have to integrate the Greek culture and religion just for one son to get married to one Greek daughter? Or just maybe to ourselves who are always thinking, reacting and acting within the narrow guidelines of our one-way cultural vision? But who cares since it is funny and we laugh. But don't choke on the bones if, being a vegetarian, you are suggested to drop meat and start eating mutton. That is Greek humor indeed, maybe with a touch or Turkish recollection behind.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Flashy Ultraviolet Lacks Substance"></head><body><p>Normally, when a movie has its colors dulled or placed in super sharp contrast, its done to indicate either flashbacks or sentimentality. In the 2006 flick Ultraviolet, these color tricks are used in every single sequence, indeed in each and every frame. Ultraviolet looks incredible, but ultimately it is just another flash and trash flick.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is a painfully bad mixture of fantastic cinematography and awful acting and direction. The film is basically a bad Matrix ripoff. And the script is just plain bizarre.<br /><br />In the future America depicted in Ultraviolet, there are two different kinds of people. The first group act just like characters from the Matrix movies, including the ability to dodge bullets and the like. They are also at heart vampires, although this aspect of the movie was poorly handled to the point that the vampire bit was confusing. The other group consists of normal everyday folks. Of course, the normal folks are at heart fascists and hate the Matrix types.<br /><br />The level of acting in Ulatraviolet is horrible. You can tell that the actors are in this movie just for the pay checks. They just go through the motions, not even trying to act.<br /><br />This is not the first movie directed by Kurt Wimmer that was basically a ripoff of The Matrix trilogy. He also made the hit Equilibrium. As a director, Wimmer specializes in lots of flashy action sequences. The end result is movies that look cool, but are ultimately empty.<br /><br />The basic problem with Ultraviolet is that its all surface gloss. Ultraviolet has a clear similarity to a somewhat earlier movie, Aeon Flux in that its all flash and trash. Both flicks are basically nothing more than godawful messes of gosh wow and would be cool and wonderful stuff.<br /><br />Only problem is that movies like Ultraviolet are anything but cool.</p></body></html>

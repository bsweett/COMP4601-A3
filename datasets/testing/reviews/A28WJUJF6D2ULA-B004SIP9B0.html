She was convincing in one of the most difficult roles any British actress could be called upon to play, and it was also courageous of this former Bond girl, often noted in American memories for being cast as great beauties and occasional seductresses, to lose herself as completely as she did in the Queen's stately contained matronly presence. Also deserving of note is Michael Sheen's chameleon-like transformation into Tony Blair. Sheen should have gotten more acclaim than he received for the skill with which he brought a still-relevant political figure so deftly to the screen. James Cromwell was great as always as the cantankerous old tyrant Prince Phillip, and only the casting of Alex Jennings as the Prince of Wales puzzled me, as Jennings, though a sound actor, did not seem to fit the part as well as many others could have. The Queen was, I thought, a riveting take on events that remain fresh in the collective minds of people around the world, and it managed to disarm cynicism and capture a convincing account of what would ordinarily be the private moments of highly public figures. In my opinion The Queen was so much better than anything nominated against it as Best Picture at last year's Academy Awards that it represented in its loss in that category the greatest mistake in Academy voting since Shakespeare In Love displaced Saving Private Ryan to take home top honors. See this film. It's a work of cinematic art.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE in-one-THIRD-of-the-movie MAN"></head><body><p>Unfortunately, ELP and LP-recorded budget-label VHS tapes don't do proper justice to such a superb motion picture, thus this product is NOT recommended.<br /><br />Orson Welles once explained to Peter Bogdonovich that a true star role is one where others talk about an unseen person for 45 minutes before he finally appears. Perhaps Welles was defining in this bit of philosophy his own status as Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN.<br /><br />It's difficult to think of Harry as a star role, for the man is an unmitigated and unrepentant scoundrel who sold diluted penicillin to hospitals-- tampered-with medicine that caused the death or permanent disabling of dozens of children and adults. Even as Harry looks down from the height of a Ferris wheel at ant-sized people he expresses to friend Holly Martins (Cotten) his disdain and unconcern for humanity. Lime is a classic sociopath, and yet the "star" of this Carol Reed picture? No, that honor must go to Mr. Cotten, who's in almost every scene and raises a fine movie to the level of a genuine classic.<br /><br />Original zither music by Anton Karas is unforgettable as is cinematography of war-scarred Vienna, battered but still beautiful and at times forbidding. Kudos to Alida Valli as a Czech refugee actress who fears deportation by the Russians. Her unshakeable devotion to Harry defines blind love and makes this girl easiest to sympathize with. Trevor Howard brings to his British major a perfect mix of business-like military demeanor and well-masked concern. Minor characters like a so-called 'Baron' and other shady types keep Holly and us always on our toes.<br /><br />This noir classic well deserves its Top 100 Movie status. Highly recommended to all!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.5) THE THIRD MAN (UK-1949) - Joseph Cotten/Alida Valli/Orson Welles/Trevor Howard/Bernard Lee/Paul H&ouml;rbiger/Ernst Deutsch/Wilfrid Hyde-White (uncredited: Lee Strasberg)<br /><br />Two years before his turn in THE THIRD MAN, Orson Welles directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W229">THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI</a> (DVD). Starring in this fascinating film noir is glamorous Rita Hayworth, who attempted unsuccessfully to reconcile with co-star and estranged husband Welles during this story's production.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Seven reasons to not get thrilled about this thriller"></head><body><p>This was my first time seeing SEVEN.I know it was a hit when it was released years ago.I know that some wonderful actors starred in it.How has it aged?<br /><br />1.There is little in SEVEN that held my interest.The story of a weary gumshoe and his hot-shot snot-nosed newbie partner is as old as the hills.One wants to retire and the other is shot-from-guns-ready to jump at anything.This story was done way before SEVEN and has continually been rehashed on every crime show that television offers.<br /><br />2.The story is slow and the film weighs in at a tiresome 127 minutes.It takes three murders and a lot of setting up of the characters and their back-stories to come to the first really tense moment resulting in a chase of any kind.We must see the tableaux of gluttony,greed and sloth before we are treated to any action.Perhaps David Flincher wanted to set us up in the manner of methodical exactness that his killer was creating,but this made for tiresome,lets-move-this-thing along-while-staring-at-the-"counter" on the vcr.A lot of material about the seven deadly sins are introduced and shot and not developed from sources such as Dante's "Divine Comedy",Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" and other ponderous volumes.I suppose this is to give the film an intellectual flavor that never lingers on the palette, but passes right on through and comes out to be flushed away and not explained.<br /><br />3.It rained everyday.<br />There were no people around in New York when the investigations were  going on.(When does that EVER happen).<br /><br />4.The clues were so in-your-face that the "gut-wrenching climax?" came as no surprise.One only needed to pay attention to the scene between Paltrow and Freeman in the cafe to know where this was going to end.<br /><br />5.I still think that Brad Pitt is no actor.I simply cannot see why this fellow gets work!Pretty faces do not an actor make!<br /><br />6.I still admire to the utmost Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow and their expert acting skills.They are far better than Pitt could ever dream!<br /><br />7.Kevin Spacey seems only to ever play the same dead-eyed vacuous maniac even if the film is not a thriller.<br /><br />SEVEN may be more appealing to some than it was to me.I honestly cannot see any value to the film for story line,rising action,editing,soundtrack ,direction or acting beyond one viewing.</p></body></html>

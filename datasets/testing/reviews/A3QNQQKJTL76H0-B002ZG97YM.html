It's a wonderfully heart-warming and beautifully animated film that's not only fun for kids, but also for adults. Of course, kids will love the big smashy Vikings and dragons, but for parents, grown-up kids and animation fans, there's plenty of other things to love: a kooky cast of characters, some witty and sarcastic dialog, and the lush and lovingly-rendered CG visuals. Dreamworks grows by leaps and bounds with each successive film in terms of animation technology, and this is their best work yet, looking even better than the fantastic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168OINK">Kung Fu Panda [Blu-ray</a>]. But besides that, it's got an entertaining story that audiences of all ages can appreciate.<br /><br />This is the story of a scrawny, wimpy boy named Hiccup, who lives in the village of Berk. The film begins with him introducing us to his miserable island "twelve days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death" and its pest problem-- dragons! Here's where the dragons come in and the scene quickly changes to one of comic chaos. As the Vikings run around fending off the fire-breathing raiders, Hiccup is told by everyone to get out of the way and get back inside. He desperately wants to impress the people of his village and earn their respect, especially his father, Stoick the Vast, the leader of their tribe and a brave Viking, who sees his son as a nuisance at best and a disappointment. During the raid, he makes a mess trying to help, but not without shooting down a rare and mysterious Night Fury first (the fiercest of them all). Problem is, no one believes him because he's such a bungler.<br /><br />Afterwards, Hiccup sneaks off to the woods to find the injured dragon with the intent of finishing the job and proving his Vikingness. He is unable to and over time, he befriends the dragon, who he names Toothless. He uses his blacksmithing skills to create a tail fin for his injured buddy and through Toothless, he learns a lot about taming and training dragons (hence the film's title). Hiccup eventually becomes proud of who he is and earns the respect of all his friends and villagers. At the end, we are treated to a spectacular fight in gorgeous 3D CG and he returns home a hero. Everyone is happy. Village is safe, father-son issues resolved, boy gets girl.<br /><br />It's all very wholesome entertainment with a good, positive story for kids and adults. Amusingly, the Viking characters all have Scottish accents, which is a stroke of genius. Many of the funnier, sarcastic lines are delivered by Gobbler (voiced by comedian Craig Ferguson), the one armed, one legged blacksmith, Stoick's 2nd in command, and Hiccup's mentor. Stoick himself is voiced by Gerard Butler (another Scot), who has played a Norse warrior before in the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UYX4OK">Beowulf & Grendel [Blu-ray</a>]. Stoick's animated mannerisms and gestures are perfectly captured! They look exactly like Butler's movements and facial expressions from other films and the animators did an excellent job bringing all the nuances to life onscreen. Ferguson and Butler's voices add a lot of personality to the film. The only thing I found annoying was Hiccup's voice (Jay Baruchel), who speaks in a nasal monotone and self-deprecating deadpan most of the time. I also didn't care for any of the other kid characters in the film. They are dull and forgettable, without really any memorable lines, funny moments, or interesting accents to set them apart.<br /><br />The sets, camerawork and lush detailing of all the characters, props, environments, and dragons is top-notch and it's clear a lot of love and attention went into making this film. The Nordic ship designs, for example, are particularly well done. How To Train Your Dragon is a fun movie and well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

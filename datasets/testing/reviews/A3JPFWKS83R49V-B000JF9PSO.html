This movie had my heart pounding, my nerves pulsing, and my body sweating. It takes the viewer on a journey aboard the flight that was supposed to be part of an attack on Washington D.C. but that was thwarted by several brave passengers, thereby saving potentially thousands of lives and millions of dollars in damage.<br /><br />Everyone already knows what took place on September 11, 2001 and anyone who doesn't know can quickly look up facts on the internet or in printed form. The fate of United Flight 93 is already well known and for that reason, I wondered if this movie would be able to keep my attention for very long. I knew about this movie several weeks before its release and I was skeptical about its ability to accurately portray the events and to give the viewer a realistic feel for what happened during this flight. Everyone already knows the outcome, I reasoned, so how suspenseful could it possibly be?<br /><br />Well, I am here to tell you that United 93 is an incredibly suspenseful, scary, heart- pounding movie that ranks among the most dramatic I have ever witnessed. It accomplishes this in spite of the fact that you already know how it will end, and the bulk of the credit goes to director and writer Paul Greengrass for making this possible. He has produced a movie about the United 93 flight that is realistic in every way and so emotionally draining and pulse- pumping it should be approached with caution by anyone who has a history of heart problems.<br /><br />I love many things about this movie and the most important among them is the action and emotional factors. The movie starts off on an easy pace and the action at first is only lukewarm. But then, the North World Trade Center Tower gets hit by a plane, causing a reaction of disbelief on the part of the Air Traffic Controllers. The word "hijack" gets tossed around, but no one can believe it. There hasn't been a hijacking in the United States in decades and it seems too unreal to accept as fact. But then, the second tower gets hit and then the Pentagon. At this point, the action on the screen is furious, with Air Traffic Controllers talking non- stop on phones, officials watching the planes paths on radar, and everyone wondering what to do next. Then, the scene switches to United 93 and its relatively quiet passengers who are chatting back and forth about things in the news, things taking place at their homes, and so on. It's nothing but ordinary chitchat. That is, until the hijackers race to the front of the plane, open the cockpit doors, and attack the pilots. From this point on, the movie is a depiction of sheer terror as the passengers get tossed back and forth, the hijackers stab more victims, and a few of the men join together and rush the cockpit in an effort to regain control of the plane.<br /><br />Another thing I love about this movie is the way it is scripted. Paul Greengrass presents a script in United 93 that is very real. It doesn't contain snappy statements, amusing quips, memorable quotations, a catchy soundtrack of classic rock and roll tunes, or anything else one would expect from a big Hollywood production. Instead, the actors and actresses in this movie talk in the actual manner one would expect them to talk to each other. In other words, the little conversation that exists is typical of what people talk about each day on the job (in the case of the flight members, crew, and Air Traffic Controllers) or in the presence of strangers (in the case of the passengers on the plane). It's almost like Greengrass set the stage, told everyone about the events that took place during the actual United Flight 93, turned on his camera, and let everyone be themselves for the next 111 minutes. Everyone talks in a completely normal way, and this adds tremendously to the film's appeal. It seems so real it's frightening.<br /><br />The emotional appeal of this movie is another strong point and I cannot imagine anyone leaving the theater without feeling shaken in some way. You feel like you're right there with the hijackers. You feel angry at these crazy lunatics who want to kill all of these innocent lives. You feel the suspense as the moment draws near for the passengers to fight back. You feel anxiety and grief as you wonder what must be going on back home as different passengers call their families to tell them they are not likely to ever see them again. And you feel a sense of outrage over the lack of decisive leadership action from the FAA and other government agencies.<br /><br />One unusual thing about this movie is that it doesn't include any well- known Hollywood leading men or women. I recognized only one of the stars of this movie: David Alan Basche, who I can recall playing a part in the movie "War of the Worlds". And even he isn't very well known. I'm not sure why the Greengrass decided to leave out the big names, but I'm glad he did because casting the film with lesser- known actors and actresses makes it seem that much more realistic. They seem like ordinary men and women going about an ordinary day that eventually turned into the most hellish day of the lives. And because the action itself is so gripping, I had a hard time even remembering the names of the characters. Usually, I have a good roadmap in my mind when I watch a movie that accurately organzies the character names and the actors/actresses who played them for future reference. But this movie was so intense with its heart- pouding action that I completely lost track of who was who.<br /><br />One other surprise with this film is that it doesn't attempt to make any brash judgments or any strong political statements. I watched and listened closely to see if there would be any negative statements about different ethnic groups of people, different religions, etc., etc., but there were none. It would have been very tempting with this type of movie to include scenes with the passengers and/or the Air Traffic Controllers going off on a hateful rant over different ethnic groups or different religions but Greengrass resists. He also resists the temptation to blame anyone specifically or to indict any one group as responsible. He does point out the failures of the FAA, but this is honest truth and Greengrass doesn't try to sugarcoat the situation. But he also resists the temptation to demonize the FAA, choosing instead to just point out the inadequacies and move on.<br /><br />Because of the hectic pace of this film, there is a large amount of shaky camera work. The scenes move at a fast clip and the camera has a difficult time keeping up with everything. This is especially true aboard United Flight 93 and as the big moment approaches and the passengers decide to fight back, the camera goes all over the place. Here, some might find this a little bit sloppy and if it were most other movies, I would criticize it for this reason. But here, Paul Greengrass got it right once again. He wanted to depict the scenes exactly the way they would have been witnessed by someone aboard the plane. With all the chaos taking place, the sudden descents, and the rollover of the plane in the sky, the scene wouldn't have been smooth in any person's eyes. It would have been a jumbled mess of action, and that is exactly the way it is shown in this movie.<br /><br />It has been almost five years since the attacks of September 11, 2001. It is a day that will never, ever, be forgotten as thousands lost their lives in these terrorist attacks. But we can all stand proud and remember the brave men who fought back against the terrorists on United Flight 93. They didn't stop the plane from crashing and they didn't save the lives of anyone on board. But they prevented much greater loss of life and property by taking action at a crucial moment. This movie, United 93, is an excellent film that everyone should see. It accurately depicts the drama, the fear, the anxiety, and the sheer madness that was taking place in the skies on September 11, 2001 in a way that is emotionally exhausting and realistic to the extreme. We all know what takes place, but United 93 still keeps you solidly in its grip from start to finish. It's an incredible movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What the fog happened to this movie?"></head><body><p>Lame pun I know. But it's a valid question, and it's one that's hard to answer without mentioning all the bad things about it. Horror movies tend to come in trends, similar to music. In the 70's we had psychological horror, 80's we had slasher films like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. 90's we get teen slashers like Scream and Urban Legend. Now we have 2 trends: the remakes of old films such as this and Ring or The Grudge and outright gory films like the Saw films and Hostel. So in a way, the horror genre didn't need this remake, it was just more convenient.<br /><br />The film centers around an Oregon community that had a dark past.  The founding fathers are having an anniversary of sorts and people are celebrating birth of their town. Only this immense blanket of fog is right outside their island and wants to creep people out. So people die, people get spooked and plot holes fit for trains fly by all the while we're going "um, this is a horror movie right?"<br /><br />On an episode of Family Guy, Brian is explaining the plot of Blair Witch Project to a blind guy and saying "nothing's happening" a lot and "something about a map".  Well there's no map here but you can pretty much say "nothing's happening....more fog, nothing's happening". That's kind of the problem with this film: it's kinda boring. There's no sense of dread for the characters so if they're in trouble, we kind of go listless.<br /><br />Another trend happening a lot lately is the reliance on CG effects. While many of these fog shots and such could obviously not be CG, the ever-growing trend of using CG and a bit poor CG at that isn't very appealing. I especially love the special feature on them: "we wanted to give them personality so you got angry fog, sneaky fog". It's like guys? It's just fog, it doesn't NEED a personality. Of course it has more personality than the actors but that's not their fault.<br /><br />One hard thing for an actor to shake is when we see them outside a signature role. So when TV's Tom Welling starts driving, we start going "can't Superman fly? And since when did Shannon from Lost go from one island to another?" It's not their fault and they try to at least give a performance but it's usually director's fault too. It's kinda sad to say attractive likable stars look so wooden.<br /><br />Here's hoping we go back to films like the Shining, Rosemary's Baby or Night of the Living Dead and freak out people because of remakes like the Grudge, the Fog or outright gory films like Hostel are an indication, we're going to suffer through more crap, and that fogging sucks.</p></body></html>

What happens when this duel gets personal... a slip in a knot leads to a death, then it is countered with the loss of part of a hand, then a leg, and then...?<br /><br />How far will it go?<br /><br />That is the premise behind The Prestige.  Good magicians never give up their tricks.  Ever.  So, as a member of the audience, watch closely, keep an open mind, and expect the unexpected.<br /><br />Because the unexpected will occur, and you will find yourself comprehending the action slower than you thought was possible.<br /><br />And it is this observation of your slow self-realization that you will find most haunting.<br /><br />Although the tales are quite different, I found myself reminded of V for Vendetta for the pace of the story, the direction, and the cinematography.  See what you think!</p></body></html>

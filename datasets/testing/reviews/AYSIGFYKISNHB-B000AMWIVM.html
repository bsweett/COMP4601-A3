<meta name="summary" content="Saw Rocks"></head><body><p>Saw is an amazing horror flick and Jigsaw (Bell) is definitley a new horror hero. 2 men (Elwes, Whannell) are shackeled broken down bathroom. Dr. Gordon has to kill his cellmate Adam or his wife (Potter) and daughter (Vega) will die.<br /><br />Tracking down Jigsaw is a dectective name David Tapp (Glover) and his partner Steven Sing (Lueng).<br /><br />This film also stars Dina Meyer as Detective Kerry. Shawnee Smith as Amanda. And Michael Emerson as Zep Hindle. This film really has a cool idea about a killer who doesn't actually kill his victims. He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. For them to survive, they have to go through his deadly games.<br /><br />Performances are very good, some over the top, but very good. The ending really makes this film one of the best films of 2004.<br /><br />This uncut edition really has no extra scenes, just an extended scene of Amanda finding the key inside a man's body.<br /><br />Saw is a must-see horror film. And it's sequel is even more awesome.</p></body></html>

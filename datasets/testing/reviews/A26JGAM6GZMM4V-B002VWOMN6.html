<meta name="summary" content="The Boy Genius and His Bitter Adversary"></head><body><p>For those about to see this film for the first time, they can expect a feast for their senses...at least in terms of sight and sound. Both the production values and the music are magnificent. In 1984, it received Academy Awards for best director (Milos Forman) and leading actor (F. Murray Abraham) as well as for adapted screenplay, art direction, costume design, makeup, and sound. It was also nominated for cinematography and deserved that award also, losing out to The Killing Fields. Although Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) is the subject, the film's focus is really on Antonio Salieri (Abraham) who is offended by young Mozart's vulgarity and resentful of the fact that such an immature boor should be entrusted by God with such exceptional talent. He considers himself the victim of a cruel practical joke, although he appreciates Mozart's "divine" talent which only serves to exacerbate his resentment. Unlike other films such as The Red Shoes which also offers so much that is pleasing to the eye and ear, Amadeus has a complicated plot which involves equally complicated human relationships, notably Mozart's with Salieri and with his father Leopold Mozart (Roy Doltrice). The supporting cast is first-rate. As the film progresses, we realize that young Mozart is literally working himself to death as he struggles to complete a commission to compose "Requiem," not realizing that Salieri is his "benefactor." There is so much to enjoy in this film even as Mozart's health deteriorates. What to make of Salieri? His jealousy is certainly understandable, if reprehensible. As the film draws to its sad conclusion, and as his own health deteriorates, Salieri's attitude toward Mozart seems to me ambivalent. Yes, the disapproval and resentment remain but I also sense a certain pride in his association with the young genius. The tone is bittersweet, in fact poignant as the old man realizes that Mozart's art -- not his -- will be remembered and cherished.<p>This DVD version also provides several supplementary items which include commentaries by Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer as well as a behind-the-scenes 37-minute documentary, "The Making of Amadeus."</p></body></html>

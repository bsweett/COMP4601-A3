Besides ONE scene, this film was awsome and lived up to it's name.  The story revolves around our returning hero Frank Martin (Jason Statham) who is now choufer for a young boy whoes mother played by the beautiful Amber Valetta is going through a rough marraige and is starting to take a liking to Frank.  This spirals when her son is kidnapped while in Frank's custody and he is blamed for his disaperance.  The boy was kidnapped by this international terrorist type guy played by Alessandro Gassman and for the record, the guy is not French, he is Italian.  Anyways...it's his girlfriend who is the real trouble...played by Kate Nauta she plays a lethal killing machine wearing nothing but her underwear and strapped with some uzzies she proves a formidable threat.  The fight sequences in the film were expertly choreographed by Corey Yuen and they prove enough to satisfy the fan...but there is one drawback...and that is the whole premise of the final fight scene.  It's just way too CGI and choppy and SOOOOOOO increadibly fake looking.  BUT as my title states, DON'T TAKE THIS MOVIE SO SERIOUS!  It's not ment to be.  Laugh a little at the rediculous conclusion but smile as you watch Frank kick serious @$$ and thats the great part about this movie...Jason Statham has moves.</p></body></html>

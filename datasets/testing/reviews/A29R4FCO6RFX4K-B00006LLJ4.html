<meta name="summary" content="Minority Report"></head><body><p>After the commercial dissapointment of A.I Artificial Intelligence, Steven Spielberg's upcoming film Minority Report is set in more traditional Science Fiction territory. This is Future-Noir at it's most inventive, with futuristic settings and amzing visuals. Tom Cruise, in his 25th film, is in superb form as the Pre-Crime agent who is on the run from his own people for a murder he hasn't commited (yet?). And the strong supporting cast of veteran Max Von Sydow and Colin Farrell gives added gravitas. The not-so-far away appearance of the system gives the film chilling realism. And this, more than anything else, is what gives the film it's kudos, for using a method of "futuristic" crimework that is completley believable. The action set-pieces and FX are absolutley amazing and the dark tone adds some well-played suspensful scenes, involving some creepy CGI creations. Building up to a tense and inpredictable climax, this is truly a great Sci Fi film that's up there with ground-breaking films like Blade Runner. Bravo, Mr Spielberg, bravo.</p></body></html>

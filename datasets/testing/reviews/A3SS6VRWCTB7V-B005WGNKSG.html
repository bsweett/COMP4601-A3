<meta name="summary" content="@ 2 hours+ Long but well paced and kept my interest."></head><body><p>Interesting Swedish film. Been a while since I watched a foreign drama video and took a while to get used to the pace. This is slow moving but the pace allows for some depth of characters not usually present in American action/drama flicks. If slow, well paced, even through out and kept my interest. Was glad I saw, heard the dubbed version.  Interesting scenery throughout. And "The Girl with the Green Tattoo" is a very special character.  Will say that some scenes are graphic in nature but no gushing blood, etc. Still, some will find these scenes hard to take because of their nature.  Overall, recommend as a mystery drama with good acting. But once again, 2+ hours long and can feel long now and again.</p></body></html>

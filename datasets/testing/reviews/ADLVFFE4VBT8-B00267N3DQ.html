<meta name="summary" content="Restored/enhanced feature movie, amazing extras, included DVD - it's a steal"></head><body><p>The Blu-ray release of the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is one of the slickest releases in Blu-ray history so far. It excels on every count: packaging, visual and audio presentation, the amount and depth of extra features and and all of the above at a retail price below most much less ambitious Blu-ray titles.<br /><br />I will briefly justify why I believe that this is a 'must have' 5-star for anyone who who watches or has kids who watch Disney animations.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br /><br />Once you remove the 3-D sleeve, the solid plastic (unlike the more recent 'cheap' Blu releases, this case does not have holes punched in it to save a penny or 2) you will find a Blu-ray guide attached to the inside front cover. The 'navigational overview' tree of the 2 Blu-ray disks is actually needed do to the almost baroque layout of features with some, such as the Hyperion Studios extra found on the Bonus disk with dozens of subfeatures within the feature. The inside cover itself lists the 27 movie 'scenes'.<br /><br />There are 3 disks:<br /><br />- The Feature Disk has the 84-minute movie plus a host of extra features.<br />- The Bonus Disk has even more extras including the already mentioned 'Hyperion Studios'.<br />- The DVD Feature Disk has the full movie once again.<br /><br />VISUAL AND AUDIO PRESENTATION<br /><br />Obviously, the original is greatly cleaned and enhanced to take advantage of Blu's 1080p superior resolution but that's not all.<br /><br />The optional DisneyView mode would make watching more enjoyable by filling the right and left side bars (the original is in a 3x4 format) with a static filler that changes with each scene matching the scene's own background, creating the impression that one is watching a 'wide screen' movie.<br /><br />Most of the extras are shot in uncompromising 1080p resolution.<br /><br />The highest audio resolution is 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio with 5.1 surround available for French and Spanish. The original soundtrack is also included for reference.<br /><br />An audio commentary track is available on the Feature Disk.<br /><br />EXTRA FEATURES<br /><br />They run the whole gamut. The Feature Disk has the expected and inevitable - but in this case with a twist - 'deleted scenes', several 'remote control games', a music video of 'Some Day My Prince Will Come' and a 'Princess and the Frog' sneak peak.<br /><br />The Bonus Disk has two main section.<br /><br />There's the 'Classic bonus features' that has content we would normally expect on a bonus disk - Heigh-Ho Karaoke sing-along, Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, Disney Through the Decades, Animation Voice Talent.<br /><br />And then there's the absolutely amazing Hyperion Studios feature. It must be the most innovative 'bonus' making this purchase worth it for anyone who may already have the movie on DVD. Architected more or less like a hypertext document, it allows the viewer to freely jump in and out featurettes dealing with the history of Disney, the animators, the making of various aspects of the movie, the cultural impact of Snow White and of Disney. And the above are put together with historians and some of the original animators talking, original story boards, full-length, uncut Disney 'shorts', reconstructed and re-enacted Walt Disney and animators commentary to specific scenes and their thoughts and views as the scenes were developed... like I said, simply amazing if you add the never-before-used interface and you consider the extra-crisp quality of the entire presentation.<br /><br />MY CONCLUSION<br /><br />I already stated it in the second paragraph of this review: if you are into animation and Disney, get it without hesitation. It's a steal.</p></body></html>

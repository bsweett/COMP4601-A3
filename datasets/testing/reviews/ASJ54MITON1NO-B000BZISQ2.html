<meta name="summary" content="The third Terminator, in the film series, on DVD."></head><body><p>This was the worst movie, in the Terminator saga, not only is there a different John Connor, (Edward Furlong did not return), there is also no Sarah Connor, in this story, and no James Cameron directing either. The new characters in the film weren't very interesting either, and the performances, were pretty forgettable as well. The Television series, that came out, shortly after this film, was actually, more interesting, and a better cast as well.</p></body></html>

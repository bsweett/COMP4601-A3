<meta name="summary" content="Romero"></head><body><p>Well the long awaited new installment in George Romero's famous "Dead" trilogy is finally here! They tried to update it and I think it fails in many respects. While Dawn of the dead is one of the best horror films ever made and Night of the Living Dead way ahead of its time, here it just seems laughable because it is not scary. It not only compares poorly to other films in the series, but it appears Romero is washed up. If they polled people on what scared them in the year 2010, I bet that "zombies" wouldn't be near the top of what scares people. But the wait finally is here, but what a disappointment. Shaun of the Dead was a much better zombie film in many respects. Romero fails to tred any new ground as a director. While zombies were pretty much an American thing, the Italians took to new levels (see Lucdio Fulci, et al). That cycle pretty much ended with Cemetary Man.</p></body></html>

This is like a pale shadow of that movie and they didn't even get the stuggle of the lead characters relgious faith against the older and sometimes more dangerous celtic faith , at least on the island he's on. Nick Cage is a excellent actor but he can't even begin to save this movie as it's  lost the point of what the original wickerman film focus was.  Buy that one.  This is a hoot though for people who like bad horror films as it's a really bad horror movie with a higher budget, still the original is a great horror classic so that's not a good thing in this case.</p></body></html>

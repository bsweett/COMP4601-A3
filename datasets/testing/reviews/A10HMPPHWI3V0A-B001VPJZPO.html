<meta name="summary" content="Skeleton Key - decent movie with a Killer Ending"></head><body><p>I am absolutly, utterly sick of the same old horror movies coming out these days, especially American ones, to me all of them are very similar and there is very rarly a unique one relesed, Over the years (60's, 70's, 80's and even early 90's)there have been some really crazy horror films that are very different from anything ever seen before, I mean dont get me wrong I love horror films but they need to come up with some new ideas and stop making un-original and boring horror films as well as re-makes of classics .... so one thing that really excited me while seeing "Skeleton Key" was that I was watching something different, a new type of horror that was FINALLY after some years trying to do something different and unique maybe it can even be classified as a cult-ish type subject ... voodoo ,possestion ,spells, witchcraft all combined ....Overall I just really was happy about seeing something different.<br /><br />Another thing that bothers me about modern horror films is that they all end in the same way ... (about 95% of the time), and that is that the much weaker longshot winner good guy always walks away in the end victorious ... I'm an old grumpy person and every once in a while I like to see a unfortune ending, though the ending in "Skeleton Key" was unfortunate, there was more lieing there than just that, it was the puzzlement of the ending, the twist, the shocker,... I'm sorry to say i'm not going to say the ending just because I dont want to spoil the ending for those of you that have not seen it, but it truly is pretty crazy.<br /><br />Now too the more negitive parts of the movie which were quite large in numbers, "Skeleton Key" was one of the most puzzling confusing and bunched up movies I have ever seen, at some points the movie littarly failed to deliver the message that it was trying to get across to the 75 people in the audience. Everything SOMEWHAT comes together in the end but some parts are so crazy that you loose intrest and start doodling with your cell phone in the theatre! ... well that may be a bit aggresive & harsh, but hey I'm speaking from genuine puzzlement and confusion.<br /><br />Personally I thought that Kate Hudson did a below average job and was 100% unconvincing as a hospice nurse .... but besides her everybody else in the film does a pretty solid job<br /><br />Not to bad but I think that the Director got a little bit to worked up and tried to carry the audience threw somewhat of a voodoo mess, but hey I bought this movie because it's unique, a good effort and most definatly something new!<br /><br />Grade: C</p></body></html>

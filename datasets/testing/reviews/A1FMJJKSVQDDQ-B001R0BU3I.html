<meta name="summary" content="Excellent performance by Don Cheadle"></head><body><p>This thriller doesn't focus on explosions and car chases. Instead, it focuses on religion and fanaticism and the negative stereotypes of Islam, and it does a hell of a job, too. It kept me interested from start to finish. But what I like most about this movie is Don Cheadle's performance. He's believable in every shot he's in, especially when he interacts with the FBI and the Agent Clayton (Peaarce) and Omar (Taghmaoui). His acting as a whole is what makes this film a whole lot better. Jeff Daniels was a bit underused in my opinion, but he does a decent job playing his part. And finally, the minimal Middle Eastern music creates the perfect atmosphere for this film. Kudos to Mark Kilian for the score. In fact, kudos to the entire cast and crew for making this movie.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Punisher is soft....get the 1989 version instead"></head><body><p>This movie made me feel as if I were watching a PG-13 kids movie. There wasn't enough action to keep me interested.<br /><br />After having his entire family murdered, he recoperates himself and then creates an elaborate plan to slowly turn his enemies against each other. Why doesn't he just blow them all away in one clean swoop ? That would have been quicker.<br /><br />I wonder if the people who gave this movie a good rating, ever saw the 1989 version.</p></body></html>

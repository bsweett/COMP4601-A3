<meta name="summary" content="Smart + Heart = Great Film"></head><body><p>The title is captivating and the film lives up to its promise.  A smart, out-of-the box and funny script by Charlie Kaufman, a good director and dynamite performances make this both thought-provoking and greatly entertaining.<br /><br />Jim Carrey, whose manic/zany performances turn me off, is brilliant here (as he was in The Truman Show).  He plays vulnerable so well, I'd like to see him do more of that.  The early scenes with him on the bus, wanting to talk to the girl, but terrified of actually doing it, are perfect.<br /><br />Kate Winslett is always good.  Here her youthful joie de vivre makes an indelible impression on Joel, the Carrey character, and on the audience.  As Clementine, aka Tangerine, with her multicolored hair and quixotic personality she makes a perfect match to the shy introvert Joel.<br /><br />A subplot, involving the employees of a company that erases troublesome memories works in its own bizarre way.  Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are all very good in their roles.<br /><br />I got a little bored with the flashbacks to Joel's childhood, wanting Mommy to hold him, etc.  They were a little too literal for my taste.  But there was so much that was wonderful that I won't subtract a star from the rating.<br /><br />Some of my favorite scenes:<br /><br />-Carrey and Winslett playing in the snow at the beach.  Wow---how much fun was that?!<br /><br />-The sheer zaniness of Dunst and Ruffalo dancing in their underwear over the sleeping body of Carrey as he's getting "the treatment."<br /><br />-The scene of Jim and Kate in the hall, near the end, when she confesses that she'll probably get bored with him and he says "OK" and she bursts into tears.  Whoa!  Cinema doesn't get much better than this---it reminds me of the emotional honesty of John Cassvetes' films.<br /><br />I didn't care all that much for Kaufman's films, "Malkovich" and "Adaptation."  I admired their cleverness but didn't really like them.  This has the same smartness but with a lot of heart and that's what makes the difference.  That's what makes this a film worth seeing, which I think will last for a long time.</p></body></html>

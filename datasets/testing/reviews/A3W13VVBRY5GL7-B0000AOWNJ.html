<meta name="summary" content="Decent remake that cannot compare to the original in any way"></head><body><p>I hate to be a movie snob (actually no, that's a lie, I love being a movie snob :-) but, I have to say that, when taken on its own, this American remake of the classic japanese 'Ring' more than holds its own as a contemporary horror classic.<p>When taken in-context as a remake, however, it fails on most every count. But anyway.<p>To synopsise:  Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is investigating the possibility of an Urban Legend being responsible for s spate of recent teenage deaths. The Legend in question concerns a videotape which, when watched, lets you know that you have a week to live. When she herslef falls prey to the Curse she enlists the help of her old partner Noah Clay (Martin Henderson) to stop the fatal event from taking place.<p>And from there on in, what we're left with is a mundanely-acted but beautifully-shot picture full of gorgeous and spooky set-pieces (the lighthouse, the barn, the asylum).<p>Watts and Henderson are there as perfunctory eye-candy, secondary to the ingenious plot and chilling photography. Director Gore Verbinski should be proud of himself  for having done such an impressive job with monochromatic shots, the Seattle weather and minimal special effects. The overall visual impression of 'The Ring' is truly unsettling.<p>The acting isn't so hot, and the ridiculous, pointless sequence with the horses on the ferry goes nowhere and does nothing. There are several horrible horror-movie cliches here too, like the boy-teen at the start of the flick with near-ESP ('they're all gonna die, maaaan) that we really could have done without.<p>For all of that, though, 'The Ring' works well as a modern standalone horror movie, and is certainly one of the betterHollywood offerings of recent years.<p>On the other hand, when one watches the original 'Ringu', you'll understand what i mean. Less overstated, less effects-laden and far , far more effecting, 'Ringu' is a Classic. 'The Ring' is not. But if you've not seen either, start with the American version.<p>To rent, not to buy.</p></body></html>

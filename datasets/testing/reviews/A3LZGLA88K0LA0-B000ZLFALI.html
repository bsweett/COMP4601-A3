<meta name="summary" content="JUDE'S THE DUDE"></head><body><p>ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a stunning musical paen to love, loyalty and commitment.  Set against the turbulent 60s  anti-war sentiment, the movie is magical and amazing in its effortless segues into the classic Beatles music.<br />Not since WEST SIDE STORY has a musical been so insightful into the cultures of the time.  Under imaginative and superb direction, the cast is superlative.  Evan Rachel Wood is a luminous Lucy' Jim Sturgess is wonderful as Jude and the support from Martin Luther, Dana Fuchs and Joe Anderson is strong.  Cameos by Joe Cocker and Bono sweeten the mix.  The music---well, what other contemporary musicians have amassed such a wide variety in style and endurance?<br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE deserved better commercial success but if you like a great musical film, this one should grace your repertoire.</p></body></html>

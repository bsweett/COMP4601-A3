<meta name="summary" content="Better than a lot of Oscar winners"></head><body><p>Joan Allen's riveting yet restrained performance lends a big assist to this dramedy about social and subruban manners circa 2005. Allen plays protagonist to Kevin Costner's antagonist in this film about divorce, bitterness, alcoholism, readjusted family life and, finally, great surprise.<br /><br />Allen plays affluent suburbanite Terry Wolfmeyer who takes to drinking and bitterness when her husband leaves home, seemingly on a permanent basis, for what she thinks is his secretary. She soons develops a friendship with neighobr Denny Davies (Kostner), a washed up old ball player) who likes to drink and has a radio talk show in Detroit. Their friendship moves in a predicatble direction that keeps the plot from being as interesting as Allen's wonderful performance.<br /><br />The film is greatly abetted by actresses playing Allen's four daughters -- Alicia Witt, Keri Russell, Erika Christensen and Evan Rachel Wood -- two of whom are out of high school and two still carrying out late adolescence. The girls' lives are also very interesting and help the viewer stay connected with the enveloping emotions of the film.<br /><br />This movie won no awards but was more interesting and rewarding than a lot of Oscar winning and nominated flicks I've seen in recent years. There is affect from "American Beauty", "Ordinary People" and "Terms of Endearment", Oscar winners to which this film readily compares. It is also more interesting and less cliche-ridden than either "Mystic River" or "Sideways".<br /><br />I think this movie would have interest for just about anyone that likes watching great multilayered acting, beautiful people, subtle comedy and/or contemporary American drama.</p></body></html>

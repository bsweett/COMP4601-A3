<meta name="summary" content="Pass the Bananas"></head><body><p>Here's a remake that is often silly, the ending is so far over the top it has skid marks, and Mark Wahlberg goes through every single scene with the same constipated grimace, yet I still had fun watching Tim Burton's version of PLANET OF THE APES.  A little technology since the 1968 original goes a long way, including some dynamic special effects, and ape makeup that looks astonishingly real.  (How does Helena Bonham Carter in full ape attire actually look good?  I dunno.) Plus Burton lets his apes monkey around; they're actually jumping and screeching and doing stuff with their feet--not to mention some intimate grooming.<br /><br />I don't know enough about the original story to know (or care) which version pays more homage; what I do know is if you can get past all the silliness (and the urge to hose down a greasy Kris Kristofferson) you will enjoy some actors mucking it up as apes, including a wickedly funny Paul Giamatti and a hulking Michael Clarke Duncan.  Tim Roth plays the villain ape in primate evil fashion, while there's even a cameo by the great Charlton Heston himself, in, irony of ironies, ape makeup.  No, PLANET OF THE APES will never make my Ten Best, yet Tim Burton's tongue-in-cheek tribute to the original is still pretty darn fun.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

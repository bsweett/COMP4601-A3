The review says "If your only option is to view a `pan & scan' version, it's best not to bother; this is a film for which the widescreen format is utterly mandatory."  Now, what they are saying without realizing it is that this movie is less a film and more a spectacle.  It's a mere Hollywood blockbuster masked over and presented as an Oscar caliber production.  I know that this is a film lauded by many and is considered one of the greatest films of all time, but in all honesty I have to say that it is a beautiful yet somewhat empty film.<br /><br />It reminds me of my feelings on `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' or even `The English Patient'.  Really though, I probably consider both of those films to be better than this one.<br /><br />The film tells of T.E. Lawrence's uniting of the Arabian tribes during his military service in World War I.  As he works with the tribes as they wage war against the Turks he begins to realize a part of himself that he didn't know before.  Sadly, he remains such an enigma that we as the audience don't ever really get to know him.<br /><br />That's my biggest issue here.  "Lawrence of Arabia' is like a really pretty painting.  It has beautiful landscapes and beautiful people, and yes, on a big screen it looks utterly amazing; but like that picture the purpose of `artist's intent' is left up to the audience to uncover alone.  It is an ambiguous journey that winds up being unfulfilling since we are given little to no real insight on who this Lawrence really is.  Peter O'Toole tries very hard, and with what he is given he delivers quite well, but in the end he cannot shed much light on this man and thus his efforts go forth unsuccessful.<br /><br />There is a story here, one of heroism, that is tackled pretty well; and there are certain moments where there is a glimmer of light on this man (especially when Lawrence admits to liking taking another man's life) but overall I feel that this film is rather empty.<br /><br />I love how some who are so devoted to this film feel the need to say that if you find this boring or don't like it then you must have the attention span of a hummingbird (direct quote there).  Truth be told, I've sat through Bergman's four hour masterpiece known as `Fanny and Alexander' as well as his six part conversation `Scenes from a Marriage' and I found it completely riveting and utterly absorbing.  Could it be that we find this boring because it is.  Boring has nothing to do with how long a film is or how loud and action filled it is.  Boring has to do with finding now emotional connection to a film.<br /><br />I found no real connection here.<br /><br />Director David Lean has received a lot of praise for his directorial efforts on this film; but I think that praise is blind and somewhat one sided.  We have to remember that directing is more than painting a pretty picture, for it is up to the director to engage the audience's emotions as well.  I said this before with regard to Minghella's work in `The English Patient' as well as Fincher's emotionally vapid work in `Benjamin Button', and recently some friends and I were discussing Mel Gibson and his lack of emotional connection in his work, most notably `Braveheart'.  These are specific cases of directors who can visually stimulate us yet fail to capture our emotions (I want to make a brief note that NORMALLY Fincher and the late Minghella are brilliant directors; these are just two cases of times when they weren't complete in their directorial efforts).  Lean falls in that category for me here.  He struggles to find a human connection and thus winds up giving us half a movie.<br /><br />It's beautiful to look at, that is for certain, but it's really nothing more than that.</p></body></html>

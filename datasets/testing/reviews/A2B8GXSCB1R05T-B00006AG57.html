<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly entertaining"></head><body><p>"The Scorpion King" is one of the most blatantly flawed films that I have ever enjoyed.  The plot is so telegraphed that the whole sum of the film can be figured out in the first few minutes.  Kelly Hu's outfits boarder on the ridiculous.  Her clothes would be better suited for a Jenna Jameson movie, and are so out of place in several of the action scenes that they elicit a chuckle.  The film is like a James Bond movie with barbarians, in this respect.  <p>And yet...I enjoyed it!  Maybe I was in the right mood for it, or maybe the director balanced that fine line between camp and drama.  Dwayne Johnson made an incredibly intelligent choice to eliminate the personality and trademarks of "The Rock" (With the exception of a quick glimpse of "The People's Eyebrow") and develop a new character.  Honestly, I think the film is carried by his personal charisma.  I would be happy to see him in more films.  Michael Clarke Duncan is woefully under used.  He is a true actor, and should have been allowed to be more than a stereotypical buddy/brute.  In an interesting twist, Steven Brand as the villain Memnon does not come close to matching The Scorpion King's mass but is a surprisingly believable threat.<p>This movie is not nearly as good as the original "Conan," but it is also not nearly as bad as the endless pile of copies that have followed it.</p></body></html>

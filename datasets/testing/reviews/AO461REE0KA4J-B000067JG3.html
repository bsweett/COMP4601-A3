<meta name="summary" content="Great DVD for family and movie buffs"></head><body><p>This DVD is pretty much a duplicate of the 30th Anniversary laserdisc edition made in '95 which contained an extensive supplement section.  Considering the laserdisc cost $120, this DVD is an extremely good  deal.<p>The movie is in widescreen format only.  Some of the extras include  an audio track carrying director's commentary alternating with  &quot;karaoke&quot; style music-only, no-singing track, the 1965 promo  documentary &quot;Salzburg Sights and Sound&quot; that runs 14 minutes, NOT  36 minutes as printed on the back of the DVD case, the 1995 re-release  promo documentary &quot;From Facts to Phenomenon&quot; that runs 86  minutes, and the extensive &quot;Gallery&quot; still-frame section that  details the making of the movie, including first-hand info such as  production memos, letters, telegrams written by the filmmakers themselves.  On nagging problem is that most of the still photos in the still-frame  section look too bright as if they were overexposed during development;  this problem didn't exist in the aforementioned laserdisc.<p>The chapter  listing printed on the included booklet has most of the chapter numbers  printed incorrectly -- chapter 8 is misprinted as chapter 7, chapter 9 as  chapter 8, and so on throughout the entire chapter listing.  I use the  chapter menu on the disc more often than the printed chapter listing, so  this is not a big problem for me.<p>DVD-ROM features include web links,  wallpapers, and a simple game where you guess the musical notes in a song.  Nothing groundbreaking here.<p>This DVD is great for family viewing,  naturally.  And it's loaded with so much extra material that it will also  satisfy hardcore movie fans  who want to know more about the movie's  background, history, anecdotes, and so on.</p></body></html>

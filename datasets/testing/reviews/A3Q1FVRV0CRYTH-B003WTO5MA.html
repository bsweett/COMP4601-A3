<meta name="summary" content="Some may balk but this remake is no joke..."></head><body><p>From the opening scenes we're assured this is going to be a horrific remake, brutal in delivery and high on the scare factor.  With almost every horror film being remade these days it would only make sense that someone would eventually tackle `The Amityville Horror' and much to my amazement this is a valiant effort.  The choppy filming adds to the air of claustrophobia and panic and keeps you paranoid over what's to happen next.  Another A+ was the cast, Reynolds blowing me away with his complex performance.  He was able to go from caring and concerned to the ultimate evil within blinks of an eye and none of it seemed forced.  He was truly terrifying.<br /><br />The film is of course based on true events.  My family actually knows a family that once lived in that house, of course years after these events, and they too experienced problems, nothing like what happened to the Lutz family, but problems none the less.  George (Ryan Reynolds) and his new bride Kathy (Melissa George) have bought and moved into the house once own by the DiFeo's just about a year after their eldest son Ronald murdered his entire family in their sleep laying claim that voices within the house told him to kill.  It's because of this very event that the Lutz's can afford the home, for no one else will take it.<br /><br />Upon moving in with their three children (all from Kathy's previous marriage) things start to turn ugly, almost immediately.  George is seeing things, their youngest daughter Chelsea (Chloe Moretz) is talking to a young girl named Jodie and Kathy is seeing a dark and disturbing change in her husband.  George is also starting to scare the kids, especially the eldest son Billy (Jesse James, the little brat from `Butterfly Effect').  As the days count down to day 28 (Ronald killed his family on the 28th day after he moved into the basement, which is where George has been working) things start to drastically get worse and the Lutz family is becoming more and more fearful of what the outcome may be.<br /><br />As everyone knows, the Lutz family flees the house on that 28th night, never to return, not even for their belongings, and upon hearing that one may think this can't be all that scary for we already know that no one dies...but it's not the prospect of death that makes this film so terrifying, it's watching what happened to the minds of those involved, watching George change right before your eyes into a monster, watching him stalk his family and try to butcher them is downright horrifying, and although it may end on a somewhat relaxed note (in that they all get away) it's not in the slightest bit a happy note, for what they went through in that house is enough to scar even the strongest of individuals.</p></body></html>

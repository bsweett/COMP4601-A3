<meta name="summary" content="Africain misery in HD DVD"></head><body><p>There are quite of lot of people out there who are not sold on Leonardo Dicaprio's acting abilites--I am not one of them.  He delivers a strong performance in this topical drama and deserved an nomination for Best Actor as well. The picture and sound in HD DVD is superb and I whole-heartedly recommend you buy this one to show off your system!! Dijmon Hounsou is also superb in this and I believe he was also nominated.  The only flaw I can see in this is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly--she has no chemistry with DiCaprio and the film could have been better without her character. Not to put down her acting ability (remember she did win for "A Beautiful Mind") but her character just wasn't really needed in this fine film at all!!  Ed Zwick's direction is on target and he captures the plight of the Africains as they are being exploited by the mercenaries and Europeans for profit.  A visual and aural feast for all you HD DVD enthusiasts!!</p></body></html>

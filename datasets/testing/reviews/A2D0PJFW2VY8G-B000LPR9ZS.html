<meta name="summary" content="One Saw too many!"></head><body><p>Having avoided watching Saw 2 for six years I finally decided to be brave and see if it was any good. While some elements were memorable it was a disappointing experience for me. Undeterred I moved onto Saw 3 and promised myself I would give it a chance. I stuck to my word and, goodness me, what an experience it was!<br /><br />Saw 3 follows on directly from its predecessor, tying up some loose ends, notably with Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) who all end up victims of Jigsaw's sadistic games. The film then switches its focus to Jigsaw's latest game. With his apprentice, Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), in tow, Jigsaw has her kidnap Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) with instructions that she must keep the bedridden Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) alive for the duration of the latest game or be killed by the intimidating collar round her neck which will fire shotgun bullets into her head! The game Jigsaw devises sees Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a father seeking vengeance for the death of his son, given the chance to face the man that killed his son, but only by completing some tests along the way. The question is can Jeff complete the game and will Lynn Denlon keep Jigsaw alive until he does?<br /><br />The main focus of the film has Jeff face the only witness to his son's death who refused to testify in court and the judge that allowed the drunk driver off lightly. Jigsaw's test for Jeff is whether he can forgive those that contributed to his grief and desire for vengeance in the present. Though Jeff is an understandably emotional and grief-stricken father he is also a bit slow when it comes to playing Jigsaw's games. No sooner has he met these faces from his past than Jigsaw's games begin with Jeff given a strict time limit before the victims are killed. Not only does he have to decide whether to forgive them, their lives are also in his hands! I was bemused at Jeff's procrastination tactics which meant even if he decided to help a victim it was already too late!<br /><br />Saw 2 upped the gore on the original and Saw 3 takes it even further. In the opening section we have the police investigating another victim of Jigsaw's who woke in a room to find numerous chains attached to his body and his only means of escape is to rip them out one by one before a bomb explodes. The opening does clear up some unanswered questions from the last film and propels Jigsaw's apprentice, Amanda, to the forefront of the story. Though she seems to house Jigsaw's meticulousness and ruthlessness in putting together the many games, there is vulnerability about Amanda that begins to have negative impacts as Saw 3 reaches its conclusion.<br /><br />Rather than gripped by Saw 3 I was left rolling my eyes and shaking my head. Jeff's story wasn't remotely engaging and even though another twist was waiting at the end it had no impact compared to the original film and, dare I say, Saw 2. The other major complaint is that writers James Wan and Leigh Whannell, who collaborated on the first film but only Whannell on the second, felt the need to reveal not only Amanda's compassion towards Jigsaw's victims but also that she helped him set up the game that takes centre stage in the original Saw, which I felt tainted the first film rather than make me want to go back and link it to the revelations in Saw 3. The first film worked so well by demonstrating the power Jigsaw had over his victims despite his debilitating illness. Even the ending to Saw, brilliantly chilling, is now somewhat redundant thanks to Saw 3.<br /><br />While I had major issues with Saw 2 it did have some good elements. Sadly I cannot say the same of Saw 3 which although gorier, lacks in a decent plot and the need to revisit events from the first film suggests a lack of ideas to me rather than ingenuity. Saw was, and still is, a great film but Saw 3 will make my next viewing of it not as pleasurable as previously, something I never thought I would say.</p></body></html>

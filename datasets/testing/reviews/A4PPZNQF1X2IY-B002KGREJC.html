I enjoyed being challenged by the rapid teen dialogue and the incredibly rich and swift pace of the film.  I loved how they explained her mother's role in her life as "she sends me cacti", that was an excellent summation of that whole relation.  Brillant bits like that instantly explained peripheral details while keeping the focus on the stories main characters.  A story that was ultimately highly hopeful as a teen (ok, so it was an uber-teen) navigates thru life.</p></body></html>

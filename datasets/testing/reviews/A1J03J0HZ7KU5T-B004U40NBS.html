However, for all its visual bravura, "Black Swan" (2010) has little resonance. The predictable screenplay is derivative of superior films such as "The Red Shoes," "All About Eve" and Aronofsky's own "The Wrestler." A fine supporting cast (Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey) and Portman's intensity sustain your interest, yet this balletic nightmare remains decidedly overrated.</p></body></html>

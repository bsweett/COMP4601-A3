<meta name="summary" content="Mann pairs Pacino & DeNiro for some "Heat""></head><body><p>After watching DeNiro & Pacino in their most recent outing, "Righteous Kill", I came to appreciate this film even more although they had more screen time in this one than in "Heat", "Heat" is still a crime classic in the Warner Bros tradition.  Each character is clearly delinerated and all the situations we see them in are compelling particularly DeNiro's and Pacino's characters--there is never a dull moment in this actioner. The supporting cast of Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Diane Venora, Tom Sizemore, and a very young Natalie Portman is excellent and of course Mann's visual style really put us in that mood of doom.  Rather than give away any details of the plot, if you're in the mood for a crime saga--check it out!!  I can't wait for the Blu-ray to appear someday. Well to update this review, I purchased the Blu-ray edition on 12/13/09 and it's definitely an improvement over the Standard Def version.  As far as the dialogue being deleted from Diane Venora's monologue--it's just a few word but noticeable.  I don't why Warners did this on the Blu-ray perhaps there should be an explanation of this.  Regardless I'm keeping my disc.</p></body></html>

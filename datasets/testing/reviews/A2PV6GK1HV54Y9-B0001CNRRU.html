<meta name="summary" content="When three lives collide."></head><body><p>21 Grams was the best film I saw in 2004. Naomi Watts is so talented, so good in every role she is in, she is remarkable to watch, she should have won the Oscar for her performance. Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are fabulous as well. The film goes out of order, non-linear so pay close attention to each scene, some scenes are cut short, some are longer to explain the story and plot better. Don't worry you will not get lost or confused, all three stories weave perfectly together halfway through the film. It is amazing how three stangers lives could all change and be affected because of one horrifying event. Intense, sad, and important film, 21 Grams will have you shaking in your boots.</p></body></html>

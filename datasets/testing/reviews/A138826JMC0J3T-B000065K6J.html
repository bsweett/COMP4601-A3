<meta name="summary" content="Final Destination"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was pretty good. Final Destination stands apart from the Screams, I Know What You Did Last Summers and Urban Legends. It's not really a teen horror movie either, I'd consider this to be a little bit of everything, Suspense, Thriller, Mystery and for lack of a better name, semi Horror.<p>On their senior class trip to France, Alex (Davon Sawa) falls aa;eep on the plane before take off and has a terrible nightmare that the plane was going to explpde. When he wakes from his nightmare, he does something that he also did in his dream and in a hysteric fit, proclaims that the plane was going to explode. This stunt gets him kicked off the plane, along with a few of his friends and his teacher. After the plan they were supposed to take takes off, it explodes. After this, the kids find out that they were more than lucky because something else had a plan for them.<p>This movie will freak you out. Plus it's also a nice step away from all those other Teen Slashers that I'm sure most of us were getting sick of. This is a very respectable movie in it's own and each scene where someone is killed, it's very unique and not, oh someone gets stabbed. <p>This is a very cool movie to own. If there was one movie out of the whole Teen Horror movie era, FINAL DESTINATION should be that one movie. Really, check out this movie. You won't be disappointed. This is a total non stop thrill ride from beginning to end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Movie, But Where Are The Extras?"></head><body><p>Along with "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", "The Breakfast Club" ranks high among the elite list of 1980s' teen comedies. Few films have portrayed the high and lows of high school any better, and its characters and plot are still relatable today.<br /><br />My complaint in my review is the dvd. Sure the sound picture quality are better than ever, but hwere are the extras? C'mon, an audio commentary by the cast and crew would've been welcomed, as would a documentary. Needless, I am a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Still, the movie is brilliant, so it's still worth owning. But c'mon, some extras would've been nice.</p></body></html>

Since at the time DC Comics had not released "Batman Begins", Marvel Comics was the only comics' distributor releasing movies, so of course their characters were the primary focus of fans.  Many began to worry with the poor performance (in movie critic's minds, that is) of "Hulk", "Daredevil", and "Elektra", would comic book movies continue to be made or would the superhero genre die out once again.  Luckily, the genre has not died, despite movie critic's most desperate wishes, and in 2005 Marvel's 'First Family of Heroes' were given the big screen treatment they deserved, and audiences were treated to a more tongue-in-cheek comic book movie, that still delivered the goods in terms of storytelling and quality.<br /><br />"Fantastic 4" is essentially the origins for this team of reluctant heroes.  Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his best friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) are attempting to persuade the extremely rich industrialist, Victor Von Doom, to fund an expedition into space to study a cosmic anomaly that is nearing Earth's orbit.  Von Doom agrees with the proviso that he and his lovely assistant/girlfriend, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), along with her hot-headed brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) are allowed to join them on their voyage into space.  Though the expedition begins pleasantly enough, except for Johnny's practical jokes on Ben, things quickly turn awry as the cosmic anomaly reaches Von Doom's space station sooner than expected and all 5 members of the expedition are bombarded with cosmic rays.  Upon their return to Earth everything appears to be normal, but then everyone begins experiencing changes in their bodies, and new powers developing.  Each member exhibits different powers, Reed has the power of elasticity, Sue gains invisibility, Johnny can control fire, and Ben becomes hard as rock.  These four out of the five member team try to learn more about the source of their new powers and possibly find a cure for them.  Meanwhile, Victor Von Doom, whose skin is slowly becoming a metallic alloy, and also has the ability to shoot electricity from his hands, is becoming increasingly distrubed and blames Reed for causing his current condition.  However, instead of finding a cure, he embraces his anger along with his power and turns on the society that has begun to shun him.  Now Reed, Ben, Sue, and Johnny must decide whether to rid themselves of their powers or join forces to battle their onetime comrade and protect humanity from his evil.<br /><br />Though not nearly as serious as "Spiderman" or "X-Men" or any of the other Marvel Comics' movies for that matter, "Fantastic 4" still gives an engaging story that can be both serious and humorous.  The casting is terrific, all of the actors perfectly embody their comic book counterparts, especially Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis.  These two actors excellently capture the constant bickering/bullying between the Human Torch and the Thing, while at the same time showing their underlying loyalty and willingness to sacrifice for one another if the need arose.  The special effects work is terrific, and it was nice to see the Thing not be computer generated like the Hulk was.  Though critics tore this movie apart and tried to convince the public it was not and could never be a big success, the box office numbers provided by fans and general movie audiences proved otherwise.<br /><br />If you enjoyed "Spiderman" or "X-Men" or any of the other comic book movies, or are just a fan of sci-fi/action movies with good storytelling, then "Fantastic 4" is a movie you should see.  However, do not watch this movie expecting to see the same level of drama as "Spiderman" and "X-Men" had, this movie is much lighter in tone, while still delivering a good story with plenty of drama mixed in.<br /><br />"Fantastic 4" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></body></html>

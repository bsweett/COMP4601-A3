<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining Indiana Jones outing"></head><body><p>"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is an entertaining Indy film.  It's no "Raiders" or even "Crusade," but it's good for what it is.  Over-the-top action, a little romance, some vaguely paranormal archeological mystery: it checked all the boxes.  Those who consider it unbelievable may want to look at the premises of the previous movies.  You have to be willing to suspend your disbelief and accept the internal logic of Indiana Jones World.  Ultimately, the film hewed to its own internal logic, moved at a decent pace, and was entertaining.<br /><br />Shia LaBoeuf takes a lot of flak from reviewers, but I thought he did a good job with the material he had to work with.  I cringed when he made his Brando-ripoff entrance, but that wasn't his fault - he didn't set up that shot, pick out his wardrobe or select a motorcycle.  Frankly, he held up well against Harrison Ford, and although I'm not keen to see a Young Indiana Jones movie with him as Indy the Third, he was fine in this movie.<br /><br />I loved Karen Allen in the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark."  She stole that movie from Harrison Ford in virtually every scene, and Marion Ravenswood was as much as part of what made "Raiders" a classic as Indiana Jones.  She was the girl next door who could also drink you and an Mongolian yak herder under the table.  But in "Crystal Skull," I don't know if it was Allen or the script, but she came across as flat and unengaging.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is at least worth a rent.  And while you're watching, ponder the fact that 5000 year old civilizations had robust technology and elaborate traps that still work 5000 years later, while you probably have a hard time getting your car to start reliably.</p></body></html>

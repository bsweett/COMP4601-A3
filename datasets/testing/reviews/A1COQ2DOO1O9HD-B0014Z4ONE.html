<meta name="summary" content="Two out of three..."></head><body><p>The most frustrating thing about Steven Spielberg is that he embodies a contradiction:  he has the skill of a great auteur but the taste of a populist hack.  When he applies his skills to "serious" films, the results are usually mixed, with potentially great material undermined by huge doses of pure sentiment.  It is as though, after inviting us to a delightful gourmet meal, he cannot resist the urge to serve corndogs and ketchup on the side, simply because he likes them.  There they sit on the fine china - reflecting in the Waterford crystal and perfectly placed silver utensils.  It's not that there's anything wrong with corndogs, per se - they just seem so out of place.<br /><br />Happily, for every Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List (almost a great film), and Amistad, there are several more Spielberg films like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and even A.I. (which, while dark, mostly avoids the usual slop of calculated "hankie moments").<p>Then there are gems like two of the three Indiana Jones movies.  The outer films of the trilogy sparkle.  They are finely honed entertainment machines that do not disappoint.  Classy, slick, fun, and elegant, they are the best damned corndogs money can buy.  They have everything to which great popular cinema aspires: adventure, romance, action, crisp dialog, and engaging characters.  The father/son dynamic of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in The Last Crusade is perfection.  It is, perhaps, the best of the three, combining the usual thrills, chills, stunts, and outlandish set-pieces with a subtextual spiritual journey that actually works.  It catches us off-guard - by treating that hoary old trope of the search for the Holy Grail as an excuse for high adventure, it unexpectedly manages to sneak in some spiritual redemption in its last few minutes.  It doesn't seem artificial or forced, either.  Given that you buy into the mythology of the film, Indiana Jones' tests of faith as he seeks to save his father's life ring perfectly true.  I dare you not to hold your breath as he steps into the abyss on his way into the grail chamber, and ponder, if briefly, whether you would have the faith and courage to do the same.  In my more devout days, I even used the three challenges Indie faces to illustrate a Sunday School lesson.<p>While I have since retreated from Devout to Doubtful (or at least, agnostic), I still get a little chill running up my spine when no less than the Wrath of God is unleashed at the end of the first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It's great stuff, too - a kind of reckless, swaggering serial-cum-action epic that never misses a step as it dances, Gene Kelley-like, through one insanely improbable situation after another.  The Nazis want the Ark of the Covenant, for its symbolic, and perhaps actual, power.  Indiana Jones wants it for his university's museum.  Will he get it before they do?  Will he escape from the escalating series of traps?  Will he rescue the girl?  Of course he will.  We know that from the first scene.  But watching how he does it all is where the fun lies. <p>The middle film of the trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, is another story.  The humor seems tinny and forced, at ruinous odds with the almost sadistically dark story of missing children forced into slave labor, and evil rituals where priests pull beating hearts out of human sacrifices before lowering them into pits of lava.  Such material would be perfectly acceptable in a certain kind of film, but clangs disastrously against the lighter tone set by its predecessor.  It's as though Clive Barker hijacked the production about a third of the way into the shoot, then gave it back to Spielberg for the last few scenes.  Kate Capshaw is stuck with the thankless task of playing a thoroughly unlikeable golddigger who somehow wins Indie's heart.  I actually found that part less believable than the whole human sacrifice schtick.<p>This DVD set is handsomely produced, with a fat selection of bonus material on the fourth disk.  It's worth the price, with the THX treatment polishing all the films to a high gloss.  As the wisdom of Meatloaf has it, in the gospel of Bat Out of Hell, "...two out of three ain't bad'."</p></body></html>

In its wake came "Alien", a film with a much darker tone, featuring characters that are actually from Earth.  Putting a twist on the monster from space story, Ridley Scott's groundbreaking film would produce three sequels (so far), as well as a fair number of imitators.  Now close to twenty-five years old, the film holds up rather well, except for some dated computer technology.  <p>Awakened from deep sleep by the ship's computer nicknamed "Mother", the crew of the transport craft Nostromo is directed to investigate the source of some radio signals, coming from a nearby planet.  A craft is sent down to the planet's surface, and a party sent to investigate.  While exploring, crewmember Kane (John Hurt), encounters some strange "egglike" objects.  A creature springs from one of the eggs and attaches itself to his face.  Kane is placed in the infirmary, and later the creature is found apparently dead.  During a meal, the alien bursts through Kane's chest, and escapes into the ship.  The tiny alien grows to larger than man size, in the space of a few hours.  The mature creature is then ready to seek out prey, and begins to reduce the size of the crew, a member or two at a time.  <p>Editing keeps the views of the creature to a minimum, and we don't actually see what happens to most of the crew, as they become victims.  Our imagination goes to work, and that can create an even deeper feeling fear.  When one of the crew is killed, all we hear is her breathing, and then a strangled scream.  Soon, only Ripley (Sigorney Weaver) and her cat Jones, are left alive.  She manages to escape the mothership just before it self-destructs, unaware that there is a stowaway aboard.  Perhaps the Alien is dazed, for it doesn't seem to be very alert or aggressive.  Ripley succeeds in ushering the creature out of the ship, and treats it to a good old-fashioned deep space barbecue.  <p>Alien takes the traditional monster tale into space.  The story is strong, and features a truly unique and frightening monster.  The Alien creature remains a mysterious terror, which cannot be defeated, only destroyed.  The setup is natural and logical, and the characters behave like real people.  An excellent screenplay keeps the level of suspense high, and the cast all deliver fine performances.  The movie contains some elements common to the horror tradition.  A group, is suddenly facing a horrible unknown danger.  There is one member willing to sacrifice the lives others (Ash), a bubblehead who panics under pressure, costing lives (Lambert), a harmless handyman type (Brett), the sacrificed leader (Dallas), and an unexpected heroine rising to the occasion (Ripley).  <p>Now to that dated computer technology.  Based on the technology of today, anyone would find the presentation in film very unrealistic, perhaps even humorous.  This is not a criticism, just an observation.  In the film, whoever has the command, has access to "Mother", apparently a room sized computer loaded with tiny lights.  This construct is obviously for atmosphere and effect only.  Who believes that a futuristic computer would occupy an entire room and use light bulbs?  Access is via a terminal with an archaic keyboard, where questions are typed in.  Text is displayed on monochromatic monitors located across the room, for "easy" viewing.  In addition there is a sound effect, like an old teletype, as the text slowly scrawls across the screen.  How very quaint!  When was the last time text actually scrolled like that on your display?  In this view of the future, they could make an android that passes for a human, but not modernize the mainframe.  <p>Just poking a little fun at a classic, so don't take offense.  Alien is great movie, and should be part of any science fiction fan's DVD collection.</p></body></html>

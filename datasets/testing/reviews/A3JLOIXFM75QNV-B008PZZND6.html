All I have to say about that is, get over it and grow up. This isn't a film about sexuality, or homosexuality. It is about 2 people, who happen to be men, who meet and grow close. Its not an explicit film, it is all done extremely well and directed beautifully and tastefully. Ang Lee is a favorite of mine, especially after Sense and Sensibility. Brokeback Mountain is easily another score for him. It really is a beautifully touching movie. I must say that at times, it frustrated me, or I should say, the characters frustated me. Everyone wants a happy ending but sometimes, Its just not possible. This is a depressing and moving film. And because of the maturity of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, its a very realistic and believable film. They really brought the characters to life and were very brave for attempting something that really wasn't attempted before in recent memory. Those actors took a risk and it worked. People will not forget this film. ***RIP Heath Ledger***</p></body></html>

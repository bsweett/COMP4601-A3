<meta name="summary" content="Love This Movie!"></head><body><p>This movie is a very odd movie but I love it because it doesn't follow that Hollywood way to make a movie.  This movie stars Winona Ryder who plays Lydia Deitz, who is very sad and depressed.  The movie is about a couple who dies and a new family moves into the house and the couple doesn't want them there because the mother wants to redecorate the house.  this movie has an all-star cast Geena Davis, Alec baldwin, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey jones, and many others.  This movie was released the 30th of March 1988.  The DVD I think could have been so much better and they could have included deleted scenes and bloopers because you know there has to be some.</p></body></html>

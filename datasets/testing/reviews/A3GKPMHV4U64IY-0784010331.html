<meta name="summary" content="What is Reality?"></head><body><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is a simple laborer (living like a wealthy guy) until he visits a place that will give him the memories of a vacation to Mars.  He pays a little extra so that he can be a spy and save the world.  But during the process it turns out that he really is an agent and they have unlocked his memories.  Suddenly he is on the run as friends and family turn out to be other than he originally thought.  A message from his former self tells him he has to go back to Mars.<br /><br />Once on Mars he is still on the run.  Here he encounters rebels trying to stop the mining concern that controls every aspect of the planet.  But while trying to save his own life and that of a previous love, Arnold discovers a Mars secret that could end the tyranny.  But in the end Arnold has to wonder is it all real or just part of the artificial vacation package he purchased.<br /><br />A pretty good film that does manage to deal with Philip K. Dick's ideas regarding the nature of reality.  I never understood how the simple laborer had such a glamorous life before the action begins but it doesn't really ruin anything.  The action is good and the effects have stood up fairly well although CGI could improve some of the facial effects.  All in all this film stands up after time and is still fun to watch.</p></body></html>

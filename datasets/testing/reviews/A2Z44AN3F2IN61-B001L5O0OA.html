It's set in the 1940s. Rather than a single, linear story, it's a series of scenes about their life in the 1940s. Did I mention that it's set in the 1940s? Argh. Obviously, the filmmakers spent a lot of time and money getting the setting just right, because they beat the audience over the head with it every chance they got. Drove me up a wall, in case you didn't notice.<br /><br />It's also got the first-person voice-overs from grown-up Ralphie. If you watched The Wonder Years, it's like that. A grown-up navel-gazing about his childhood. It's almost as entertaining as listening to someone tell you about their dreams.<br /><br />There were some amusing scenes, of course, and I even laughed aloud several times. And I really enjoyed the end. It was such a nice parent moment--that no matter how disappointing his own life was, he could still give that joy to his son.  Awwwww....<br /><br />I'd guess it would be a more appealing movie if I had an idealized view of childhood or of the 1940s (it was set in the 1940s, by the way). Unfortunately, I have neither. Or if I liked Hollywood's version of a "cute kid." I have kids. Three of them. They're cute--or were, when they were younger. I tend to find Hollywood's version of cute obnoxious and whiny.<br /><br />On the other hand, I can't agree with the (very few) negative reviews--almost all of which complained about either vulgarity or *gasp* a gun! for Christmas! *ack!*--either. It was the 1940s. Kids had guns. They had BB guns in the 1960s, too--well, the boys did, at least--I had to borrow my little brother's. And it's pretty obvious that vulgarity doesn't bother me--I give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Z4OXS">Blazing Saddles</a> 5 stars.<br /><br />I'm glad I finally saw it, but I don't think I'll be watching it again.</p></body></html>

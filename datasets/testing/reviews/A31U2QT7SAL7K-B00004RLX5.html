<meta name="summary" content="A good film coupled with some engaging extras"></head><body><p>A commercial and critical success, 1986's "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" has a simple premise: The principal crew of the starship Enterprise must travel back in time to retrieve a couple of whales in order to communicate with an alien probe that is causing climactic devastation to Earth.<br /><br />The actors, after having known their respective characters for over a quarter century (at the time of the film's production), could perform these roles blindfolded.  They immerse themselves into them and are believable, although Walter Koenig's Russian accent, as Chekow, has always been a bit forced.<br /><br />That said, the second disc is filled with something for the fan, non-fan, and the individual interested in a film's production.  Two fond tributes are offered: one on Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and another on character actor Mark Lenard ("Sarak").  On the former, Gene's son Eugene recalls times with his dad and these recollections are quite revealing and entertaining.  The latter is a loving homage to the multitalented Lenard by his surviving wife and two daughters.<br /><br />Fascinating info on the science behind the film's storyline, a "Vulcan primer," and a look at the special effects are also presented.<br /><br />But, the most "insightful" bonus is a look at "Kirk's women." Four actresses (Louise Sorel, Celeste Yarnell, Katherine Browne, and Catherine Hicks) recall what it was like to appear on the series or the theatrical films.<br /><br />They also talk about working with Shatner and Nimoy, which makes for some interesting comparisons.</p></body></html>

This movie is a little bit better than "28 Days Later" because it doesn't seem to stop in the middle of the story. The story is about a nurse named Ana, played by Sarah Polley, whose world is turned around one morning she wakes up and finds zombies everywhere. She finds a group of survivors, headed by, Kenneth, played by Ving Rhames. They go to a deserted shopping mall for shelter. Part of the group of the survivors are Michael, played by Jake Weber, Andre, played by Mekhi Phifer, and Andre's wife, Luda, played by, Inna Korobkina. When they get there, they don't receive a warm welcome by the security guards, CJ, played by, Michael Kelly, Terry, played by, Kevin Zegers, and Bart, played by, Michael Barry. More survivors start to show up. Norma, played by, Jayne Eastwood, Tucker, played by, Boyd Banks, Monica, played by, Kim Poirier, Nicole, played by, Lindy Booth, Glen, played by, R.D. Reid, Frank, played by, Matt Frewer, and Steve, played by, Ty Burrell. There is also another survivor, a gun shop owner on the roof of his gun shop store, Andy, played by, Bruce Bohne. The events that occur are very frightening, indeed. This movie is creepily interesting and powerful moving, at times. This movie is well executed, thanks, in part to its director, a first-time filmmaker, Zack Snyder, whose direction of the movie was brilliant and powerful, without compromise and this is one of the best remakes that I have ever seen, better than "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2003). The performances by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer, are excellent. The rest of the cast are great. The screenplay by James Gunn, who wrote the screenplays to "Scooby-Doo" (2002) & "Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed" (2004), did a excellent job on the screenplay, which is, a great companion to Romero's original screenplay. The music by Tyler Bates is excellent. The cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti is excellent. The make-up on the zombies by David LeRoy Anderson is brilliant and they look really convincing. The film editing by Niven Howie is great. The casting by Robin D. Cook & Joseph Middleton is great. The production design by Andrew Neskoromny and costume design by Denise Cronenberg is excellent. The movie is well executed in every way. This is what why we go to the movies for. Brilliant execution and an well done idea by Zack Snyder.</p></body></html>

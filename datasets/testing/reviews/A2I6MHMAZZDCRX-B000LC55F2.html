<meta name="summary" content="A Movie Worth Watching Closely"></head><body><p>100 years ago, there were two fledgling magicians.  Both Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the plants in an audience who help a magician with his final act.  But one night things turn deadly, leaving Robert a widower and breaking apart the two men.<br /><br />Over the years, they keep tabs on each other and try to hurt each other.  That's how Robert knows when Alfred premiers his most phenomenal trick, the transported man.  In this trick, Alfred moves from one box to another across the stage in one second flat.  Robert becomes obsessed with learning how his rival does the trick, an obsession he takes to unhealthy levels.  Who is the ultimate magician?  Will Robert learn the secret of the transported man?  What lengths will he go to attempting to get the secret?<br /><br />Frankly, that summary does the movie an injustice.  It is more a character study of the two men than anything else.  The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, yet once I got the characters established in my mind, it was very easy to follow.<br /><br />This isn't my normal light film.  In fact, it is very dark at times.  But the story is so engrossing.  I was lost in the world unsure who to root for to win.  In fact, I gave up trying to predict the outcome, and it's a good thing I did because I never would have guessed how it ended.<br /><br />The acting from every single member of the cast is great.  I can't single anyone out, that's how good it is.<br /><br />And this is definitely a movie to own.  There are so many scenes that appear to mean one thing but really mean something else that you need to watch it again.<br /><br />I am sorry I am just now watching this excellent film.  If you've missed it, go out and see it today.  I can't recommend this film highly enough.</p></body></html>

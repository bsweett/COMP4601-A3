However, Coppola's disregard for making her audience understand and feel for Marie made this movie boring and trite.  I never once felt like I could identify with any character.  All of them seemed emotionally removed from the film.  I could understand how this would play up to the characterization of the time, but it was poorly done nonetheless.<br /><br />The movie is pretentious and overdone.  It was trying too hard to be aloof and cold, yet visually stunning.  The visuals remind me of a Pleasures perfume commercial--okay for a commercial, but not so good for a movie (to see this hazy, romantic cinematography done well, try the 2005 Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley).  Understanding Marie and Louis's demise was difficult.  Understanding Marie's true feelings was also difficult.<br /><br />I did not mind the soundtrack, I actually enjoy it.  There is no better way to convey the decadence and mindlessness of the time than comparing it to the 1980s.<br /><br />It is a fun movie that should be taken lightly as a period spectacle.</p></body></html>

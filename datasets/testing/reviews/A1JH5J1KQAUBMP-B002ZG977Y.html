Some reviewers want more story, but it seems to me that the figures of Greek myth are generally at the mercy of fate and destiny, so I didn't miss the lack of motivations rooted deeply in character.  I also didn't mind the scrambling of mythology, although I wouldn't recommend this movie as a source for college students trying to crank out a term paper on Greek myths at the last minute.  I didn't even mind Perseus's buzzcut in a world where everyone else (even some of the women) have beards and long hair.  At least it's easy to pick him out of a crowd.  The giant scorpions, the Medusa, the harpies, and the Kraken all looked great and the action was exciting enough to keep me happily shoveling popcorn into my mouth.<br /><br />BTW, I elected to see the film in 2D since I had read some bad reviews of the murky look of the film after the last minute decision to switch it to 3D.  "Avatar" demonstrated that 3D technology has finally arrived and is worth the extra bucks when done right.  However, too many Hollywood productions trying to jump onto the bandwagon with substandard product may make moviegoers think twice about paying higher ticket prices.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Life In A World War II Japanese Prison Camp"></head><body><p>THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is one of my favorite war movies. It is a story about life in a World War II Japanese prison camp situated in a Burmese jungle. The screenplay is actually an adaptation from an anti-war novel by Pierre Brouille. The main thrust of the film is the duel of wills between the commanding officer (Sessue Hayakawa) of the camp and the commander (Alec Guinness) of the British prisoners.<p>The production is marked by strong acting performances by Guinness and Hayakawa. William Holden plays the part of an American escapee who leads a band of commandos back to blow up a bridge which is being constructed by the prisoners. Holden is his usual competent self. Jack Hawkins is another respected actor in the cast.<p>Sessue Hayakawa began making American films in 1914 but spent his World War II years in Japan. The movie's theme song whistled by the prisoners on the way to work on the bridge became a popular recording during the late 1950's.<p>THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI received several Academy Awards including best actor by Guinness. Hayakawa was also nominated for best supporting actor. Some other awards were for best picture, director, screenplay and cinematography.</p></body></html>

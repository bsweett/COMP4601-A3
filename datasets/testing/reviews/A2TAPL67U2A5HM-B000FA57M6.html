<meta name="summary" content="Doom (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Doom (Unrated Widescreen Edition)~ Karl Urban is an alright shoot them up movie with an alright plot. The special effects are quite good. The acting on the other hand is terrible and the Rock acts like he went to hollywood upstairs acting school. I love the doom cam that we get in the end and I wish somehow that the movie would have played alot more like the computer game (which I love). The music is alright but it sounds like the generic shoot them up grunge metal and is not all that inspiring. Still and all this is an adequate shoot them up movie that should not be missed.

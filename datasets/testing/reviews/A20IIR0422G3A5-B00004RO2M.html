<meta name="summary" content="One of Kubrick's best. Buy It."></head><body><p>`Full Metal Jacket', coauthored, produced, and directed by Stanley Kubrick may very well be the great director's second best film, after `2001, A Space Odyssey'.<br /><br />The conventional wisdom at the time of the film's release in 1987 is that it was ? of a great film and ? of a good film. Until I recently viewed this DVD, I complacently thought the first half on the Marine training camp on Paris Island, South Carolina was the `great' half and the second half in Vietnam during the Tet offensive was the `good' half. Now, I am not so sure.<br /><br />Most of my new doubt arises from Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as the clueless recruit nicknamed `Gomer Pyle'. I may be seeing this performance in a new light as Mr. D'Onofrio is now a prominent face as an actor in one of the `Law & Order' incarnations where he ably plays a much different sort of role. When I pair this performance with that of Jack Nicholson in `The Shining', I see a common weakness arising from the two actors' giving away the game in their expressions several scenes before their climaxes. In the case of Nicholson, it is almost a full two acts before the story tips its hand. Up until now, I wrote this off as Jack being Jack rather than a result of Kubrick's direction. But now, when I match these two performances up with those of Stirling Hayden and George C. Scott in `Dr. Strangelove', I begin to see a definite pattern of overacting in Kubrick's lead actors, whether it be in comedy, horror, or drama.<br /><br />Another reason for lowering the stock of the Paris Island act is the fact that the central character here, the lead drill instructor, is played by Lee Ermey, who was actually a Marine drill instructor and who served as the technical consultant on the film. Ermey, in the part which would make his career from then on, could probably have played this part in his sleep. I would not be too surprised if I did not actually contribute to a lot of the dialogue, if not literally improvise it on the spot.<br /><br />A third reason for valuing the second half of the movie is the fact that the Vietnam action is so open-ended in comparison to the Paris Island story. There is just so much you can show about Marine trainees and their drill instructors, without going off the reservation. And, with Kubrick's penchant for realism in most things, he is definitely not going off the reservation in this situation.<br /><br />The second half of the movie is largely owned by Matthew Modine (Joker), one of the recruits graduated at the end of the first half, and Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother), he of the `thousand yard stare' who manages to fire a belt fed machine gun while standing and cradling the weapon in his arms. If the recoil doesn't make this improbable, then the overheating of the barrel surely does. But there is none of the overacting which tipped the director's hand in Act I.<br /><br />For the longest time, I felt a disconnect between Act I and Act II, but now the connection between the two halves has become much clearer for me. Act II depicts Marines in combat. Act I shows the kind of training which lead to that combat under fire. And, the most salient aspect of that training is the message that `...Marines are meant to kill, and even if they die, the Corp will live forever...'.<br /><br />It's noteworthy that one of the collaborators in the writing of this movie is Michael Herr, the author of `Dispatches', who also is listed as a co-author of that other great Vietnam era movie, `Apocalypse Now'. Herr's contribution of realism to two relatively surreal movies may be why these two films are well remembered to this day and Acadamy Award winner, `Platoon' has fallen to second string status, except for the cachet obtained by winning the Oscar for best picture.<br /><br />Kubrick's DVDs, like those of Woody Allen, have few extras. And, my favorite, a commentary soundtrack by the director is no longer possible, but, unlike `2001', this movie has relatively few obscure scenes. The only puzzle may be the several visual and auditory allusions to Mickey Mouse.<br /><br />Oddly enough, my take on Kubrick actors' overacting suddenly raises my opinion of `Eyes Wide Shut', where the principals are so low key, you hardly notice that they are acting at all.<br /><br />This is easily in my top 10 favorite war pictures and possibly my favorite Kubrick flick to watch on DVD.</p></body></html>

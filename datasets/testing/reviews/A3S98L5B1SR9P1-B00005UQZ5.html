<meta name="summary" content="The Fugitive (1993)"></head><body><p>Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford), convicted of killing his wife Helen, on his way to be executed in Southern Illinois, has a lucky bus accident and escapes to a hospital. Enter Sam Gerard (Jones), who literally steals the show with his flip one-liners throughout the film: My my my...what a mess; We got a gopher; Richard, do you wanna get shot?!; S.o.b. our boy came home, etc. Gerard hounds Kimble ruthlessly all the way back home to Chicago. The scenes that stand out are the start of the chase, the tunnel standoff, the encounter at the hotel. Richard finds a one-armed man killed Helen and breaks into his apartment to find more dirt and encounters him on the el-train en route to confront the mastermind of the murder, his best friend Dr. Charles Nichols. A clever man, Richard eludes Sam and his lawmen by hiding out in child molester apt. and posing as an Hispanic janitor doing medical work. Clearly the best action movie of the 1990s, as excellent acting portrayals by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.</p></body></html>

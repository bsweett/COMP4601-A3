<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Evelyn Salt, Mindless Entertainment"></head><body><p>Director Philip Noyce and star Angelina Jolie, the pair who gave us a thriller "The Bone Collector" back in 1999, team up again for "Salt," action thriller about Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent on the run, accused of being a Russian spy. To make my review short and not to spoil anything about the film, I can only say is that the fast-paced and action-packed thriller, penned by Kurt Wimmer ("The Recruit"), keeps you guessing until the end, though you may notice lots of plot holes when you leave the theater, or even before.<br /><br />This is not to say the film is bad. "Salt" delivers goods with Angelina Jolie as the titular character, who remains a mystery from the very start (the film begins with a sequence set in North Korea, slightly reminiscent of one James Bond film). In fact some parts of the film remind us of James Bond or Jason Bourne films, but Jolie lends energy (if not credibility) to the convoluted storyline, which looks sometimes dated with the heroine's back story and these inevitable "villains." Or maybe we should call it old-fashioned.<br /><br />"Salt" is mindless fun with lots of actions. The action set-pieces including chases and shoot-outs are all well-done though some of them stretch credibility to the point where Salt looks almost superhuman (never afraid of ricocheting bullets). But Bond and Bourne are also superhuman, so why not Evelyn Salt?</p></body></html>

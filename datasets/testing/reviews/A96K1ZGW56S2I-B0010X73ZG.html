Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) notices the strange mist moving across the lake and though it seems unusual, it doesn't seem to concern him much.  He goes into town with his son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), and their next door neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) to pick up a few supplies from the local supermarket.  Everything appears normal.  Then Dave and others in the store notice police cars, firetrucks, and military vehicles driving down the main road in front of the story at high speeds.  Soon sirens ring out and an older man runs into the store yelling that there is "something in the mist."  The doors of the store are closed just as the strange mist that Dave saw earlier on the lake covers everything outside.  Screams are heard, the power goes out, and the earth shakes.  No one knows for sure what's exactly outside in the mist, but the few people that leave the store to check things out aren't seen from again.  The store has emergency generators, but they begin acting up.  Dave and a few other volunteers try to fix the generator and soon discover that there are monsters in the mist.  Those in the store begin dividing into different factions.  There's those like Dave, who though nervous and frightened, keep their wits about them and try to figure out the best course of action.  Then there are others like Brent who decides that action needs to be taken immediately and leave the store.  There are many who aren't sure what's going on.  Then there's Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Wallace) an eccentric woman who proclaims that the mist has been sent by God to cleanse the Earth in preparation for the final days.  Some of what Mrs. Carmody says is reasonable, but her self-righteousness minus any compassion and mercy turn her into an apocalyptic cult leader.  One by one those in the store succumb to Mrs. Carmody's cult-preaching, proving that what's happening inside the store may just be far more deadly than anything out in the mist.<br /><br />THE MIST is an adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King short story.  Darabont wrote the script, directed, and co-produced THE MIST.  I really like Darabont as a director.  I have a friend who once said that if Darabont only directed five or six movies in his life, it would be enough because each of his films is so well-crafted.  THE MIST is Darabont's fourth film and if he continues his pace, he probably only will direct five or six films in his life.  But, that's okay.<br />THE MIST is almost a perfect adaptation of Stephen King's original story, with a few slight changes.<br /><br />Mrs. Carmody.  It may have just been me, but it seemed like Mrs. Carmody was more than just a kooky lady with some eccentric religious beliefs who becomes caught up in a sacrificial fever. Instead, it seemed to me that Darabont was using her character to vilify anyone who has religious beliefs.  For instance, there were a couple of times when she would say something that I would agree with, but I found myself shuddering because her statements were not backed by her actions.<br /><br />However, Mrs. Carmody's portrayal is minor compared to the one huge alteration.  King's story is ambiguous and no one knows what happens to the characters but the story ends in "hope".  I guess that ending didn't satisfy Darabont because he took King's story and extended the ending and turns the hopeful ending into one of the bleakest and darkest endings I have ever seen in a movie.  Darabont still remains one of my favorite directors, but it does make me wonder if Darabont, whose previous films were ones filled with hope, compassion, and faith (THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, and THE MAJESTIC), is taking his career in a different direction.<br /><br />Overall, THE MIST is a monster movie filled with psychological horror and an ending so bleak it might just make you sick.  For a bit a trivia, be sure to notice THE GUNSLINGER poster that Dave is painting at the beginning of the movie.</p></body></html>

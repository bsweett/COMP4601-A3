<meta name="summary" content="A COMPELLING BUT PAINFUL FILM TO WATCH"></head><body><p>ABOUT THE SUPERBIT EDITION: SOUNDS/LOOKS GREAT BUT-NO SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: IN 'CLOSER' LOVE IS A ROUGH ROAD!<br /><br />This film is a bit hard to take and watch, but at the same time draws the viewer in and won't let go. The film begins with the four protagonists; Julia Roberts as Anna the recently divorced photographer, Jude Law as Dan the obit-writer/ wanna-be-novelist, Natalie Portman as Alice, the nice girl that is a stripper, and Clive Owen as Doctor Larry, the skin doctor in more ways than one, clearly identified. Just what possessed these people to act so very needy and clingy, both before and after, bouts of cruel, devious, and fickle emotional tirades, is beyond me. However, that is at the heart of this fine work of filmmaking and the reason to see it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: BE FOREWARNED THIS IS A VERY SAD STORY<br /><br />If the four characters were flawed, the men seemed more obviously so than the women. I'm not sure if that is the way it really was, or just the way I perceived it. Nevertheless, it seemed to me as though two essentially nice girls with issues, and in need of nurturing became absorbed by two rather self-centered cads with a penchant for treating women, like less than dirt. It was not until the end that the real flaws in the women's characters' became obvious, especially in Alice, who had played a misunderstood fallen angel for most of the film. Nevertheless, both Julia Roberts as Anna and Natalie Portman as Alice were excellent in their roles. Jude Law was a contemptible cad, albiet - well acted, but Clive Owen was nothing short of a self-proclaimed 'cave-man' with a stated double standard for himself. Maybe that means Clive Owen should be honored for his performance, but it frankly just turned me off - period, and made the film harder to believe.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Sci-Fi Classic"></head><body><p>This film is a true science fiction classic.  When it was first released in 1977, it competed with Star Wars as one of the top films of the year.  Richard Dreyfus stars as Ray Neary, a man who  suddeenly begins to have visions and hear voices.  Terri Garr stars as Dreyfus' wife.  Finally, Ray's visions begin to take strange turns, and he ends up constructing a model of Devil's Tower in his living room.  By this time, his wife and children have left him.  Meanwhile, odd occurances are happening all over the world.  A flight of Navy torpedo bombers missing since 1945 suddenly shows up in Mexico in almost brand new condition, and a ship is found in the middle of the Gobi Desert.  The voices finally lead Ray and others to Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  There, a large spaceship lands with people that have been missing for years, including the pilots of the torpedo bombers.<p>This movie is loaded with special effects which were excellent for their time, and it still remains one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  All sci-fi fans should watch this excellent movie.</p></body></html>

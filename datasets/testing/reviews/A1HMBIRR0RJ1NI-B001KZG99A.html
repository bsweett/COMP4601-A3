<meta name="summary" content="The Man of Iron!"></head><body><p>4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Slam bang, rip roaring, old school comic book hero movie, that's "Iron Man! The purest of comic book movies, who has a message, but does not overburden the audience with to much emotional baggage.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is "Iron Man," he may be the brightest acting star of his generation, as he can play almost any part, & he plays the wealthy industrialist, swashbuckling, chick magnet, Tony Stark to perfection, with a wink of his eye! Jeff Bridges, who is also one of the greatest actors of his generation, plays the double dealing, money hungry, evil surrogate father figure, Obadiah Stane, of Tony Stark, with malicious glee, as he plans to take Tony's inventions & sell them to both sides of the fence. Tony's personal aid/secretary, Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow) is perfect in her role as the faithful secretary, that is thinly disguises that she is in love with her boss. She is vulnerable, yet ready to take control of any situation that is bestowed on her with total competence. These three actors make "Iron Man," sturdily solid, great popcorn entertainment for those who want to escape for a couple of hours in their lives!<br /><br />Recommended to everyone who loves a thrill ride of a film, with a great confrontational finale!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Zombie masterpiece"></head><body><p>Rob Zombie has filled a pop-culture horror void with The Devils' Rejects. Zombie presents horror with a message -- Captain Spaulding's psychotic, cannibalistic brood hearkens back to Tobe Hooper's maniacal Brady Bunch from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Beneath the unremitting violence and gore are serious questions about society, family and justice. Stylistically The Devil's Rejects also hearkens back to cult films like Electra Glide in Blue. The Devil's Rejects is recommended with one caveat: NOT for children or sensitive adults. The violence is off the chart and the humor is definitely sick.</p></body></html>

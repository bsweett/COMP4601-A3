<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps the highest-quality horror film ever produced (details)"></head><body><p>Yes, this is clearly a somewhat toned-down horror flick but, WOW! I haven't seen much to compare with this outstanding film, in any movie genre, for ages. While it's much shorter and a different sort of story, I think that this production stands equal in quality to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>, and that is a huge compliment.<br /><br />In fact, if you have previously enjoyed either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000797E7">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a> (which is the "white-knuckle" version of the most famous of all Sherlock Holmes entries), or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305609330">Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles</a>, (the magnificent cinematography version), then you will clearly love "Sleepy Hollow."<br /><br />THE STORY: This yarn springboards from Washington Irving's compelling tale of terror, the companion work to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00221Q2TS">Rip Van Winkle</a> from this Classic American author's famous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0766184900">The Sketch Book</a>. In the case of the film, a youthful and naive New York City constable (Ichabod Crane) is directed north to a New England Dutch settlement where a series of murders has begun to generate chaos in the community -- the year is 1799, only about twenty years after the American Revolution. The first nuance of the murders which Ichabod encounters is that all the killings have been effected by decapitation. The locals are sold on the idea that the perpetrator is nothing short of a terrifying headless horseman (artfully played by a deranged-looking Christopher Walken), purportedly a ghost of a Hessian soldier, but Ichabod is a man of science and he initially asserts that the headless horseman yarn is ludicrous. But Ichabod's scientific approach quickly gives way to his tormented imagination... especially when subsequent murders ensue.<br /><br />This is a terrifying mystery thriller of the First Water, directed by Tim Burton. The screenwriting (Kevin Yagher) is incredibly compelling, the cinematography is magnificent, the locations (mostly in England) are magical, the filmscore compositions (Danny Elfman) are faultlessly appropriate, and the acting is superb. Johnny Depp as Ichabod (at least for the purpose of this particular film version) amounted to flawless casting. I was also very pleased to see the great Christopher Lee (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009TB5G">The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>), in this film however briefly it may have been.<br /><br />Viewers should prepare for a long sitting as the running time is 105 minutes -- but there is never any drag and the action is both tasteful (for the genre) and non-stop. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1, a presentation of enhanced widescreen (16:9).<br /><br />In summary, this Oscar-winning 1999 film is one that you won't want to pass by. I was not in the least surprised to discover that it was produced by the renowned and talented Francis Ford Coppola, (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286S38">Dementia 13</a>.) The film is rated R due to one mild and brief sexual scene as well as for the violence and the gore of the numerous heads which bounce wide-eyed along the ground after they are separated by sword and by axe from their terror-stricken hosts. I'm normally not a big fan of contemporary movies but, in this rare instance, I award "Sleepy Hollow" my most enthusiastic and very highest five-star recommendation.<br /><br />REVISION: (4/10) If you loved this film as much as I did you'll likely also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064LJVE">The Village (Widescreen Vista Series)</a>.</p></body></html>

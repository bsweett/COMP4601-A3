<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies ever made...."></head><body><p>The story revolves around Sgt. Raymond Shaw ( Laurence Harvey). He has just come back from the war a Medal of Honor winner for saving the lives of his platoon. He is a hero in everyone's eyes from the men in his platoon, to the general public. All except his commanding officer Col. Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra). Marco is suffering from nightmares involving the entire platoon being captured by the Red Chinese and being subject to sadistic mind control experiments, where Raymond is trained as a top assasin. Marco tries to convince the Army that the Medal of Honor was just a front and that Shaw is a deadly killer. However, they also love Raymond and refuse to believe what Marco is saying. Now it is up to Marco alone, to stop Raymond before it is too late. Stop him before he has a chance to play a &quot;little game of solitare&quot;. <p>The performances in this film are phenomenal. Lawrence Harvey is outstanding as Raymond Shaw. We see two sides to the character. The first being Raymond himself who can prove to be a great guy, a jerk, and a nervous wreck all in one. The second is the cold, calculated assasin. Both are done equally well. Frank Sinatra is without a doubt one of the true American legends. Major Bennet Marco is without a doubt the best role that he ever played. I love the struggle of one man against many to prove the truth. This is Sinatra's fight for the whole film. Janet Leigh did a nice job as Sinatra's love interest. John Gregory gives the film's funniest role with Senator John Iselin. He is the puppet and Angela Lansbury is the puppeteer. He does whatever she says. It is hilarious. The best performance of the film, and one of the best I have ever seen period, was given by Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Iselin. One of the most evil and coniving women that I have ever seen in a movie. A truly unforgettable performance. What makes the role so good, is that she is Raymond's mother. <p>&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is the most suspenseful film that I have ever seen. I think the thing that impresses me the most is the fact that the film still holds up extremely well, despite the fact that it was made over 40 years ago. The story itself is amazing. The topic of mind control provides for paranoia, conspiracy, and overall terror and suspense. One of the most chilling phrases that I have ever heard was &quot;How about a nice game of solitare.&quot; The film also provides for tons of action as well. If you are a person who loves suspense, you cannot go wrong with this film. Mind control, government conspiracy, and the fight of one man against many are all woven together to create a well rounded story, and the actors all give the performances of their careers. The DVD is very affordable and offers an interview with Frank Sinatra, and the director John Frankenheimer.</p></body></html>

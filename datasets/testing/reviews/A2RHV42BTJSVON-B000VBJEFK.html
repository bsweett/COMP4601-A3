<meta name="summary" content="Ratatouille: Not Pixar's best..."></head><body><p>NOTE:  This is a a review/analysis, so it goes a little more in-depth than most of my reviews.<br /><br />  Even though this may be Pixar's weakest film (I will explain why later), it is still miles ahead of most other animated films that have been released in the last five years.  I love Pixar's movies, especially "Cars", "Finding Nemo", and "Toy Story", and I also love rats, I have had one as a pet for the last four years.  So, what kept me from truly enjoying this film?<br /><br />  There is nothing fundementally wrong with this film, it is a feast to the eyes.  The film is so beautiful visually, it looks like it isn't even animated most of the time.  It is certainly a treat to see Paris depicted in this film, it is just georgeous, especailly the shots that are done at night time.  Even the lead rat Remy and his furry rat friends look quite realistic.<br /><br />  The story is engaging enough, it is about a rat named Remy who has an exceptional gift for smell and tasting food.  He desires to be a chef after he sees the chef Gusteau on a cooking show, and struggles to develop this gift while the rest of his family is ignorant and misunderstanding of his gift.  After the colony gets chased out of their house, Remmy winds up in Paris at Gusteau's old resturant and runs into  Linquini, a hapless young man who just started as the Dishwasher at Gusteau's.  Of course they form a bond, and help and hurt eachother throughout the course of the movie as they discover who they are.<br /><br />  The main problem I have with this film is the character development.  As far as Remy goes, I just do not see him treating Linquini the way he does towards the end of the film, and vice versa with Linquini.  They are both depicted as people who found each other and truly care about one another, but needlessly hurt each other still.  At the same time this could be interpreted as human frailty, but that is just not what the movie is about.  If they would have just stuck to the main point that anyone can achieve their dreams, then it would have been a better movie.  The end of the movie and the way the food critic Anton Ego turned around was very improbable to me because of the character that was developed throughout the movie.<br /><br />  Again, this is an extremely enjoyable film, but it was just hard to truly enjoy a movie that humanizes animals so strongly.  I love movies like "Babe" and "Charlotte's Web", but this one just seemed to take it a step too far.  It blurs the lines between humans and animals and puts them on the same level as us.  So, in spite of these flaws, it is still leaps and bounds ahead of other animated films that have come out lately, it is just not up to Pixar's normal quality.<br /><br />  God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Film Like Nothing You've Seen"></head><body><p>This is a film that goes way beyond the horror genre for which  it has been labeled with so many other monster movie offerings.  It is an exploration of faith, a complex struggle of good versus evil that stems from the conflicts that are present in each of our lives, combined with a theology lesson and the belief in something greater than ourselves.  Ultimately, it is an exploration of the worst kind of horror, the horror that exists in the belief that for every good, there is an evil, and to that end, that even the ultimate good has an ultimate darkness lieing in its shadow.<p>This film, based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, and directed by William Friedkin, is the story of two priests and a family living in Georgetown University, just outside Washington D.C.  Blatty, who wrote the novel and screenplay, based the story of a child's possession by the devil on actual events that he had read about many years before writing the Exorcist.  <p>The story begins with an elderly priest, Father Merrin, who is working as a missionary in Iraq.  A former exorcist, Merrin is confronted by a vision of the demon and is given a premonition of events that will unfold later.<p>The story continues in counterpoint, introducing us to Father Damien Karras, a young, Italian priest whose mother is dieing of poverty.  A student at Georgetown University, and the psychiatrist on the staff of Saint Michaels, Karras's faith is shaken when his mother dies while in the custody of a sanitarium for the poor and impoverished.<p>The other half of this counterpoint is the story of Regan, daughter of movie-star Chris MacNeil, who is at Georgetown University filming a student-rights movie.  They rent a home on the campus, and while they live there, Regan begins to refer to an invisible friend who she refers to as &quot;Captain Howdy&quot;.  As the story progresses, Regans disposition begins to change.  She starts complaining of headaches, and has outbursts that are completely uncharacteristic of her, and before long, all that see her begin to believe she is either medically insane, or possessed.<p>Chris MacNeil implores the help of Father Karras to aid her in exorcising her daughter.  Uncertain what to do, Karras turns to the head of his order and seeks the assistance of Merrin, who has since returned from Iraq.<p>The story works on a number of levels.  The visual experience of the film is horrifying, as Regan is transformed from an innocent little girl into the demon that possesses her.  The film is dark, graphic and often very disturbing in its imagery.  But what makes this film far more frightening than the visual images is the psychological effect it has on its viewer.  This movie transcends the screen, and plays out like a literary work, giving incredible depth to each of its characters, making them very believable and easy to relate to.  <p>By the end of the story, the movie examines everything from the power of faith, to the power of darkness, and leave the viewer with an experience that will effect them to their very soul.<p>The DVD edition of this film contains many extras, including interviews with the director of the film and the author of the original novel (who himself was a Georgetown student).  It also contains footage that has never been seen in earlier releases of this work.  The film is controversal, and still one of the most disturbing pieces of all time.  It is an important film, and not one to be taken lightly.  <p>Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

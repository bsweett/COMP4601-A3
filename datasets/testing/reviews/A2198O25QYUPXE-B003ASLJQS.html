<meta name="summary" content="The risk of assumptions"></head><body><p>Mystic River is a scintillating film that reassures the viewer to feel certain, and suddenly wallops this secure belief with startling revelations. Loyalties and objectivity are tested in the narrative of this movie, which concludes with assumptions as the cause of devastating miscalculations. A fantastic film!<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

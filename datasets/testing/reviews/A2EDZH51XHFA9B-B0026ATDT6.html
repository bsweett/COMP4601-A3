I probably lost that idea in the many, many comparisons that have been made to Jaws (which make no sense at all to me). All the hyperbole ("one of the greatest monster movies ever made!") aside, however, The Host is an amusing little flick, certainly capable of holding a viewer's attention for a couple of hours.<br /><br />The plot: after a number of toxic chemicals were ordered dumped into the Han River by a neglectful army higher-up (this part of the story, by the way, actually happened, though no giant monsters have yet cropped up), something very large and very hungry started growing in the Han River. One day, it wakes up and decides it's hungry-- and my, don't those folks on the shore look appetizing? So it goes to have itself a meal, and takes a snack for later-- Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Il in her first screen role). Her father, Gang-du (Lady Vengenace's Kang-ho Song), pursues the monster to no avail. Later, at the memorial service for the monster's victims, Gang-Du, his siblings Nam-joo (Linda Linda Linda's Du-na Bae, who's rapidly becoming Korea's It Girl) and Nam-il (Hae-il Park, recently of Memories of Murder), and his father Hie-bong (The Scent of Chrysanthemums' Hie-bong Byeon), into custody... after which they get a frantic call from Hyun-seo, who's still alive and hiding in the creature's lair. The family must escape custody and find Hyun-seo, helped and hindered by any number of odd characters. And, of course, the monster itself.<br /><br />Forget Juno-- The Host is the little movie that could. Nominated for seven Grand Bells (the Korean Oscars, essentially) including Best Film, it won two (Best Director and Best Editing), and estimates say that almost 20% of South Korea's entire population went to see the movie in theaters. Once it got out, it went on a festival rampage, taking awards at the Saturns, the Asia-Pacific Film Festival, the Asian Awards, and Fantasporto, among others. Needless to say, it also shattered South Korean box office records, taking in over ten billion (yes, with a B) won during its theatrical run. (To put it in perspective, that's about ten and a half million bucks... on six hundred seventeen screens.) But you have to ask yourself, given that the unbearably awful Titanic is still the top-grossing movie in American history, whether it's any good.<br /><br />And it is. The script is sharp, the acting is dynamic (and very tight; many of these performers have worked together on multiple movies in the past), the creature effects are some of the best I've seen in recent years. It's not a great film, by any means; it's a simple, straightforward monster movie that's got some added depth with the family angle-- but it's a lot of fun, and it's a movie that does stand up very well to rewatching, mostly because it's predictable without being boring and/or stupid. Fun! ***</p></body></html>

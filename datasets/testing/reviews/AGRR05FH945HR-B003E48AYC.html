<meta name="summary" content="Something is going to happen..."></head><body><p>So sayeth The White Queen, who was experiencing time backwards, but what 'happens' in this movie is a little hit and miss.<br /><br />When it works, it works well, and some of the casting, especially of Depp and Hathaway, was inspired.<br /><br />The story is, as usual, a blend of the two books, with the added re-entrant twist that an adult Alice is returning to Wonderland/Underland. The special effects are well done, although I hated the enlarged head that Burton gave to Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen. She is a beautiful, classically-trained actress and the absurd distortion serves only to irritate and distract.<br /><br />The final Joan of Arc-style battle against the Jabberwock at least lifts the movie towards the end, before shambling back into the sterile, over-stereotyped garden party.<br /><br />For me, it fell well short of what it should have been, despite some solid performances. If you are going to effectively rewrite/extend the Alice saga, what is the point in stopping short of REALLY rebuilding the story arc, and taking it onto another level?<br /><br />The four stars are for Bonham Carter, Depp and Hathaway, who all injected their otherworldly magic into a movie that was barely worthy of their talent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, some flaws"></head><body><p>Great fight scenes<br /><br />The movie looks as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and sounds as good as (the soundtrack is excellent) Crouching  Tiger but something is missing.  I think its just the simple fact that most audiences in North America don't know much about the unification of China and don't care much about the unification of China.<br /><br />Personally, while I liked the movie a lot the simple factor really cut down on my ability to care for the characters<br /><br />DVD-Got some great features but I still felt a little short changed, good thing this was a rental.</p></body></html>

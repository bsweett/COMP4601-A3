Rick, an American expatriate, runs a caf&eacute; (with gambling in a backroom). This operation is protected by the local Chief of Police. The first funny scene is where Victor Laszlo, wanted by the Gestapo, appears under his own name! Then he is introduced to the Nazi chief! All so polite (can you believe it?) Rick is said to be on the blacklist, with a price on his head. How did he not just escape, but wind up with a caf&eacute;? I suggest Rick made a deal with the authorities, and works as a high-grade informer. Its not an accident that Yugartes is arrested after he shows up at Rick's and confesses. Rick has knocked around way too much to be so sentimental in Paris. The question is whether the Laszlos will be able to escape to Lisbon, and then to America, with the transit papers. Those German soldiers sing "Wacht am Rhein", a 19th century nationalist song. "Watch on the Rhine" was a stage play and a later film.<br /><br />Conrad Veidt portrays the top Nazi with ominous overtones and underplayed evil. Rick shows sentimentality with the Bulgarian couple; was this just a whim or some sort of pay-off to explain a large sum of money? Victor Laszlo escapes from an underground meeting. Wouldn't he be under constant surveillance? There is a surprise ending. Rick double-crosses Louis to let Victor and Ilsa leave. The foggy night creates atmosphere (is fog possible in the desert?). Major Strosser arrives, but somehow lacks his usual retinue and pays dearly for his mistake. [Believable? It echoes the fate of Heydrich.] The real scandal is not that Rick and Louis run off together to join the Free French. It is that nobody escaped from the concentration camps of the Gestapo unless they were turned into double agents. This suggests Victor is now a Nazi agent (read some of the post WW 2 books)! The efficient British counter-intelligence would soon deal with him. Or could Rick really be a triple agent, who uses Louis' affection to escape to Allied territory after effecting the escape of Victor and Ilsa?<br /><br />The charm of this film seems to be its classic restraint and understatement with its stilted language. It has unity of time, place, and action. The film is fast-paced and tightly edited. The Hollywood Production Code supported the happy ending where Victor and Ilsa's marriage continued after their hardships. The cleverness of this film is how it layers sentimentality over a rude reality, like some old-fashioned fairy tale that has different meanings for children and for adults I think the happiness of the performers shows in their stage presence. Many were refugees from Nazi Europe. This makes it a better film than "Citizen Kane" and its cynical performers. One flaw is the story of exit visas which cannot be canceled; no government would do that. 'Force majeure' trumps a piece of paper.<br /><br />[The book "Round Up the Usual Suspects" tells about the making of this film, whose story transcended the usual money-making entertainment.]</p></body></html>

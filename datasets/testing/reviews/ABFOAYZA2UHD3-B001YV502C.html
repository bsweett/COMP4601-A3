<meta name="summary" content="great movie"></head><body><p>it touched me and made me think of all the children we, as human race, take for granted, don't care for and abuse.<br /><br />children are miracle, and joy, and should be cared for lest they be taken away from us.<br /><br />sometimes i do think god would be better off wiping us out by another plague or, as in this movie, by worldwide sterility.<br /><br />if we are not able to care for children of the world, they should be taken away from us, and with them our hope, our future, our joy of life.<br /><br />excellent direction and cast notwithstanding, the power of this movie is in the fact that it made me think, it made me cry, and it made me care even more. it made me care to the point of being determined to do something for children of men we see in the news hungry, maimed, abandones, abused, sold, exploited.<br /><br />we can and should, as race, take care of our children.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HUMANS WORST NIGHTMARE REVEALED!!"></head><body><p>night of the living dead is a creepfest for real. i hardly think anybody can watch it and not be a little spooked, or chilled. especially back in the day when it first came out. this has got to be one of my top favorites, no doubt. it's exceptional a one of a kind masterpiece just about. up there right along with the exorcist. this is the original, black and white touch just to add to that level of fear for you. i don't think even george a. romero knew how big this was going to get. he made a name for himself and is always thought about when these kinds of movies are talked about. one of the top directors ever. great job, and got to give the man credit. so, what would you do if all of a sudden one day the dead begin to walk? where would you be, and would you even think it possible? well, in this film that's what it's all about. for some damn reason all the dead start looking for fresh flesh to eat. about these people who find refuge in a farm house to try to get through the night, but as the night passes by there's more and more of these dead people out there. they smell living, and they won't stop till they get them. which in turn makes the six people in the house start to panic, paranoia steps in, and the fear of death and the thought of being on someone elses menu makes them crazy. the zombies are so lifelike and creepy. it's so good, that you welcome the scare it delivers. it's hella good cause you just can't believe it's happening. the blood and guts. from the opening scene at the cemetary all the way to the end, just when you though it was safe to come out. the actors themselves were very believable and that in turns makes the movie all the better. lots of props because films like this are so hard to find. night of the living dead is good for any night.</p></body></html>

Also several moments of genuine tenderness as well as natural hilarity. As ably directed by Nancy Meyers whose previous work in What Women Want is also first-rate, the cast is excellent and  Diane Keaton's Academy Award nomination for best actress (as Erica Barry) in a leading role was well-deserved. I also expected a nomination for Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn. The supporting cast is also fine, notably Frances McDormand (Zoe Barry) and Keanu Reeves (Julian Mercer). The core situation is that the wealthy and charming Harry is dating (at least for the moment) Erica's daughter Marin (Amanda Peet) and accompanies her for a weekend in the Hamptons where her divorcee mother (a successful playwright) has a lovely oceanside home. Of course, Erica and her sister Zoe appear unexpectedly. <p>As a result of his hedonistic lifestyle, Harry suffers a heart attack unrelated to Erica. After emergency care by Julian, he is released but must reside nearby during the recovery period. Guess where? Of course, he and Erica fall in love. Meanwhile, prior to Harry's appearance in his life, Julian had become strongly attracted to Erica...not to her daughter. Apparently she has had no romance in her life since the divorce and is currently hard at work on a new play which is not going very well. Harry eventually becomes well enough to return to Manhattan. And then....<p>Eventually, both Harry and Erica must make very difficult choices. It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to explain what those decisions prove to be. However, I feel free to say that the decisions are juxtaposed very effectively with various humorous incidents, a few of which are featured in the trailer shown in theaters. Yes, this is a comedy but it also has some attitude. On occasion, an edge. There are implications to the lives which the two seniors have led, prior to their meeting. The resolutions of various conflicts (both major and minor) are entirely plausible, except -- in my opinion -- for one which involves Erica and Julian. See this entertaining, sometimes serious film and then reach your own conclusions.  <p>The special features provided with the DVD include a "Commentary" by director Nancy Meyers, producer Bruce Brock, and actress Diane Keaton, another "Commentary" by director Nancy Meyers and actor Jack Nicholson, a "Hamptons House Set Tour" with Amanda Peet, and "Harry Sings Karaoke to Erica" (a deleted scene).  For whatever reasons, Keaton chose not to contribute much but Nicholson did and, as always, is charming, articulate, and generous. Contrary to his persona in so many films, Nicholson is renowned among his film colleagues for the same endearing qualities which are evident in one of the commentaries.</p></body></html>

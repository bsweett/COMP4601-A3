<meta name="summary" content="Well, technically speaking, the operation is brain damage"></head><body><p>In every script that Charlie Kaufman writes there always seems to be a very twisted mind game as the premise; and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no exception. Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) have just gone through a messy break up. Clementine, being rather impulsive (to say the least), undergoes a pseudo medical treatment to erase all memories of Joel Barish, so she can get on with her life. Joel discovers what she has done and opts for the same treatment. Somehow, in sifting through their memories, they rediscover what made them fall in love in the first place. Herein lays the twisted mind game that Kaufman is so fond of. Joel and Clementine must battle the memory erasers to hold onto each other, and the battle royale is all taking place inside Joel's head.<br /><br />Kaufman is aided and abetted here by director Michel Gondry -- a visual genius. He realizes Kaufman's vision with a variety of special effects, like forced perspective and stop action. Nothing computer generated here, it is all done with clever manipulation of the camera. Michel has really brought Charlie's nutso ideas to life, and no matter how far fetched, it all has the gritty look and feel of reality.<br /><br />In a role reversal, you could say that Kate Winslet is playing the Jim Carrey part, while Jim is rather reserved and understated -- the usual sort of Winslet role. Joel, always with three days of stubble on his face, pours his feelings into a diary and whimsical sketches rather than blabbing them out loud. Joel Barish is a projection of Charlie Kaufman, and I can really see him in Jim Carrey's introverted character creation. Who issued the restraining order?<br /><br />There is also a lot of underground cartoonist Robert Crumb in Barish, and some of the scenes where Joel is reliving his childhood could have been lifted directly from Crumb's comic book memoirs. Joel is reading an R. Crumb comic in one scene.<br /><br />-------------<br />Clementine: What are you, NUTS?<br />Joel: It's been suggested.<br />=====================<br /><br />But Joel keeps all his craziness locked inside, whereas Clementine spills it out for all to see. She dyes her hair crazy colors, like Blue Ruin or Agent Orange, and it all matches her clothes -- and the drinks she mixes. She is high maintenance to the max, and she tells him so in no uncertain terms. Soon after meeting she has Joel breaking and entering.<br /><br />---------<br />Clementine: Look, I'm sorry if I came off a little nutso, I'm not really.<br />Joel: That's okay; I really didn't think you were.<br />===================<br /><br />Joel is always very polite and nice, and nice is something that Clementine hates -- or at least she thinks she does, until Joel starts to grow on her. Clementine pushes Joel to experience life to the fullest, to get out of his shell. Clementine has Joel out on thin ice -- figuratively and literally. They are laying together out on the frozen River Charles, a central metaphor of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Joel: I could die right now, Clem. I'm just... happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.<br />=============================================<br /><br />Carrey and Winslet make a great team, with Carrey letting Winslet carry the film, while Jim is the anchor. Kate Winslet is spectacular here. I enjoyed her here much more than watching her go down on the Titanic.<br /><br />Also contributing to the success of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as Stan and Patrick, the technicians who perform the memory erasing procedure; Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the inventor of the technique; and Kirsten Dunst as Mary the receptionist. Stan and Patrick are The Two Stooges of pseudo medical procedures, and Dr. Howard has a suitably reassuring bedside manner -- but you wonder just whose bedside he's been at. "Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard. Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard."<br /><br />--------------------<br />Joel: Is there any risk of brain damage?<br />Dr. Howard Mierzwiak: Well, technically speaking, the operation is brain damage, but it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.<br />================================<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is also on a par with a night of heavy drinking -- just as much fun but without the hangover, regrets, or DUIs. Though the plot is convoluted, the viewer should have no problem following it. The visual story telling style of director Michel Gondry really pulls you in. Repeated viewings will no doubt reward with additional revelations. Kate Winslet, Jim Carrey, and the rest of the cast really give it their all. It is a very funny film that also has a lot to say about the nature of love, memory, and how much we need each other, even if we are all a little crazy.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Clementine: You know me, I'm impulsive.<br />Joel: That's what I love about you.<br />==================================================<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P3SA8K">Synecdoche New York</a> (2008) (written by Charlie Kaufman)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLJIQ">The Reader</a> (2008) ....

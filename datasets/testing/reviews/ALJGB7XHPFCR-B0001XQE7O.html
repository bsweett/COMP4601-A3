In that way he becomes immortal. Big Fish is a story about storytelling, about embracing the magic of existence, and the art of telling tall tales, even if they are true. This is a wonderful movie and it's life filled to overflowing with more life than life itself. I loved every minute of it.  I watched this movie because it was Directed by Tim Burton, I had no idea what it was about, but I heard it was very good.  The first part of this movie was a fun heartwarming set of tall tales, intertwined with a son angry at his father for allways telling them and never letting him know the real truth. I thought it was a good movie 4 out of 5 stars or so. Then the ending.  I wasn't ready for the movie to end, but I have to say this is the best ending I've ever seen in a movie. The way in which the story brings the son around and shows us why and how his father's stories work is fantastic. I'm watching as circus freaks are waving at an old man and I'm tearing up. Only Tim Burton could cause me those emotions at those images. 5 stars.</p></body></html>

He has found a way to clone dinosaurs.  He's thought of all the controls to keep the population in check and the dangerous ones under control.<br /><br />Unfortunately, his investors aren't sure that the park is safe.  So, before he can open it, he has to bring in dinosaur experts Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to sign off on the park.<br /><br />The three are admittedly impressed by what they see, especially Alan and Ellie.  But the wonder soon turns to horror when security goes down, freeing the creatures.  Suddenly, the group finds themselves stranded on an island in a storm fighting to survive these creatures from the past.  Will any of them make it off the island alive?<br /><br />This movie was one of the first to use computer effects, and it revolutionized the industry.  Frankly, these effects still hold up even today.  You'll really believe that these people are interacting with the dinosaurs.<br /><br />The biggest weakness is the story.  It starts out very slowly while the science is explained.  There's lots of talking in the first hour.  Once the dinosaurs get loose, the movie kicks into high gear and becomes an edge of your seat thrill ride.  It doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, I still get knots in my stomach during most of these scenes.  Unfortunately, the climax is again weaker then it could have been.<br /><br />I have never understood why this movie was marketed at kids with fast food tie-ins and action figures.  This isn't a kid's film.  It's downright scary for at least half the length.<br /><br />Despite the weaknesses in the story, this is still a well deserved classic.  If you haven't seen it, you're in for a heart pumping thrill ride.</p></body></html>

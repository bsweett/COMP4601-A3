For those that hasn't experience HD (high def), this movie is an eye opener to what HD can do! When Frances McDormand was talking to Charlize Theron (white robe scene), the color was so beautiful, it just stood out very much.  Now, I'm not saying this is the best movie with story wise, but as for picture, this is a great piece of DEMO to show what HD is like!  This is an awesome movie! Charlize is very cool!  If you are into this HD format era, this is a movie to get, in fact i would even go as far as saying is as close a King Kong in HD.  This movie is a must have, you won't be upset with the purchase with story and picture wise!  Mesmerizing!!</p></body></html>

You don't watch a Hollywood film expecting a documentary. If you want a 9/11 documentary, tune into Discovery or History Channel. In Hollywood, you watch a good story play out on the silver screen. You're taken to another place and time then left to use your Personal Computer to do research that will help you separate fact from fiction. (or do like I said and watch Discovery Channel!)<br /><br />This story stays very close to the truth of 9/11. It stays very true to the danger, the heartache and the tragedy of the day. And it ends very triumphantly, which is the purpose. It is what can best be termed historical fiction. It's based in fact, much like Titanic was, (even features real people, much like Wyatt Earp or what have you) but contains events that have been stretched, strained, morphed, adapted, edited and deleted.<br /><br />It's called a movie!<br /><br />I believe this movie was very well done and stayed very close to the feel of the day. When it's all said and done, that's what a HOLLYWOOD product should do.<br /><br />I have to tell you that I'm clausterphobic and this movie really got to me. I truly felt like I was in that small cramped space with them. I felt the building fall down. I felt the urgency, the fear, the sadness. I wasn't in NY on 9/11, but boy I sure felt like I was while watching this movie.<br /><br />And like another person said, if we watched this movie and "Flight 93" every day, maybe we'd remember who the real enemy is.</p></body></html>

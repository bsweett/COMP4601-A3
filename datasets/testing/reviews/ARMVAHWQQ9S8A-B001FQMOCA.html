The mannerisms, the facial expression, the way he held his guitar and hunched his head over, while grinning--perfect.  Reese Witherspoon is beautiful as June Carter, and the two of them together constantly steal the show from each other.  It must also be said that both of these actors use their own voices for the songs, and that's saying a lot because the music in this movie is amazing.<br /><br />The story, the music, the progression of the events is very well done.  One, upon watching the movie, is totally immersed in Mr. Cash's world.  They feel what he feels, see what he sees.  This two hour movie takes us through the past, on an amazing trip in Johnny Cash's shoes as he walks the line.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></body></html>

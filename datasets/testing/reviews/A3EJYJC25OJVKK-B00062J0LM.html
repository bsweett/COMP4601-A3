<meta name="summary" content="Really creepy but very well done summer flick!"></head><body><p>This summer thriller entitled &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a really scary but also really well executed update of the 1960s original version of the novel. Featuring a stellar cast of Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington, and Jon Voight.<br /><br /> Denzel Washington is the center actor in this movie playing a horribly scarred Gulf War veteran who returned home from the war in Iraq in 1991 after liberating Kuwait from the Iraqi forces of Saddam Hussein. More than a decade later, he has been having recurring nightmares about the memories of what really happened during his time in Kuwait and he beleives that he was the subject of a medical experiment where a medical device is implanted in the brain to brainwash the subject and use them for sinister purposes. The devices are the products of a corporation called Manchuria Inc.<br /><br /> However noone believes him except a friend who was also a veteran of the Gulf War. Now he must convince his friend not to run for president of the United States but his mother is a power-hungry individual who 'cares' deeply for her son but isn't exactly what she is thought to be.<br /><br /> This movie is really chilling and really delivers the scares through it's suspenseful tone and the frightening portray of what it's like if criminal corporations actually brainwash their victims to cover-up lies, crimes, and other horrific deeds. The acting is superb by most and the directing is excellent. One of the scenes was very hard to stomach however but overall, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a thriller worth seeing on the big screen.</p></body></html>

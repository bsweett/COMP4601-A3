<meta name="summary" content="GRACE BEAUTY AND LOVE"></head><body><p>In its original foreign  theatrical release, MARCH OF THE PENGIUNS was a French film with a soundtrack that voiced the first-person feelings and thoughts of the titular birds.  For U.S. release, it was wisely re-cut and a new, simpler audio track with a poetic narration by Morgan Freeman was recorded.<br /><br />Under the harshest imaginable conditions, the lowly but noble Emperor penguins successfully live lives that reflect the most fundamental of human concerns.  Especially moving is the powerful image of a community literally huddled together to create warmth when the temperature approaches 100 degrees below zero with winds of 80 miles per hour.<br /><br />Breathtaking photography underscores the life passages that include choosing a mate, breeding, birth and the complexities of parenting.<br /><br />These sturdy and brave creatures live lives of grace and beauty and love. To think otherwise is not giving them their due.  They are living examples of what it means to make a commitment and stick to it.  Endurance and perseverance are apparently a natural part of their essence.<br /><br /> If you crave more things Penguin, check out PENGUINS UNDER SIEGE, shot in hi-def, it's the untold story of South Africa's Blackfoot penguins.</p></body></html>

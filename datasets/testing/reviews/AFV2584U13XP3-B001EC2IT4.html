<meta name="summary" content="A Wacky Entertaining Look At The Afterlife"></head><body><p>If this is what the afterlife is going to be like then I guess it won't be so bad when it's my time though gotta stay away from anyone like Beetlejuice.  Tim Burton movies are an a acquired taste while entertaining then do sometimes seem a little out there though that's what makes these movies so entertaining in the first place. The cast are great in this movie as they all seem to give a 110% into their characters and while for obvious reasons some of the effects will seem dated they will still make you give a laugh as y see the hijinx of Beetlejuice in action.  I do advise new comers to try and watch a trailer or clip though as while many especially fans greatly appreciate the movie it might not be for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well deserved R rating for this suspense-thriller"></head><body><p>First, let me say the R rating for this film is well deserved.  Give me a few sentences to compose my thoughts and try to avoid potential spoilers this early in the review and I'll explain my reasoning behind that statement.  (I hate when reviewers give away spoilers without warning, especially when they needn't do so, so I really do try to avoid that myself.)<br /><br />I guess I'll start with a quick run-down of the trailers/opening advertisements for this disc.  First up, a trailer for the 2010 version of The Crazies.  The best part of that portion/segment, the haunting Andrews/Jules cover of the song Mad World (also used as a theme in the advertising for the Xbox 360 game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A4MTGS">Gears of War (2-Disc Edition)</a>).  Ok, I know, that's just my opinion, but I do love that version of the song.  Actually, with Timothy Olyphant starring in this new version of The Crazies, I might actually be interested in watching it when it's out later.<br /><br />Next up an ad for the George Clooney/Ewan McGregor film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECMAE">The Men Who Stare At Goats</a>.  I do want to catch that one when I get a chance.<br /><br />Michael Moore's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030Y11XS">Capitalism: A Love Story</a> gets the 3rd slot.  Pass on that one for me.<br /><br />And finally, well, no not the feature/main menu yet, there's an ad for the new Starz! series Spartacus: Blood and Sand.  Plenty of sex and blood ooozing from the ad for that one (but no, that's still not why I would say this film deserved the R rating.  It might be why the preview might, but it's not why the film does).<br /><br />Ok, finally we're at the main menu for the disc.  Here's where you may encounter a few spoilers for this film, but given how long it took me to get here, please don't say you weren't warned.  Again, the following thoughts and comments are highly likely to contain spoilers for the film or at least provide several clear clues as to what to expect from the film.  If you don't want to know in advance, then don't continue reading here.<br /><br />Once we're finally at the main menu we get the pleasure of hitting start to begin playing the 109 minute feature film.  It starts off friendly enough.  Daddy/Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is busy working on some electronic item while daughter is busy making bracelets and necklaces.  Mommy is off somewhere else in the house but fusses at daddy to answer the door when someone comes knocking.  Apparently no one told the stars of the film in advance that this was going to be this kind of film and that they shouldn't have answered the door.  (Apparently the family was too cheap to put a peep hole in the door, or have a dog to help protect the family, or other similar things.)  Before you know it daddy is near death while mommy is on the floor dieing in front of him and daughter is about to be severely harmed.  We're spared the actual gore for that event, as we find ourselves seeing hotshot prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) talking to a co-worker about their respective careers.<br /><br />We find out that Rice has a stellar conviction rate that he doesn't want to endanger by going to trial on a case that he could potentially lose.  Rather than blow a possible conviction he decides that he's going to plea bargain with one of Shelton's killers.  By making the deal he guarantees that one of the killers will face a death sentence with the other getting a lighter sentence for his cooperation.  Never mind that the killer that is getting the lighter sentence is the worse of the two (and is the one that actually did the killing), the justice system being what it is, Rice takes the bird in the hand and is left to tell Shelton that this is the best he can do.  Shelton is, of course, unhappy with this as he expected justice, but if he got it, well we'd have no movie, would we?<br /><br />10 years later Rice is in attendance when killer #1 (actually, he was killer #2, but who cares, right?) is having his death sentence carried out.  Killer gives a short speech noting that as god as his witness, he didn't do it, and then the system goes to work.  Except, well, from that point on nothing goes as Rice would expect.  The Killer has his sentence carried out, but rather than being a quiet, peaceful death, cruel and unusual punishment is the order of the day.  Someone must have tampered with the equipment, but who could have or would have done such a thing?<br /><br />Soon killer #2 (who was really killer #1) is getting a phone call tipping him off that the police are about to catch him on a third strike that would have him going to jail for a long time.  He starts running away immediately but gets another call that helps point him towards freedom.  Or so he thinks.  It's not long before we find him stretched out on a table about to meet the star of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> films.  THIS WOULD BE THE PART THAT CLEARLY DESERVES THE R-RATING!<br /><br />Rice continues investigating and assumes that Shelton has taken revenge, though Shelton seems to ready to admit his guilt immediately.  Just as Rice is about to take his confession and run with it, Shelton reminds him that Rice has nothing even close to the legal standard that would be required to get a conviction.  Soon enough both men are in court with Rice asking the judge to keep Shelton in jail rather than released on bond.  Soon we're seeing a scene that reminded me of the Kirkland (Al Pacino) character's great blow-up in the film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053UIE">...And Justice For All</a>.<br /><br />I'll stop the summary here, but note that I could note similarities between elements of say the TV series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FKO3GW">Prison Break - Season One</a>, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TODCII">Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)</a> and several other films (and books, TV shows, etc.)<br /><br />In the end I though the film was fine, but really nothing special enough to leave me sad at the thought of missing it.  I'm glad that I got to see it, but wouldn't run out to spend a bunch of my disposable income on this one.  Go with on-demand if possible so you can save a little of your movie buying budget.</p></body></html>

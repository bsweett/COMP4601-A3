<meta name="summary" content="An Entertaining Film in the Shadow of &quot;Ocean's Eleven.&quot;"></head><body><p>"The Italian Job," in many ways, seems to remind me of a sequel to "Ocean's Eleven."  Get together an interesting, big name cast and assign them each a specialization.  Launch this talented group of individuals into a world of immense action and crime in which the cops and authority seem to hold no place-the battle is purely between the "good" bad guys and the "bad" bad guys.  I enjoyed this film, but not as much as "Ocean's Eleven" or even "Sneakers"-another film with a somewhat similar premise.  <p>Although I don't think I'm as harsh as some others have commented, I wasn't particularly impressed with the acting in this film.  I was expecting more from Edward Norton, but perhaps the role just didn't allow for anything.  The action sequences in this film are good and I was particularly impressed with the helicopter scene-the flying is incredibly difficult to pull off and, as the special features inform us, was not added with computer graphics.  The special features on this disc are not anything special.  I watched all of the little short documentaries on the various aspects of the film.  While they are interesting and provide some insight into the making of the film, there really isn't a whole lot to say about a pure action film.  <p>While it's not as good as "Ocean's Eleven," the film is still worth a look if you're interested in those types of movies.  Grab some popcorn, turn off your brain, and enjoy little Mini-Coopers drive around the screen.</p></body></html>

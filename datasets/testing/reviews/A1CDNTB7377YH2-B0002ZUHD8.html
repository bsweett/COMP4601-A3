<meta name="summary" content="Good Battle Scenes"></head><body><p>This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be.  Though I always thought of King Arthur as belonging to a later period, this movie does a decent job of capturing a much earlier period in history where Rome still ruled most of Europe.<br /><br />Arthur and his men had been promised to be allowed to retire from "military" life are called back for one more mission.  They need to rescue a nobel held captive.  Though none of them want to do it, the knights loyal to Arthur will do it just to stand by him one more time.<br /><br />The battle scenes are epic, reminicient of some of the battles from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The forest people are incredibly interesting and I wish the movie could have expanded on them more.<br /><br />Though this movie may not be suited for a "sequel," a prequel would definately be great.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great and emotionally devastating war flick"></head><body><p>I have to confess that I wasn't quite prepared for this film. I was expecting something at least decent, but instead saw what I believe to be one of the best war films that I have ever seen.<p>This is the latest in a string of films that attempts to make the combat sequences as accurate and as life like as possible. I have read a number of books about wars, warfare, and battle, and in them one constantly reads about the amount of smoke that there is on a battlefield. Most films take cinematic liberties, however, making the battlefield as clear as possible in order that the viewer can follow the action. In WE WERE SOLDIERS, however, much of the battle takes place is an artificial fog. <p>One of the best things about this film, as opposed to other battle films, is that you get to see how the battle looked from both sides. The Vietnamese are not presented as faceless, almost inhuman forces as in most films, but we get to see them as human beings, and their own strategy and tactics are displayed. One shot in particular stood out for me. A Vietnamese soldier pauses in the hollowed out part of a tree, breathing hard, changing the clip on his rifle, and then putting on the bayonet. Then, he stands for a second, battling his fear, before forcing himself to move from cover and attack. You can probably count the number of war films on one hand that would have portrayed the enemy in such a human light.<p>The film as a whole, despite containing some very intense battle sequences, is as concerned to focus on the human dimension as much as the military. This may be the most purely emotional war film that I have ever seen. It is also filled with many individuals acts of moral courage, such as when Col. Moore's wife demands that the cab company deliver all the telegram's from the war department to her instead of the individual wives, telegram's that informed them of their husbands' deaths. <p>The cast was, for the most part, excellent. Mel Gibson was as solid as usual. Barry Pepper was marvelous as reporter (and real life book co-author) Joey Galloway. I wonder why we don't see more of him. He has been thoroughly enjoyable in everything I have seen him in. Sam Eliott has always been on of my favorites, and he stood out in this one as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley. <p>A very good movie, and while I would caution that it is very, very violent, and graphically so, I would also urge anyone who has been putting this one off, to give it a try. I think they will be moved and astonished.</p></body></html>

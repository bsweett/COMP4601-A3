<meta name="summary" content="Good thriller"></head><body><p>Well told thriller about corporate lawyers and what they do to protect their clients. George Clooney plays a guy you kind of root for, even though he's doing the devil's work, just because he does it so well and so smooth. Even he doesn't like what he does, but he knows that this is his place in life. Until, of course, events occur that make him re-assess himself, and he struggles with the answers. Well acted, and really well directed.</p></body></html>

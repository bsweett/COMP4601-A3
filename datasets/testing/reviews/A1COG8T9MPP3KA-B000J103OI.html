<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Streep delivers"></head><body><p>Ok I give it 3 1/2 stars. Totally predictable film. But charming in its own way. The character "Andrea" reminds me of Audrey Hepburn. Say what you want about Meryl Streep but she totally is great here, and you forget it is even Meryl Streep and believe she is the hard biting career driven woman that she portrays in the film. It also makes one think about ambition versus love. However, the "other lover" storyline was totally unnecessary and who would leave their cutie pie boyfriend for that self centered monster?</p></body></html>

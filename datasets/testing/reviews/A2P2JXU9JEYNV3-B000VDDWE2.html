"The Day After Tomorrow" was done by the same crew who brought you "Independence Day".<br /><br /> Well, it's July 5th, and all h**l is breaking loose.<br />It all starts with the Larsen "B" ice shelf breaking up and falling into the Ocean (which was a real event, I might add). What happens from here, is best described as pure fiction (Science Fiction?).<br /><br />Baseball-size hail in Japan, snow in India, tornadoes in Los Angeles, Helicopters freezing in flight above Scotland and a 100+feet storm surge in Manhattan. I think the only thing missing was fish and frogs raining from the sky in Kansas! All this leads up to three "superstorms" that signal the beginning of the new Ice Age.<br /><br />Much time is given in the film to it's actors explaining away these occurrences, with Dennis Quaid leading the charge to think proactively, to protect the citizenry of the U.S. (it seems our government is only interested in money-WOW! big surprise, there!) The dramatization of the characters seems superfluous at times, with dialog that's just banal enough to put one to sleep. All the actors in this film make brave attempts to lend credibility to the story, but just can't get past the weather, which is the real star of this film.<br /><br />The crazy weather IS interesting, though, especially when the choppers froze in mid air. The guy flash-freezing at the hatch of his helicopter is pretty good, and where better than Los Angeles, to get the "Wizard of Oz" treatment! Manhattan always seems to get the brunt of damage in disaster flicks, and one wonders why it's still standing!<br /><br />It might seem that I'm bashing this film. On the contrary, there IS one thing that saves this film, and it happens to be my favorite part. It's when the "new" President of what's left of The United States gets in front of TV cameras and microphones, and ADMITS his fault in the handling of the disaster! I love it!!<br /><br />The Scientific Community essentially dismissed this film outright, because of it's most glaring errors- The weather. Some said it was an "overly severe" example of the coming of the next Ice Age. Some even went so far as to say that many of the anomalies would not even occur! While I'm no scientist or meteorologist, "The Day After Tomorrow" is a pretty good example of "Escapist Reality"!<br /><br />Some of the extras are interesting. There is a breakdown of the sound elements of a specific scene in the film, the usual deleted scenes, and commentary tracks. The Making-of segment is accessed by DVD-ROM.</p></body></html>

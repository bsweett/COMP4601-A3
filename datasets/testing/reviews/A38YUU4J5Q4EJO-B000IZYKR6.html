<meta name="summary" content="Edge of your seat chiller"></head><body><p>I was not expecting this movie to be so GOOD, but was I ever surprised!<br /><br />Excellent acting all the way across the board, too.<br /><br />This story is about the revenge of a young girl, against a pedophile who she believes has taken advantage of young women by raping, molesting, and even murdering one girl.<br /><br />By acting like a young, sweet, and innocent girl in a chat room, she lures this man to his apartment, and once there, and drugged, and with no one around to hear him- The games begin!!!<br /><br />This young girl is such an excellent actress, she had me believing for a minute that this was not a movie!! and the games continue, until the shocking climax of the movie...<br /><br />There is a casteration scene on his kitchen table that you will never forget.<br /><br />Although not the best movie I ever saw, this is way at the top of my list!<br /><br />I have wondered why this movie is called "Hard Candy" and I think it is because, to a pedophile, this young girl is as they say 'Eye candy' - Candy for the eyes, Yet she is wise and tough and hard beyond her years, therefore : Hard Candy.<br /><br />Highly reccomended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Meet The Idiots?"></head><body><p>So the world watched this film and loved it(the box office records convey that) I somehow never watched this in the theater and a lot of friends and family said it's really funny.Mind you,I thought Meet the parents was a good film.<br /><br />I respect Robert Di Nero for some brilliant films like "Casino" and not to forget the mafia perfect film "Goodfellas" He's getting old and I'm sorry it feels sad to see him play a character as ineffective and out of place as what he plays in MTF. His character in Meet The Parents was better lined but in "Meet The Fockers" he seems to try hard to be taken seriously.He still remains one of my favourite actor. I just hope no more future "meet the ____" movies come up.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is about as irritating as they come.It's quite apparent how unintelligently inclined his pretentious over the moon happy character is.There is absolutely no story and the humor seems rather bland and highly exaggerated. I have  a bit of a humor going around but this is the classic case of befooling the audience.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS DVD<br /><br />I can't recall one scene in the film I remotely enjoyed. I'm sorry,hollywood. You can definitely do better. Watch "Harold and Kumar go to white castle" for something better enacted and glorified.</p></body></html>

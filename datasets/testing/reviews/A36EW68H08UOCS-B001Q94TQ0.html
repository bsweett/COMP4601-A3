<meta name="summary" content="Oscar-Nominated Performance by Catalina Sandino Moreno"></head><body><p>What type of performance would it take for a teenage girl in a Spanish-speaking film debut to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress?  This type.<br /><br />Catalina Sandino Moreno flames the screen as the resourceful and practical Maria.  This character makes some difficult choices - some would say the "badness" that occurs to these young women are only just desserts, but Joshua Marton's film does an excellent job of portraying the type of desperate poverty in Columbia that would make a young woman consider desperate choices.  Maria is working in a warehouse stripping thorns from roses that are being shipped overseas when she meets a young braggart who introduces her to men who are smuggling heroin into the U.S. by packaging them into horse-pill pellets, wrapping them in the fingers of latex gloves, then having "mules" carry them into the U.S. in their digestive tract. Maria flies over along with 4 other "mules" with over 60 of these heroin death-pills in her belly.  If one breaks, death seems a certainty.  Tension mounts palpably - will a pellet break and kill one of the girls?  Will U.S. Customs catch one who arrives on an expensive flight from Colombia with little visible means of support?<br /><br />The supporting characters are fleshed out as well as the story needs - but the film is carried on the able talents of Moreno.  Not recommended for those squeamish about a movie where considerable time is spent depicting desperate young people in illegal and morally questionable activities.</p></body></html>

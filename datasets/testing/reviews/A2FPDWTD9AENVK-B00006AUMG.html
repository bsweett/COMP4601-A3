<meta name="summary" content="Blade 2"></head><body><p>BLADE 2 kicks off shortly following the events of the original, this time teaming The Daywalker with a unit of highly trained vampire mercenaries who have enlisted his aid in order to destroy a common foe. These mutant "Reapers" are an evolved breed of vampires that hunt both humans and bloodsuckers alike, posing a huge threat to both species. Guillermo Del Toro steps in for Stephen Norrington this round, bringing with him a slicker look, even more fast-paced action, and a ton of bloody gore. Goyer has also eliminated the cheesier elements and over the top dialog that bogged down his first script. The success of the original allowed for a greatly expanded budget, which Del Toro has poured in to the elaborate set designs and improved FX. The Reapers benefit most from these upgrades, possessing excellent make-up work that crosses the eerie rat-like features of Max Schreck's Count Orlok with the deadly mandibles of The Predator. BLADE 2 is one of the rare series sequels that outdoes the original on every level, making it the strongest of the three films.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></body></html>

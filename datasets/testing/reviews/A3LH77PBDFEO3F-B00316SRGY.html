<meta name="summary" content="What is a good man?"></head><body><p>A local talk show host here in Bakersfield (Ralph Bailey), who happens to be an African American, and a moderate conservative, often says something to the affect of "Folks born before WWII get a pass for saying "knucklehead" racial epitaphs because they lived through the era of segregation an the Civil Rights movement. However, those of us born in or after the "Baby Boom" should have learned better by now. We had the benefit of growing up watching shows like "All in the Family", and "Sanford & Son" to poke vicious satire at bigoted thinking, and so we hope at least to have moved on.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a great film that gives us some great lessons in dramatic form. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a man from that earlier generation and he throws epithets out without ever thinking there is anything wrong with it. He hits white ethnicities as much as he does people of color, and it was weird for me to remember that there was a time when speaking like that was common.<br /><br />But here's the thing, Walt is a good man, prejudiced perhaps but still a good man. Walt is forced to consider his racism when he unwillingly gets to know his neighbors. When he asks his young lady neighbor why her people came to America, she explains that her people (the Hmong), fought in alliance with the USA in the Vietnam war, and when America quit, they left the Hmong high and dry, and would be slaughtered if they stayed behind. It seemed to me to click a connection in Walt's brain, then he began the friendship that became closer than family to him.<br /><br />In "Gran Torino", Eastwood continues to swing his message away from violent solutions in his films. This is probably my favorite after the "Unforgiven", of Eastwood's films promoting this message. It is a thoughtful, well written, well acted and well directed film. That really surprised me in the end.<br /><br />One of the best films I've seen in a while!<br /><br />5*<br /><br />Now there is a missed opportunity however, not with the film, but rather with the DVD, There was a great chance to do some documentary work on the change of demographics in American Culture as well as a specific opportunity for some history about the role of the Hmong in the Viet Nam War. Instead there are some rather banal pieces about America's love affair with the Automobile. My first car was a '73 Gran Torino, so if anyone should have liked what they did, it might have been me, but I seldom watch DVD extras, and I still think they missed a great chance to do some more good with this excellent movie.</p></body></html>

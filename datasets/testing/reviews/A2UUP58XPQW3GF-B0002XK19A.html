<meta name="summary" content="Extended cut reviewed, period!"></head><body><p>SPIDER-MAN 2 is arguably the best comic book action movie ever made. When I saw it in the theaters, I said: "wow"!!I was already satisfied with the original cut and now with Spider man 3 in the horizon, Marvel is coming out with 2.1. Luckily, I managed to see my friend's  sampler.<br /><br />Forget everything else when you watch this extended cut and it's outstanding. The extra 8 minutes of footage add context, lengthen and deepen some emotional scenes, inject the funniest moment of the film and (surprisingly) add and extend fight scenes.<br /><br />From what I can tell, almost all the deleted scenes are incorporated in. The elevator scene when spidey lost his powers, more emotional scene and character depth why he is losing his powers and the clock tower/subway fight with Doc Ock has been extended(although the extended scenes are very subtle).<br /><br />For Spider-man fans(such as myself), it is something that completes the entire context of the film and defines why Peter Parker is such a comic book hero than shall I even say Superman or Batman. He is broke, have a lot of hardships but he still travels the straight and difficult path just to do the right thing. His problems caused him to slowly lose his focus, hence his powers. He believes in (Stan Lee came up with this)"with great power comes great responsibility." and Aunt May's "sometimes we have to give up the things we want the most, even our dreams" just defines Peter as human, with flaws but he is always willing to make a sacrifice.<br /><br />Now, I have some experience with marketing gimmicks to know this is also one. But for Spidey completist, (if it wasn't for us, no 2.1 wouldn't be released)it may be worth the purchase. It is not a superior cut of the original but it does fill up the void between 2 and 3. I already own the SE 2 disc release, as well as the outstanding Superbit version(the superbit version utilized 6.8 gb space out of the 7.4 gb dual layer)and I can't help getting a bitter taste in my mouth and now I heard Fantastic Four is also getting an extended cut.<br /><br />Video: The picture is amazing, although the superbit version is still a bit better. It looked like it has a better transfer from the first release. I didn't see any noise because of the extended scenes. Colors are radiant and vibrant. It was sharp and clean, and for some reason, the 2.1 transfer seemed brighter and yielded more detail in the black levels where needed. Superior transfer from the original SE.<br />Audio: French, spanish, Portugese, English 5.1 DD track, sorry, no DTS-ES. Sound is crisp and loud with 5.1 Dolby Digital track.<br />EXTRA FEATURES: Weak. The special features in the original dvd release are a lot better. For die-hard fans, you still cannot get rid of the original version, it has the best special features.<br /><br />I cannot say this version is better than the first Special Edition or the Superbit, but die-hard fans will be happy to own it although I CANNOT give it a "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED" RATING. It is something you have to think about, if you already have the first SE version, but definitely grab this one if you don't own any of the other previous dvd releases.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!! It is a weak 4 stars for the dvd release, 5 stars for the movie.</p></body></html>

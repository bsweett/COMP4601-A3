<meta name="summary" content="doesn't quite work"></head><body><p>This attempts to be serious hard scifi, but there is something about the film as a whole that simply fails.  The script is all over the place.  On the one hand, it tries to be a kind of morality tale, raising questions about the ethics of scientists seeking their brand of truth.  You have a couple - the woman pushing ahead, the guy doubting and ultimately letting her do what she wants - who debate things in a wooden dialogue that doesn't go far enough.  Brody kind of yells out his concerns in certain situations, but doesn't hesitate to make love to the creature later.  The scientists do an illegal, dangerous experiment in secret, using the facilities of their company to pursue their own designs, with startling results.  On the other hand, they create a monster and it becomes a life-and-death struggle, etc.  Here it more or less fits into a formula:  fascination, revulsion, fear, then violence a la Frankenstein.  Oh, and an amoral corporation is bankrolling the whole thing.<br /><br />It would have succeeded better if the chemistry between the stars - Brody and Polley - somehow played better on screen, but I just couldn't believe them - that they were in love, that they were geniuses, that they had some higher, if mistaken, purpose in mind.  Brody is much better than Polley, whom I had never seen before and think gives a mediocre and inconsistent performance.  This failure is the crux of the film's failure, in my view.<br /><br />A lot of it is unbearably grotesque and ridiculously overdone.  There is one scene where these invented members of a new species square off and turn eachother into oozing pulp for incomprehensible reasons.  It is bad enough that it had to be so disgusting, but they did it (surprise!) at a demonstration in a shareholders' meeting, which just isn't believable.  A similar thing happens with the monster, of course, who also turns out to be based in human part on the DNA of the female scientist.<br /><br />I think one of the best things in the film is the monster.  Her character is subtle and an evolving enigma, the effects are flawlessly realistic, at least in a visual sense.  I did find her perfection as an organism a bit much, but that is a problem only for the serious hard scifi buff.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this as a viewing experience.</p></body></html>

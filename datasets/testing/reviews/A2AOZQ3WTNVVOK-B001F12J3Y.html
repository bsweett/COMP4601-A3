<meta name="summary" content="A New Holiday Classic"></head><body><p>It seems like every time I let controversy over a movie keep me from seeing it in the theater that I regret it.  Such was the case with this movie.  I heard a lot of criticism over this movie and I let it keep me from seeing it in the theater.  How dumb was I?  This movie is a lot of fun and a feast for your eyes.  Modern film makers make few enough of these films, and this one is a winner.<br /><br />We meet a boy who is at that age where he begins to realize that the world appears not to have as many mysteries as he believed it did when he was little.  One of those mysteries is Santa Claus.  He truly wants to believe, but the evidence he has gathered tells him that there is no Santa Claus.<br /><br />As he falls asleep on Christmas Eve he hears a most unlikely sound: a train pulled by a steam engine outside his house.  He quickly runs outside to see a very real train making all sorts of hissing and ticking noises.  Then he sees and hears a conductor yelling "All aboard!"  The boy does not get on the train in spite of the conductor's best efforts to convince him to board.  As the train pulls away the boy changes his mind and barely makes it aboard for a journey to the North Pole!<br /><br />We soon meet several characters who will be keys to the plot of the movie throughout.  Tom Hanks plays no less than five characters:  the boy's father, the conductor, the boy himself, Santa Claus, and a hobo ghost.  I could tell it was Hanks easily enough with three of the characters, but the other two did not sound like Hanks at all, though I watched an interview with Hanks and I can tell you that it definitely was Hanks.<br /><br />This movie is filled with subtleties and a lot of fun.  I would rather allow you to watch the movie and discover the treats for yourself.  To tantalize you a little, the train does get to the North Pole, but only after running out of control and nearly sinking under water.  Even after the train gets to the North Pole our heroes end up taking a detour on one of the train cars, ending up somewhere in the heart of an operations center.  Even though I knew this movie was animated, the scene where three children cross a trestle over what appears to be a nearly bottomless pit was a bit tense.<br /><br />This movie is a visual treat throughout, but the visual effects from the point the train appears are spectacular.  The train is extremely detailed as are the animals, plants and people.  The animation is unusual when compared with animation we have seen in the past because of the type of computer animation used.  However, the results are phenomenal.  While the animation did distract me a lot sometimes, after having watched this movie umpteen times (for those who like this message, this movie can be addictive) I can tell you that I keep coming back for the message and not the graphics.<br /><br />This movie was nominated for a bunch of awards, including three Oscars, but it only won four.  I found it interesting that this movie won a Grammy Award for Best Song for a Motion Picture, and yet the Oscar people failed to recognize this movie for any sound awards, though the Oscar people nominated it for several sound awards.<br /><br />I believe that for many people the "Polar Express" will be a holiday favorite and tradition along with the Rankin/Bass classics, "It's a Wonderful Life," and "A Christmas Story."  If you have yet to see this one and you enjoy holiday stories, definitely give this one a try with an open mind and an open heart.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Cinematography"></head><body><p>The dialog is minimal, but this is very much a visual picture. Film students can probably appreciate the technical aspects of the movie. Excellent cinematography. Any religious overtones are sveltly built into the enviornment itself and not obviously sticking out.<br /><br />Story is well told; definitely a lot of showing more than telling.<br /><br />Minimalist but very strong concentration of the wasteland. Watch how people act around each other even in the simplest of situations. You really do get the sense of how untrusting society has become. The acting from all the characters is superb.<br /><br />Well done movie.</p></body></html>

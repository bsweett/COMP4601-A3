<meta name="summary" content="The Funniest Movie of 2010 so far!"></head><body><p>Adam (John Cusack), his 2 friends Lou and Nick (Rob Corddry and Craig Robinson)  with Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) go to a ski resort where they used to hang-out in the 80's. While there they get smashed in a hot tub and find themselves transported back to the 80's.<br /><br /> The movie is sleazy, gross, offensive and...the funniest movie of the year. The cast work great together and most of the movie is funny. The movie even has it's touching moments. I also loved Crispen Glover as the doorman at the motel who has one arm in the 2000's, but in the 80's he has two arms and Lou can't wait to witness when he lost his arm. The scenes where you think he might lose his arm are just hilarious. I loved this movie, just see it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This movie was good"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott's Hannibal in my opinion is just as good as the first one. Ridlet Scott blends hunting images with extremely graphic violence which in my opinion works very well together. I like how they show you the evil of Hannibal Lector. I think that was good the first one should you his good side this one shows his bad side. This film should have got the NC-17 rating for violence its one of the most violent films ever made.<br /><br /> WARNING: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Groesome violence and Graphic Cannablism.</p></body></html>

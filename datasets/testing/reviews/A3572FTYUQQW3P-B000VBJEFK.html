The hordes of rats sort of freaked out my wife and while the movie went to great lengths to assure the audience that the rats were clean and sanitary the fact is when they raided the pantry they didn't wash their hands and did in fact contaminate the food which was later used. Thankfully the Health Department closed the place down.  Of course this is only a cartoon and shouldn't be taken too seriously.  As a cartoon it was well executed and undoubtedly appealed to its target audience.  This wasn't one of Disney's best efforts but when compared to what is generally being offered to kids on TV it is outstanding.  A cute movie, kids will love it, predictable and a little unnerving if not downright spooky at times.  Unless you have kids I think I would miss this one.</p></body></html>

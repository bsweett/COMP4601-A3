<meta name="summary" content="Troy"></head><body><p>Homer's "The Illiad" comes to life in this epic reenactment of the fall of Troy.  Banished are the Greek gods, who are referred to a lot, but never seen.  And that is probably for the best, although that is probably the most noticeable change from the source material.<p>Hector (Bana) and Paris (Bloom) from Troy are on a peaceful mission to Sparta, when Paris falls for the beautiful Helen (Kruger).  Paris takes her back to Troy, enraging her husband Menelaus.  Menelaus enlists the help of his brother, King Agamemnon (Cox), and his army to retrieve her.  Agamemnon sees this as a opportunity to increase his empire, and is more than willing to help, summoning his prized warrior Achilles (Pitt).  Achilles, we find out, will fight for Agamemnon, but only when it suits him.<p>The battle scenes are grand in detail and the special effects mesh seamlessly with the live actors, and one has come to expect in movies these days.  The problem lies more in the characters.  With the exception of Hector, the characters seem rather flat and unlikeable.  One could argue that Hector is the most noble character in the whole movie, and that is something that really gets him nowhere in the end.  All in all, "Troy" is enjoyable, but not as good as it could have been.</p></body></html>

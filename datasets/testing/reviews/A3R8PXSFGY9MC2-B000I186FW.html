Sadly I was a little disappointed, but only a little. It is OK, but very stylised and the story seems a little aimless in places (hence the 4 stars). Hugo Weaving does an admirable job portraying his characters sentiments whilst restricted by a mask throughout and Natalie Portman does a good job with a rather poor character that seems to change her temperament a touch too frequently to be believable. For fans of action movies and graphic novels this should keep you entertained, at least as you pick holes in it afterwards!! Worth a viewing, but don't expect too much and you should be fine.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

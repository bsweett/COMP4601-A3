The actuality approaches a bleakness that builds to a wave of silent paranoia.  Instead of that cornucopia fraught with starry-eyed promises, he discovers a microcosmic facsimile of the world from which he left, filled with some good--the bittersweet albeit confusing sounds and flavors of the familiar translated and assimilated within the confines of the new surroundings--but mostly bad--a recreation of the same infernally instinctual caste system the &eacute;migr&eacute; sought to initially avoid but robotically approaches like a moth to the flame.<br /><br />In the 2007 film "Eastern Promises", director David Cronenberg ("A History of Violence" and "Dead Ringers") and screenwriter, Steve Knight ("Dirty Pretty Things") explore the nature of this imbalanced seesaw of disillusion.  Setting their story in the London of various Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, they imbue the film's overall ambiance with a distinctly Eastern European miasma that suggests a steamy blood-colored borscht filtered through the cold and quintessential gray pea-soup--a far cry from the shining yellow emission of Dick Wittingham's city whose fabled streets are reputed to be paved with gold.<br /><br />Swirling about in all this grittiness, float new Londoners of various assimilative degrees.  The pretty midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) serves as a shocked onlooker openly and vocally reflecting the thoughts and reactions of the unseen audience.  In the course of her work, she comes across the tragic Tatiana, a pregnant teen found hemorrhaging on the floor of a local pharmacy.  In failing to save the life of the ill-fated mother, she feels obliged to discover a family relation for the newborn child, the only clue to this a diary written in Russian that Anna has not the linguistic skills to translate.  A business card found within the pages of the journal, leads her to the formidable Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), owner of a red velvet Russian Tea Room clone replete with the homey music of "Ochi Chernye" and balalaikas that act as a cover for the operations of the criminal syndicate `vory v zakone' not unlike the facade of the Genco Olive Oil Company shielding the Corleones.<br />And like the celluloid gangster family, Semyon boasts an heir-apparent to his throne.  Kiril, played with a wicked insecurity by French actor Vincent Cassel oscillates between party boy and hot-headed killer in a psychotic conglomeration of the Sonny/Fredo archetypes of "The Godfather."<br /><br />Best of all is Nikolai, Kiril's driver and aspiring vory v zakone climber, the taciturnly menacing Viggo Mortensen who flits along the fringes of a somewhat desired normalcy, flirting with Anna while fixing her motorcycle and cautioning her alliance with the steel-cored Semyon, yet wearing his gangster curriculum vitae on his body in a series of rank-stating tattoos and grisly actions that speak louder than his non-words.  Mortensen's performance borders on brilliant--I didn't think he could top his Tom Stall role in "The History of Violence."  Nonetheless, he does and does it well, particularly in two scenes where his nudity shows his vulnerability and empathy for the parts of his job that are distasteful to him and displays a primordial flare for survival that transcends the boundary of the typical action-packed fighting segment and becomes a strobe-lit sequence of the masculine form that suggests a sculpture in motion.  Cronenberg and Mortensen form a fascinating film-making alliance which I hope continues.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Director David Cronenberg teams up with lead actor Viggo Mortensen and writer Steve Knight to tell a tale of disillusioned hopes in the film "Eastern Promises."  Despite some gritty depictions of violence amidst themes involving the seedier money-generating operations of the Russian mafia, the combination of talents manages to balance the darkness with some light and generate an entertaining film with distinctive performances, especially in the case of Mortensen.  Recommended, especially if you appreciated "The History of Violence."<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Secret Garden meets The Shining"></head><body><p>Good cast and contrary to some reviewers, I felt that nudge of surprise we all felt when a door was flung open or something popped out from under the bed, at least in the first half.<br /><br />Dr. David Callaway, Deniro, is a successful New York practitioner of psychology, Amy Irving his wife, Allison, and Dakota Fanning the wasp-gothic daughter.<br /><br />It must be tough to act as an adult with Fanning. She is quite attractive (I mean she's attractive as a child) and she is very gifted as an actor. Two successful actors who pulled it off were Washington (Man on Fire) and Cruise (War of the Worlds) but in the former she was kidnapped for 1/2 the movie and in the latter she was comatose for 1/2 the movie. Here she's in most every scene and embezzles each one.<br /><br />Deniro, the brilliant, brilliant actor of the 70's and 80's (everything he touched turned to gold) does somethings better than anyone else and many things very well. Being warm and fuzzy isn't one of them so when he tells his colleague that he can't stay in the city after Allison apparently kills herself because "now I have to be a Dad," you know there are problems ahead.<br /><br />He's probably miscast. Elizabeth Shue, gorgeous, talented, plays every scene as a country recently divorced Mom with exceptional cleavage and boots. Couldn't figure it out.<br /><br />All in all the ending as the film's success in the market was predictable. Not bad to rent; I hope you didn't drop $25 to see it in the movie house. 3 stars.

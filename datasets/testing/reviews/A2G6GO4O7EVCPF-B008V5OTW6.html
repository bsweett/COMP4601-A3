<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's Munich is a powerful film...one of the best movies of 2005"></head><body><p>Eric Bana (Troy, Chopper) in a dynamic performance stars as Avner,a man who is assembled to a team of agents who are sent to eliminated 11 people who were involved in the kidnapping of athletes in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Bana's team consists of Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Enduring Love), Ciaran Hinds (Rome, Veronica Guerin) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Birthday Girl, The 5th Element), plus others. Their information is giving by the guy who started it all played by the always great Geoffrey Rush (Finding Nemo, Lantana). Soon Bana and his team are off to eliminate them all and also Bana's family could be in danger in the process. It's a powerful film with superb performances all around. Spielberg shows the horror and the chaos of what happened with bloody, brutal results. It's one of the best films that came last year and all I gotta say is bravo. Not for all tastes but I think if someone went threw what happened it would of been a horrible experience to go threw. Also starring Yvan Attal (The Interpreter, At Dawning) and Ayelet Zurerl (Maktub, A Night Without Lola).</p></body></html>

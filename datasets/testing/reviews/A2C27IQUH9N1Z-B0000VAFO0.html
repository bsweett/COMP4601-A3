I was really disappointed.  First, it's difficult to know who to root for: the Lycans are brutish but the vampires are decadent and duplicitous but dress better, both are violent.  The film is gorgeous to look at, but by the end I really didn't care about any of these characters; there are elements from Matrix and Terminator and a dozen other thrillers here, but no one to care about -- sort of like a fantastic-looking Hammer film.<p>Extras include trailers and a tv spot, storyboard comparison and a music video.  the film can be heard in English or French with subtitles in English, French or Spanish.  (We found the subtitles useful since it was often difficult to figure out what characters were saying.)</p></body></html>

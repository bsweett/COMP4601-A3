<meta name="summary" content="Relating to the Blu-ray release--not the movie itself"></head><body><p>PHONE BOOTH Blu-ray is packed the way HD movies should come.  It's loaded with MPEG2@26MBPS video, which means that everything on the screen looks simply incredible.  The colors are vibrant and the images are sharp and clear.  At this point in time, picture quality really doesn't get any better.<br /><br />The audio portion of the disc was treated in the same fashion.  The soundtrack as well as the special effects noises were crystal clear and come through a surround sound system gloriously.<br /><br />Unfortunately, high-tech doesn't improve the movie.  It's still a good watch with plenty of tension, but not enough of the story is given.  Colin Farrell and Forest Whitaker are the only two given the chance to really act.  An argument can be made for Kiefer Sutherland's voice-over work, but he was missing in action when it came to being on-stage.  Also, other than the commentary, there were no extras or behind-the-scenes pieces.<br /><br />But it's top of the line for people looking for the true experience of an HD disc for their home entertainment systems.</p></body></html>

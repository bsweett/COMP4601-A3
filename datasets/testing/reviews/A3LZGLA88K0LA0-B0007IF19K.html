Foxx is so good that I too actually forgot I wasn't watching the real Ray Charles.  Jamie inhabits the role so intensely one can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  Under masterful direction from Taylor Hackford, RAY is an excellent biopic, whose only fault in my opinion is its length; it seems to go on forever.  But during the time spent with the movie, you are treated to some of Ray Charles' most endearing songs; a tightly focused script featuring superb performances from the supporting cast including Kerry Washington, Regina King, David Krumholtz, Bokeem Woodbine and countless others.  The period detail is impeccable:  costuming, vehicles, everything seems like it came right out of the fifties and sixties.  I don't know the name of the actress who played Ray's mother, but she is wonderful in a fiercely determined performance.  Ray is a legend, conquering all the major fields of contemporary music, showing that an r&b singer can have pop hits, even country hits as demonstrated in his awesome renditions of I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU and BORN TO LOSE. And the picture doesn't sanitize his faults and weaknesses:  he was a womanizer and his addiction to heroin could have ended his career.  It is ironic that after he conquered this addiction, his stance in the recording industry lessened; seemed he did his best work while high.  But as the movie depicts, Ray's conquering of his personal demons kept his family together, and after tonight's six posthumous Grammys, one can say Ray and his music lives on.  Congrats to Foxx for his uncanny embodiment of this musical giant.</p></body></html>

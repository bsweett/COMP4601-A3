<meta name="summary" content="This Court is now in session, Hon. Darth Maciek presiding, the accused Sir Ridley Scott will please rise to hear the verdict"></head><body><p>This revised verdict contains SPOILERS:<br /><br />This High Court finds the accused guilty of:<br /><br />1) disappointing the expectations of large numbers of devoted fans and admirers<br />2) soiling his own legacy<br />3) dumping garbage in theatres around the world<br />4) insulting the intelligence of the viewers<br />5) wasting the talent of good actors<br />6) robbing defenceless Engineers of the totality of their "cool" factor<br />7) wagging his 3D in public, in a crowded area, without any valid reason<br />8) using office staples in medicine<br />9) causing waste of perfectly good popcorn in a world where hundreds of millions do not have enough to eat<br /><br />Justification: A LOT was expected from "Prometheus". It is however the finding of this Court that this film failed to meet the required standards to such a point, that it is at best an average SF film, many quality levels beneath "Alien" and in fact not even as good as "Alien3"... This Court finds particularly reprehensive the fact, that Sir Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors alive, accepted a piss-poor scenario, which, unlike in his masterpieces ("Alien", "Blade Runner", "Blackhawk Down", etc.) doesn't make any sense. This Court rejects with extreme energy the argument of the defense, that the scenarist is responsible for this film fiasco. The director is the person really in charge of the film and therefore the responsibility is all his, for everything, including the scenario. Also, as the scenarist is currently hiding in his own butt and refuses to come out (understandable under the circumstances), his testimony couldn't be heard - and therefore the whole point is considered moot and irrelevant for the present proceedings.<br /><br />This Court finds particularly offensive to common sense that the whole idea of First Contact with intelligent aliens was wasted and played at the level of a B-class "direct to DVD" SF film. It can be resumed briefly - an intelligent entity, belonging to a race which could fly interstellar spaceships already at least tens of thousands years ago, wakes up and sees smaller creatures, clearly intelligent because they obviously made it out of their solar system. So what does it do? It doesn't even try to communicate, but just starts to rip them apart. This Court allows itself here the right to laugh its (---) off, but with much underlying sadness.<br /><br />As a mitigating circumstance, this Court finds that there is a possibility that this deplorable scene was caused by the android David messing up the communications. The android seems to have learned alien's language from ancient human inscriptions - which certainly did not include phonetics (this is why NOBODY today can say with certainty how the Latin was REALLY spoken). So it may be that what the alien heard from the android was in fact: "I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries". Which would explain everything... All doubts being considered in favour of the accused, those mitigating circumstances will be duly weighted at the sentencing, below.<br /><br />There can be however no mitigating circumstances concerning another weakness of the scenario, namely the fact that a mission which cost Weyland Corporation a trillion of dollars is manned by a bunch of total IDIOTS! This Court reminds here, that the crew of "Nostromo", made just of hard working blue collar people, acted with much more logic, caution and discipline than the 17 crew members of "Prometheus", who are for most part simply pathetic. This Court acknowledges however, that captain Janek, pilot Chance, navigator Ravel and medical officer Ford are - to some extent - exceptions here.<br /><br />In the interest of justice, this Court presents here some most blatant examples of above mentioned idiocy:<br /><br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission - so the first time you see an alien skellington you panic and run like crazy away from others!<br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission, because you are a renowned biologist - so the first time the guy next to you sees an alien skellington, panics and runs away like crazy, you scream like a little girl and run after him, so you can get lost together in a maze of dark underground galleries (even if it is YOU who have the only map)...<br />- on a planet able to support life you find an alien underground complex and the atmosphere is OK! Let's all take off our helmets, so we can inhale all the local bacteria, viruses and other stuff against which we have no immunity!<br />- a living creature, vaguely snakelike, appears and approaches - let's give it our hand immediately, after all this is how we handle cobras and vipers on our planet - and I should know, I am a biologist!<br />- oops, I am contaminated by an alien organism and there are already little tentacles growing out of my eye - as I am an educated person with a PhD, I will not say one word about it, I absolutely want this thing to develop until I can not be saved anymore; also let's contaminate the others, after all, Mum always told me it is nice to share!<br />- a guy who was missing for 24 hours signals his presence at the spaceship entry - let's not even have ONE LOOK at him, like for example to see if it is REALLY him, BEFORE opening the doors!<br />- two of my people are stranded in a weird underground complex and there are signs appearing that there is SOMETHING alive inside. Should I maintain regular contact and keep a careful watch over them until they are recovered? Naah! Let's just get drunk and get laid, they will be surely fine... And anyway there is no manpower for this, there is only 15 people left on board...<br />- last but not least, on a trillion dollar interstellar mission on a planet which can support life (and therefore presence of predators can be expected) the whole arsenal on board consists of one shotgun, one handgun and two little flamethrowers - and therefore at some moments it will be down to knives, axes and wrenches...<br /><br />Idiocy being contagious, it is the finding of this Court that the giant aliens a.k.a. Engineers, also caught it:<br /><br />- I am a supremely intelligent ancient life form; I wake up from cryogenic sleep and see facing me five smaller, but clearly intelligent life forms; because I am evil and aggressive I wish to destroy them; of course it doesn't matter that I am alone here and unarmed, and there may be a hundred other small life forms waiting outside, packing heat; it doesn't matter that there is their whole SPACESHIP somewhere outside, which definitely must be packing REAL heat (if only for its propulsive system and mass); it doesn't matter that for all I know there can be a whole FLEET of spaceships on the orbit - no, I am going after them with my bare hands, without collecting the slightest intelligence, without even trying to find some weapons, maybe wake up some reinforcements. Tens of thousands of years of brilliant intelligence development = charge at sight and fight bare handed!<br />- I am a suppremely intelligent ancient life form and my spaceship was just downed by those pesky small life forms; it appears that one of them is still alive and hiding in a small sized but sophisticated container; I want to kill this life form! Should I find a weapon? Use the equipements of my ship which still function to scan the alien container and check for booby traps or weaponry? Go find another spaceship and use its weaponry to vaporize the intruder? No! The correct answer is to charge blindly towards the alien container, with my bare hands, without even having a look for any possible traps or surprises.<br /><br />This Court admits that the casting was made skilfully, but many actors were underused. Idriss Elba (captain Janek) plays very well a tough and brave man - but his screen time is surprisingly limited! Charlize Theron looks in this film as a goddess - frankly, at some moments this Court almost had the impression that looking at her hurt this Court's eyes, so beautiful she is. Her character (Meredith Vickers, mission supervisor) is IMPRESSIVE - but again, the scenario mostly leaves the lead to others and her part in the second part of the film is especially disappointing. Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the CEO and owner of the redoubtable Weyland Corporation. But Peter Weyland is a venerable, truly ancient old man - and Guy Pearce is not, which forces him to wear SO OBVIOUSLY a silly rubber mask! Why Sir Ridley couldn't hire just an old actor (there must be some in Hollywood), is beyond this Court's ability to understand - and forgive.<br /><br />An even more serious charge concerns messing with elements linking "Prometheus" to "Alien". The Engineers, mysterious giant humanoids furtively suggested in the alien spaceship wreck in "Alien" (the giant skeleton sitting in the chair), were a very promising thing for more than 30 years - and in this film all those promises were betrayed! Helmets? Really!? And the short scene revealing the origins of creatures from "Alien" made this Court frankly laugh (and it was a sad laughter...)<br /><br />Some mitigating circumstances are nevertheless recognized:<br /><br />- Michael Fassbender is the real star of this film as he steals the show as David the android.<br />- Noomi Rapace cannot (nobody can!) match Sigourney Weaver, but she still gives a honourable performance. It is highly appreciated by this Court that her character is a believing Christian, even if she seems to be the only one on board (captain Janek may be the second one, but there is not enough hard evidence to prove this). Much will be pardoned to the director for the scene in which she says "This is the Year of Grace 2093".<br />- Another mitigating factor is the scene in which the alien ship develops a crush on Charlize Theron and she in return imprints on it...)))<br />- And finally, it must be recognized that the accused is still suffering from PTSD following his association with a film about Fat Robin Hood and Old Maid Marian...<br /><br />Therefore, taking all the evidence in account, this Court decides as follows: 1. The film itself receives two stars. 2. The director is sentenced to a total of no less than 5 and no more than 15 years of bitch slapping by an alien queen of average size and temper, in a facility to be determined at a further hearing. 3. The sentence is suspended until the opening of the sequel of "Blade Runner" - it will be however executed in full if this film proves to be another disappointment.<br /><br />This Court is now adjourned and will drown its sorrows by ingesting Black Slime. God bless America!</p></body></html>

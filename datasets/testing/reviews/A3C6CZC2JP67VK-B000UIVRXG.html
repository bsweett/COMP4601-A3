The beginning of Hot Fuzz presents us with a cop called Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) who has the best arrest record in his station (400% better to be exact). But while in America this would be a cause for admiration and pats on the back, here it's bad form. He's making everyone else look bad. So therefore he's sent to the country, to a place that has no crime and a place that has won the village of the year competition. Which he later found himself bored in and became part of a ragtag police force... umm... service and teamed up to a childlike Police Constable Danny Butterman (Frost). Their differences take most of the first half of the movie and just turn out to be hilarious. The later parts consist of gruesome deaths and action packed gun fights which blended very well with the story line. Also, what I found funny here are the reasons behind the deaths of some locals which are very ridiculous compared to a more logical explanation rendered by Angel (well illogical deaths happen a lot in slasher films... correct me if I'm wrong). Though the film took two hours but the unlikely duo will not disappoint you, their mere presence makes the movie entertaining.<br /><br />Some of the funniest scenes occurs quite early in the movie. The plot if is rather silly, too crazy to be true. Though it serves well since its a parody in the first place. But the portrayal of these British actors makes the film believable. They have filled it with so many distinguishable actors that contributed very nicely for the greater good of the film.<br /><br />Aside from the main characters, my personal favorites is the baritone-voiced Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) and the jolly yet creepy Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent... he acts so natural that something in him makes me believe that he was one of my past bosses. Plus only few movies can manage to make likable villains. However, despite the wonderful parodying and the enjoyable action-comedy, there's something lacking in this film, and I think it's a matter of heart. The characters do develop and grow and we see glimpses of the same heart that we saw in its predecessor, but it's all been glossed and the film, I think concentrates a little too much on the parody, the action and the comedy and just a tad too little on the relationship between Nick and Danny. That's not to say it's not believable that they are friends, but it's just not the core of the film. I think that's what made "Shaun" very strong, on top of the comedy and homage. Hot Fuzz doesn't center in on it, more centering on the action and the homage than the buddy and loses a little because of it. Nonetheless, it's highly enjoyable, especially for movie lovers and I still recommend it as a high mark in buddy action comedies, even as a parody.</p></body></html>

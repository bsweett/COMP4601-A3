<meta name="summary" content="'EVIL DEAD' Good, Scary Fun..."></head><body><p>I remember the first time I saw previews for this movie when I was little and never taking the chance to see it. I never even rented it and I wanted to, but I was worried about it being just one of those "by-the-numbers, just-like-every-other-horror-movie" type of film. I went ahead and purchased the DVD, hoping that it would unlock some type of reaction - some kind of glimmer of hope. What's the verdict on this low-budget shocker?<br /><br />First off, let me be one of the first to say that the camera angles in this movie really make it quite terrifying. Raimi's camera work is pure genius...he uses the camera angles and frenzied shots to his advantage, and they add more to the film, making it ultimately more creepy. EVIL DEAD is a real treat of a low-budget film, and the atmosphere will give you the chills for nights after you watch this. One of the many reasons this film is great is actor Bruce Campbell, who plays Ash, the hero of the film. His comic turns; his sense of dread; his fear; his anger; every thing he is feeling, you're feeling ultimately more. The other actors in this movie, Betsy Baker, Ellen Sandweiss, Sarah York...all of them lend this movie a realistic sense of dread that can only permeate from a great horror film. Mind you, this isn't just a horror movie...elements of comedy and action also flow into this, but make no mistake, this is still very much a shocker. After five people set out to the woods of a remote part of Tennessee, they find not quiet but chaos after awakening evil spirits in the backwoods with the incantation played from a tape reading scriptures from the ancient "book of the dead". People start getting possessed one by one (all except for Ash); one of the ladies has a rather lewd encounter with possessed trees; a mysterious and angry force is after our hero in the final frame of the film (which is by far one of the best I've ever seen); and Linda (Ash's girlfriend) goes nuts and eventually, is decapitated by Ash, who really had no choice in the matter. All the scenes at nighttime are chilling, no doubt this would be quite scary if it really were happening. Just be grateful that this is only a movie. The ending of the film is one of the strongest, and the sequel would perfectly pick right up where this low-budget chiller would leave us...hungry for more.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a good scare this Halloween, you should look no further than THE EVIL DEAD. Though there are plenty of good fright flicks out there to enjoy, EVIL DEAD is a whole new experience, low-budget done right and done scary. You will never think of the woods the same way again after watching this...anyone rent a cabin?</p></body></html>

I don't think the Dude would much care what format you put him into or if a bowling ball came with the DVD or not.  In the end the Dude just takes each day as it comes, seemingly content to having survived another odd experience.<br /><br />The movie pretty much starts and stops and occasionally comes to a crashing halt just like the Dude's car.  It is a pastiche of noir and kitsch elements loosely held together by the Dude having to deliver a ransom for a rich man's young girlfriend, Bunny, and soon finds his life completely turned upside down by events.  The Coen Bros. humorously capture the laconic LA scene, forcing the Dude to have to face some rough rides and tough broads (Julianne Moore), before finally getting a clue to what is actually going on.  Walter is there to help him out, played with the bravado you have come to expect in John Goodman, but usually ends up making an even bigger mess of things.  Buscemi comes across as odd man odd out in this strange bowling trio.<br /><br />If you are used to the tight, plot-driven movies of the Coen Bros. you may be disappointed by this one, as it is played entirely for comic effect.  There really isn't much there to hang the Stanger's ten gallon hat on.  It is what it is.  Best to just sit back and enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

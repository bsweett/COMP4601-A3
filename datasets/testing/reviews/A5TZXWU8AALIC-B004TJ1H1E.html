<meta name="summary" content="Still Likin' It HOT"></head><body><p>When Hollywood started making the lists of the Greatest Movie of All Time, or the Greatest Comedy of All Time, etc.--I was skeptical: how could any person or group really decide those honors after a century of films?<br />(And I've never forgotten that THE EXORCIST was left off the AFI Greatest Films list, which is a crime when you consider that overrated films like FARGO did make the list).<br /><br />But I didn't have a problem when SOME LIKE IT HOT was voted as the Best Comedy of All Time.<br />It's a funny idea, it's got an incredible cast (Jack Lemmon still makes me laugh out loud--especially his scene with Marilyn Monroe in the bunk on the train), and it still works.<br /><br />I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, so my personal favorite comedy is NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE, but I won't disagree that SOME LIKE IT HOT should be at the top of the list.<br /><br />I'm laughing just thinking of my favorite lines.</p></body></html>

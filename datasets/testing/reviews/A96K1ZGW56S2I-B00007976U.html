I've seen most of his pictures (even the bizarre ones) and know that he's not just a great comic actor, but a great dramatic actor, too. However, if Williams wants to gain more recognition for his dramatic roles, he's got to start picking movies that have better &quot;umph&quot;.<p>ONE HOUR PHOTO is a movie about a photo lab technician (Williams) who after years of developing pictures for the same family becomes obsessed with them and wants to enter their lives in a more intimate way. The concept is pretty creepy and seems promising. However, the movie never fulfills its promise. Instead, all the great acting, lighting, and scenery go to waste in a movie without any meaning or real plot. What could have been a great stalker film ends up getting lost in the art of filmmaking and the movie itself is lost in the process. So, basically, ONE HOUR PHOTO is a journey of ninety minutes to nowhere.</p></body></html>

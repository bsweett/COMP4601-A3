So when I heard about the sequel, I didn't plan on going out of my way to see it. I was never into comic books, and am not really a fan of Superhero stories to begin with. Well, with all the hype and merchandising going on Spiderman 2 caught the attention of my son. He wanted to go so badly, I just couldn't say no. I have to say that I was extremely surprised at how good this movie is. The blend of action, humor and drama is fantastic! The special effects are amazing, and Doctor Octopus should go down as one of Hollywood's greatest villains! Even if you aren't a fan of Superhero movies, there is just too much to enjoy with this film to pass it over. The acting is top-notch and the high flying action will keep you glued to the edge of your seat! I can't say enough about Tobey Maguire. His portrayal of Peter Parker is great. You completely buy him as an average kid who gets caught up in extraordinary circumstances. You actually feel sympathy for this kid who has maybe taken too big a bite of something to swallow, all while rooting for him to start slinging some web. I also recommend seeing Spideman 2 in the theaters, because alot will be lost when it moves to the small screen. If you have been hesitant going to the theater because of the usual hype surrounding "summer blockbusters" which usually fall flat, don't be. Spiderman 2 actually lives up to or surpasses the hype. I will surely be in line when part 3 opens.</p></body></html>

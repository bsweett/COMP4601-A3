I didn't and we have T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and the immortal line "Talk to the hand."  TERMINATOR: SALVATION makes a better fit in that it takes us onward in time instead of having endless Terminators come back in time to save/kill John Connor.  It has a serviceable performance by Bale as John Connor.  Moon Bloodgood and Sam Worthington (actually a contender for James Bond) are worth the price of admission.  The CG Arnie (the head on the body of Roland Kickenger -- who is not going to be Conan) looks fake.  A popcorn film and nothing more.  If you are looking for TERIMATOR or T2 you will be disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing feature from the talented Morgan and Wong"></head><body><p>When a high school student's premonition of death causes several of his classmates and a teacher to narrowly avoid being killed on an exploding airplane, they gradually come to understand the rules that Death follows and attempt to avoid their own fates.  Having enjoyed Glen Morgan's and James Wong's television work on &quot;X-Files,&quot; &quot;Millennium,&quot; and &quot;Space: Above and Beyond,&quot; my expectations were high for this film.  Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver consistently enough.  Although the atmosphere was appropriately creepy, I found the premise to be quite silly and this is a flaw that is hard to bounce back from.</p></body></html>

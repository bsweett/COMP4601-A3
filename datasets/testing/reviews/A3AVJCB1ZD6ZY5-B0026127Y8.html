<meta name="summary" content="A bit unbelievable--yet Neeson's acting makes Bryan Mills real"></head><body><p>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is thoroughly out of touch with his 17 year old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). For her 17th birthday, he gives the girl a karaoke machine while her rich stepdad gives her the horse of her dreams. He is very much in touch with the too-real world of crime being a retired 'fixer' for an undisclosed US government agency.<br /><br />Bryan gives Kim grief when she wants to spend vacation in Paris with an older friend.  He signs her parental permission to go out of country with a long set of stipulations:<br /><br />1. call when she's landed<br />2. call every night<br />3. call when she's ready to take off<br /><br />Yet, the minute Kim sets foot on French soil, she's doomed.  She's not there a day before Albanian white slavers kidnap her and her friend.<br /><br />Luckily, Kim's on the phone with her Dad when the kidnappers strike.  She gives Dad who has 'a particular set of skills' enough description that he's headed for Paris to get his daughter back and he's got 96 hours to do it.<br /><br />"Taken" shows you a very hard man with a very human side. Neeson's depiction of Bryan Mills is what makes an otherwise stereotyped impossible odds film very real and compelling. All through the white-knuckle suspense, you are rooting for Mills and Neeson just does not disappoint.<br /><br />"Taken" is not a film for really young kids.  It just barely comes in with a PG-13 rating, but it's definitely a film that teenaged girls could benefit by watching.  And action fans are going to love this one.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, March 2009</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MOVE OVER, ARNOLD"></head><body><p>Vin Diesel who plays the anti-hero hero in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; should inherit the muscle man movie roles of the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger, if this movie is any evidence.  Actually, Diesel is a much better actor than Arnie, and he is the core of this highly entertaining and frightening science fiction movie.<p>I was awed by some of the lighting and camera work; scenes shifting from hues of orange to brown to blue and then the eeriness of the eclipse.  But, lordy, what creatures.  Even though we know they are computer generated, one cannot help but admit they were some of the best monsters since &quot;Aliens&quot;.  The device of having them in the dark was superb, because not only did we fear the sight of them, but their haunting and frightening screams.  <p>The overall casting was likewise effective, particularly Randha Mitchell as Fry, a complex and well-drawn female character that combined both strength and vulnerability, and an expressive face that worked beautifully for her.  Cole Hauser is effectively creepy as the addicted cop, who shifts from his early &quot;hero&quot; role to the true villain of the piece.  I also liked Claudia Black's tenacity and guarded sexuality, and Keith David's stereotypical religious leader.  Ketih managed to make him convincing.<p>But, it is Diesel who struts, grunts and muscles his way through the film; he is very good at showing expression with just a little twist of his mouth, and even with the &quot;see in the dark&quot; eyes, his final scene with Mitchell is both touching and unforgettable.<p>A great movie----let's look for more of David Twohy's brilliant conceptualization and style.</p></body></html>

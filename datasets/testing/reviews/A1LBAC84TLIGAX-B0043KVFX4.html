<meta name="summary" content="SUPERB AND MIND-BLOWING 10 OUT OF 10."></head><body><p>As a movie lover and gamer I have watched 14 total zombie movies in my lifetime: Night of the Living Dead, 1978 Dawn of the Dead, 2004 Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead, Evil Dead 1,2,3, 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, 1937 Revolt of the Zombies, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and now Resident Evil Extinction. Out of all these zombie films I've watched I can honestly say Resident Evil: Extinction is my favorite mostly over the fact is has more story to it than most of these other zombie movies, and it has the spectacular amount of gore of Land of the Dead with the action at par with 28 Weeks Later and Evil Dead with hints of many of today's superb science-fiction action titles. Milla Jovovich is still really hot and her combat moves have never been so sexy since The Fifth Element. The storyline will keep you intrigued because of how interesting it is and the zombie looks have vastly improved since the first two movies and look like the zombies from Land of the Dead with the running capabilites of the 28 Days Later/28 Weeks Later zombies. If you truly like movies and you can't stand the endless comedies, uninspired horror flicks, and the crappy High School Musical, then this is definitely for you.</p></body></html>

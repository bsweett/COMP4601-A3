<meta name="summary" content="The movie's actually better than the book!"></head><body><p>What happens when you take a negative of a negative?  As an example, the novel Sahara was absolutely awful, a one-star effort that failed on almost every level of plotting and characterization.  Clive Cussler, the book's author, however, disowned the movie version of his novel.  Did this mean that the film would be good?  The answer is "sort of."  Sahara the motion picture is a vast improvement over the source material but is essentially just an okay movie, neither bad nor good.<br /><br />The movie version of the story follows Dirk Pitt (played by Matthew McConaughey) who is basically a marine version of Indiana Jones who seeks underwater treasure for a semi-private organization called NUMA.  He and his friend Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) go up the Niger River in search of a Confederate ironclad that apparently crossed the Atlantic and wound up in Africa.  Meanwhile Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) is in search of the source of a mysterious ailment that is apparently coming out of war-torn Mali.  The dictator there is intent on eliminating all outsiders, and soon Dirk and Al are assisting Eva as they find the source of the plague and do a little treasure hunting on the side.<br /><br />On the plus side, most of the truly awful parts of the book have been eliminated, most particularly a supposed plot twist involving Abraham Lincoln.  The movie's writers have just taken the book's core plot and characters and reworked it into a light action movie.  On the minus side, none of the lead actors are all that great.  McConaughey and Zahn are reasonably amiable and Cruz is nice to look at, but none are really good actors.  The best in the cast would be William Macy, but he is underutilized.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is not the sort of movie that requires talented thespians, just some decent action and effects, and there is enough of that to keep most viewers entertained.  Overall, this is a three-star film, not particularly good or bad, a routine action movie that allows you to turn off your brain for a couple hours.  I cannot really recommend this movie, but I wouldn't warn people away either.</p></body></html>

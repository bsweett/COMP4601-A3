<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant installment of the franchise!"></head><body><p>Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew (Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates Mcfadden, and Marina Sirtus) have been given orders not to interfer in the battle between the Borg ship and the Federatuib ship. But the sinister Borg race with their sexy leader (Alice Krige) have a dastardly plan to go back in time so they can enslave the human race on Earth in the 21st century, the Enterprise follows them as their only chance in stopping the borg is to find the creator of warp drive known as Zefram Cochran (James Cromwell) and his assistant Lily (Alfe Woodard) and stop the Borg's plan.<br /><br />The greatest ST sequel since "Wraith of Khan" and yet the most satisyfying! The acting and special effects are fantastic, the storyline is well constructed and director/actor Jonathan Frakes has really made the movie into one of the best sci-fi movies ever. Ms. Krige is quite a dish for a cybernetic villainess in this movie, Jerry Goldsmith's score soars high as one of his best and is the best film of the Next Generation  part of the ST franchise, a real winner in my books.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent sound and picture that is better then the original DVD all the way! extras include audio commentaries, Text Commentary from Denise and Michael Okuda, Teasers and Trailers, Scene deconstruction, A tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and featurettes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Long and tedious"></head><body><p>Note: I watched this on an international flight. Perhaps it was the altitude, but I found it long, slow, and boring. I suppose some of the limbo visuals are neat, but due to the composition you are always aware that it's CGI, so it loses its impact.<br /><br />It's also a meditation on the horror and creepiness of child molesters. And the wistfulness of lives cut short. These themes are not for kids, so beware. It will give them nightmares.<br /><br />But it's hard to say what this movie is supposed to be. She doesn't seem to have much power to affect the outcome, so there's not much connection between her and the "real" world.<br /><br />Now, I realize this statement might be controversial, but all those scenes lingering on little girls (alive or dead) and physical teen romance seemed to border on a sort of unhealthy vibe. I don't know if that was the intent.<br /><br />Like I said, maybe it was the altitude. I found "The Road" to be also long, pointless, depressing, and boring on this flight as well. If you like this kind of thing, more power to ya.</p></body></html>

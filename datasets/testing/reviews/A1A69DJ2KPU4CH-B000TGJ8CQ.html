<meta name="summary" content="So Sue Me, I Love This Movie."></head><body><p>Okay, by all accounts I'm supposed to hate this movie. It was critically panned and even the review on the FX movie channel I'm rewatching it on right now gives it one star. Usually I am in full agreement with the professional reviews, but not this time. This is one of the movies that is pure escape for me. I don't analyze every little detail when I watch this movie and I don't find myself being super critical the way I am with other movies. Can't really explain why, but it might have to do with the beautiful theme music, the beautiful settings of the movie, or the incredibly beautiful Jessica Biel. Man this woman takes my breath away and she especially looks lovely in this movie. Maybe I'm soft on this movie because it's about a guy creatively figuring out how to get the woman of his dreams, and I had a similar challenge meeting my current girlfriend. Unfortunately I did not have the main character's ability to see into the future to increase my odds, had to do it the old fashioned way.<br /><br />There are some interesting twists and turns, and I have to admit I did not see the end coming. I thought it was a very creative use of his ability. The acting is solid, Nicolas Cage is his normal self, and you either like him or you don't, I like him. As beautiful as Jessica Biel is I think she's a fine actress. Julianne Moore is always great in everything I see her in and the rest of the cast is fine as well. I really appreciate the fact the movie never becomes some sappy love story, it never becomes cliched.<br /><br />So if you're a super critical reviewer maybe you'll see all the plot holes, poor acting, contrived circumstances, and bad script writing, but as I said, none of that stuff entered into my mind. This is not an oscar worthy movie, but it is a super fun escape for a few hours, and honestly isn't that the point of movies in the first place, escapism?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the coolest sci-fi films ever"></head><body><p>The Fifth Element combines all good features of a great science fiction film.  Great special effects, a great story, great characters, cool villains, and good versus evil on a grand scale.  Bruce Willis is one of my all-time favorite actors, and he is on top of his game playing Korben Dallas, a retired military man who has resorted to driving a cab to make a living.  Everything changes for Korben when Lelu, played by Milla Jovovich, comes along to save the world from the coming evil invasion.  Lelu is the fifth element in a process that will stop evil from destroying our planet.  Gary Oldman plays Jean-Baptiste Zorg, who is one of my all-time favorite villains in any film.  Equal parts evil, funny, and dangerous, Oldman is the perfect villain for this film.  The action is over the top and so is the dialogue, but it all fits the film perfectly, and whatever cliches might pop up are totally welcomed by the viewer.  If you haven't seen The Fifth Element yet, you are missing out on possibly the best sci-fi movie of all-time.</p></body></html>

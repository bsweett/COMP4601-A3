No question, Paul Giamatti as Cleveland delivered an excellent performance and his character was the cause of most of the laughter. The story itself is about a bedtime story that becomes reality for a particular group of people. The message of the film is very good, namely that every individual has a purpose in life and in the universe, and that each person is of value -- a message that is not subtle, but communicated rather obviously.<br /><br />The problem that I have with the film is that there's no real surprise factor that takes your breath away like e.g. in the Sixth Sense or in The Village. Still, M. Night is a top-notch director who communicates and translates his vision very well unto the screen, and in this flick he also shows a bit more of his acting skills which have improved a lot and are actually very good. Cindy Cheung is also doing a fine job - I have to mention her. Let's put it this way: it is a completely different film from what's out there and also the expectations for this film might be different of what this film really is. Did this film deliver? I would have lived my life just fine without ever seeing this film. Will I buy the DVD? No. But it's an original story although in a sense some story aspects reminded me e.g. of KPax or the typical good and evil sequence and there's someone who needs to be saved by some sort of savior.</p></body></html>

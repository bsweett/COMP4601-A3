<meta name="summary" content="Personally, I liked it ..."></head><body><p>That said though, I TOTALLY understand where people are coming from when they say they didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />Universal really fumbled the ball when they tried to advertise 'Hulk' as a front -to-back action movie. It just isn't, I can't put it any more simply then that. If that's what you are expecting (or had expected) I can almost guarantee you'd come away disappointed.<br /><br />Ang Lee is an art-house director ('Ice Storm' 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon') and that influence very clearly shows here. 'Hulk' is much more a character study of Bruce Banner then it is an action movie. The Hulk as a comic book character was always, quietly, one of the more complex characters in the Marvel universe, as opposed to the rampaging maniac that most people unfamiliar with the comic seem to think he is. Lee's choice to explore the former when most people were actually expecting the latter wound up alienating a great deal of the target audience.<br /><br />That's really a shame too because, although I wasn't a fan of the ending, it's really a terrific movie. The story and plot were really well thought out. The changes that were made to the Hulk's origin made a lot of sense. The performances were all great (Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot really stole the movie). It's just too bad that so many people were, I feel, led to expect something that they, ultimately, weren't going to get.</p></body></html>

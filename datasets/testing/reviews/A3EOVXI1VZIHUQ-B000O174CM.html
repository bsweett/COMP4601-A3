<meta name="summary" content="Like the characters in the film, Dreamgirls has its ups and downs"></head><body><p>I didn't dislike Dreamgirls, but I didn't love it either. It's just your typical been-done-before Hollywood film, only this time it's done with a big famous soundtrack and storyline. That only partly makes the film a success.<br /><br />The first hour or so of the film is dedicated to slowly revealing all the characters that we will be watching for the next 2+ hours. Danny Glover, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, and even Steve Urkle is in there for a second at the beginning (that's when you know they're pulling all the stops).<br /><br />Although there are some dazzling shots and some amazing singing performances, most of the acting is lackluster, except for Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy occasionally, though he's just playing the Eddie Murphy we've always seen. For some reason when he plays the same character in a dramatic film, it earns him an Oscar nomination. That speaks more to the low amount of respect given to comedic actors in comedies than to Eddie Murphy's acting. Jennifer Hudson is not an actress, except when she's singing. Maybe they should have invented a new category for her called "Best Supporting Singer" because during straight acting scenes she was stunningly blank and disappointing.<br /><br />The film itself drags quite a bit, even with the four or five montages used to show the singers' rise to the top. It all gets a bit repetitive and boring, although the second hour is much more exciting and entertaining than the first.<br /><br />Overall, like I said, it's not a bad movie, it's just not a good one. And it's definitely not a Best Picture contender... I don't know how that idea got sold to Academy Award nominators. Check it out if you love musicals or if you love watching pop-singers pretend to act in between singing and dancing. Other than that, it's not worth the time.</p></body></html>

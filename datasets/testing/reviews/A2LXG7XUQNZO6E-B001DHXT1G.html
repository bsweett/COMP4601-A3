<meta name="summary" content="Finally A Worthy Hulk!"></head><body><p>Unlike 2003's The Hulk, 2008's The Incredible Hulk is actually a good film! Go figure, it only took a remake slash sequel, a concept re-launch if you will, five years later to really do the character justice! This film's improvement over the last isn't just due to the advancement of CG technology (which it has big time!); it's also about a solid, entertaining script and talented actors delivering convincing performances. Everything about this Hulk film just seemed to work so well, so much better than I assumed could have been possible after being subjected to the first film. Obviously, I wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk was a blast to watch, this is entertainment gold! Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors; his Bruce Banner was leaps and bounds more likable and sympathetic than Bana's and, truth be told, the overall re-casting of established characters was the best thing they could have done for this series. Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliott are both admirable actors but they can't hold candles to Tyler and Hurt.<br /><br />Now, once again comparing this film to the last, The Incredible Hulk's new villain, Roth's Abomination, just took a big fat, steaming cinematic dump all over Nolte's goofy character, Father. Really, I don't even know what they were thinking with that bit of casting! I like Nick Nolte and all but c'mon, his character stunk! Abomination is where it's at and where it should have been in the first place!<br /><br />There's been a lot of chatter amongst comic and movie fans about which Marvel film kicked more tail, The Incredible Hulk or Iron Man, and for most the answer to that is clear...Iron Man. However the battle between Iron Man and Stane's Iron Monger just cannot compare to the unbridled entertainment value of The Incredible Hulk's romp `em, stomp `em toe-to-toe showdown with the Abomination! Iron Man edges ahead of The Incredible Hulk in the "Better Film" category but only by a little and only due to Downey Jr.'s performance.</p></body></html>

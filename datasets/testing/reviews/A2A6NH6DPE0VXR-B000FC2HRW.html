<meta name="summary" content="Almost as good as part 1"></head><body><p>Sequels were originally planned with Devon Sawyer having a vision in each one and I didn't mind that idea since I thought he wasn't that bad in the first one. Since they couldn't get him to come back they just made part 2 about someone else having a vision and death following those who survived a big highway wreck because of her. Then part 3 it has someone else having a vision of a big rollarcoaster accident. Then death follows whoever survived killing them in the order they would've in the accident. With the person who had the vision spending most of it figuring out who will die next.<br /><br />  The stories are all pretty much the same but the writer has to be creative  with who will die and how. The death scenes are creative and bloody and the film is about as well made as the first. Part 2 was a little too hateful, gross and disturbing for me. It's cool that you can control the fate of the survivors on the dvd even if the outcome is pretty much the same in the end. Still I wouldn't mind the feature in more horror dvds. It would've been cool having that fetaure with a Scream movie. It adds more to the film being able to watch it this way . Although once you do it once I doubt you'll do it again and again.</p></body></html>

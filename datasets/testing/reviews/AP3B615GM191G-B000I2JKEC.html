<meta name="summary" content="A Pure Superhero"></head><body><p>In today's Hollywood, the superhero movie is a changing breed. Films like "The Dark Knight" and "Hancock" are taking a reality-based approach to our heroes, portraying them as tortured souls who save lives out of anger or emotion, not because it is their sacred duty. Fortunately, the first "Superman" film passes the test of time as a testament to old-school superheroes...men and women that truly can be admired.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong...I consider "Dark Knight" to be perhaps the most complete film I have seen so far in my lifetime. However, after watching "Superman: The Movie" for the ump-teenth time (although this time with my 10-year old sister who was viewing the movie for the first time), I was struck by the purity of the Superman character. Whether he was rescuing a bus full of children, apprehending a petty burglar, matching wits with arch-enemy Lex Luthor, or taking time to swoop down and nab a little girl's kitten stuck up in a tree, Superman always strived to do what was ethically and morally right. I actually got a chill down my spine when Supes proclaims to Lois Lane that he stands for "Truth, Justice, and the American Way".<br /><br />Besides the symbolism of the Superman character, the film itself is also quite compelling. It really can be broken down into three acts:<br /><br />Act one focuses on Superman's doomed home planet of Krypton. The interesting visuals and cinematography of those scenes are some of the best the film has to offer.<br /><br />Act Two features a young Clark Kent as he lands on Earth, is raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent, experiments with his super abilities, and ultimately learns of his Kryptonian heritage via a trip to the Arctic.<br /><br />The longest, and final, act of the film finally introduces the blue-and-red suited caped hero we all know. Key themes of this act include Superman becoming the hero of Metropolis, his burgeoning love for Lois Lane, and the penultimate battle to stop the latest diabolical scheme of Lex Luthor.<br /><br />The acting is also superb through-and-through. There will likely never be another Clark/Superman as heroic as Christopher Reeve, while Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando as Lois, Lex, and Jor-El (Superman's biological father), respectively, help to make the movie even more engaging.<br /><br />Finally, though many Superman fans may debate me on this, I also enjoyed the comedic touches of this film. Though admirable, the "Boy-Scout" aspect of Superman is, at times, a bit overdone, so the injection of small humorous moments is a welcome respite. Plus, children (like my sister!) will find Lex's comically inept henchman Otis (played by Ned Beatty) to be the highlight of the whole experience!<br /><br />There are not too many films worthy of a permanent place in my DVD library, but "Superman: The Movie" is one that definitely will be around my home for as long as I am. I recommend this exciting, intriguing, inspiring movie to anyone...period.</p></body></html>

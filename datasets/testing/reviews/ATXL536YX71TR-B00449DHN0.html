<meta name="summary" content="I appreciate GANGS OF NY more now than I did when I saw it in '02"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese's THE GANGS OF NEW YORK was my personally most disliked film of 2002.I found it to be exceedingly long,endlessly bloody and with a script that covered way too much ground with too many subplots and characters,and an ending that was rushed compared to the first two hours of this 167 minute EPIC!<br />Well, given time and also a viewing of Ric Burns' 10 hour PBS documentary entitled NEW YORK, I revisited GANGS and appreciated this film so much more.I still see it as very flawed for all of the above reasons, but with the history and in depth background thoroughly in place (especially from PARTS ONE and TWO from the Ric Burns series!)I was able to better fill in all of the necessary information that Scorsese et al simply could not cram in.I could now appreciate what Scorsese was attempting to communicate about his beloved New York City in the years of immigration,political corruption and rebellion that erupted during the Civil War Years.This film can only hint at what actually happened in that time and ALL of the players and affected groups.<br />I continue to use the word "Appreciate" because I have such enormous respect for Scorsese and his team that has worked on so many films together.There is so much,technically, to marvel at in GANGS, but the screenplay is still the biggest problem that I have with this film.Thanks to Ric Burns who has made me respect this film more over the last five years!<br />An excellent follow up film to GANGS would be Scorsese's THE AGE OF INNOCENCE which chronicles the next chapter in New York history after the Civil War.I also HIGHLY recommend the 10-hour Version of the PBS Ric Burns NEW YORK.There are additional versions, but the 10 hour will suffice.It is divided into five 2-hour segments,with the first two parts establishing firm foundation for then viewing THE GANGS OF NEW YORK.</p></body></html>

I am only giving it 5 stars because I want the avg. costumer rating to be higher. Now, on with my review.<p> Martin Scorsese's "Gangs of New York" is a movie I'm sure many will argue about concerning whether or not it's one of his best. Well, lets for the moment say it's not one of his best. Then I feel, it is his most impressive and visually stunning movie. It's probably his most ambitious. "Gangs of New York" does have a grandioso feel to it. It's one of the rare times when a Hollywood movie wants to tell a story and actually be about something. That though is not unusual for Martin Scorsese. To many he is the greatest living filmmaker.<p> "Gangs of New York" starts off with a "war" sequence that is as harrowing as the opening moments in "Saving Private Ryan". It's not for those with a weak stomach. Make no mistake about it. This is a violent picture. Many might say it has too much gore. But, to these people, what exactly were you expecting? Here's a movie dealing with 19th Century New York. A time when people were at a civil war. Hate filled the air, and were you expect a nice good hearted fairy-tale? I'm sorry but you'll be disappointed.<p> In the opening scene Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) leads his troops of Irish Americans against "Bill the Butcher"'s (Daniel Day-Lewis) troop of "real" Americans. As the Butcher likes to say. Vallon has a son, Amsterdan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who witness this war. At the end of it, Priest Vallon dies. What's to become of Amsterdan a small boy, without a father? He is sent away, but, naturally can never forget the sight of seeing his father killed. He plans revenge and will wait as long as he has to. This is the set-up.<p> When Amsterdan does get older he will of course head back home to find "Bill the Butcher". Things have changed since he was a boy. It's a new world, and it seems like it's "Bill the Butcher"'s world. He seems to rule to five points of New York.<p> It's when "Gangs of New York" hits this part of the movie it reaches the tone that will be played throughout. "Gangs" is really a very impressive movie. There is such craft clearly seen. The movie was done with such passion and understanding by a man who truly loves the history of New York. If you can't appreciate this movie strickly on those reasons alone, than I doubt you have any real love of cinema. It's those things besides acting that make the movie what it is. The cinematography, the art direction, the costume designs, & the production designs. All of these things added together give the movie what it is going after.<p> Is "Gangs of New York" for everyone? Of course not. Nothing in life is 100%. But, I do feel people should make an effort to see it. Even if you didn't like the movie at the very least you can say you saw it and explain why you didn't like it. Most I think will enjoy the movie. And maybe as time passing on, people will have a kinder reaction to the movie.<p> The movie also stars Cameron Diaz, in what I felt was one of her best roles. She has really surprised me. I honestly felt the woman can't act. But than she does a movie like this or "Vanilla Sky" and shocks you. She plays Jenny Everdeane. John C. Reilly plays a small role "Happy Jack". And Jim Broadbent plays William "Boss" Tweed, yet again, another small role.<p> Bottom-line: One of the best films of 2002! A movie of craft and ambition. So, it might not be Scorsese's best, it is still one of his most impressive films.</p></body></html>

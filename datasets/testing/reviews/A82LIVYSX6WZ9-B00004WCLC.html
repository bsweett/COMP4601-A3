<meta name="summary" content="long but powerful"></head><body><p>its a two tape long movie but its great and its actors do good. the end with all the frogs was unexpected fot me and it was hilarious to see that, its rainging frogs damnit!!! Tom Cruise delivers the powerfullest performance in here as the son of a dying father and he confronts his father in tape two. the relationship bewteen Melora Walters and John C. Reilly is oddly likable. pt andersons other films Punch-Drunk Love and Boogie Nights I recommend too</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FIVE stars for the MOVIE, THREE for the EXTRAS!"></head><body><p>I've had the movie for over two years and just got around to viewing it.  Well, it was well worth the wait.  An engaging and hilarious story that appeals to the child in all of us, this is a film for anyone that ever wondered about what lay under the bed or hid in the deep recesses of one's closet.  Creative minds and talented actors come together to make a film comparable to the studio's other offerings such as "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life".  In fact, "Monsters, Inc.", in my opinion is BETTER than the record-setting "Finding Nemo".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bonus features don't compliment the film.  Included is a "new" unfunny short that, thankfully, is just that: SHORT. Interviews with the animators and other production staff show that they are gifted beyond measure but they are a tad BORING and stereotypically GEEKY!</p></body></html>

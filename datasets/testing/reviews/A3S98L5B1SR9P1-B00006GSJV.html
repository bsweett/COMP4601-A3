Unlike this review, the movie flows gracefully without being choppy. There are so many more good things to be said about this movie. 2 more things: Russel Crow is such an amazing actor and seems to perfectly elude the character of John Nash. James Horner does some excellent work with the score, although it does seem to be a little repetative in some places.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Interesting Interpretation of a Centuries Old Legend"></head><body><p>The 2004 film "King Arthur" is not your standard retelling of the centuries-old tale about King Arthur and his knights of the round table.  For many years, archeologists and historians have attempted to explain the possible roots for the mythologies surrounding the fabled British king, and based upon the evidence and various theories that have been put forward, many believe that if King Arthur actually existed, it was at a time much earlier than most people tend to place the legend: at approximately the time when Rome still occupied ancient Britain (Gaul).  The producers and writers of the film "King Arthur" then constructed a fictional story about the legendary Arthur without the magic and grandeur of earlier films such as "Camelot" (1967) and "Excalibur" (1981), but with the realism of what may have occurred when Rome was preparing to abandon much of its empire.<br /><br />The film begins far to the east of Britain, in another part of the Roman Empire called Samatia. Here, Samatians, whom Romans had spared due to their fighting skills, were given an agreement by the Empire several generations earlier that a number of young Samatian boys would be taken by Rome, given military training, and serve the empire for the next 15 years as soldiers.  These Samatian knights, as they are referred to, would then be sent to a particular region of the empire to serve with the Roman army.  After their 15 years of service, they were then free to return to their Samatian homes. One of the groups of Samatian knights were sent to Britain to help defend Rome's occupation against the people's living north of Hadrian's Wall. Placed under the command of Artorious Castus, a.k.a. Arthur (Clive Owen), the Samatian knights include Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen); who are all anxious to obtain their freedom after having served the Roman Empire for a long 15 years.  Unfortunately, a bishop from Rome, Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti), orders them to instead rescue a Roman family living north of Hadrian's Wall before giving them their papers indicating that their military service was fulfilled.  Begrudgingly, they set out north of Hadrian's Wall for the first time in their lives.  After a small skirmish with local British, they arrive at the Roman estate where its Roman leader has used torture as a means of converting the local British Pagans into believing in Christianity.  Arthur rescues the tortured captives that include Guinevere (Keira Knightley), then proceeds to insist on evacuating everyone from the estate because of the approaching Saxon army that leaves no person alive in its wake.  The Saxons are lead by the sociopath & despot Cerdic (Stellan Skarsg?rd) and his son Cynric (Til Schweiger).  The result is a film filled with several intense battle scenes that were no doubt inspired by such films as the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "Gladiator" (2000), but without the ultra-shiny suits of armor and mysticism as in "Excalibur" and "Camelot".<br /><br />Because so many people are well familiar with the more popular & mystical stories about the legendary King Arthur, the far more realistic version of the story presented in the 2004 film "King Arthur" was not as well received by audiences as it could have been. However, by placing the possible historical Arthur within the context of the end of Rome's occupation of Britain, the film's writer (David Franzoni) and director (Antoine Fuqua) did a masterful job at attempting to create a plausible story from which the more popular legends could have developed.  Though parts of the story were a little rough at times, it was still entertaining and interesting.  Overall, I rate the 2004 "King Arthur" with 3.5 out of 5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.</p></body></html>

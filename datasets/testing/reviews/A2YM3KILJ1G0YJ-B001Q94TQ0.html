<meta name="summary" content="Maria Full of Crank"></head><body><p>Maria Full of Grace focuses on the life of a fairly common girl growing up in Columbia 17-year-old Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno).  Her work dethorning roses pays meagerly, and her boss won't even let her take a quick break.  She asks to urinate, he replies, "If you do, urine trouble," and she says "Urine ojete; I quit."  Although, I must admit that my Spanish is rusty, I ignored the captions a few times, and the Spanish in this film is on Columbian hyperdrive like they're purposely trying to insert slang and confusion.  The lack of job puts a particular cramp on her family because she's the family pack mule; she carries/supports her mother, her sister, and her sister's bastard.  The latter is supported unwillingly.  There goes that iPhone data plan!  Unfortunately, this dire financial situation also left Maria without enough dinero to buy condoms.  Better make that crib a double!  At this point, Maria has few choices.  Make no mistake, we always have choices, but Maria's are almost all bad.  But since she's in Columbia and she's used to being a mule...why not make some big bucks doing what she knows?  Who else is going to facilitate New York's llello delivery to privileged, trust-funds named Trent and Cole, or the Ivory Tower of Wall Streeters who need a pick-me-up to screw over the rest of America for longer than an 8-hour work day?  The stage is set; let the drug smuggling commence.<br /><br />Devoid of massive cocaine factory explosions which rain Columbian sugar down on an entire village, it is apparent director/screenwriter Joshua Marston took no pointers from Michael Bay.  Instead, a realistic approach is delivered without condescension or preaching.  Much appreciated.  Nearly all focus is on the protagonist; her jealous, gordita girlfriend, and the third most dangerous activity involving a mule I can think of.  By all appearances it's the second most authentic film about drug trafficking which has probably ever been made.  First is clearly Aces: Iron Eagle III.  Classic.<br /><br />I enjoyed this tense, character-driven look into the world of poverty, drugs, the lubricating properties of tooth paste, and a recycling scene that toes the line of Human Centipede material.  At no time during the movie are decisions or scenarios unfathomable, which, in and of itself, makes the message powerful, enthralling, and interesting.  Moreno's performance cements this movie's profound significance and impact.<br /><br />Note: I realize crank is a slang term for meth, and not cocaine.</p></body></html>

The prevailing storyline may be a moving and inspiring, but it takes place against the backdrop of some of the most horrific events in recent memory.  In a manner reminiscent of Schindler's List and The Pianist, Hotel Rwanda uses its story to shed a stark light on one of those instances where the unthinkable happens, namely the Rwandan genocide of 1994.  Fuelled by decades-old tribal hatred stemming from the days of Belgian colonization, and enabled by the fear and indifference of a Western world still reeling from the then-recent disaster in Somalia, that year the majority Hutus unleashed a paroxysm of violence against the country's Tutsi minority, killing nearly a million men, women, and children in a period of barely three months.  While ethnic and tribal clashes are nothing new-witness Israel, Ireland, and the former Yugoslavia-the convergence of factors in this case seemed especially combustible, a fact to which the staggering body count certainly attested.<br /><br />Exploring the genocide mostly through the eyes of one man, the movie seeks to find redemption among horror by illustrating a single instance of the best of human nature in the midst of an explosion of the worst.  Don Cheadle has a tall order in filling the role of real-life protagonist Paul Rusesabagina, but he manages to bring equal amounts of passion and nuance to a role that demands both.  For those who don't know by now, Rusesabagina was the Hutu manager of the prestigious Hotel Milles Collines in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, a hotel that literally became a refugee camp when over a thousand people sought shelter there from the guns and machetes of the rampaging Hutu milita.  The movie wisely portrays Paul as less a born hero than one who had heroism thrust upon him, as the narrative sees him emerge from a consumnate businessman concerned with himself and his family (his wife was a Tutsi) to the savior of hundreds, both Hutu and Tutsi alike.  While it should go without saying that Hotel Rwanda is a dramatization and therefore not entirely factual per se, the portrayal of its hero is never less than believable.<br /><br />The violence is largely implied, rather than explicit-there's nothing to match the most cringe-inducing scenes in Schindler's List or The Pianist-but the film more than succeeds in capturing the sheer terror of what was occurring.  This is never more true than in perhaps the film's most harrowing scene, when a minor fender bender lands Paul and a villainous employee in a clearing-turned-slaughterhouse, and Paul gets out of his van to the sight of corpses strewn out literally as far as the eye can see.  There's no action or dialogue, but the harsh reality of senseless massacre is still put on the sharpest possible display.  Even more than the violence itself, though, the dehumanization necessary to murder on such a massive scale manages to terrify: much like the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking, the Rwandan genocide was spurred by a belief that the enemy was completely outside the bounds of normal human decency.  Alternately referring to the Tutsis as traitors and "cockroaches," the Hutus were able to justify their indiscriminate butchering of civilians with the time-honored devices of scapegoating and projection, which are ultimately the backing for pretty much all such atrocities.<br /><br />The movie also conveys yet another sad reality of human nature with its implications of the widespread apathy that greeted news of the atrocities in the Western world.  Granted, many countries were in no mood for foreign entanglements in the wake of the bungling of the humanitarian crisis in Somalia (including the deaths of 18 American soldiers vividly depicted in Black Hawk Down), but in light of the occcurrences in Rwanda the refusal to intervene shown by the so-called international community was still shocking.  Unfortunately, Western governments were concerned primarily with protecting their own, as the movie bitterly demonstrates when the United Nations peackeeping forces aren't allowed to evacuate anyone from Kigali but foreign nationals.  Of course, people everywhere tend to be concerned primarily with their own-their families, their friends, their countrymen-so the tragedies of Rwanda ultimately aren't all that surprising.  The impotence of the UN is brought into especially sharp relief through the well-meaning Canadian colonel played in career-reviving fashion by Nick Nolte, whose good intentions are outweighed by his inability to do much of anything to stop the rampant bloodshed.  It's not at all surprising to see Paul quickly reduced to bribery and bargaining with the Rwandan army and Hutu militia to keep his charges alive.  While there are some moments of odd poignancy and even dark humor to be found here, for the most part Hotel Rwanda is a depressing (if still necessary) watch largely because it illuminates the aspects of our nature that we don't often acknowledge.  Ignorance and insularity are realities of life in the U.S. these days (we're at war with Iraq right now, but how many Americans have been there or even know what countries border it?), and Hotel Rwanda is clearly intended to reflect those realities back at its viewers.<br /><br />Now, before I take my leave of this overly long review, it should be noted that Hotel Rwanda tells only a small part of the story of Rwanda, and it's a fictionalized part at that.  Watching it doesn't substitute for reading about the events themselves and what they can tell us, so you shouldn't expect it to (which is also why so many of the criticisms I've seen of this movie on this site are off base; people seem to be knocking it for not being something it's not supposed to be).  However, if this movie manages to stimulate some thought and discussion, all the better.  Whatever the case, though, it's certainly a brilliant movie in its own right, filled with powerful imagery, moral indignation, and Cheadle's captivating acting.  And if you do feel like reading up about the Rwandan genocide, may I suggest Scott Peterson(no, not the murderer)'s gripping book Me Against My Brother.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific entertainment!"></head><body><p>This is a kids movie done in the best way - lots of laughs, a great message, plenty of enjoyable asides and loads of bits and pieces adults can enjoy as well. The voice acting is top notch and with a great cast.<br /><br />I laughed out loud in several places and the film never gave way to over the top cutseyness - it's great fun all the way through and very strongly recommended.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

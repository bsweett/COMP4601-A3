<meta name="summary" content="A Cool Flick"></head><body><p>A surprising winner in my book, Garden State is entirely likable, and also one of those films that is capable of being simultaneously deep and funny, light and fun, welcoming and imposing, all as it slips out from behind its misguiding exterior and brutally confides things to us we'd almost as soon not know. Natalie Portman definitely earns her paycheck as Sam, a charmingly weird girl who manages to love life (and inspire a love of life in others) even as she deals with problems that would send most of us into a tailspin of self pity. Writer Zach Braff of NBC's Scrubs was equally great as director and actor, playing the part of a young man named Andrew Largeman, who has returned to New Jersey after nine years of living in California, where he has won moderate fame on a TV series playing an intellectually-stunted individual. (A left-handed compliment in the movie has someone telling Andrew, "On that show I really thought you WERE retarded.") Andrew returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his mother, whom he accidentally crippled when he was a child: something he has clearly never been allowed to forget, and which has understandably haunted him ever since. In New Jersey Andrew reconnects with a number of old friends, including one whose sudden wealth comes from having invented a form of "silent Velcro" and he stares down some old demons, including the biggest one in the form of his judgmental father. Above all else Andrew unexpectedly finds love, and it is the story of this love that gives (the almost dreary) Garden State its well-found balance. Garden State is a refreshing movie that never loses the feel of its indie roots. Andrew and Sam are the sort of people it's impossible not to root for, and the entire film has a "what will happen next" feel that's rarer than ever for any writer to accomplish.</p></body></html>

Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess play Lucy and Jude who fall in love during the midst of the Vietnam War. This is a musical and all the songs are Beatles classics like Strawberry Fields Forever, If I Fell, Happiness Is a Warm Gun, I Am the Walrus, I've Just Seen A Face, and many many more. The acting and singing is superb and the plot works perfectly with the Beatles fun and moving lyrics. Look for cameos by Bono, Joe Cocker, and Salma Hayek. My favorite music number is I Want You (She's So Heavy) featuring a great new face Joe Anderson. I highly recommend this tripped-out, hippie love gem, enjoy!!</p></body></html>

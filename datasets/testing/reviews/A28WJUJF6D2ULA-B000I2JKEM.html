<meta name="summary" content="I Now Commit Heresy With This Review"></head><body><p>I am a big fan of Tim Burton's work, especially his other stop motion animation masterpiece, The Nightmare Before Christmas, so naturally I was expecting to fall in love with Corpse Bride, but the fact is it didn't "grab" me as much as I thought it would. It even took me two tries to get through it, beautiful though some of it was, as well as grandly atmospheric and visually-appealing, and I think the reason this tale of a living man and his undead would-be bride failed to take hold of me related to its characters, who just didn't seem as interesting as those in The Nightmare Before Christmas. I hope Tim Burton continues to make animated films, in fact I wish he made them more often than he has, but Corpse Bride simply isn't among my favorites.</p></body></html>

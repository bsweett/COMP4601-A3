Second movies are always the toughest for directors since they have to spend much of it tying everything together for the first and the third. This doesn't allow as much time for creativity. In fact some parts seemed stretched to fill time in  this sequel. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, I just didn't have as much fun as in the first one. It made me think of other second movies that are dark like "Back to the Future 2", "Temple of Doom", and "The Empire Strikes Back". My wife and others have said they thought the special effects were great, but the barnacles and some of the makeup was just to creepy. Being as this is Disney family fare I tend to agree. This is not "The Ring" or "Thirteen Ghosts" so it does not need to have overly scary effects to get the job done. You want kids to enjoy it as well without having nightmares. The overall story is okay. I think a little more time on editing and comedy and less on makeup and effects would have been well spent. This time Captain Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, owes Davey Jones his soul, and of course he isn't ready to pay up. The action and comedy were not as spontaneous. Rather than new fresh things, it felt like much of it was just carrying on from the first movie. I would still recommend seeing it and buying the DVD when it comes out. I am looking forward to seeing the third movie next year.</p></body></html>

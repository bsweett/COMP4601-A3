<meta name="summary" content=""If you believe in love at first sight...take a closer look""></head><body><p>Mike Nichols' "Closer" is a loquacious and verbally explicit look at love, sex, deceit, honesty, the wandering eye and romantic competitiveness.  Mike Nichols' "Closer" is also one of the most utterly pompous and frustrating films I have ever seen in spite of some truly powerful acting by its all-star cast.  Instead of bringing me into the lives of these four people and allowing me to emphasize with them and understand their pain, I found myself utterly repulsed and perplexed by the actions of these characters.  I kept looking for some deeper meaning or some actual point, but in the end, I was left with nothing.<br /><br />In this film, Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen are selfish, manipulative, needy people who prey on each other like sharks at a feeding frenzy of the emotions.  They lie and cheat... and then they go lie and cheat again.  It's a never-ending cycle of betrayal, sex, and dishonesty.  For the first half-hour or so, I felt engaged in the romantic drama of these characters.  At the end of this hour and forty minute mess, I was so incredibly sick of these people and angered by their absolutely horrendous actions.  There was no moral, no lesson, and no message.  Unless you count the idea that men and women are incapable of forging a lasting and genuine happiness as a message.  And for most of us, that is simply untrue.<br /><br />What sort of pompous pessimism is this?  Just because the writer, Patrick Marber, may have had bad experiences with love, he felt the need to write a whole play about it?  And then adapt it to a screenplay?  Implying that, somehow, the rest of us wish to watch cruel, deceptive people mess around with each other's emotions?!</p></body></html>

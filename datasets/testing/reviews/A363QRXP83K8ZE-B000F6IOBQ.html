But this movie, which I expected to be a dumb but fun actioner with very welcome vampire and werewolf action, is worse than dumb-it's boring.  There's nothing wrong with dumb action-comic book movies, but to make it so yawn-inducing...<br /><br />Do they make stuff like this on auto-pilot?  It takes genuine skill and talent to take all of these amazing effects-'lycans' running around ripping people apart, getting their heads ripped off, vampire guys flying around with spiky wings, crazy eye effects, shooting, more shooting, explosions, random creatures being torn apart, etc, etc-and make a totally boring mess of a film.<br /><br />This reminded of The Matrix Reloaded-take a decent movie with some semblance of originality, overproduce the sequel, ensure it gets bogged down in some humorless mumbo-jumbo, make every shot look the same, make everything look like MTV School, have ridiculous violence you can't even see because there are 100 cuts per minute, and voila--instant crap.<br /><br />No wonder America is getting dumber.  Apparently, we are unable to watch films that aren't cut like music videos or commercials, now basically the same thing.  The trailer outdoes the movie here by a wide margin.  You can't even see what's happening in half the battle scenes, with the abundance of blue lighting, long, wet hair flinging around, slow-mo sweat and blood, and cuts, cuts, cuts.  To say nothing of the story.<br /><br />In this one, apparently some lycans, or vampire-lycans, or hybrids, are running around, something or other, I forget.  It's more trouble than it's worth to discern the plot, except to note that Derek Jacobi, a respectable actor, appears in this, presumably because his grandkids need college tuition or his portfolio requires diversification.  Kate Beckinsale isn't asked to do much acting except wear that awesome black leather outfit, fire two guns at once, and resemble Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil, or Keira Knightley in Domino, or any other leather-clad female with great eyes and better guns, including the preview for another crap movie I saw that prefaced this thing.<br /><br />I want to note the remarkable effect of every single shot looking the same-same murky blue light.  The gore, if you can see it, runs thick, but it's comic bookish and it all looks blue.  The film takes place in some alternate universe, in some alternate time and on a planet...where?  We have some place that looks like Russia, I couldn't tell, a lot of commandos who use MP-5s, and then you have vampires and lycans running around.  Honestly, I really thought it would be more fun, but there isn't a shred of humor, not one once of self-reflexivity to let you know that maybe, just maybe, the people involved in this film had fun making it.<br /><br />One gigantic yawn.  If you have the attention span of a small pup, by all means go watch.  For the dedicated, go check out the DVD, sure to be released in two weeks, and definitely including at least one full extra disc of `extras', including revelations on how the 75,000 effects and stunt people collaborated to make this masterpiece.</p></body></html>

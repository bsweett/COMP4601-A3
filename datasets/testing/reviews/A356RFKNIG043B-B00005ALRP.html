I don't think this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original print, though; while it's a good, crisp picture, it's not much of an improvement over my dvd.<br /><br />The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and the Big Pharma conspiracy angle is an excellent updating that works well. There's thrills aplenty, with minimal violence, which I appreciate more every year as idiot directors and writers rely on guns and blood to fill the holes in their ill-planned plots. There's more intelligence than that at work here, and director Andrew Davis makes it all mesh tightly and suspensefully. The ending is a bit weak: I don't buy the scene at the conference, but it works to the degree it must, and that's good enough.<br /><br />Add Ford and Jones at the top of their games and it's a movie worth watching many times, whenever one needs to be reminded what a truly fine thriller can be.<br /><br />Too bad they didn't polish it up enough for it to be a blu-ray worthy of the description high-def.</p></body></html>

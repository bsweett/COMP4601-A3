<meta name="summary" content="GRIPPING HISTORICAL DRAMA"></head><body><p>One of the best ensemble casts of all time. Captivating screenplay. Excellent acting. Impressive battlefield sequences. Mediocre score. Wonderful character development. And the historical perspective of the invaluable contribution of the African American people who fought, and fought well, to win the country's freedom.<p>Apart from the minor quibble that Matthew Broadwick was grossly miscast as the center piece of the movie (he simply does not have the panache to make a compelling job of the role), this film is perhaps the best movie I have seen on the American civil war, or any war for that matter. <p>I am no authority on American civil war, but I haven't completely figured out one thing: the pivotal spine of the theme is about the experience of blacks in the war (who had hitherto been &quot;slaves&quot;) but still Zwick chose to narrate the saga from the point of view of the &quot;54th's&quot; white commanding officer. Why are we made to see the African American troops through his eyes instead of seeing him through theirs?  <p>Despite that petty rant, and some historical inaccuracies (e.g., the 54th was not the first regiment to hire non-whites), this is a very well-made movie that's definitely worth owning for its absolutely electric atmosphere.

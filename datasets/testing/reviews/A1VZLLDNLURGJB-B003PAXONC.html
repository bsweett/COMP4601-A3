<meta name="summary" content="I AM LEGEND-Provides Will Smith a Chance to Actually Act"></head><body><p>I AM LEGEND was a good four star film starring Will Smith.  I enjoyed the special effects and computer animations as well as the staging of this very good sci-fi remake of the OMEGA MAN.  In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the original film and recommend it for all fans of Will Smith.<br /><br />I was not at all surprised that Will Smith could pull off some very serious and dramatic acting under genuine "sci-fi" conditions that strain credulity. As I always suspected, he is much more than a likeable stunt man and should enjoy a great acting career over the years ahead.<br /><br />The ending of the film was a bit of a bummer, but we all knew the basic plot anyhow. I thought he went out like an action figure but was given a good chance to demonstrate his very fine acting skills.  As he usually does, he portrayed a very likeable and basically very good individual, and did this without appearing corny. His character was trying to set straight a failure of the entire human race and took his responsibilities as a research doctor very personally.</p></body></html>

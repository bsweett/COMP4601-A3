<meta name="summary" content=""You know, the only thing that matters is the ending""></head><body><p>Johnny Depp is a writer who's going through emotional crisis and is confronted by a stranger, who accuses him of stealing his story and demands him to change the ending. Some of the details of the plot are compromised for the sake of surprise and shock, but the outstanding performance of Depp makes up for any compromises. Watch this movie and try to overlook the simple suspense details and think of the more important questions: If you could go back in time, would you act differently? If you have the power, would you change the ending of certain stories in your life? How torturous is the relationship between you and your conscience, and after all, how outstanding is it to have a talk with your conscience every now and then?</p></body></html>

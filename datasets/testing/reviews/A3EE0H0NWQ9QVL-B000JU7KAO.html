Night Shymalan's 'Lady in the Water' is good at taking a mundane existence, like life at an apartment complex, and lifting the veil off the supernatural world.  He works to build a bridge between two worlds: childhood and adulthood, the ancient and the modern, myths and the tangible, the factual presence as we know it and the supernatural.  In 'Lady in the Water' he does all of this skillfully, but often leads us to make our own conclusions.  And sometimes there is explaining to do, and sometimes there is too much explaining,...<br /><br />We begin with an apartment manager and maintenance man, Cleveland Heep, (Paul Giamati) who is recovering from the grief of losing his family to violence, changing jobs from doctor to  work in a Philadelphia complex (called The Cove, and looking a lot like a hotel).  He is confronted by a mysterious woman* who comes from "the blue world" via the complex's pool.  He believes she is drowning and dives in to save her life.  She ends up saving his.  In his apartment, she tells a marvelous tale of a ritual she must fulfil to escape danger and be promoted in her own realm by an eagle.<br /><br />Interweaving stories and possibilities are revealed by the colorful tenants who all believe in this magic, coincidentally enough, and try to protect and free the woman from the menace of "the snarks," another mysterious Shylaman monster out in the wilderness.  All the ritual must come properly together.  She is some sort of mystical force that will transcend all the evil of the world, but how that manifests itself is not entirely clear. Yet, all of the tenants are convinced.<br /><br />The movie is as hypnotic as most of his works are.  Shylaman keeps our interest and suspense, but he doesn't always satisfy this time around.  There are genuinely scary and funny scenes that create a decent entertainment, but it doesn't always add up.  Unlike his masterpieces, 'Wide Awake,' 'Sixth Sense,' and 'Signs,' he doesn't flawlessly tell his story or mesmerize our senses to an admirable conclusion.  However, some of the essential flaws of 'The Village' are noticeably absent, too.  There are also some of the same elements you find in most of his movies:  the bitter person in need of healing, the child who is more perceptive than the adults, the other world that contrasts our own..., etc.  'Lady,...' is a perceptive, but flawed creation by the man who has replaced Hitchcock in post-modern films.  Who else could make it plausible that there is a mystical nymph  making a visitation from the local swimming pool?  There is also a lingering sense of archetypes that are well-drawn and haunting--like always.  He bridges the gap between both worlds convincingly enough, but here he just doesn't do it as well.  This is a recommended movie with some major reservations.<br /><br />*Her name is "Story".  With "Cleveland Heep," how 'bout the prodigy Mr. Dury renamed Mr. Crossword, etc.?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Incredibles (Widescreen 2-Disc Collector's Edition)"></head><body><p>The Incredibles (Widescreen 2-Disc Collector's Edition)~ Maeve Andrews is a really good animated movie. The animation is astounding and the script is very well written. The movie starts out with Mr Incredible saving the world and then he is sued by the people that he tried to save. This means that the Incredibles are put under witness protection act so that they can live "normal" lives. I love the music and it reminds me a lot of the music used for movies such as Superman, Batman and other super hero movies. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie, like the scene with the "fat" Mr. incredible not fitting in the tube, the fight with the robot and many more.  This is the best animated movie that I have seen since Finding Nemo and I therefore give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></body></html>

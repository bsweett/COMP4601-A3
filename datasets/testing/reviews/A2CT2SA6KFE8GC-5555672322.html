<meta name="summary" content="Enter.....The Mask!!"></head><body><p>Even though this begins right after the end of part 2, Jason seems to have grown about twice the size he was in that film.  He's also now completely bald, he seems to have lost all of his hair in that half hour time frame.  The disco theme is pretty catchy, and the 3D thing looks quite dumb.  It would be nice if the dvd came with glasses and the film was in 3D.  When the van full of victims pulls up(as it always seems to in these the beginning of these films.  They might as well have an announcer say, "Lets meet our victims, ladies and gentlemen"), you will identify almost immediately who the lucky one is who'll survive.  That point is pounded home even more when she refuses the advances of her old boyfriend.  And of course, as you probably already know, Jason gets his hands on that hockey mask in this one, and he must love it, coz he's never without it again.  In fact, he manages to get it back after losing it a few times, and even gets a brand new one in 8.  No different than the rest, but I have to admit that this one has what I feel to be the creepiest moment in the series.  These films are far from being scary, but there's a dream sequence at the end of this film that's pretty well done and might even give you the chills.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Very Popular And Enjoyable Film"></head><body><p>Even though this film was released in 1985, now, more than 20 years later, it is still highly entertaining.  You get at least a few moments with each character, develop a feel for them, and come to like them all.  You really want to see them succeed, and the suspense of whether they will or not is constant.  This movie is good for all ages, and is rated PG.  The Cyndi Lauper "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough" song was a nice touch.  Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg created a magical movie that will be enjoyed for years to come.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sports Action With a Satisfying Outcome"></head><body><p>How would it feel to be a prisoner and have the opportunity to "get even" with your superiors by challenging them in a game of football? This situation would cause a great feeling of exhilaration among many inmates, and it happens to form the main plot of "The Longest Yard", a movie remake of the 1974 original that starred Burt Reynolds in the main role.<br /><br />In this updated version of Longest Yard, Adam Sandler stars as Paul Crewe. He is a man with a troubled past and a guilty conscience. He was once a professional football player, but was banned from the sport for fixing the outcome of a game by shaving points. This guilt has never quite left him and now, many years after the shameful scar from his past originated, he finds himself in prison. He is coerced by Warden Hazel- the man in charge of the prison and a guy with political aspirations- to put together a team of football players using other prisoners, with the goal in mind of pitting them against the guards of the prison in a nationally televised game. Sandler resists, but he ultimately gives in.<br /><br />This sports film offers some suspenseful moments and some good action. It also finds Sandler's character in a tough situation once more, when he is blackmailed by Warden Hazel into once again fixing a football game- this time, the actual game between the guards and the prisoners. Sandler has to make a difficult decision between taking the easy way out (fixing the game and avoiding a longer prison sentence) and doing what is ethical: Refusing to fix another game, like he did in the past, regardless of the consequences.<br /><br />Sandler is ok in his role as Paul Crewe, but I find myself a little resistant to accept him playing a semi- serious part. I say "semi- serious" because this film has many funny moments and Sandler fits it nicely during the comedic segments. But the more serious parts of the film seem a little awkward for Sandler. However, in the case of "Longest Yard", you don't seem to mind because the supporting cast is very good, and it includes Burt Reynolds (just like in the original movie), James Cromwell, Chris Rock, etc., along with several professional athletes, like Brian Bosworth, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, and others.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sports film with a generally positive message and a satisfying outcome. It isn't quite as good as the 1974 original, but it does offer some solid entertainment, some good comedy, and some serious moments as well, to combine into a pleasant motion picture.</p></body></html>

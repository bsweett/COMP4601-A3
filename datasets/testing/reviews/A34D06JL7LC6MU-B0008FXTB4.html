<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable & Funny, Not a Masterpiece"></head><body><p>I want to begin this review by stating that "Be Cool" is based on the novel by Elmore Leonard and is the sequel to "Get Shorty."<br /><br />This movie has all the makings of a bad sequel. Different director, different screenwriter, 98% different cast, take a dialouge driven comedy and make the sequel a comedy. Etcetera, etcetera. Having said that, I did like this movie. I've seen<br /><br />"Get Shorty" twice, have read the book and read the book "Be Cool" as well. I knew going into this film it wasn't going to be as good as "Get Shorty" and it's not. GS was a great movie, with fantastic dialouge and an interesting Elmore Leonard-like story line. This movie has an all around different mood to it and the dialouge isn't bad, but it isn't as good. Be Cool is essentially a comedy, at least that's what it's billed as. Not every joke hits and in fact most fall flat. I liked this movie cause I did laugh a couple of times and seeing John Travolta and Uma Thurman together is great. The two have great screen chemistry that they haven't been able to show off on screen since 1994 when they made "Pulp Fiction". Be Cool is about former shylock-turned movie producer Chili Palmer. Chili has been getting sick of the movie business after making a flop sequel to his hit film "Get Leo." Chili is at a sidewalk cafe talking to his friend (a music producer) Tommy Athens. Tommy tells Chili about a movie idea and also about a talented young singer named Linda Moon. Tommy is shot and killed by a russian man and Chili goes looking for Linda Moon. Linda (Christina Milian) works at The Viper Room singing in a girl group and is under management by Raji (Vince Vaugn, very funny) a wannabe black man. To top that off Raji has a gay bodygard named Elliot (The Rock) who wants to be an actor.<br /><br />Chili becomes Linda's new manager and with the help of Edie Athens (Thurman) he gets her to perform at an Aerosmith concert.<br /><br />Also in the movie is Cedric the Entertainer and Harvey Keitel as<br /><br />a gangsta rap mogul and Raji's boss. Both characters play fairly funny characters, CTE is better. It's nice to see Harvey Keitel, since he's rarely in a movie nowadays. Now as far as being faithful to the book it's probably 80% the same. The 20% is only minor things like Linda Moon had a band called Odessa in the book. B-.</p></body></html>

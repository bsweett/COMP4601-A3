<meta name="summary" content="A Great Little Movie"></head><body><p>I put this movie in not expecting it to be much and came away feeling I'd seen a great little movie with a lot of emotion and humor packed in.  This film covers several different plot points: the importance of money and status versus love and family; the importance of employer/employee/customer versus corporate synergy; the importance of living for the little things in life.  I especially liked Dennis Quaid.  Quaid doesn't always get the chance to show he can actually act and this film really allowed him to shine.  A major suprise in this film was Topher Grace -- he actually can act without being the fool like he is "That 70s Show." Now that Grace has left that show, "In Good Company" may prove to be a great stepping stone.</p></body></html>

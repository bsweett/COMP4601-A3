<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man"></head><body><p>While visiting Afghanistan, billionaire arms supplier Tony Stark (Downey) finds his caravan overrun by terrorists and himself captured.  Injured in the kidnapping, he finds a n irremovable piece of shrapnel in his chest.  He must wear an electromagnet to keep it from piercing his heart.  The terrorists want him to replicate his latest and greatest missile for them to use.  Stark has other plans, and is able to fashion a suit of armor that allows him to escape captivity.  Back home, he decides to stop his company from making military weapons, and focus on perfecting his metal suit.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is a great film, and as a superhero film it rates up there with "Batman Begins" and "Spider-Man 2".  It has action, drama, fumor, and great special effects.  The story of the self-made superhero is different and interesting.  Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired casting.  He IS Tony Stark, and he is at least as responsible for the greatness of this film as director Jon Favreau.  Favreau would not be the obvious choice for a film of this nature, but he pulls it off spectacularly.  "Iron Man" is a great movie for all ages.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

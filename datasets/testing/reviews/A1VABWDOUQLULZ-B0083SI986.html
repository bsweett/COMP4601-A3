<meta name="summary" content="I'm no hero."></head><body><p>Indeed, Walt Kowalski says he's no hero, and he isn't.  Except that he is an old man deeply troubled enough by his acts in the Korean War to stand up for those unjustly persecuted.  The story is compelling, but considering Eastwood's brilliance and success behind other films the star quality just did not convey in this one.  Kowalski was well-acted, though it was Ahney Her as Sue who shone.  She was the only one who seemed to be in the part and not just acting it.  The flow of the film was a bit slow and its transitions quite choppy.  The editing just did not seem to be on par, which resulted in some of characterization of Kowalski seeming contrived if not completely off.  Despite its patchy qualities this film delivers a powerful story, that while potentially predictable does not detract from its power.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, two problems"></head><body><p>First and foremost, the scenery, story, and acting in this movie is top-notch.  From Sean Penn's vision of how Christopher McCandless lives his life and searched for his goal, to Emile Hirsch's protrayal of the man's life, it's very compelling.<br /><br />As for the movie, Christopher (Hirsch) is a young man with the hubris of youth, the free-spirit of someone without responsibility, and the wherewithal of a privileged family.<br /><br />Because of a slightly dysfuncational family life, a strong disdain for much of what contemporary society has become - something with which I can strongly related, and the desire to find the aesthetic quality in every day life, Christopher leaves it all behind.  He eschews money (he actually sets fire to his last few remaining dollars), possession, and just about every other modern convenience in search of<br /><br />Along the way he changes his name to Alexander Supertramp in honor of not only the lifestyle but also his desire for anonymity.  His voyage to Alaska was full of adventure, finding random jobs, kayaking the entire Grand Canyon into Mexico, and meeting some interesting people along the way.<br /><br />Eventually he finds an abandoned school bus and calls it home.  It's just enough shelter for him to make it base-camp, where he can forage and hunt small game.  He spends the rest of the time reading, writing, and reflecting.<br /><br />The first major problem I have with this movie is the fact that he was so nice to so many, but had such an irrational hatred of his family.  I can understand his hesitancy to be close to his father, but he tortured his mother and sister out of pure ignorance and selfishness.<br /><br />The second problem I have with the movie is the message.  The majority of the film is a buildup, a message, an insight into his joy and freedom.  And then, in the end, the message changes.  Not only was his original concept foolhardy, but the lesson he learned was that he was completely wrong.  The essence of what he wanted to escape from was eventually the precise thing he craved.  It's easy to picture Alexander Supertramp as the free-wheeling, nature-loving, soul on a quest for enlightenment if he didn't end up looking like a utterly na?ve young man who lost his life unnecessarily.</p></body></html>

I've heard others say it was too slow and not gory enough, but I thought it was just right. I loved all the old English language and bad weather. The backdrops and shots of old London from the sky are gorgeous. The story is unbelievably awesome. The Ripper was most likely a Nobleman and this flick tells the tale well. And with style. Bravo Hughes Brothers!<br />A common factor I did notice with people who said they didn't like it, is that they all probably watched it on 27" TV's. I think it was watchable in widescreen only, which, on a 27", turns into a 6-inch thick, 2-foot wide movie bar.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jurassic Park of Weather Movies"></head><body><p>From the minds of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg, Twister has a tornado instead of a T-Rex.  The score even reminds you of Jurassic Park.  But despite this, Twister is a real nail-biter.  I started out watching it sitting on the couch, and ended up on the floor closer to the screen at the end.  The weather effects are amazing - and scary.  The tornados are real-looking, but so are the sky, the clouds, the wind, and the mood - which hooks you in.<p>The romance between tornado-chaser Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton), is predictable, but it is still interesting to see how it unfolds.  CSI's Jamie Gertz plays the third-wheel fiancee, trailing along in hot pursuit of the storms because Jo is still sitting on the divorce papers.  Her refined, Southern character is funny in contrast to Hunt's boot-stomping, full-throttle lifestyle.<p>Helen Hunts leads a huge pack of nerds who compromise her tornado-chasing team.  It is interesting to note that Hunt is the only attractive woman in the film.  It was like the casting agent deliberately surrounded her with unattractive women.  Even her mother as a little girl is a big, beefy, homely farm woman, and her father is a typical redneck.  How such a pretty girl could come from them, I don't know.  One of my favorite characters is Jo's aunt.  She is very unique.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Recycled, unoriginal, and poorly executed humor for the low iq"></head><body><p>Can we actually have some comedy films that actually possess some originality without the rehashed jokes, relentless advertising in every scene, and just poorly constructed and unlikeable characters.<br /><br />I feel as though the trailer sufficed in portraying it's funniest parts because there was not much left after that; and even those selective scenes weren't that funny when I viewed them. My main problem with this film was not the stupid and repetitive humor but the uninteresting characters that we have to route for and hope they find their best friend Doug. Who cares about Doug or their journey to find out how he got kidnapped? The humor relies heavily upon random, bizarre, and illogical bursts of different characters, infliction of pain, random celebrity cameo's (Mike Tyson) and just bad dialogue. I usually don't mind this type of humor when it is executed properly and in a timely fashion.<br /><br />This film, on the other hand, is just a poor excuse for another college humor comedy. The sad part is that these hero's were supposed to be routing for are like in their 30's with wives and kids, pathetic. Now we don't have to scratch our heads and realize why male adults act like their still in college and milk their party years till their 50. This film preys on an audience who is just out of touch with reality and cannot appreciate carefully constructed characters, witty and realistic dialogue and plausible friendships, because in this film these guys have anything but on-screen chemistry; it comes across as awkward and unnatural.</p></body></html>

Jack in trouble again, this time with Davey Jones looking to collect a debt now due him. The plot thickens when Will Turner learns his father is a crew member aboard Jones' Flying Dutchmen and will do anything to free him of his service. All this and the East India Trading Company is hunting down not only pirates but the means to control the sea! This is probably the weakest of the 3 and it still gets 5 stars. Simply great fun!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Another EYE POPPING blu ray! The picture and sound are what blu-ray is suppossed to be! The special features are carried over from the dvd with blu-ray special features added. It's worth every penny. FINAL VERDICT: Walk the plank if you don't upgrade matey! ABSOLUTELY UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></body></html>

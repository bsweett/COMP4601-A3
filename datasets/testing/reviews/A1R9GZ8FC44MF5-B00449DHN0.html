<meta name="summary" content="Better than chicago."></head><body><p>Why did chicago win the best pic oscar, it should have gone to LOTR, but this ones a close second place.  The movie is great, all around.  The gang fights, the performances, the sets, the story, everything is masterfully crafted.  Scorcese makes another great movie(goodfellas, casino), they all kick a$$.  The only thing holding back this movie from being a 10 out of a 10 is the smut and the movie is seperated on 2 discs on the DVD, why its not that long really, if they can fit the green mile on one disc why not this one, i hate having to get up and change the disc.  Its a 9 out of a 10 for the movie because the smut and lack of one gang fight that i thought it could use in the middle to kind of even it out alittle.  Overall its a good movie worth owing, and probably Scorcese's best.</p></body></html>

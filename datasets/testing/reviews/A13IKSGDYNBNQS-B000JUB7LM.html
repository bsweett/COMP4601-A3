<meta name="summary" content="Another classy movie from Eastwood"></head><body><p>In the Winter of his career (he is now 76 or 77) Clint Eastwood continues to make quality films, which ignore the Hollywood 'market' and at least require you to engage your brain. Million Dollar Baby is another well directed, well acted and engrossing movie.<br /><br />The stand-out performance is undoubtably Hilary Swanks as the gritty working class woman who wants to make it big as a boxer. You can see she obviously worked very hard to get into shape for this film. Both Eastwood and Morgan Freeman give good performances alongside Swank, although I'm sure it would have been a better film if Morgan Freeman had played Frankie, rather than Clint Eastwood. However this is arguable and we'll never know.<br /><br />The film won 4 Oscars, and overall is a thought-provoking movie that deals with a difficult topic very well - and its well worth buying.</p></body></html>

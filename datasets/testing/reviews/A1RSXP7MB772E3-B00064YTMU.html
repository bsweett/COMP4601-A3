Saying to the box, "Why don't you just kill the man?" (refering to max when he throws vincets brief case of evidence including his hit list down upon a busy street from an overpass. The entire film is full of them, the climactic end not sparing either! After being shot in the face he manages to leap frog onto the back of a speeding subtrain. But it's just one of those films. I wouldn't go as far as saying low brow, not with the sometimes engaging conversations, and hilarious dark humor. The cinematography focuses, at its most creative moments, on the lonely nature that lives on the peripheral of the city limits. Showing how close indeed L.A is to the desert. Along the way in following Max (the taxi driver) you cross landmark streets (such as le brea-named after the le brea tar pits), and some of the most notable superstructures in the los angeles area. You can follow the timetable in which the night flows from Max's fare reader and other places in the movie. (such as a subway sign that read "today is january 25,2004. The time 540AM.) The time is referred/displayed 5 times in the movie. See if you can catch them all.</p></body></html>

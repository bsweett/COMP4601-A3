Portman does a great job for such a vague charactor and "V" is a wonderful part as a whole, he truly represents a true, opinionated and couragous hero. I thought that it got stuck in the mud and began to get a little slow their in the middle but it sped up again in the end and overall it succeeded in being what slowly becomes a very unique "Marvel" film. Some of the parts of the film I thought were very clever such a the speech that "V" makes @ the beginning of the movie in  which he speaks in words that all start with the letter "V". Some other people say that you should read the comic book (I believe it is), before watching the movie so that you have a full understanding about what is going on and that way you can enjoy the "Deeper Meaning" as well, ... I went into the theatre hearing good things and I most definatly was not dissapointed!<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

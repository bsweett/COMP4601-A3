This follows the life of a gangster who becomes the king of crime. He has everything. Al Pacino makes a perfect lead role.<br /><br />The deluxe gift set is worth your money. It contains both Scarface movies (includuding the one by Howard Hughes) and 2 discs on the 1983 one and 2 discs on the Howard Hughes version. So buy it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Banal  Storyline but with some Good Moments Courtesy of the Cast"></head><body><p>Rumor has it that this is a pretty banal movie.  The rumor is true.  Ted Griffin, the screenwriter from Pasadena, and a writer with some pretty fine screenplays under his belt (Matchstick Men, Ocean's Eleven), somehow felt the need to cash in on the re-release of the classic film THE GRADUATE about his hometown idiosyncrasies and make a 30 years later 'sequel'.  Bad choice: the comparisons between the two films are just too far apart to endure tolerance from the audience.<br /><br />Rob Reiner has made some fine films in the past, but he lets this little bit of pastiche just get out of control.  The few laughs that are implied come form some gritty lines from Katherine (veteran Shirley MacLaine), playing the grandmother of Sarah (Jennifer Aniston), who was the model for 'Mrs. Robinson' in the book THE GRADUATE.  It seems that Aniston returns for her sister Annie's (Mena Suvari) wedding to hunky Scott (Steve Sandvoss from 'Latter Days' fame) with her affianced Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) only to realize that she doesn't seem to fit into Pasadena much less her family.  Never close to her father (Richard Jenkins) she hears that her mother had a fling with one Beau (Kevin Costner) and that she may be the offspring of Beau and her mother.  How she discovers the reality of the rumor is the point (or lack thereof) of the movie.<br /><br />With Aniston, MacLaine, Ruffalo, Costner and Jenkins in the cast the film has to have some good points - and it does.  It is just that the idea for the story is too lame to digest and too poorly written to buy into, making this a film to watch only if you happen to love the cast.  Grady Harp, May 06</p></body></html>

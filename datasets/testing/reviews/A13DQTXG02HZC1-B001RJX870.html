There was a saying that if you were to kill a person, you were called a murderer.  If you were to kill hundreds of people, you were called a tyrant.  If you were to kill thousands of people, you were called a conqueror.  And if you were to kill millions of people, you were called a Leader.  Here, you were able to see that in some people's point of view, Hitler was the saviour for Germania and their devotion and loyalty towards the man were unwavering till his death with his Mistress.  For the Jews, he was a monster who would zealously wiped out one race for the sake of maintaining the purity of the Aryan people.  For some, they finally understood that Hitler was an intolerant person that wouldn't take compromises and would take extreme measures to get his way.  They simply repented and subsequently went against his wills.  Here again, we question the rationality of having a war.  It's simply senseless to see a German killing another German whilst other Germans were fighting the onslaught of the Red Russia Army and having to protect the deprived, forgotten, and "dispensable" civilians.  Audience shook their heads in disbelief as Dr Goebbels (one of Hitler's more prominent cronies) and his wife calmly fed their children with cynides prior to them meeting their own deaths.  For them, it's about unquestionable loyalty and fanaticism towards one particular belief such as what Talibans and Al Qaedas believe in jihad to free Middle East from white's supremacy.  Lastly, there were those unspoken heroes that would stand up to the occasions to fend for the weaks when they weren't able to defend for themselves.  There were also those whose innocence was lost and that reality didn't seem to live up to their expectations.  "Downfall" is very good in terms of depicting the daily happenings, the intimate moment such as Hitler struggling with his Parkinson disease, reactions of various people from different facets of society, people dealing with their own mortality through denial, coming to term with it, or simply quickening the process to their final moment.  This is truly a riveting movie told from German's perspective catering for the matured audience that would want to understand people's reactions to it all rather than having those glorifying images shoved down our throats as done by other American film-makers.  A movie that would linger on in my memory bank for many years to come and a movie that deserved to be watched on the big screen.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

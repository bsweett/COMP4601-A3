<meta name="summary" content="THE MAGIC OF "BATTLES BEYOND ENDURANCE""></head><body><p>What boxing movie? We don't see a deluge of training montages leading to a foregone triumph; Million Dollar Baby (MDB) has much deeper themes in mind.<br /><br />It canvasses emotionally fraught territory and forces its characters to make decisions for which no sport can prepare them. "Sometimes the best way to deliver a punch is to step back. But step back too far and you ain't fighting at all."<br /><br />The production reeks of austerity all round, as if Eastwood has boiled off every ounce of fat and let only the essentials remain. Principally we have three characters that are sketched with satisfying precision:<br /><br />Frankie (Eastwood), a has-been manager dumped by his last client thus growing dangerously risk-averse. His disaffection finds expression in hollow visits to church, some of which are hilariously blasphemous but never gratuitous.<br /><br />Who better to shake him up than Maggie (Swank), a scrappy, dirt-poor wanna-be who stashes away leftovers from the restaurant that she waits at. Already pushing her luck at 31 she is so hungry for boxing that she practically lives at the gym, gobbling up stray bits of advice. Swank's portrayal of angst, exuberance, doggedness and zeal all rolled into one, sans Hollywood theatrics, is a feat.<br /><br />Then there is Eddie (Freeman), Frankie's help around the boxing gym, whose earthy narration comes into play and charts Maggie's progress with some evocative voiceover.<br /><br />The core narrative is simple so shouldn't be spoiled, but several subplots are constantly at work throughout the movie: Eddie's own career and his relationship with Frankie, Maggie's poor background and her relationship with her abhorrent family, Frankie's long-lost daughter and his taunting interplay with his local priest. None of these smother the movie, nor are they followed through to much conclusion, yet they provide intriguing depth to the three main characters as we come to know them in the shadowy expanse of Frankie's boxing gym.<br /><br />The denouement is not one bit controversial, it's a very natural culmination of events. I am not quite sure what the controversy was all about anyway. There used to be a time when different opinions were resolved with you and I agreeing to disagree. Now, everything that's not in line with one's opinions is either moronic or just plain wrong. The script does a good job of explaining its decisions. When Frankie ruefully questions his judgment for ever backing Maggie's foray into boxing, Eddie gives him a rejoinder that makes perfect sense for the upcoming decisions.<br /><br />What an impeccable production; no supercilious plot structures, just a hard-nosed theme with great respect for the slow miracles that draw people together in ties that touch the heart and soul.<br /><br />Your collection is incomplete without this marvelous film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A decent biopic"></head><body><p>Aside from "Boy named Sue," "Ring of Fire" and a couple other classic hits, I'm not much of a Johnny Cash fan. Still, I had an indistinct respect for the man, and sensed his genuineness. Bottom line: for a guy who didn't bring much fan loyalty into "Walk The Line," Cash's film biography, I found it tolerable.<br /><br />WTL takes us from Cash's dirt-poor Arkansas roots, where a family accident left him, the ill-favored son, at the mercy of his alcoholic father's demeaning rage. In the Air Force, Cash started writing the songs (though from what impulse the film does not say) that later made him famous. Initially more dogged than talented, Cash got involved with the rockabilly music of the day, toured with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter. The film does a great job illuminating the touring scene in rock and roll's very earliest years. The finale, showing the making if Johnny's famous live album at Folsom prison, was the climax of the film, showing Johnny finally having mastered himself and having a rollicking good time among men who saw into his tortured soul.<br /><br />ALERT! A few spoilers in this paragraph: WTL is chock full of clich&eacute;s about making it in the arts: the intrepid hero who battles self-doubt, family antagonism and an industry that doesn't think he has what it takes; with guts and desire he masters his instrument and becomes a great success, only to lose his way in anonymous sex, pills, booze or dope; After hitting bottom, the love of friends and family help him face the demons of the past, get him cleaned up and move onto greater successes. WTL, like "Ray," mines these familiar veins.<br /><br />WTL is saved from mediocrity by a couple of factors. Joaquin Phoenix does a decent job portraying Cash. Sometimes he looks and acts very much like Cash, other times less so. It's hard, though to know whether he's playing a man who is painfully shy and not good with words, or one who is not that bright. Reese Witherspoon does a creditable job as June Carter Cash, though every now and then "Legally Blonde" peeks through. What really saves the film is the grit it took for Phoenix and Witherspoon to sing their own parts. With Johnny Cash, pure determination took over when all else failed. The leads were able to channel some of that energy into their roles.<br /><br />If it was up to me alone, I'd give WTL 3 stars, but my wife (an Cash fan from way back) thoroughly enjoyed it, earning it one extra star.</p></body></html>

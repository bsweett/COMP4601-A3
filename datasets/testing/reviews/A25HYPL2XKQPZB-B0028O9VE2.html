<meta name="summary" content="Vega and Sandler are great, Leoni is evil!"></head><body><p>Spanglish is a good movie when it is about John Claskey and Flor, his Mexican imigrant housekeeper, played by Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  John and Flor both have young teenage daughters and they are interesting as well.  John has a son who is on screen some but mostly goes unnoticed.  John also has a mother-in-law with a drinking problem who has a few good moments.<br /><br />But unfortunately, director James Brooks has created one of the most evil, unsympathetic characters ever in John's wife, Deborah, played well by Tea Leoni.  I don't fault Leoni because she is utterly convincing as the despicable, selfish, clueless, adulterous Deborah.  She is mean to her daughter, her husband and to especially Flor, the housekeeper she hired.  Deborah doesn't have one redeeming quality which the viewer can latch on to.  There is no reason to care about her.  Even at the end of the movie when she does perhaps see the error of her ways, it doesn't change the fact that she is a horrible person and it doesn't make up for all the evil she did to her family.<br /><br />The reason to watch this movie is Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  Their chemistry together is fresh and exciting and one leaves the theater knowing these two were made for each other.  I read one review about Spanglish that said the movie isn't very good, but it does have interesting characters.  It could have been a good movie if Brooks hadn't made Tea Leoni's character so utterly unsympathetic and repulsive.  Still, Sander shows he can act without being his traditional silly self and Vega is a newcomer to America who is absolutely beautiful to watch.</p></body></html>

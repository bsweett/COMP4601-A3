The plot twists and turns kept me glued to me seat and the screen.  The acting was top-notch by all involved (especially David Bowie's supporting role), the writing was incredibly clever, and the direction was smooth and sure-footed.  The unfolding of the "trick" or "tricks" is revealed a la M. Night Shylaman style (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TQRB">The Sixth Sense</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064LJVE">The Village</a>) and one can feel rather stupid at the end for not seeing the tricks all along, hence the catch phrase, "Are you watching?"<br /><br />It is hard to find much very redeeming about either competing magician, although one might be more on the side of the one who lost his wife, played by Jackman, due to the other magician's mistake during an act, played by Bale.  It is sad to see Jackman's character not recover from this loss and to fall into obssessive revenge.  Bale's character is tender in his family scenes and that actually is disturbing as we don't see him truly hurt or sorry for his part in his partner's wife's death.  You would think as a family man he would be more sensitive to his partner's loss.  In the end, we care little for these men and that is the saddest commentary of all.  By the way, I'm not spoiling anything here as this is all revealed within the first 15 minutes of the film.  It simply sets the stage, no pun intended, for the revenge plot portion of the film.<br /><br />This is a film not be missed.  It is truly one of the best films of 2006 and should have been honored with a Best Picture nod.  This film may not be to everyone's liking, but I loved it and highly recommend it along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist</a> and equally well done film about magic that went kind of unnoticed as "The Prestige" was a more splashy film at the time.</p></body></html>

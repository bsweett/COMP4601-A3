Greek Gods, Kings, Queens and Princes ruled.  The motto was "Conquer or be conquered." Fierce battles rein supreme. Natural born fighters killed face to face.<br /><br />  Paris (Orlando Bloom) convinces Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) to leave her husband King of Sparta Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) and go back to Troy secretly. The overzealous Greek King Agamemnon uses his brothers vice as a reason for an all out war against the Trojans. All kings are summoned to join the King of Greece to conquer Troy.  Priam (Peter O'Toole) and Prince Hector (Eric Bana) must decide to protect their city or give back Helen.<br /><br />This movie follows King Achilles (Brad Pitt) who wants to go down in history as the greatest fighter in the world. Achilles contemplates fighting for the Greek King Agamemnon. Achilles detests King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) for his leadership. After convincing from his friend, King Odysseus (Sean Bean) Achilles agrees to fight the Trojans.  With that much tension in the air, I was waiting for Achilles to take down King Agamemnon at any time.<br /><br /> The movie flows well for the two-hour length. As a note, I would like to see how Achilles became such a great fighter. And how Paris and Helen got together in the first place.<br /><br />  Movies will try to entertain the audience for two hours.  Hollywood "Epic" is always associated with Hollywood. Key word is Hollywood. Hollywood will always give itself first billing to MAKE money. Money is a must. As for the "Based on" disclaimer, lawyers require that so know one gets sued. Most movies follow the book loosely. I mean loosely so you don't get sued loosely.<br /><br />  Recipe for a Hollywood Epic; Bring in your hot star actors add a 200 million dollar budget, based on book script and mix together.  Walla. Hollywood "Epic" stamp.  The number one priority for epics is always base decisions on making money. Always.<br /><br />Trying to please film and book critics is an afterthought. Great acting is not the highest priority. Big scenes, big names, action and sexy, hot actors give the film some upfront marketability.<br /><br />As I have said before in reviews, movies have a short time span to entertain. Books are at the mercy of the individual. The modem of transportation remains the same. All the reviews that want the movie to follow the book more will never have their cake.</p></body></html>

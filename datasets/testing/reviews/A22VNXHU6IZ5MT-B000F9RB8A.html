This movies kicks some serious axe!!!"></head><body><p>What a great film,this was one of the suprise imports in the movie theaters,very funny stuff indeed,a very funny kung fu flick with a great story line too,The evil cigarette smoking landlady is very funny and memorable,as well as all the other great elements of this ultra cool film!!! I've had it twice on DVD (the original Widescreen and Axe Kicking Edition),but this Blu Ray Disc takes it even a step further witn great visuals,sound,and pretty much the same extras that were on the original Widescreen DVD release!!! A very recommdended Blu-Ray release!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+</p></body></html>

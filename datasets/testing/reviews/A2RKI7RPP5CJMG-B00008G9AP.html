<meta name="summary" content="Harry Does It Again!  Better Than The First!"></head><body><p>&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; pulls off something that only &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; has done.  It's better than the first film!  Not only is the story more interesting(though the first was tops as well), it's packed with even more wonder and imagination than the first as well.  The castmembers of the first flick return, as well as Kenneth Branagh in a superb performance as Lockhart, the bumbling, vain writer of &quot;Magical Me.&quot;<p>I'm sure the naysayers had a wonderful time bashing this sequel for its evil undertones.  Students get &quot;petrified&quot; and the basilisk takes shots at Harry, but all in all, Harry prevails.  He makes the right choices, does the good deeds and fights a good fight.  How dare he promote such horrible values!<p>Please folks, I used up a lot of space harping on how kids need to have fun in my review of the first film.  The same applies to this movie as well.  Don't worry about your kid becoming a warlock or praying to Satan, just let them have a little fun.  If you raise them right, you won't have to worry about any of that anyway.<p>The &quot;Potter&quot; books encourage kids to read and use their imagination.  That's a good thing in my book.  The movies encourage kids to use their imaginations as well.  <p>You've just got to love something that promotes so many good things.  We need more heroes like Harry.  He's a good character to let your kids read about and watch on the big screen.  He's caring to others, takes his studies reasonably serious(you might want to promote Hermione's study habits to your kids, though) and he always tries to do the right thing.<p>Overall this movie is fun and enjoyable for the whole family.  Some of the scenes might scare the little ones, but this movie is worth explaining those scenes in order to get the message across.  <p>Watch this one and have a ton of fun.  It's great for everybody.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

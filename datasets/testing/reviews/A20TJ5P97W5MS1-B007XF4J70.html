Defines old school classic. It was directed by Michael Curtiz, starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, and featuring Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. This movie has a plot that appears to be simple but could possibly be more complicated then life itself.<br />The great Humphrey Bogart plays Rick. Rick owns a bar in Morocco during World War II called Rick's Cafe. This bar & casino is frequented by shady characters from all over Europe. Most of these individuals are looking for one of three things: a drink, freedom, or love. One random night it all changes when Rick's old squeeze walks in and brings all the familiar feelings with her. The only problem is that this ain't no ordinary girl. She is beautiful and she is directly connected to the resistance. Love or liberty? This film asks the big questions in a fun way. It is still going strong today and you certainty don't need special effects to see why. You can practically smell the booze and feel the heartache. Watch it then, watch it now, and watch it tomorrow: Casablanca is as cool as they come.<br /><br />Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="City of Sin"></head><body><p>This past Sunday, I went to see Sin City, another in my recent binge of comic-book-based flicks. The film is comprised of three main stories. One features an unrecognizable Mickey Roarke as a reformed ex-con enforcer-type, who's been set up for murder. Another features Bruce Willis as an about-to-retire straight-shooter cop, who takes the fall for a nasty crime he didn't commit. The last features Clive Owen as a defender of the Old Town ladies of the evening, who run into a spot of trouble when they off an abusive, seedy chap who turns out to be a cop. There's a large, talented, well-known cast...except for Jessica Alba, who's nice looking but I'm not yet convinced that she's picked up any acting chops.<br /><br />The movie's cinematography has the feel of a comic book, right down to its core. Everything's noir-ish, in primary comic-book colors, with odd camera angles that give it just that right feeling. The dialog is similarly stylized, and it's also pretty crude at times...not for younger children. Lots of stylized, noir-ish violence to be seen here as well. Just for reference, there's nowhere near as much violence here as in, say, Kill Bill Volume 1.<br /><br />All in all, I was pretty pleased with the movie. Surprised by how will Roarke did; it's been a long time since I've seen him in anything. Worth seeing...but don't be taking your kids.</p></body></html>

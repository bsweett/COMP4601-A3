<meta name="summary" content="10 People, In a Local Motel, Vanishing One After Another...."></head><body><p>Imagine ten characters mostly unknown to each other, and they are trapped in a local motel because of the hard rain falling.  Then suddenly, they start to vanish one after another leaving only a room key numbered 10, 9, 8....  Is this a clue, or a message.  If message, from whom?<p>These travellers include John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay.  One is a policeman; another a chauffer; another his employer (and a has-been star).  Inspite of their varied personal background, they seem to have something in common, which is to be revealed sooner or later.  <p>If you are a total stranger to the genre, you might not notice it, but this idea is clearly borrowed from Agatha Christie novels.  But &quot;Identity&quot; gives an unexpected twist ... which is provided by the 11th character.  That is a crucial point, but some of you will detect the plot device, one of the pivotical point of &quot;Identity,&quot; in the middle of the story.  If so, just keep on watching, because another big surprise is waiting for you.<p>And that is also the weakness of the film, too.  As the plot unravels, the mysterious atmosphere gets thinner.  That is inevitable, considering the nature of the film.  Still, if you see the opening of the film which has a tense, sinister feeling all around, you might well regret the loss of it.  <p>Director James Mangold's foray into thriller is pretty successful, even though what he does is actually recycled from old classic films of the genre.  But he does it very competently, and it is certain that you get thrills especially from the first part of the film. <p>But the most memorable contribution to &quot;Identity&quot; is done from its production designer Mark Friedberg and its photographer Phedon Papamichael.  And like his previous &quot;Girl, Interrupted,&quot; James Mangold is endowed with talented cast.  Kudos to these great cast and crew, and &quot;Identity&quot; is a fairly good thriller though we ALMOST want to see it again to check in this motel.  Shame that there is no Norman here.</p></body></html>

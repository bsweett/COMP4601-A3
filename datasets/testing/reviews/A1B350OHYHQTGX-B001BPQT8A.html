<meta name="summary" content="Can't recover from Kevin Spacey"></head><body><p>The movie is so E V I L and B R I L L I A N T.<p>Both director David Fincher and author Richard Dyer are to be put in Jail..! They came up with the best homicidal movie ever to be made. So they are dangerous for the society!<p>Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt did a great job... especailly the facial expressions of Brad Pitt, I cry everytime I see them.<p>And as of Kevin Spacey, he was so convincing that it took me months to recover from hating him for being a PERFECT COLD BLOODED MURDERER.<p>I wish the DVD menus were not so distorted and more eye friendly to be navigated easily.<p>If you haven't seen this film, you are missing so much!</p></body></html>

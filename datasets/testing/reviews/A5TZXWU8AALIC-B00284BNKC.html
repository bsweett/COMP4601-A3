As great as it documents the hellish descent of four people into various drug addictions, it can't possibly be an enjoyable entertainment experience.  That said, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM stands along with DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES as a gripping film that bares all the pain and sadness of characters who fall victim to their vices.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful, especially the ladies.  Jennifer Connelly continues to rack up her impressive resume, and Ellen Burnstyn commits to film one of the bravest performances I've ever seen.<br /><br />After catching this film again on the Independent Film Channel just now, I've switched over to a news program where the talking heads are discussing legalizing drugs.  The smarter people know how deadly drugs can be, and the more cynical can shrug dope off as another method of natural selection, but the drug problem in this country--whether crack or pills or whatever--is a poison seeping into all of our lives.<br /><br />I know people who have died of drugs and, sadly, I know a few more who will.<br /><br />REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is the kind of drug movie people need to see.</p></body></html>

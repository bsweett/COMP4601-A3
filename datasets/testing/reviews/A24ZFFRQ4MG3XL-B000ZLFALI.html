It's great on DVD but I imagine the cinema experience would have been even more incredible.  This is such a fantastic musical movie, and whether you're a fan of the Beatles or not, you can't help but fall in love with the music and the characters.<br />It's set during the turbulent Vietnam War protest-era and it's told brilliantly.  The characters names are picked from different Beatles songs like Lucy, Jude, Sadie and Jo-Jo to name a few.  There are more than 30 Beatle's songs that tell the story of Jude and Lucy, such as Let It Be and All You Need Is Love and obviously, Across The Universe.<br />Joe Cocker makes a cameo as does Bono in a trippy scene with him singing I Am The Walrus.<br />I cannot tell you enough just how brilliant this is.  It's so much fun to watch and you can tell how much detail and passion must have gone into the making of it.  You can't help sing along throughout the movie and it's very very enjoyable.  I highly recommend it to anyone, even if you aren't a Beatles fan.  I love the extended music sequences in the bonus features (there are actually some other fantastic features too that make this even more special).  Go get a copy now.  You'll love it.</p></body></html>

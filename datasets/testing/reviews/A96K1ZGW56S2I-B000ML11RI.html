<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to Basin City."></head><body><p>After extolling his nihilistic tendancies through his magnum opus comic, BATMAN: THE DARK NIGHT RETURNS and the screenplays for ROBOCOP 2 & 3, Frank Miller returned to his comic book roots and modified his pessimistic worldview by writing a series of extremely gritty, largely black & white graphic novels that came to be known as part of the Sin City series. Miller hasn't had very many positive experiences with the Hollywood system and for the longest time swore he would never allow the Sin City books to be transformed into a movie.<br /><br />Then Robert Rodriquez entered the picture. Despite the fact that he shoots most of his films in his studio near his Southwestern home (in Texas I believe) and is a filmmaking maverick who not only directs his films, but usually writes, edits, and scores them as well; Rodriquez has established himself as a powerful Hollywood filmmaker. Rodriquez has been a fan of Miller's Sin City books from their first publication and secretly shot a short based on one of the stories as test to show to Miller. Rodriquez showed the short to Miller, Miller loved it and the short became the opening sequence to SIN CITY.<br /><br />SIN CITY is one of the most brutal crime noir films ever to be made. The movie tells a series of three and a half different tales that are loosely connected that take place in Basin City. Basin City is sort of an overly corrupt, crime-invested version of NYC. Things are so bad that grafitti artists have spray-painted over the "Ba" in the town's sign, thus the name "Sin City."<br /><br />Rodriquez used Miller's comics as the storyboards for the movie. Therefore, SIN CITY is filmed mostly in black and white with only the occasional dash of color: a red dress, a blue hot rod, a yellow deformed man, blond hair. Also, there is a bar in Sin City that virtually all the main characters in the movie have an association with. Sometimes in this bar things seem to lighten up and the cold black & white world outside is allowed to be tainted with a tinge of colors in their softest hues.<br /><br />The casting for SIN CITY is brilliant and all of the actors do a good job for their roles. The most exceptional performance is pulled off by Mickey Rourke who plays Marv. Marv's story is perhaps the most optimistic of the tales, even though it does include a beheading, cannibalism, and an execution.<br /><br />SIN CITY is an incredibly violent film and had it been shot in color would have probably received an NC-17 rating. There's all kinds of shootings and stabbings, several explosions, cannibalism, two beheadings, a castration, an attempted child rape, suicide, and other acts of violence I can't recall. Staying true to the color-style of the film, whenever someone bleeds, their blood is usually yellow or white, but never red.<br /><br />Depressing as the movie is, I have to admit that I did enjoy parts of the film.  I was rooting for Marv and hoping he would at least win the girl, if not the day. I was impressed by the cinematography. I liked the score. However, reflecting upon the movie later on, I was almost sick to my stomach.  Technically and cinematographically, the film is brilliant.  But as far as stories go, SIN CITY is true to its title and wallows in sin & filth; making it one of the bleakest films I have ever seen. It's definitely not a movie that everyone will enjoy, and even some who do (like myself) will discover later that it--like sin-really wasn't that great of an experience after all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I really enjoyed this movie. But."></head><body><p>Edward Norton gives a great performance. If you like him, you will like this film. The storyline  keeps getting lesser interesting as the movie goes on. The reason I give this film three stars is because I felt robbed of my time in the end. I mean, the end just didn't really do justice to the premise and a few things were left unexplained. The dialogues are decent. The sets and locations are fine. Some scenes in the first half were overwhelming while the sub-par end was the only major flaw I found in The Illusionist. The love story within the film was a tad dodgy cause there was no chemistry between the two involved. Paul Giamatti has done better films. His character had just one expression.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say, NOT BAD<br /><br />However, I will recommend this film to everyone. It's quite ambitious.</p></body></html>

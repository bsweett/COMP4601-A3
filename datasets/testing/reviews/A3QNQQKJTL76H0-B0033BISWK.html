<meta name="summary" content="One of the better sci-fi flicks to come along in the last 5 years"></head><body><p>District 9 is a refreshing break from the slew of mediocre big-budget sci-fi action flicks produced by Hollywood every year. Made on a tiny budget of $30 million by South African director Neill Blomkamp, it's amazing what he and his crew have been able to accomplish for so little money (comparatively speaking). The story is tightly woven and wonderfully acted by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor who plays the protagonist, Wikus van de Merwe. Blomkamp knows that the story drives a film, not the CG. The CG aids the storytelling, but shouldn't take center stage, something that many of the $150+ million Hollywood CG stinkers forget (ahem... <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NXSRX4">G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZIRM2">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a>). In D9, the CG (provided by Vancouver-based SFX house Image Engine) is perfectly blended into the environments and feels natural and realistic. It never sticks out or takes you out of the sense of immersion.<br /><br />The story is about an alien ship that came to Earth 20 years ago and stopped over Johannesburg, South Africa. There it stayed motionless until the government sent in cutters to open up the ship, where they found a race of cricket-like beings huddled in squalid conditions. Leaderless, malnourished, and numbering over one million, they are given refuge on Earth and confined to slums on the outskirts of the city. Rife with crime, poverty, and violence, District 9 is policed by a private military contractor called MNU (Multinational United) and controlled by a profiteering Nigerian warlord/illegal arms dealer and his thugs. At the beginning of the film, Wikus, whose doofy appearance and demeanor is reminiscent of a young <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009IW8OE">Peter Sellers</a>, is tasked with evicting the alien residents of District 9 and relocating them to another settlement. During a search for contraband, without giving away too much of the plot, Wikus makes a discovery that changes his life, turning him from an MNU agent into a reluctant hero.<br /><br />Visually, the film has a very coarse look. As widely publicized, the story is based on South Africa's struggle with apartheid, and was filmed in an actual township in Soweto to give the film a dirty and gritty sense of authenticity, using handheld Red digital cameras to heighten the documentary feel. The story is smartly written and the themes of corporate greed, racism/xenophobia, poverty, and corruption are not hard to believe. Replace the alien refugees with humans and you can find this kind of squalor in many parts of the developing world, like we saw in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9KR94">Slumdog Millionaire</a> (India) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9PNX">City of God</a> (Brazil). Crime in South Africa is rampant and it's one of the most dangerous places on Earth in real life. Some of the alien weaponry is very cool and people explode like watermelons. Limbs get severed and there is a good amount of violence and gore in the film, so be forewarned if you are sensitive to such imagery. The climactic showdown at the end is also very exciting and well done.<br /><br />Stated influences for the film include the Alien and Terminator series, Robocop, Predator, and others, so if you enjoyed these films, you'll probably enjoy D9. Highly recommended for the sci-fi fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Benefits of Ambulance Chasing!"></head><body><p>Julia Roberts gives an excellent and Oscar worthy performance of real-life character Erin Brockovich who in finding a way to make ends meet stumbles upon a case of big corporate bully and exploiter of the innocent against the simple folk and serves as the catalyst in putting ambulance chasing to good use for a change.  In stark contrast to the beginning of the show where Erin fails to take advantage of ambulance chasing on the small scale with her traffic accident claim the huge payoff she gets at the end of the show where she presumably helps more people than just herself and her kids seems to argue a case for the necessity of this particular form of legal practice to protect the little guy who would otherwise have no way to seek proper justice.<br /><br />It is indeed amazingly hypocritical for Americans to decry poisonous Chinese-made toys and/or melamine laced candy when they themselves are poisoning their own citizen's drinking water however this in no way excuses the Chinese situation naturally although it is interesting to see just how if given a chance American companies would happily kill innocents for the almighty dollar without a second thought.<br /><br />This dvd has good special features such as interviews with Erin herself as well as a making-of documentary.  The picture and sound quality are both good without any obvious blemish to report.  It's hard to resist an underdog makes good story like this one and for this reason, this film ages pretty well.  Not the best film I've ever seen but certainly not the worst either.</p></body></html>

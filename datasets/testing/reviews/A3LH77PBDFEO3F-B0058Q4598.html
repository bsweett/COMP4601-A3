<meta name="summary" content="Humanity is bad, but...."></head><body><p>After the universal disdain for this film, I wasn't going to buy it. My wife hates most Sci-Fi, and this was purported to be not good sci-fi, so wisely picking my movie battles, I was going to skip it. However, my sweet-heart decided to surprise me (it's the thought that counts) and we sat down and watched the DVD together.<br /><br />Here is the short version,<br />People are bad.<br />People are self destructive.<br />People need to be destroyed.<br /><br />People made classical music.<br />People love.<br />People can learn.<br />People need to be saved.<br /><br />So overall, political diatribe aside, it wasn't terrible all the way through, just really terrible in parts, and the rest was watch-able, but the bad parts are really and truly bad.<br /><br />On the plus side the CGI was quite good, but again the script was atrocious.<br /><br />2*</p></body></html>

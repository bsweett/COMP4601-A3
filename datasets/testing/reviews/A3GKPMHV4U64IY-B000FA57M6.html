<meta name="summary" content="Good for a Game-Based Movie"></head><body><p>The game Doom has inspired a lot of competition and a very-good series of novels.  It is not surprising that it would be made into a movie.  But like the books, the movie has to add a lot to the story to make it work.  A simple shooter is not a story.  This movie takes a different direction than the novels.  Most of the action takes place on Mars which can be reached through an ancient gate.  When a science installation comes under attack, a rescue squad is sent.  They don't know what they are going to find but they investigate in a professional manner.<br /><br />Soon they run into some of the horror game players expect.  Strange and powerful creatures no roam the installation.  The team must manage to fight them off while trying to figure out what is going on.  As expected, the body count begins to rise.  As tension escalates it is realized that the horror must not be allowed to get back through the gate to Earth.  Eventually the exact nature of the menace is played big time and we have the final showdown.<br /><br />Considering this is based on a game with almost no story it turned out pretty well.  The team would have been more believable if that had some sort of head protection but the makes wanted the actors faces unobscured.  I was also surprised at changing rates of spread.  For much of the movie it is a slow process but when a scene calls for it, it is almost explosive.  The Jekyll and Hyde nature was quite interesting but I felt the movie ended almost too easily.  There was no mopping up or even checking to see if mopping up would be necessary.  Still, these films are made for action and this one delivers it in full.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rock On, Man. Rock On."></head><body><p>THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is about a man named Dewey Finn who just won't "grow up."  Dewey has been doing odd jobs the last several years, living off his roommate and best friend, all so he can keep playing with his band and eventually get their big break. Then, one of the younger members of the band has a mutiny and kicks Dewey out. Dewey is despondent and after being seriously threatened to be thrown out of his apartment, he takes a job as a substitute music teacher at a high class private school pretending to be his roommate. Dewey gets the bright idea of getting the kids to be his new band and the musical hilarity begins.<br /><br />THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is implausible and is predictable (almost completely). However, it's also highly amusing and entertaining. I am not a huge fan of the rock music that is triumphed in the movie. Despite this, I was able to enjoy the movie and it's soundtrack. Jack Black is at his finest.  Also, Joan Cusack is perfect in her role as the strict principal, Rosalie Mullins, who longs for a little bit of love and friendship. The kids in the film are a joy to watch and the play off of Black's manic energy with an eager glee that the best of performers would have a difficult time dealing with.  The movie doesn't have any violence or foul language, though there are a few crude jokes and references to drug use. Rock on, man and stick it to the man.</p></body></html>

Essentially it's another Groundhog Day paradox movie, but in the future, where someone alters the current timeline through some sort of time travel mumbo jumbo.  That sci-fi vehicle is driven by the FBI's desperate hope to stop random European terrorists from detonating a nuke in LA.  As if anyone would notice.  Agent Ferris (Moore) leads the effort by pursuing Frank Cadillac (Cage), a cheesy Las Vegas magician who just happens to have the ability to see two minutes into the future.<br /><br />The filming has some really slick scenes, and the manner in which the filmmakers utilize Cadillac's talent is truly creative.  Nothing worse than a lack of imagination.  Right, Green Lantern?  Adding in Jessica Biel surely doesn't hurt.<br /><br />Fairly unoriginal, but aside from inconsistencies that are inherent in all sci-fi movies like this one, everything is done very well.</p></body></html>

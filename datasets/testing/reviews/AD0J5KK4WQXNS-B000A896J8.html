Considering that this is a Ridley Scott movie one has to beg the question - what on Earth did he think he was doing? Since the early 1990s Hollywood has been evading a movie about the Crusades... and now we can see why. An English blacksmith turns out to be the heir of a Jerusalem Knight and goes off there to find himself, only to replace his father and serve the King of Jerusalem who is having a hard time maintaining law and order in his own house while Muslims are knocking down his doors. Plotless, pointless and utterly boring, the fight sequences have been seen so many times before that you will just sleep your way into the end credits... and what a three hour nap it will be. For all the big names on display this really does leave much to be desired. Forget Gladiator or Troy. This one is clearly a no-brainer.</p></body></html>

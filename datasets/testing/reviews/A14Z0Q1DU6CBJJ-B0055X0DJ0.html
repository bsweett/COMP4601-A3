<meta name="summary" content="BAY being BAY"></head><body><p>I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. His MTVish, everything looks like a commercial, hyperactive directing style caters to the lowest-common denominator of film-making. Everything he has ever done has been so over-the-top and ridiculous, I personally think it's embarassing that his movies make as much money as they do. He insults our intelligence by removing creativity and replacing it with mind-numbing, "what the heck just happened", "that was ridiculous" explosions.<br /><br />That being said, I enjoyed TRANSFORMERS (the first one). It seemed to me that Michael Bay had finally found a movie where he could be his arrogant over-the-top self and nobody would notice. I mean, how more over-the-top can you get than robots that transform into cars, boats, planes and whatever else they feel like.<br /><br />Yet, TRANSFORMERS 2: RISE OF THE FALLEN showed Bay's over-the-topness in a different way. The least of which is the ability to shoot some of the most unnecessarily sexist shots of Megan Fox I've ever seen in a movie. The first time we see Mikaela Banes (Fox), she's leaning forward on her motorcycle in her short short shorts for everybody to drool over. Look, I appreciate the beauty that is Megan Fox just like the next guy. She's smokin' hot, but that camera shot is hands down, the most unnecessary camera shot in the history of film. Sure, for a sex movie or Basic Instict or such, but not TRANSFORMERS, a movie that is based off of a popular set of toys, cartoons and is catered toward young people.<br /><br />On top of that, we have to witness the unnecessary hanging testicles of one robot and countless other unnecessary instances.<br /><br />Then of course there's the action sequences that are so fast and confusing it had me thinking of SPEED RACER and how the creators needed to just tone it down a notch. Wrestling matches between robots become just a pile of twisted metal. Just F/X rolling around on screen.<br /><br />The entire final sequence was so rapidly edited and over here, over there, over here again, over there, here's a new place, who's that, what side is that robot on? who just got blown up? oh, there's some giant robot testies, explosion here, explosion there, run there, run here... and it's over.<br /><br />I had actually started to find a small place of appreciation for Michael Bay after the first Transformers movie, but now he's right back in the cellar with me. Too bad though. This isn't a bad movie. There are a lot of funny, entertaining, well-constructed moments in RISE OF THE FALLEN, it was just a movie that was poorly handled by an arrogant director who thought he had to do way too much stuff.<br /><br />I wanted to give it 2 stars, but there is enough entertainment to make it a worthy watch. It just could have been so much more if Michael Bay had an ounce of tact in his repertoire.<br /><br />Less is more Bay. Less is more.</p></body></html>

It is a depiction of the final days of the Third Reich from the perspective of Traudl Junge (Alexandria Maria Lara, as yet unknown to American audiences-- that will change soon), Hitler's secretary. Based on Junge's own memoirs and Joachim Fest's Der Untergang, Downfall shows a quick scene of Hitler interviewing Junge for the job, and then cuts to April of 1945, when everyone involved knows that no matter what happens, this will end badly. The film is for all intents and purposes plotless; Hirschbiegel is simply interested in exploring the different ways in which the characters are reacting to the stress of the imminent loss of the war. Hitler (peerlessly depicted by the great Bruno Ganz; this performance should have nabbed him an Oscar) gets sicker and more frail before our very eyes, while Eva Braun (Nowhere in Africa's Juliane Kohler) tries to keep up a happy-go-lucky air. Traudl and her friend Gerda (Perfume's Birgit Minichmayr) just try to muddle along. Schenk, an SS doctor (The Experiment's Christian Berkel, who also turns in an absolutely stunning performance) vacillates between simply trying to do his job and trying to talk sense into the other officers, who are doing their best Brownian motion impersionations, while the enlisted officers are separating into groups who do nothing but drink heavily and reminisce and those who become more fanatical by the day. There is a deep sense of nihlism about the whole affair-- it's Nero's Rome without the fiddling.<br /><br />It seemed to me while I was watching the movie that what made it truly great was that it did not end with the death of Hitler himself; the film continues for another forty minutes, getting more and more grim every second, as the Russians take over the last holdouts in Berlin and what would have been minor characters in most movies are allowed the full dignity of having their loose ends tied up. The darkness of this picture is relentless, from the literal darkness of the first scene-- Hitler interviewed for secretaries, it seems, in the middle of the night-- to the existential darkness of the long, brutal denouement. There is not one shred of hope to be found here, only fleeting, and spurious, happiness. And yet these characters go on, and the actors who play them play them going on exceptionally well. Hirschbiegel directs them going on, and does it in such a way that we can't help but feel the most sympathy for the greatest monsters-- who were, after all, human beings. Vastly misguided ones, perhaps, but in the end, they are us, just as the millions who died under them are us. Hirschbiegel never lets us forget that, and in doing so has made, as one critic trumpeted, perhaps one of the finest war films of all time. **** ?</p></body></html>

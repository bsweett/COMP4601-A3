Jake Gyllenhaal is charming as ever, with great support from Michelle Monaghan and always reliable Vera Fermiga. Loads of suspense, a somewhat clever script, and fine editing had me from moment one. It's really fun stuff, with the entire cast rolling with the punches. My only argument is that the usually reliable Jeffrey Wright was sorely miscast (was Michael Caine busy?). Duncan Jones' film is quite enjoyable, loaded with nuance and verve. I liked it a lot. Gyllenhaal never fails to charm.</p></body></html>

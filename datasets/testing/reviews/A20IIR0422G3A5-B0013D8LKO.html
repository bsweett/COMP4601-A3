<meta name="summary" content="Important movie from important director. Not his best."></head><body><p>`Eyes Wide Shut' is Stanley Kubrick's last film and like every other film where he had complete creative control (For `Spartacus' and `Paths of Glory', Kubrick was largely an employee of Kirk Douglas), there is much which is both brilliant and puzzling.<br /><br />From the outset, I will say that while there is much nudity and some fairly explicit sex in this film, it is clear to me that all of this was done for a greater dramatic effect than simple `soft core porn'. This case should be clear if you compare this film with `The Story of O' which, while it has honorable intentions and high aspirations to be something more than a piece of pornography, the difference in the level of artistry should be obvious, as `The Story of O' is very high class pornography and `Eyes Wide Shut' is not.<br /><br />Much can be adduced from Kubrick's source, a work of fiction by Arthur Schnitzler entitled in German,`Traumnovelle' or `Dream Novel'. While I am not up on the details of Schnitzler's work, I know he worked in pre-World War II Germany or Austria at a time when the doctrines of Sigmund Freud were easily at their high water mark, especially among playwrights and novelists. One needs a copy of Freud open to work out much of the symbolism in, for example, Eugene O'Neill's plays such as `Mourning Becomes Elecktra'. This means that any sexual references are certain to have at least two or more interpretations, as Herr Freud and his students found sex to be behind most motives. And, for men, at least, that belief persists to today.<br /><br />At the very least, this literary source gives us a clue that a lot of what we are seeing has many dreamlike properties, if not explicitly scenes from a dream. Another thing this source explains is why the locations for the story are much more at home in Paris or Berlin or Vienna or Prague or Rome or London (where the film was actually shot) than in New York City. While American robber barons build their fair share of large houses and estates, they can't hold a candle to the opulence found in pre-World War I European houses of the nobility. It would not be a bit surprised if Schnitzler's original story took place in Vienna and its outskirts.<br /><br />The problem with the dream scenario is that there is no evidence that the highly improbable centerpiece scene of the story, a highly ritualistic pairing of strikingly beautiful virtually naked, masked women are paired up with robed and cloaked members, seemingly both male and female, of the onlooking crowd, in a very European looking suburban estate. Admission to these proceedings are exclusively by password changed every day, and given out, it would seem, to a highly exclusive group of (probably) exeedingly wealthy people. And, everyone participating in this erotic pantomine wear Venetian style maskes.<br /><br />I confess that it took me three attempts to watch the movie to its conclusion without falling asleep before the ending credits roll. Part of that is my fault for watching it late in the evening, but part is due to the fact that the pace of the dialogue and business is almost somnambulistic. This is not the Tom Cruise of `Top Gun' or `Days of Thunder' or expecially `Rainman' when he was in top form. I believe the relaxed pace was certainly coming from Kubrick's direction and not Cruise's acting. I tried to picture a more high powered actor in the role such as Nicholas Cage or Russell Crowe, and I could not see them adding any real energy to the performance.<br /><br />The very best scene in the movie occurs when Cruise's character, a highly respected doctor, rousts the owner of a costume shop out of bed at 2:00 AM to rent a tuxedo, cape, shoes, and mask in order to attend the password access only estate party. The shop owner, played by Rade Sherbedgia is a perfect study of a first generation immigrant shop owner in New York City. This scene also gives us some clue that all is not as it seems when the shop owner discovers his very nubile teenaged daughter consorting in secret with two very oriental gentlemen, while the shop owner and daughter seem to be or some central European nationality. The aura of strangeness is doubled when the good doctor returns the clothes the next morning and meets the two oriental gentlemen and the shop owner in polite conversation, with no trace of the fatherly rage of the early morning.<br /><br />To cut to the chase, this is certainly not Kubrick's best or most memorable film. `2001', `Lolita', `Dr. Strangelove', `Full Metal Jacket', and `Clockwork Orange' are easily better. Even his rendition of the obscure Thackery novel, `Barry Lyndon', starring Ryan O'Neill has some better moments than `Eyes Wide Shut'. And yet, it may still be better than 2/3 of the other movies made today. Like all Kubrick movies, it definitely succeeds in making you think about the film.<br /><br />Recommended for Kubrick fans and fans of all other `autre' directors such as David Lynch, Peter Greenway, and Ken Russell.</p></body></html>

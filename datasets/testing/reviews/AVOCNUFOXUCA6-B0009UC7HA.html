<meta name="summary" content="Good-natured action movie"></head><body><p>"Sahara" is not a brilliant movie.  Its plot, to the extent there is one, is ridiculous and chock full of as many laughable and astounding coincidences as any Bond film.  Perplexingly popular Penelope pairs poorly with Matthew McConaghy.<br /><br />And yet, this movie works for what it is, and is an enjoyable and good-natured action picture.  If you turn off the logic part of your brain (and you will have to), the picture doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps moving at a good pace, and has a good sense of humor.  Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaghy are excellent, as is William H. Macy.  While not a top-tier actioner, this movie is entertaining, and is at least worth a rent.  Hey, it's better and more plausible than at least half of the Bond films.</p></body></html>

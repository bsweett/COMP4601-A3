Blade II is an action horror movie, This to is more of a drama horror movie, and a very slow one at that. Similar to the prophecy or the new exorcist movies. I likes the movies dark atmosphere and strange occurrences, but I can honestly say I would not want to sit through this movie twice. It just dragged on too much. So what your left with is a boring movie with some interesting spots in between. I didn't see a problem with the acting like others had mentioned, however I did see a problem with the lines. Some of the lines they say are not funny, out of place, or just stupid.<br /><br />Verdict<br /><br />Very so/so</p></body></html>

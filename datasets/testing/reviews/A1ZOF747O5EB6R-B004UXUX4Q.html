<meta name="summary" content="Clooney Brings It Off"></head><body><p>"The Descendants" covers family relations in the wake of an impending death against a backdrop of squabbles over a massive land inheritance.  When money is involved, family squabbles are always at their most tawdry.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer based on Oahu with an attractive wife as well as two daughters aged 10 and 17.  His wife is involved in a tragic accident and becomes, essentially, a vegetable.  She is diagnosed never to regain consciousness.<br /><br />It is during this trauma that King learns that his much-adored wife had been cheating on him.  This comes a terrific shock.  He must manage this trauma while at the same time coming to a conclusion on a family inheritance that dates back to the time of Hawaiian annexation.  The decision involves hundred of millions of dollars and he has to balance the competing objectives of his various cousins who are all potential beneficiaries.<br /><br />Clooney plays the part magnificently.  He is a struggling parent who is trying to understand his daughters whilst simultaneously managing his own savaged emotions.  He is ably supported by a strong cast playing his daughters, the broader family and friends.  Clooney may well have played himself into an Oscar.  It is hard to conceive that he will not receive a nomination.<br /><br />I recommend this film strongly.  Yes, it's a tear jerker but it's also a wonderful performance that deserves high accolades.</p></body></html>

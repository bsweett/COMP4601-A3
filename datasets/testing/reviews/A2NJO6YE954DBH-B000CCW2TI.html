<meta name="summary" content="Rachel McAdams gets seated next to the passenger from Hell"></head><body><p>"Red Eye" is a movie that puts most of its cards on the table.  At the start we see a wallet with a pair of initials on it being stolen.  We also see a large metal container being smuggled into the United States.  Two points determine the pathof a line and we know that these two events are connected.  Actually if you assume that everything you see and hear in this 2005 thriller has something to do with what is going on.  If Carl Ellsworth (who wrote the "Halloween" episode of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") has somebody on the airplane suddenly talk about a missing pen, then that would be a CLUE, and attention must be paid.  That does not mean that director Wes Craven ("Scream/2/3") will not play with your expectations in an effort to keep things honest, but for the most part you can see how everything is set up and red herrings are pretty nonexistent.  The result is more a question of anticipation than predictability and it was not until the big finish that I actually got to the point where I was saying (out loud in fact) that this could not be the "end" because "X" had not happened yet, which is pretty good for a thriller.<br /><br />The genesis for this film was apparently the simple idea of what happens if you get on an airplane and end up being seated next to the passenger from Hell.  At this point many of you will be thinking back to "Planes, Trains & Automobiles," but this film is something quite different because it takes place in a world where apparently nothing is coincidence.  Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is a hotel desk manager for a swank hotel in Miami, who is heading home from Dallas after attending her grandmother's funeral.  Her flight is delayed and she has occasion to meet Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) more than once before she gets on the flight and discovers they are seatmates.  He wants to know if she is stalking him and what proves to be a deadly game begins in earnest.<br /><br />I have to admit that when I watched this DVD I had managed to forget anything I might have heard or read about "Red Eye."  Obviously Lisa is the heroine and Jackson is the villain (after this and "Batman Begins," Murphy is going to have to make an earnest effort to avoid being typecast in such roles).  But since all the dots connect in this film it has to have something to do with Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia), the new head of Homeland Security who said some rather stupid things on television for someone whose position has to do with defense and not offense when it comes to terrorists.  Before she gets on the plane Lisa is juggling cell phone calls from her father (Brian Cox) and her nervous assistant, Cynthia (Jayma Mays), and the film puts more of its cards in position on the table.  But there is a hole card, which is revealed when Lisa has to change her blouse (talk about bait and switch).<br /><br />The best thing this film has going for it is Rachel McAdams.  In case you did not notice, 2005 was a very good year for the actress.  After being the blonde Queen Bee in "Mean Girls" back in 2004, she went back to dark hair and did "The Notebook."  Then in 2005 she made "Red Eye" in between "Wedding Crashers" and "The Family Stone."  She may well be the best thing in all three of those films, but this is the one where she has to do the most heavy lifting.  Her character is smart, which only makes her more attractive as far as I am concerned, and despite her vulnerability we do not believe that she will be a victim.  There are some moments where both the heroine and the villain are conveniently stupid (when you get somebody down, go all in and finish them off: everybody in my family knows this), but there are enough smart moments and we are rooting for Lisa, so such slights can be easily forgiven.</p></body></html>

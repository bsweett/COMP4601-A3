Directed by James L Brooks yes the same guy from The Simpsons movie he also directed Terms Of Enderment. It stars Jack Nicholson as Melvin, Helen Hunt as Carol Connelly, Greg Kinnar as Simon Bishop,  Cuba Gooding jr as Frank & Jesse James as Spencer Connelly.  Story is Melvin is obsessive compulsive novelist he doesn't get along with his neighbors in his apartment & he also hates his G  a  y neighbor Simon's dog & throws it down a shute into the garbage. When he's confronted on it Jack Nicholson gets some hilarious verbal ownage in " Never interrupt me again ok? Not if there is a fire not even if you hear the sound of a thud & ! week later there is a stench so bad that you have to hold a hanky over your face cause the stench is  from a decaying body. Even if it's election night & some fudge pa  c  k  er you date has been elected the 1st qu  e  e  r President of The US & he's on his way to Camp David & you want someone to share the moment with. Even then don't come knocking. Not for ANY reason. Do you get that sweetheart." It's like they wrote it for Jack Nicholson inn mind. He eats breakfast at the same restaurant every morning at the same table he has an interest in this waitress Carol Connelly she's the only 1 that tolerates him eventually she finds out what kind of man he is. His neighbor Simon was robbed by these thugs & beaten up pretty bad & has to go to the hospital his agent Frank forces him to take care of his dog.  Melvin becomes attached to the dog. Carol has a son Spencer he's acutely asthmatic Carol decides to get a job closer to home he can't adjust to the new waitress. He actually pays for the medical bills to get him the treatment he needs. Simon who is recuperating has lost his artistic will & close to being evicted. Frank asks Melvin to drive Simon to Baltimore to ask his parents for money. Melvin invites Carol to go she reluctantly agrees to go. From there we get some good character development & these people aren't perfect the portrayal is real. Melvin & Simon have a great back & forth. Like when Simon talks about his troubled childhood Melvin responds " Some of us have great stories pretty stories that take place on lakes & boats & Noodle Salad. Just no one in this car. But a lot of people that's their story good times noodle salad. What makes it so hard is not that you had it so bad but so many others had it good." You know I could go on & on but the performances are really good Jack Nicholson was great. Helen Hunt could be b  it  c  h  ybut she was still pretty good. Jesse James wasn't in it a lot but I cared about his character. Cuba Gooding Jr didn't have a whole lot to do but he was good for what he had to work with. Greg Kinnar was off & on to me but worked very well. So that's As Good As It Gets. & I'll have more random movie reviews.</p></body></html>

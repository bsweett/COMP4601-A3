<meta name="summary" content="No , Really Barbra, They're Coming To Get You!"></head><body><p>Barbra and her goofball brother Johnny are putting a wreath on their father's grave one cold damp afternoon. Little do they know that across the eastern third of the united states, the dead are rising and feasting on the flesh of the living! One of the zombies attacks Barbra. Johnny comes to her rescue, only to be overpowered by the walking cadaver! Barbra runs, trying to escape in the car, which has no keys! The dead guy breaks out the passenger-side window with a rock, just as Barbra releases the emergency break, sending her down a hill and into a tree. Barbra gets out just in time and runs to a nearby farmhouse. Once inside, she finds a corpse at the top of the stairs, stripped of it's flesh from the neck up. Enter Ben (Duane Jones), the true hero of the story. He's a cool, smart, tough-under-pressure man who has just arrived after fleeing from a swarm of undead. Ben begins fortifying the house, nailing boards over the doors and windows. Barbra is in shock and remains mostly silent. Later, a group of living folks come up from the cellar, where they've been hiding. This includes a young man named Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley), and the Coopers- Harry (Karl Hardman), Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter, who was bitten by a zombie sometime earlier. Well, Harry Cooper is a know-it-all type and immediately wants to take control of the situation. The problem is, he's also a gutless coward, and Ben has to put him in his place more than once. Can this motley group survive the night while a legion of flesh-eaters gathers outside? George A. Romero created THE classic zombie movie with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Only his remarkable DAWN OF THE DEAD even comes close to (perhaps surpasses) it's visceral impact. Romero's use of radio and TV coverage of the zombie invasion adds realism and texture (you can just imagine the 24 / 7, wall-to-wall coverage on the 24 hr news channels of today). The "closed in / cut off" feeling of the characters is portrayed perfectly. I highly recommend this movie to all zombie-lovers everywhere, as well as those who hate most recent hollywood attempts at "horror"...</p></body></html>

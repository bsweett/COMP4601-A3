<meta name="summary" content="Art film... Or film from comic art?"></head><body><p>Ang Lee is a brilliant director. That being said, I don't think Universal should have handed this movie to him. Comic book movies need to remember from whence they came. They need to remember who their core audience is. This movie does neither. It is an excellent movie. It's just not the movie that it should have been.<p>The movie looks great. Eric Bana seems to be sleepwalking through the better part of the film. Jennifer Connelly does her usual great job. Nick Nolte should join Over-Actors Anonymous. The effects are top-notch. And still, this isn't the Hulk that I wanted to see on the big screen.<p>The old CBS series, much of which is now available on DVD, came closer to the tone that should have been here. A man who is tortured by what he's become on a search to find the cure. This movie makes the same mistake that the "Lost in Space" movie made. It all boils down to "Everything will be alright if only my Dad would love me."<p>The franchise that could have been "The Hulk" now gives way to this solo movie. Enjoy it for what it is, or for what it could have been.</p></body></html>

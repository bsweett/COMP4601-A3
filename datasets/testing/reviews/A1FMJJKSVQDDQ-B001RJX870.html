<meta name="summary" content=""The German people have chosen their fate . . .""></head><body><p>Das Boot is still my favorite war film, but Downfall is just as great. This  film, which deals with the last days of Hitler and the Reich, is something that we aren't really accustomed to these days. Like Das Boot, we get to see the German P.O.V. rather than the American/British/Russian, only here it is a bit more striking because it involves the notorious dictator himself. We get to see his ruthless paranoia and isolation as Russian forces are gaining victory around Berlin. We also get to see the people around him who start to see that Nazi Germany has been greatly defeated. It's a very disturbing experience, and once the end credits roll, we are left with awe and shock.<br /><br />This is a fantastic foreign film that should've won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film (or at least have a tie with The Sea Inside). Grade: A</p></body></html>

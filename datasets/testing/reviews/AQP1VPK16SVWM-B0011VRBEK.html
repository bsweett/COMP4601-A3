<meta name="summary" content="Stunning suspense thriller"></head><body><p>Imagine a Hitchcock thriller crossed with Raymond Chandler's "Farewell My Lovely" with a twist of David Lynch thrown in for good measure and you'll get an idea about how inventive, startling and powerful "Old Boy" is. Chan-wook Park's film dazzles with stunning imagery but more importantly with a brilliantly supversive mystery at its core. Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped after a celebratory night. He was headed home for his young daughter's birthday when he disappears. When he wakes up he finds he's a prisoner in a cutrate hotel without windows and a metal door. His meals are slid under the door to him, his only companionship is a TV and his grip on sanity begins to slip away after 15 years of confinement. Suddenly, he's released without explanation. He's given a cellphone, a wallet full of money and 5 days to discover who imprisoned him and why. Filled with rage when he discovers that his wife was murdered and he was framed for it, Oh Dae-Su tries to try down his young daughter with the help of a sushi chef he meets and gradually falls in love with. This twisted, dark tale has more twists and turns than a mountain road. Oh Dae-Su gradually unravels the mystery which stands at the heart of his existence but with each bit he unravels he discovers more unanswered questions.<br /><br />The image quality on this disc is extremely good as is the sound. The film can be viewed in the original Korean (although English is the default language for the film)and there are subtitles which, amusingly, don't always match what the English dubbed track has. Featuring a director's commentary as well as deleted scenes(with optional commentary) and theatrical trailers for this film and others in the Tartan Asia Extreme Cinema DVD releases, "Old Boy" like "Momento", will keep you guessing all the way to the conclusion. If this was an ordinary mystery, I'd say it would be worth viewing one time but the dazzling directorial skill of Park and the strong performances by the actors (as well as the well written script)make this graphic, violent suspense thriller worthwhile.<br /><br />You'll be glued to your seat as you try and put together the pieces of the puzzle about why this ordinary man's life is taken apart and, more importantly, why he has to put together the pieces of the mystery to regain his life again. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>I just finished watching this movie with hubby an hour ago for the first time. I never seen or new there was a Terminator 4. I just new about Terminator 1 and 2. When I looked up 1 and 2 to order off of Amazon I found out about 3 and 4. I now have all 4 Terminators. I've been watching each one in order the past few days. And I think Terminator 4 is a good movie. I don't think it is the best Terminator. The 3rd Terminator is the best one, but I enjoyed it just as much as the other three.</p></body></html>

I expected a corny schlocky teen flick (and there is some of that) but it is so creepily done that the thrills outweigh the drawbacks in this one.  Basically, the gang is marked for death - they know it and we know it.  The thrills come into play with the when and the how.  Wong TEASES us to death with this part of the film. Great, elaborate teases arise as each character meets his/her doom. Most of the tension comes from the set-ups and they are very well done. Fun, effective and eerie.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

They trick a helicopter to land in the wrong place and steal a passenger's brief case.  James Bond enters a North Korean military base posing as a buyer for weapons and paying with the briefcase full of diamonds.  The deal goes badly as he is recognized by Zao who is Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's assistant.  The briefcase is filled with African conflict diamonds.  In trying to escape Bond blows up the briefcase and Zao is injured as diamonds imbed themselves into his face by the force of the explosion.<br /><br />Colonel Moon tries to escape Bond by using a hover craft as Bond commandeers another smaller one and chases after him.  In typical James Bond style a battle ensues and Colonel Moon goes over a waterfall in the hovercraft while Bond is captured and imprisoned in North Korea.  He is in prison and tortured for 14 months and then released in a prisoner exchange for Zao....<br /><br />This is an action packed 007 movie with a high tech plot.  I didn't mention but Halle Berry in the story as Jinx a NSA agent.  As in most Bond films the movie is filmed in exotic locations around the world and the story line is very good.  Halle plays a perfect match to Pierce Brosnan's 007 and the chemistry is sultry.  Pierce has always played a good role as Bond and he doesn't disappoint us in this movie.  Even Madonna appears in a cameo role in the middle of the movie and she has an encounter with Bond while she introduces him to the antagonist of the film.<br /><br />This movie has spectacular special effects and stunts that will really hold your attention.  There are several plot twists and turns and this movie is really a good one.  I recommend it to you.</p></body></html>

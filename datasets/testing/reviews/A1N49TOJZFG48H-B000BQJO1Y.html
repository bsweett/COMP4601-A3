<meta name="summary" content="THE GOLD STANDARD 4"></head><body><p>this is an enGROSSing , absorbing , gripping , unique , scary , intelligent , fun pre CGI horror picture . others will go on at great length about its' attributes . they're right . i really haven't anything additional to add but my vote . they make lots of great film now . this is how they did it circa 78' on a relatively modest budget (that's an enormous understatement) . GEORGE ROMERO is a genius .</p></body></html>

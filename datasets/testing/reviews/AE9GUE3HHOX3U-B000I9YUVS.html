The first 20 minutes were borderline interesting, then it just got REALLY BAD.  Selma Blaire seemed like she was on something, her voice sounded like she was hagging out, all raspy and lethargic. She even utters a line "can someone beam me out of here" and it looked as though she was looking right at the camera.  Tom Welling is a one trick pony.  You need more than the "hot" factor to be a credible and talented actor.  He's a horrible crap actor, and they just had to get him with his shirt off, ok! who cares.  The minute he opens his mouth you just want to fall asleep.  Then the fog rolls in.......WHO CARES!  This film is borderline unwatchable, I turned it off half way through because it just didn't interest me. Next!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Very Intertesting Movie"></head><body><p>I enjoyed "Enternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". Jim Carrey is wonderful in the lead role. And Kate Winslet is also really good in it.<br />  The story itself is very interesting, but somewhat complicated.<br />Its kind of a Science-Fiction-Love Story. And you have to be really willing to suspend belief. Its not realistic at all and you really have to pay attention to the story line.<br />  It is a very different kind of movie. But still very enjoyable.<br />And the acting performances are outstanding.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Some of Eastwood's Best"></head><body><p>The west is revisited in this beautifully transferred HD DVD version of the Academy Award winning "Unforgiven".<br /><br />Extras include a 1959 episode of "Maverick" featuring a young Clint Eastwood - most certainly a lot sharper than seen before - this is one of the high points that add great value to this HD DVD in my opinion. Hours of other extras about "Unforgiven" and about Clint Eastwood and his career also accompany this HD DVD.<br /><br />"Unforgiven" isn't the "best" western I've ever seen, nor does it quite capture an authentic west so much as it captures a more "studio-and-costumer" west, but that's just me. It is a gritty western painted with vigilante justice of severe consequences, along with life-lessons, old-west style.<br /><br />The performances were very nice - Gene Hackman played his character well, but I didn't quite "get" him...maybe a second viewing will do the trick. The story moves along a bit slowly, but plays out effectively. I didn't get "lost" in it, but I did like it.<br /><br />The lightning is clearly a studio lamp, but the low, rolling thunder sets a nice dark mood.<br /><br />I would guess that you've got to like westerns to like this film, as it may not make you a fan of the genre on its own, as the classics might. But as far as value goes, there are plenty of extras and the movie is well done.</p></body></html>

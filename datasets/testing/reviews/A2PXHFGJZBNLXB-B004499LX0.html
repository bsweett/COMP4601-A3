<meta name="summary" content="Glamorized hollow misanthropy, in my opinion"></head><body><p>One of the previous reviewers of Mike Nichols' CLOSER called it "one of the most raw and honest portrayals of 21st century relationships." Sorry if this offends you, ma'am, but if you find Patrick Marber's hopelessly sour depiction of 21st century relationships truthful---if you agree with his implicit argument that people in our modern times have lost the ability to truly love each other and be honest with each other in relationships, no matter how hard they may try to make a show of affection and honesty---then I can only imagine what hurt you've gone through in your romantic life to lead you to make a similar conclusion.<br /><br />CLOSER is the sad chronicle of four lives ruined by cheating, lying, and manipulation. Anna the photographer (Julia Roberts) breaks the heart of Larry the dermatologist (Clive Owen) by sleeping with Dan the writer (Jude Law), who himself breaks the heart of Alice the stripper (Natalie Portman). The movie basically follows these four characters as they all hurt each other, some willingly, some unwillingly. There are very few scenes that elicit any sense of hope for these people; they remain self-absorbed and plain selfish from beginning to end.<br /><br />So, these are not very likable characters. Not a problem, necessarily; I've seen plenty of movies and TV shows in the past that have had unappealing characters, but have been so well written and insightfully performed that I nevertheless feel compelled to observe these characters during the course of the film or episode. (An example: the hit TV show "Everybody Loves Raymond" can sometimes make you wince more than laugh---especially when someone get Patricia Heaton's Debra Barone angry!---but I still maintain an admiration for its occasional priceless insights into family life, even in the midst of crazy family dysfunction.) Likewise, I might have accepted the bald manipulations of these four nasty specimens more readily if the movie actually highlighted some startling truths about modern relationships. The cynical side of me is perfectly willing to accept the filmmakers' notion that people these days have become a little more selfish in love. But the way Marber presents his thesis here, there is no connection to anything resembling real life---especially in his dialogue, which can be impressive when it doesn't simply sound all-too-written---to ground his misanthropic ideas in some kind of realistic footing. The result is a movie that seems less like an expose of harsh truths, more like a grotesque fantasy about glamorous people mindlessly inflicting terrible emotional pain on each other.<br /><br />I can't really fault the performances, though---at least Natalie Portman's and Clive Owen's. It was an inspired decision to cast the innocent-looking Portman as the stripper who gets hurt by Dan and wisens up considerably afterwards; Portman relays an occasionally touching vulnerability (although, admittedly, that is the only note Portman really emphasizes in her performance here), and Nichols smartly mines it for irony in the film's closing scenes. Clive Owen also burrows into his role with all the intensity and emotional honesty he can find from a role that requires him to be hurt and angry in one scene, and then coldly vengeful the next, almost on a dime. As for Jude Law and Julia Roberts...well, Law plays his character like such a sensitive fellow that you sometimes can't believe that this timid-seeming man could brutally hurt Alice the way he does. And while Roberts effectively dials down the movie-star wattage here, she does seem somewhat ill at ease in parts of this movie. When she hurls sexual obscenities at Larry in one scene, Roberts' delivery makes those words sting with all the power of a dead bee.<br /><br />But perhaps one shouldn't blame Law or Roberts if they have trouble giving consistent performances in this movie. Their roles are in the service of a shallow vision of modern relationships that seems so divorced from any sense of reality that any actor might have trouble trying to find any kind of emotional truth in this kind of role. I expected CLOSER to be edgy and compelling; it is both, but it is also witless and frankly pointless, in my opinion. Forget the hype; you can easily skip this one.</p></body></html>

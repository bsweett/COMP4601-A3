<meta name="summary" content="5 star cinema"></head><body><p>A hilarous and campy film that hits the spot on orginality.  Will Smith continues his comedic acting as the young hotshot rookie. And Tommy Lee Jones does a great job as the overbearing yet lovable experience "MIB" character.  Both actors bring life and vitality to the movie and characters they play.  A film that brings a great sense of comedic punch lines and humorous slapstick.  A great for the whole family to watch.</p></body></html>

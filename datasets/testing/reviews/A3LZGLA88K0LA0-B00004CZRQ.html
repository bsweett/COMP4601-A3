<meta name="summary" content="STILL ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL HORROR FILMS EVER"></head><body><p>Thirty years later and I still find &quot;The Exorcist&quot; a powerful, disturbing, and amazing work of art.  William Friedkin's direction is superb, the score including Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS still one of the best, and the whole project an exercise in terror.  Let's go beyond the obvious special effects and the frightening possession of Regan McNeil, and look at the stunning performances Friedkin elicited.<br />Ellen Burstyn is outstanding; her mother role goes from the pampered movie star trying to stay close to her daughter to the pure terror of seeing her child possessed by Satan.<br />Jason Miller in his guilt-ridden role of Father Karras is mesmerizing.  Tormented and doubting his faith, he nonetheless conquers these and propels the movie's grueling climax.<br />Max von Sydow as Father Merrin is brilliant in his subtle performance of a man near death faced with the unbelievable task of exorcising not just a demon, but the devil himself.<br />Linda Blair's performance is all the more amazing in that as everyone knows, Mercedes McCambridge mouthed the demon's voice, but Linda was there physically and her agony (especially in those awful hospital tests) demonstrates what potential she had, that was unfortunately never fully tapped in later films.<br />Kitty Winn as Burstyn's personal assistant was also very good in a supporting, almost invisible role.<br />And let's not forget Lee J. Cobb as Kinderman, a cop with a heart and soul a great pickup line.<br />THE EXORCIST has never been duplicated for its gut-wrenching horror and it's ability to creep under your skin no matter how often you've seen it.<br />A true classic in any genre.</p></body></html>

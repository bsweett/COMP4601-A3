<meta name="summary" content="This should have gotten Tom Cruise an Oscar!!!"></head><body><p>And it probably would have if he had done this one back in the early to mid 90's when people were falling all over themselves with his "Jerry MaGuire" this one is by far one of Cruise's best, if not the best performance of his whole career, In this he is Vincent, an aging hitman who has five hits he has to make in one night in Los Angeles, but it is clear he is not familiar with the city & enlists the services of a cab with Jamie Foxx as the unsuspecting cab driver who shuttles him around as he makes his hits, the first one goes horribly wrong as the victim falls out of a window & lands on the top of the cab no less, it is here that Foxx realizes what is going on &  Vincent has no choice but to involve him in his hits, as they load the body into the trunk, the next hit is successful, but when Vincent leaves Foxx handcuffed to the stirring wheel, some punks try to rob him & steal Vincent's breifcase containing his hitlist, this is cool moment as Vincent intervines & immediately takes out the punks so fast that you have to see it to beleive it in a rather satisfying moment, the third hit is a bit more sad, all this action draws the attention of the local police as we learn that Vincent's hits are those of people slated to testify at a criminal trial, Mark Ruffulo(13 Going on 30) is on hand as a cop following Vincent's mayhem with Peter Berg as his reluctant partner who it seems just doesn't care about these victims, the fourth hit is a bit more tense as Vincent sets his sights on the victim in a nightclub full of patrons & this victim's security force, with Ruffalo & many Swat team members attempting to save the guy, all hell breaks loose in a scene that is a bit diffucult to describe, you just have to watch it, Vincent of course makes his kill & quietly leaves amid frantic people running in all directions, his last kill is a lawyer leading the case, Jade Pinkett Smith is the attourney who is the last target, who Foxx had met early on in the film's opening moments, Foxx soon realizes this & attempts to stop Vincent in which a cat & mouse game ensues between the three of them with a rather satisfying ending, again, this one should have gotten Tom Cruise an Oscar, his Vincent is so cool & reserved that you actually forget that this is Cruise playing the part, Cruise embodies this character in a way that you  just forget that it is him in the role, this was definately a step away from the roles that Cruise usually plays, & like him or hate him, you have to give him credit for taking on an unconventional role, somthing that most actors are afraid to do, if the Media & Hollywood hadn't turned on him as they have now turned on Mel Gibson, I believe he would have been nominated by the Academy.... don't be put off by your dislike for Cruise, this is one great film, & director Michael Mann once again makes Los Angeles come alive, just like in his other film "Heat" Los Angeles becomes a charater here too, the city never looked better at night.</p></body></html>

Whether these heroes be adapted from books, comic books, video games, or real life, they each have several traits in common in which we all relate; from their capacity for good, to trying their best to do what's right, and of course, no matter the obstacles set before them, always fight for those that cannot fight for themselves. Each of our cinematic heroes always seems to embody the very best in all of us. Among the ranks of cinema's greatest heroes is a character that was born from a novel by writer David Morrell, and at first glance didn't seem destined to be the great action hero he later became over the course of three sequels. The character I am referring to is the other most popular character that Sylvester Stallone embodied outside of boxer Rocky Balboa, none other than John Rambo, the Vietnam veteran and former Green Beret, who wanted nothing more than to find acceptance from the very country that he had fought and bled for when it needed him most. Of course, Rambo never would have become the hero we love if not for the excellent film that started it all, "First Blood" from director Ted Kotcheff ("Uncommon Valor") that introduced audiences to the tortured soul of a man simply looking for a place to belong.<br /><br />"First Blood" is the story of Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who is traveling the country trying to find former brothers-in-arms; instead, all he finds is heartache as each and every one of his friends from the war have died, leaving him all alone in a world that seems it would rather forget he and his kind ever existed. As he walks into a small town looking for a bite to eat, the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) deems him to be a disturbance and proceeds to usher him quickly out of town. However, Rambo refuses and is subsequently arrested for vagrancy, but after the local police make the terrible mistake of mistreating their newest prisoner, Rambo feels that his only course of action is to free himself of their custody, and flee to the surrounding woods. As the local police are hunting him, Rambo's splintered mind is taking him back to his time as a Green Beret, and all of his lethal training begins to take over. Realizing the high cost of their mistake, the police turn to a man who knows John Rambo all too well, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who desperately wants to ensure Rambo's safe apprehension, while at the same time averting anymore bloodshed before it's too late. Now, in a strange town, surrounded by people who appear to hate and fear him, Rambo believes he is fighting a new kind of war and he will stop at nothing to survive, and ultimately win.<br /><br />"First Blood" is an engaging look at the trauma many veterans face upon returning home and finding that the reception isn't quite what they expect it to be. The film examines not only the ramifications of war on those who proudly serve their country in times of need, but also what could happen when a man is pushed too far and what he may be willing to do to protect himself. It is surprising that the serious topic of how we as a country have treated our veterans, namely those of the Vietnam War, is front and center in this action-packed film. It is this higher quality storytelling that elevates "First Blood" into becoming much more than your average action movie.<br /><br />The superior quality of the story for the film came from author David Morrell, who wrote the original novel the film was based upon, it was then adapted into a screenplay by writers Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Sylvester Stallone. Though I've read that the film differs in numerous places from the book, if not for that initial novel this film may not have had the same level of depth, social commentary, and realism that made "First Blood" so much better than other action movies of its time. Assisting in the quality of the film, was the solid, no frills direction from director Ted Kotcheff, who by choosing to film on location imbued the film with a gritty, natural feeling in tone that could not have been captured as easily on a back lot of some studio in Hollywood.<br /><br />The acting from Sylvester Stallone was some of the best he has ever done in any of his films. We all knew from his 'Rocky' series of films that he could handle the action scenes and even the dramatic ones, but it was the pure emotion he brought to the character that was so surprising, especially in that riveting final scene in the police station. Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy were superb in their supporting roles as Colonel Trautman and Sheriff Teasle. Crenna created a pseudo-father figure for Rambo with Trautman, and provided audiences, along with the characters in the movie, the interesting insights into the possible mindset of Rambo, and also just what exactly he is capable of. As a credit to his talent, Crenna's character of Trautman not only became one of his most popular characters throughout his entire career, but his character's brief moments of exposition may have been the key point in the film in which Rambo went from being just a misunderstood war veteran, to one of Hollywood's iconic heroes. Brian Dennehy was perfect as the seemingly good natured Sheriff when we first meet him, to becoming the slimy villain, who along with the rest of his police force, embodied the viewpoint of the numerous protestors to the Vietnam War and its veterans, and all others who have judged rather than respect our veterans throughout the history of our country.<br /><br />"First Blood" is an extremely well made survival-themed adventure film that is full of intensity, drama, and exhilarating action sequences that will have you riveted until the film's final moments. A must-see for all action movie fans and is an exciting opening chapter to one of Hollywood's most action-packed franchises. As a tribute to just how enduring the character of Rambo is within Hollywood, 2008 saw the return of the hero in the appropriately titled "Rambo", the fourth film in the franchise, and the first 'Rambo' film in 20 years.<br /><br />"First Blood" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></body></html>

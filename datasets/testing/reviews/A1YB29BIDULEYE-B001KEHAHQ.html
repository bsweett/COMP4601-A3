So, I really can't make a comparison here.<br /><br />But that said, this movie is certainly good for a few laughs and there are enough serious elements to prevent it from becoming an utter farce. (Not to mention a sub plot on corruption as well as deception.)<br /><br />A murder takes place at a soccer match in France. Chief Inspector Kline sees this as a chance to win a public service award that he has been nominated for several times, but never actually won. His plot is to put the bumbling Clouseau on the case. (He feels that Clouseau will bumble along, accomplish nothing, and buy time for Kline to uncover the murder.)<br /><br />While Clouseau certainly bumbles throughout the story, we see that he is not exactly an utter idiot either. For one thing, Beyonce's boyfriend was the murder victim at the soccer match. And a jealous x boyfriend is a major suspect. But Clouseau knows that this is just a little too obvious.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But at about the 2/3 point, the movie stops being funny. And while we may have been laughing at Clouseau's bumbling throughout the movie, we are moved into deep sympathy for him when he is framed and hounded by the corrupt Kline.<br /><br />Granted, we may understand Kline's frustration at his repeated coming close to a coveted award, but never actually getting it. But his actions against Clouseau were not only cruel, but they were illegal as well. (Arranging for him to have a suitcase full of weapons at the airport.)<br /><br />But here the movie gets interesting. Through a number of seemingly bad clues he obtained throughout the movie, Clouseau is able to find out what is really going on. This leads to a climactic chase and final confrontation where we are cheering for the detective we once laughed at.<br /><br />(So, first we were laughing at Clouseau; then we were moved into sympathy for him; and finally, we are cheering him on. GREAT!)<br /><br />To top it off, it is virtually impossible not to enjoy it when Clouseau's corrupt boss gets a major comeuppance. We may have seen Clouseau as a bumbler for sometime, but in one of the last scenes, we can certainly smile and give a sarcastic: "Oops."<br /><br />I'm sure many Peter Sellers fans will be reluctant to accept Steve Martin in the role. But that said, the movie is not bad.<br /><br />I've seen Steve Martin in a few roles, and I consider this one of his best.</p></body></html>

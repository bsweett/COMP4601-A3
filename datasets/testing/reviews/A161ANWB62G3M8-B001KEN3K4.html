There are some great setpieces, a few fantastic lines and the cast is very impressive. There's also a great bit during a symphony concert that had me in fits of laughter.<br /><br />Great light entertainment.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

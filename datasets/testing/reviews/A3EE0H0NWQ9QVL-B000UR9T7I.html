Not nearly as riveting as its classic predecessor 'Spider-man 2,' this movie swings ahead admirably enough.  Just when this adventure starts to reek of overconfidence, we find a fresh trek going in unexpected directions.  While 'Spider-Man 2' made our hero a constantly beleaguered underdog, #3 shuffles the deck of perilous contingencies.  Seldom extraneous or convoluted, the peril and story lines are still inventive enough to keep our interest.  Indeed, the shifting developments are at times intense and frightening.  In epic and intricate proportions, this installment seldom fails to awe.<br /><br />We begin where we left off with impending engagement between Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry's (James Franco) angst against Peter for his father's death.  At first the rift between Peter and Harry takes a run-of-the-mill amnesia course, but the subsequent developments provide greater vigor.  Meanwhile, Peter's uncle's killer, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison to become the Sandman, an elusive monster with morphing dimensions.  If one villain isn't enough, then Peter's new newspaper rival, Brock and alter-ego, Venom (suavely and savagely played by Topher Grace) comes to roost after Peter's professor develops an evil transformative potion that even gives Spiderman a new makeover.  (Spiderman`s inner conflict gives us more depth than previously provided, and the startling visual effects are less recycled than reinvented.  Both keep us guessing.)<br /><br />Still retaining characters we love (Peter's aunt still provides badly needed tenderness, and his growling newspaper editor boss is still the lovable curmudgeon) but giving us a whole new venue, 'Spider-Man 3' promises many sequels to come.  Although the tension is diminished compared to the masterpiece of 'Spiderman 2,' #3 is an edgy and excellent edition to the 'Spiderman' franchise.  Sam Raimi's directing refuses to dwell on past laurels, and the sharp editing ably assists eye-popping visuals.  Hopefully, the `Spiderman' franchise will continue to be this worthy.  Penetrating and often startling, 'Spider-Man 3' seldom disappoints.</p></body></html>

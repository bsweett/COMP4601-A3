<meta name="summary" content="Sweet and funny"></head><body><p>When 16-year old tomboy and wise-cracker Juno (Ellen Page) discovers she's pregnant, she decides to look for a couple to adopt her baby.  She finds yuppies Vanessa and Mark (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman) and thinks they would be super cool parents.<br /><br />I was prepared to dislike this movie because I don't think teen pregnancy is comical, but I was won over by Ellen Page's quirky charm.  She's smart, independent, strong and very likeable, a true gem of an actress.  Michael Cera plays her clueless boyfriend; he's believably bewildered by the pregnancy and, though more interested in the track team than the baby, is quite appealing, too.<br /><br />Juno becomes a strong heroine in a tough situation.  The movie is funny and the characters are real and it has the off-beat feeling that indie movies often have.  Recommended if you can overlook the basic moral issue and enjoy the story.</p></body></html>

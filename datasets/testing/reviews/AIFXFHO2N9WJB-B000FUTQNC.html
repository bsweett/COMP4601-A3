<meta name="summary" content="Protect Your Identity..."></head><body><p>In today's world one can never be to careful with his/her identity, whether that be bank account information, social security numbers, credit cards, or anything for that matter.  With the way the world is you never know when your very identity can be stolen from you, often times without you even knowing that it's occurring.  In the Warner Brothers thriller "Firewall" Harrison Ford discovers that security is not absolute no matter how hard you work to ensure it.<br /><br />"Firewall" places us into the life of Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford), the head of I.T. (Information Technology) for Landrock Pacific Bank.  His day begins like any other, his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen) shares playful banter with him, and his kids bicker as usual, not a thing out of the ordinary.  As he goes throughout his day at the bank he tops things off with a meeting over drinks with a co-worker and a high-ranking employee of another bank.  After drinks are over, Jack leaves to go home when the very high-ranking employee of the other bank (Paul Bettany) appears in his backseat with startling news, Jack's family is being held hostage!  With his family in jeopardy Jack is forced to comply with the hostage-takers demands, he must steal 100 million dollars from the very bank he works for.  The criminals have anticipated virtually every scenario that could possibly occur during their heist; except one, what a desperate man will do to protect those he loves no matter the cost.<br /><br />When I first saw the previews for this thriller, my first thoughts were that the movie looked good and would probably be a movie I would thoroughly enjoy; however, I thought it appeared that Harrison Ford was basically doing the same character he had portrayed in "Air Force One" (minus the whole being President of the United States thing).  Now, many actors have made a career of playing virtually the same character that had brought them success in previous films, Tommy Lee Jones, Steven Seagal (though he's hardly successful anymore), Ben Stiller, and Jackie Chan.  In most of those instances each of those actors' movies are successful, except for Seagal's of course.  So, even though I thought that Harrison was doing the same character again, I still was excited to see this movie.  After watching this movie I have to say, that even though Harrison is playing the same type of character that he's known for, basically the average guy who is vulnerable, yet full of strength and resourcefulness, he still delivers an excellent performance that you can't help but enjoy.  The supporting cast led by Paul Bettany ("A Knight's Tale") and Virginia Madsen ("Sideways") are equally strong, especially Bettany who delivers a much more realistic villain than he did in his previous bad guy role in the lackluster "The Da Vinci Code".<br /><br />The story was very well paced, full of plenty of action and thrills that keep the audience riveted throughout the entire duration.  The director made a choice that can sometimes harm a movie's success, by pushing the movie into high gear early on.  But director Richard Loncraine ("Wimbledon") managed to get the audience to connect to the characters during the opening scene of the movie, and gradually fleshed out the characters over the entire course of the film, which gave the movie much more story than your average action thrill-ride generally contains.  The topic of identity theft is one that is very real in today's world, and "Firewall" treats the subject in a very serious manner, taking careful consideration to never make light of the very serious issue, and keeping that aspect of the movie as realistic to the general public as possible.<br /><br />"Firewall" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

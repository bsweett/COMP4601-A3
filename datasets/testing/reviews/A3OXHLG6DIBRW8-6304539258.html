<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Movie, Both Versions Are Worth Having!"></head><body><p>To me, "Star Wars Episode IV" is Star Wars. I saw the origional release at a Drive In when I was 13 years old and have rewatched the movie (in it's various releases) no less than 30 times since. We have actually worn out a VHS copy of Star Wars because my kids also watched it over and over.<br /><br />Star Wars was really the first of it's kind. The special effects and production quality were cutting edge. The script was strong and the acting was mostly great.<br /><br />Get this set, enjoy both versions, share it with you friends and family!<br /><br />Recommended!</p></body></html>

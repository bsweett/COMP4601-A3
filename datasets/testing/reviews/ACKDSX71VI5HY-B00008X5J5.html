<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful film animated brilliantly decades before the advent of computer animation"></head><body><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's 1959 adaptation of "Sleeping Beauty" is the last truly great animated film from the studio's early brilliance.  It caps the first era of feature-length animation which began with Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" in style, with a simple story told through daring animation and creativity.<br /><br />With the voice talents of Mary Costa, Eleanor Audley, and Verna Felton, among many others, the movie's dynamic animation precedes the digital revolution in animation by at least three decades.  Yet, the available resources of the time are utilized so ingeniously that the movie is literally forty years ahead of its time.  It also boasts unique characters and a script which is not afraid to present its villainess as a purely evil demonic witch.<br /><br />The storyline is deceptively simple:  three benevolent fairies look after a princess, deep undercover because of a vengeful death curse at her christening.  Eleanor Audley's vocal work combined with frighteningly mature animation make the evil fairy Maleficent one of Disney's most potentially terrifying antagonists.  Her name itself is a stroke of genius:  a combination of the words "malevolent" and "magnificent."<br /><br />Also featuring a great soundtrack comprised mostly of Tchaikovsky's "Sleeping Beauty Ballet," and including the poetic "Once Upon A Dream," Walt Disney's "Sleeping Beauty" is a superb film, animated or otherwise.</p></body></html>

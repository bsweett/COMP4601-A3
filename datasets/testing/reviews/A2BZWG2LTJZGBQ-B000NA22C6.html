<meta name="summary" content="Excellent performances all around- especially Depp!"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp stars as Mort Rainey, a writer who has had some success.  He is awakened by a man named John Shooter (John Turturro) who claims that Depp stole his story and published it.  Depp agrees to show Shooter proof that he did not steal the story, while Shooter makes it clear that he intends to make Mort's life tough until he obtains the proof.<p>This is just the beginning of the story, the window dressing.  What makes the film excellent is the acting.  Depp is wonderful again as a writer who is dealing with recent tragedy in his life.  Turturro is great as an almost over the top tough, Charles Dutton is a strong supporting friend/lawyer for Mort, and Timothy Hutton is menacing as the boyfriend of Mort's soon to be ex wife.<p>The plot is complex and twists often, but never out of control.  All the time, Depp is great and he really shows his range.  This character requires him to be in control of himself, but just barely.  There is an edge required here based on the situations the character goes through.  Depp pulls it off beautifully.  By the time the credits roll, you will be impressed.  The story makes sense, and the surprise ending is good (not great) but the strength of the acting makes this almost a must-see.</p></body></html>

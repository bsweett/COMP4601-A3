<meta name="summary" content="A Stunning Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>This is a stunning transfer, one of the better transitions to Blu-Ray I've seen and especially impressive since the film is 15 years old.  Detail is sharp and the colors magnificent..  Anyone fortunate to grab this when Amazon was selling it for $10 got a steal.  It's still a great bargain for under $20.<br /><br />By the time you are done watching this, you are emotionally spent with the involving story and totally satsified with the beautiful photography you've witnessed over 177-minute epic film.<br /><br />What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character: Scottish rebel leader William Wallace, played by Mel Gibson, who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story, great cinematography, excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film that looks incredible on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Scrap your old edition and get this one: you won't be sorry.</p></body></html>

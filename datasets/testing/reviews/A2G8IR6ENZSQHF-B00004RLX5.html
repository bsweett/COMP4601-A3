<meta name="summary" content="It's surprising how well this movie works"></head><body><p>The premise of &quot;Star Trek: The Voyage Home&quot; probably doesn't sound promising to those who haven't seen it- the Enterprise and the crew travel back to the present day to retrieve a pair of humpback whales.  It's a welcome surprise then that &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; proves to be one of the most entertaining Star Trek entries; it's both interesting and funny, if a little low on tension.<p>Director Leonard Nimoy handles this situation perfectly.  The &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; story had grown old even when this movie was released in 1986, but it's still a riot to watch the Enterprise crew try to adapt to late 20th century San Francisco.  There's also a good ecological message from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;- if man continues to be short-sighted in his dealings with the environment, he may inadvertently destroy himself.  There's not many major characters in the film outside of the Enterprise crew, but Catherine Hicks shows flair as a marine biologist that's trying to help out Kirk and Co.<p>The only thing that's missing from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; is tension.  There's no real villain and never really a sense that things won't turn out all right in the end.  One could argue that the series needed to lighten up a bit after the dark and violent second and third entries, but it still sometimes feel that something's missing from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;.<p>Overall, this is a very entertaining movie, and one of the few &quot;Star Trek&quot; films that can appeal to a wide audience outside of its target one.  Considering the quality of some of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films that followed it (&quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, &quot;Generations&quot;), &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; is definetely a quality Trek outing.  If you don't own it yet, what are you waiting for?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good escapism all around"></head><body><p>What can I say? This is a darn good action/adventure flick. There's suspense, guns/ammo, mummies, creepy crawly insects, tombs, and all that there is that make an action movie excellent. This is one example of good escapism. Kudos to Fraser, Weisz, and Sommers for exquisitely remaking the original "Mummy."<br /><br />A+</p></body></html>

But what struck me most about the movie is that, although at first it doesn't seem like it, Eastwood's character really does earn the title of 'good' throughout the course of the film. Leone establishes that virtue consists of more than being the one most wronged in a situation or killing the villains with some small amount of reluctance. Although he is no great samaritan, The Man With No Name is willing to go to great and elaborate lengths to do the right thing and give someone else a chance at redemtpion. In the end, I think this movie is really about Tuco - caught between the extremes of Angel Eyes and TMWNN, he lives a life of crime out of neccesity, because life is more difficult for him than for an unreal character like TMWNN, but he has the potential for both good and evil.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful premise, disappointing film (includes spoilers)"></head><body><p>I wish I'd stumbled across this late one night on TV, with no idea of what it was going to be about.  But if, like me, you've seen the trailer, then don't even bother.  You'll be waiting 85 minutes for confirmation of everything you've already guessed.  It's a good-looking, well-crafted movie of course, with a wonderful cast and a delicious premise, but it's let down by the screenplay.  About on par with a reasonable episode of "The X-Files", Gerald Di Pego's tale of abducted children and their seemingly delusional parents falls too quickly into the repetitive pattern of a chase movie and never really makes the most of the potential for ambiguity at its core.  There's nothing clever about it, nothing that throws you off.  Nor, once all is revealed, does it sufficiently explain how the aliens managed to do what they did, or when, or why.  I presume we're meant to forget about that as our eyes well up over scenes of familial reunion.  Whatever.  This could have been a wonderful story about the psychology of grief or a creepy sci-fi thriller.  In the end, it manages to be neither - trivializing one for the sake of the other.  Julianne Moore fans might be interested to see her give another emotionally-fraught-yet-filled-with-inner-resolve performance, but that's about all that's really of interest here.</p></body></html>

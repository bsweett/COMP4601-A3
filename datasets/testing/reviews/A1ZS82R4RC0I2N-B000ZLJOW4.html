<meta name="summary" content="Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness"></head><body><p>An underrated yet excellent movie, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is an enticing indie offering from director Terry Zwigoff. Yes, it`s another movie about teenagers, still it`s far from being a useless collection of jokes glued together a la &quot;American Pie&quot; or &quot;Roadtrip&quot;. Instead, this film, inspired by the Daniel Clowes` underground comic, focuses meaningful themes like alienation, consumism, (sub)culture and the first steps into the adult world. <p>Thora Birch plays Enid, a clever, creative yet confused suburban young girl straight out of highschool. She and her friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) must face a new and unpredictable future where they have to be on their own and face multiple and relevant choices. They never seemed to really fit in, and for the first time realize that pherhaps they should. But is it worth it? And what`s the price to pay? <p>Zwigoff manages to combine drama and comedy with great effect, delivering a cinematic experience that is satirical and ironic while being poignant and emotional as well. In a way, it`s like MTV`s show &quot;Daria&quot;, but in this movie the results are more deep, intense and relateable. <p>At times, the pacing is a bit slow, still it makes sense since the story focuses some points like the everyday mundane monotony and suburban inertia where nothing interesting or gripping seems to happen. <p>&quot;Ghost World&quot; is also a twisted, witty and original coming-of-age story, focusing the nerds, geeks and losers that are as clever and brilliant as they are ignored and virtually invisible (like ghosts). As a result, they don`t have much of a social life and remain incapable of relating with most of those who surround them. Enid is such a character, and when she dares to try helping someone she ends up being used and hurt. <p>One of the most innovative and surprising independent movies of the last years, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a little gem worth discovering that gets better with each viewing. Probably most, or at least many people won`t like it much, since this is not a typical, laugh-a-minute and brainless teen movie, but a thought-provoking and genuine cinematic experience. Still, for those who try to get deep into it, it will surely be a memmorable and unique film to watch. <p>Related movies: &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, &quot;American Splendor&quot;, &quot;SubUrbia&quot;, &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Storytelling&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;L.I.E.&quot;, all very good choices as well</p></body></html>

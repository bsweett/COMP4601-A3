<meta name="summary" content="better than I expected--3.5 stars"></head><body><p>This was actually better than I'd expected. I'm not a NASCAR fan, but Will Farrell does on occasion make me laugh.<br /><br />And laugh I did. Ricky Bobby (Will Farrell) is a born race car driver who becomes a champion, until an accident leaves him psychologically unable to race again. John C. Reilly plays his sidekick, always coming in second, helping Ricky Bobby win. Will Farrell's over-the-top goofiness was toned town a bit--a small bit, which for me made the movie funnier, because I was laughing at the lines and situations rather than at Will Farrell.<br /><br />NASCAR is lavishly lampooned, but in such an extravagant and good-humored way that I doubt fans would be offended--the movie takes the stereotypes and runs with them. And there are a couple of subplots that keep the movie interesting--Ricky Bobby's kids are uncontrolled brats until his mother takes them in hand; he has to deal with betrayal and the consequences of his treatment of his best friend; there's love lost and found; and the commitment-phobic father who set him on the path to racing returns to put him back on track (heh. pun. sorry.) with hilarious training tactics.<br /><br />Jane Lynch and Gary Cole as Ricky Bobby's parents have the best roles, I think--funny, but low-key. The kids were over-the-top both when they were obnoxious and when they were reformed, but that, oddly enough, kept them from getting on my nerves.<br /><br />We watched this with our sons, ages 12 & 16, and there were a couple of sexual references, but nothing that made me cringe. They were amused, and quoted lines from the movie for quite a while afterward.<br /><br />It wasn't a great movie, by any means, but it was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, and a good excuse to eat buttered popcorn.</p></body></html>

The Borg, led by a creepy queen (the same actress who played the White Witch in the 2005 Chronicles of Narnia), seek to assimilate the entire population of Earth by traveling back in time to stop the first launch of the warp drive.  Will, Deanna, and Geordi travel to Earth to assist the scientist in his launch.  But the scientist is a drunk, and very turned off by the adoration and idolization proferred by the folks from the future.  He runs away.  Meanwhile, the Borg Queen is hard at work trying to figure out how to assimilate Data (Brent Spiner).<br /><br />Great action from the moment the movie begins to the very end.  The only thing I didn't like were the new hairstyles of Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).  Blehh!  They look very bland as Deanna has straight brunette hair and Crusher has a shorter blond style.</p></body></html>

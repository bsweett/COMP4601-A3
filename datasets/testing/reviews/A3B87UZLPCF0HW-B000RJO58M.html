A send-up of American action movies, particularly those made by noted hack Michael Bay, Hot Fuzz achieves what Bay's films could only imagine, they're both awesome and entertaining. This is one of the few films where your side hurts from laughing, but you have to stop clutching it, to cover your eyes from sudden explosions of gore or brutality. Filled with scene stealing performances, from Jim Broadbent as the chief, to Timothy Dalton as a diabolical supermarket supervisor, Hot Fuzz is easily the best comedy and action film of the year so far, and shouldn't be missed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great"></head><body><p>As the contining adventures of those 23rd century characters, who wind up having to save the Earth once again.  But this time we find that an unheard of alien ship comes out of no-where to find out what happened to the Humback whales on the planet Earth.  And if they don't answer then it spells the doom of Earth itself.  Great acting, directing, and script run this movie up to the category of GREAT.  A must see movie for all non-Trekkie fans and Trekkie fans alike.</p></body></html>

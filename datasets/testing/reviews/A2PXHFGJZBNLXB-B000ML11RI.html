<meta name="summary" content="Visually stunning, but that's it"></head><body><p>Maybe I missed something by not seeing this in the theater; maybe the living comic book visual style of SIN CITY was so dazzling on a big screen that it obliterated any reservations about the sheer banality of its storylines. But I finally got a chance to see this film, a joint effort of graphic novelist Frank Miller and film director Robert Rodriguez, and was frankly bored by it after about half an hour (and I think I'm being generous there!). All the storylines---Bruce Willis' attempt to protect a young stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke's attempt to avenge a prostitute's (Jaime King) death, Clive Owen's attempt to put down a thug (Benicio del Toro) and his misogynistic ways---are done in a film noir style that is unfortunately ALL style. There's no psychological depth to any of the characters as there are in other comic book adaptations (BATMAN BEGINS is an exemplary recent example); it's all just a soulless geek show. A fantastic looking, often atmospheric geek show, but a geek show nevertheless. If appearances are all that matter to you, than SIN CITY will probably be a ball (and the visuals are the only reasons I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of just 1). But for those looking for something other than just fancy-pants visuals in a comic book movie adaptation, look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

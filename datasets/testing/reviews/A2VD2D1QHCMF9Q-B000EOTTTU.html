For instance, why did the English initiate war on the Indians, and why didn't the Indians just wipe out the English . . . it would have been easy for them.  There was mystery surrounding the motivation of Pocahontas and her attraction to John Smith . . but it wasn't important to understand this relationship in the appreciation of this movie.<br /><br />The worth of the movie is in the depiction of the Indians and the English.  The Indians were shown as what we would only call savages today, but they knew their land, knew how to grow crops, had an intricate social structure, etc.  They also appeared to be living as they were shown for millennia, with neither a knowledge of progress, or a desire for progress once they recognized it in the behavior of the English.  The English, on the other hand, were shown as physically dirty, unable to cope with the land or to support themselves from the land, and they appeared arbitrary and severe with each other.  But they did represent progress.<br /><br />This was a worthwhile movie for the scenery and the overall impressions of the people at that time in our history.</p></body></html>

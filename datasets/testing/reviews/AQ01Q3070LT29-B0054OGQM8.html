Formatted to fit your screen.<br />BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985)<br />  Eric Stoltz was filming his scenes at Puente Hills Mall for "Back To The Future", however it just wasn't working out right. Stoltz was replaced.<br />  Enter Michael J. Fox who won the part to play "Marty McFly". He was working on the "Family Ties" tv series at the time and stayed up all night to work on the Mall parking lot scene with Christopher Lloyd.<br />  "Back to the Future" was released July 3, 1985 and the story begins on October 26, 1985.<br />  Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a high school student who helps Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) take care of his house while the doctor is away.  That night, he must meet Doc at the Twin Pines Mall. With a DeLorean automobile turned into a time machine, Doc explains to Marty he is going 25 years into the future (2010). When the Libyans find Doc and shoot at him, Marty escapes in the time machine and ends up in the past, November 5, 1955 in Hill Valley at the exact spot.<br />  There he meets his own father (Crispin Glover) and his mother (Lea Thompson) who are teenagers.<br />  Like "Star Trek", you are not suppose to alter the past in anyway, but in Marty's case, he must find Doc in 1955 to help him with a time machine and get his mother and father to kiss at the dance, so Marty can exist and get back to 1985.<br />  Very cute movie and a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber, Thomas F. Wilson, Clauia Wells, Deborah Harmon, George DiCenzo, James Tolkan, Jeffery Jay Cohen, Casey Siemaszko, Billy Zane, Elsa Raven, Jason Hervey.<br /><br />Note: The Puente Hills Mall is known as "Twin Pine Mall" and later "Lone Pine Mall". The mall today still exists in City of Industry, California, although it has changed businesss and re-construction over the years.<br /><br />Running Time: 1:55 rated PG.<br />______________________________________________________________<br />  BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART II (1989)<br /><br />When Marty came back to 1985, not everything was quite right. Because Marty interferred in the past with Biff almost sexually assaulting his mother and his father stopping Biff and how his mother and father finally connected, the present 1985 is not how it should be.<br />  So Doc returns in the DeLorean time machine to pick up Marty and Jennifer because their kids in the future, October 21, 2015, are not right either.  However, when Marty runs into his son on the square, buys an almanac which Old Biff gets a hold of and then Biff takes the DeLorean time machine for a quick spin to who knows where, it alters 1985 once again.<br />  While Hill Valley and the McFly family is in dispair, Biff is all-powerful rich.  Doc and Marty must go back to November 5, 1955 and make things right again and not run into themselves or let themselves see them.<br /><br />Returning cast: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilon, Casey Siemaszko, Jeffrey J. Cohen, Billy Zane, Buck Flower.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Elisabeth Shue, Charles Fleischer, Darlene Vogel, Jason Scott Lee, Elijah Wood, Flea, James Ishida.<br /><br />Running Time: 1:47  Rated PG<br />________________________________________________________________<br />BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART III (1990)<br /><br />  When lightning struck the DeLorean time machine, it disappeared, but now that 1955 and 1985 have been corrected, Marty is still stuck in 1955 and a 70 year old letter delivered by Western Union to Marty says Doc is now in the Old West 1885.<br />  Not to worry, the DeLorean has been in an old mining tunnel for 70 days waiting for 1985 Marty and 1955 Doc.<br />  Another mistake: Dr. Emmett Brown died one week after writing the letter to Marty in 1885. He was shot by "Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen".<br />  marty goes back to the Old West, Hill Valley, September 2, 1885, to try and bring back 1985 Doc, so he can exsist in the future.<br />  Marty meets his ancestors, the McFly's in the Old West.<br /><br />Returning Cast: Michael J.

<meta name="summary" content="Here's another vote for George!!!"></head><body><p>To all the cry baby mouth breathers ....complaining endlessly about having to hit up their mommies for cash every time a new version of Star Wars or Star Trek comes out on DVD that doesn't suit them...I say get a job or better yet....get a life..make your own damn movie and stop bashing the person who , unlike you, climbed out from under his mommas skirt and did things with his life.<br /><br />Lucas created the characters and made the movies...he OWNS them...not you the freak fan who saw it 100 times...that gets you ZERO equity in the production or say over its content.  If he felt with technology growth he could make them better..let him!<br /><br />Oh ....the Star Wars Nerds began crying about the updated versions before they were even released....so<br /><br />to honor these whiners..Lucas releases the originals.  And the crying continues...why didn't he update the picture and sound??? WAAAAAAA ...<br /><br />Oh....so you want SOME updates for technology improvements..just not others?<br /><br />The guy gives you stunning , updated versions AND the throwback versions....and that is still not enough and HE's Attacked for being greedy?<br /><br />he's not forcing you to raid your mommas cookie jar and steal her lunch money or making you mow a couple of lawns to get the cash to buy them...or even forcing those few of you who have jobs to buy these...they are an OPTION...if you truly want the originals as you complained about...and<br /><br />the crying continues.....another reviewer said it best SCI-FI NERDS are the biggest complainers ..EVER.<br /><br />My review is to back up the artist...the person who created this and who OWNS it..and listened to the crying for the original release....without updates and delivered.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Long on the lurid, short on the substance"></head><body><p>Every political dictator is really schizophrenic con artist:  A persona of intellect, charisma, paranoia and greed, trying, suddenly, to project benevolence. Many dictators fail because what lifts them to power - murder, theft, fear and ruthlessness - contradicts with the practicality needed to keep it. What a frantic, random life they lead. One eye open in bed. Two death squads open for business.<br /><br />Ugandan general Idi Amin's angle was to play the lovable, chummy, gun-toting teddy bear.  He was a guy who'd take his own shirt off his back. Who'd let his soldiers dine before he did. Who believed Uganda was the root of civilization, and promised to restore its greatness.<br /><br />He also proclaimed himself "Lord of All Beasts on the Earth and All Fishes in the Sea" and expelled Asians from the country because God told him.  From 1971 through 1979, as Amin ruled Uganda, he ordered the murders of possibly 500,000 political opponents. Brutal, meticulous, torturous murders.<br /><br />So it makes sense that "The Last King of Scotland," a fictional account of Amin's reign, is a nasty piece of business.<br /><br />But does it need to be this ugly?<br /><br />The last act of the movie plays like a contemporary tour of Dante's Inferno, tinged with the twisted vibe of the 1970s, and we're led through it by a character nearly as rotten as Amin. It's a lurid experience that, frankly, takes dead aim at women. Every female character is a target for infidelity, a one-night stand, or abuse.<br /><br />One character is disemboweled. Another is hung by his skin. Director Kevin Macdonald has crafted an effective, tense movie of tight close-ups and jarring violence.  But he reduces the movie to the violent fantasies of misanthropes. "The Last King of Scotland" is pulp fiction. Even the terrific Forest Whitaker, who plays Amin, can't escape it.<br /><br />Screenwriters Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan tell the story from the perspective of Nicolas Garrigan (James McAvoy) a young Scottish doctor who spins a globe and lands his finger on the middle of Africa. He starts in a rural Ugandan clinic. After a chance meeting, Amin offers Garrigan the job of personal physician. Garrigan accepts and finds Amin calling him "my closest, most trusted advisor."<br /><br />Movie ads are misleading, because Garrigan is really the center of the movie, and he's no innocent. In fact, he's a punk blown in from "Trainspotting." Banging around Amin's palace, wolfing down steaks, attending meetings, he falls under Amin's spell until he plays a (willful) role in the murder of a colleague. He's clued in to Amin's tactics, but it doesn't stop him from  tossing Amin's pretty third wife (Kerry Washington) against that aforementioned wall.<br /><br />Garrigan's creepy libertarianism leads "The Last King of Scotland" down a more melodramatic path than it needs to be. Amin killed so many innocents,  so it's odd that Macdonald fixates on Amin's personal war against a guy who kinda deserves it.<br /><br />Yes, the character is meant as a symbol of white decadence in Africa, and the cost of kicking up dirt in the backyard of a civil war. But it's no mystery that Europeans, with the help of guys like Amin, raped and pillaged the whole continent, leaving it decades behind in political and economic development. Based on a recent glut of movies about Africa, Garrigan's indulgence seems more exploitative than informative.<br /><br />McAvoy's annoyingly Scottish performance makes Garrigan harder to like. He hits the accent hard, especially in scenes where he's asked to sneer at British diplomats. He also seems to take Whitaker's cue in adding a bunch of flourishes to his performance. Confidence is compelling, but McAvoy acts like he's been Ewan McGregor for the last 15 years.<br /><br />As Amin, Forest Whitaker tears into his role to create a ravenous-yet-calculated man. He's moody, and, frankly, very funny. There two or three good, full laughs in this movie, and Whitaker is able to bury and excavate his character's dual personas within a scene. Amin understands, like few people do, both wit and slapstick. If the performance seems cartoonish, it's on purpose: Amin wanted to be a mascot to his people.<br /><br />Sadly, the filmmakers trust Whitaker's acting so much that the story hardly explores the sociopolitical aspects of Amin's rule. Crucial decisions and events are seen from afar. The Entebbe incident,  in which Amin allowed a hijacked Israeli airplane to land in Uganda before Israeli troops staged a rescue operation,  is presented more as a cliffhanger for Garrigan than the end symbolic end of Amin's legitimate claim to power.<br /><br />What makes Idi Amin tick? It is  unclear. "The Last King of Scotland" is more content to let us laugh his comedy, and shudder, however briefly, at the thought of his brutality. It seems so unhinged, its depiction of dictatorship so exotic and foreign, that we are left with, like "Scarface," "Fight Club" or "Full Metal Jacket," a piece of art easily manipulated for prurient desires.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if "Uganda!" quietly slips into the language of pop culture over the next few years as an expression of joy, anger, or both. That's a compliment to the movie's allure. And a fierce criticism on its lack of nuance.</p></body></html>

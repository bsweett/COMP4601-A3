<meta name="summary" content="Far better to have loved and lost... than never to haved loved at all!"></head><body><p>Teaming up Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston proves to be a winning combination. This movie is about the story of a couple, Gary and Brooke, who meet at a sports outing under the most interesting of circumstances. They fall in love and go to live together in a condominium they purchase together.<br /><br />A relationship that started with great promise soon turns sour and the fighting that takes place between these two individuals makes for rather difficult situations, at times... difficult to watch.<br /><br />Neither wants to give up ownership of the condo, so they stay together even though it becomes apparent that they would be better off apart from each other.<br /><br />Family and friends suffer the results of the increasingly bitter relationship, at times forcing friends to choose sides at the detriment of either partner. Both actors deliver great performances, but we felt sorry for Jennifer Anniston, who in her private life had a similar break-up that ended in her divorce from Brad Pitt.<br /><br />The movie has that rare combination of drama and comedy that makes you laugh at times, but the situations are so real... and painful... that at times we found ourselves saddened by the depth of despair of these two individuals who see their relationship come to an end.<br /><br />The filming is done in Chicago and some of the best lines are delivered while the protagonist guides tourists through the Windy City, as the host of a tourism business he runs with his brothers.</p></body></html>

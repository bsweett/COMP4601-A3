<meta name="summary" content="Fantstic movie, terrible system for digital copies - They pushed the envelope for Blu-Ray features too far."></head><body><p>The movie has been reviewed to death. Nothing much I can add there - except that some parts will really make you squirm!  The quality is flawless, the effects mind-blowing, the ancestral/nascent versions of the Face Huggers and Aliens is friggin great.<br /><br />So I'll review the product.  Movie: 5 stars. Digital extras, etc. - 0 stars. The digital download options are horrible. You can pick the new "Untraviolet" option - this requires that you join one of two streaming video services. It's 10 minutes of jumping through hoops, answering questions, entering the same code multiple times and verifying email accounts. You can't simply copy and play.<br /><br />The other option is using iTunes to copy the movie. What if I don't have iTunes or don't want to use iTunes?  So I went to my old computer that did have iTunes. It won't accept the code. It gives an error that the movie must be redeemed using the DVD. The DVD runs a program that simply opens iTunes and instructs you to manually enter the code. The end result - no digital copy on iTunes. After six tries it finally worked. The program was not loading iTunes correctly. Want to watch it on your Droid tablet? Forget it - unless you want to stream the Ultraviolet version. I don't want to waste my battery powering WiFi when I don't need it.  But I can't copy the digital version to my tablet. So much for watching it "anytime, anywhere."<br /><br />While that's going on, I decided to scan the QR code on the insert "to learn more."  Too bad it can't be scanned. Droid X phone, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tablet, iPhone4 and iPad2 - none of these could scan the QR code. I guess the designers never bothered to test it.<br /><br />So I figured I'd try the app. What an irritating, frustrating little program this is. It just screams "DELETE ME!" Slow, clunky, half the options just give an error that it has to be synced to the movie to work - and even then they don't.<br /><br />This disc was obviously designed to push Blu-Ray to it's limits. Interactivity, menus - you name it. The problem is that they pushed it too far, to the point that unless you have a top-end player, the entire system fails miserably. For example - In the main menu, I could not navigate to any option except "Play" unless I powered down the player, powered up again, and immediately selected a different menu option, such as "Extras". If I played the movie first, then went back, it locked.  As for the "Easter eggs" - forget it. Could not get one to work. Locked up or did nothing.<br /><br />The deleted scenes - not too many. A couple were interesting, and you could tell that they could have played the characters a couple of different ways.  "Alternate ending" - could not get it to work, and that's assuming I even found the correct menu option. Again, the power-cycling between options was frustrating.<br /><br />So if you want a great movie on a fantastic format - and don't care about the digital copies or app, then you'll be thrilled.  Expect anything else to work? Forget it.<br /><br />Final insult: I have three Blu-Ray players. All three have the most current firmware. The DVD will only play on one of them. Won't play in my Samsung or Sony, but it will play in my Sanyo. But it takes forever to load, and sounds like an old computer floppy disk on and off for a minute - The rattly sound when it loads data and the machine-gun staccato when it resets.<br /><br />One final comment. They used the cheapest possible case for this product. It offers almost no protection, and is way too flexible. The DVD cases were great - this is not much better than paper. As for printed extras - just the insert with the redeemable code.</p></body></html>

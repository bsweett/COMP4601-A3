Whilst Zemeckis touched his audience with 'Forrest Gump' and scared them all with 'What Lies Beneath', this is a film that seems to have been released purely to show us all Tom Hanks' formidable acting skills.  In the film Hanks plays Chuck, who is separated from his wife after his plane crashes and he, the only survivor, is forced to eke out an existence on a tropical island for four years, forging a friendship with a ball called Wilson.<p>Whilst Hanks' acting is undoubtedly good, he always seems to play Mr. Joe Regular and the scenes on the island are incredibly dull.  We see Chuck light a fire, smash a coconut and fish.  This makes up the majority of the movie, with themes such as madness being explained away with a frankly bizarre 'friendship' with a ball.  In this lies the movie's main failure - it's not particularly bad but it is particularly dull.  Devoid of any other characters - save Helen Hunt as his wife in a role so minimal it even rivals Laura Dern's in 'Jurassic Park III' - we're forced to concentrate on the same things over and over.<p>Still, the airplane crash is stunningly done and the ending is thankfully a little less contemporary than would be expected.  Yet compared alongside, Zemeckis' other film that year - 'What Lies Beneath' - this is nothing.  Just another stepping stone in Tom Hanks career as he garners yet more award nominations.</p></body></html>

But, nonetheless, this was a catastrophe. Or make that a &quot;cat-tastrophe.&quot;<br /><br /> Don't blame Halle Berry for this, even though she starts out the movie tellingly &quot;dead in the water.&quot; She proved in &quot;Monster's Ball&quot; that she can act. And she looks great in this movie. But I didn't buy her for one second as Catwoman. And I didn't buy her boring romance with Benjamin Bratt either. It just wasn't sexy.<br /><br /> Blame Pitof, who was likely responsible for the non-stop camera movement, the constant editing, the computer-animated cat who mounts Halle to revive her from the dead and the overall emphasis of style over substance. I swear, this movie gets so out-of-control with its editing at times that I fear for any epileptics going to the theater. &quot;Catwoman&quot; will cause seizures.<br /><br /> Poor Sharon Stone doesn't even deserve this. Though she fares well in the final fight scene, not that you can ever tell anything that happens in any of the fight scenes, she's given ridiculously over-the-top scenes to play out using every histrionic possible. Her costuming is ugly. She's freakishly overlit in every scene in the movie. And the plot twist involving makeup that somehow makes her invincible is just plain stupid.<br /><br /> This whole mess is far from &quot;purr-fect.&quot; So far from perfect, in fact, that I laughed out loud when the thing ended.</p></body></html>

There is so much going on at one time, yet its never confusing. Plus, there are quite a few important characters to keep track of, and they all have their own proper place in this film. Even with 1 less actor, it would seem incomplete. This movie flows perfectly. Basically, the plot sort of revolves around a large diamond. Its not necessarily a heist film. Nor is it a 100% comedy, though, you gotte love that British humour. And no, Brad Pitt isn't a main character, however, he is a great, essential character. There are actually quite a few different nationalities in this film. Its all very interesting, how all the characters interact with one another, bantering, or threatening each other. Its alot of fun. The movie has a great soundtrack as well that really adds to the mood of the film. Its really an impressive film that would appeal to many people.</p></body></html>

It is one of the best historical dramas that I have seen. Beautifully filmed with great acting and costumes. Many movies have shown bits and pieces of Elizabeth before with Betty Davis being one of the best, but this rivals even her magnificent classic version.  I highly recommend you catch this visual treat with substance. The movie centers on Protestant Elizabeth dealing with the Catholic King Philip II of Spain. His Inquisition is sweeping Europe and threatens the freedoms of all, including the English. Spain plots war with the assistance of the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots. Some magnifcent scenes including the battle in the English Channel with the Spanish Armada make it a feast for the eyes. The acting is quite good though so we never feel as though this is just eye candy. Fans of the movies "Apocalypto" and "Elizabeth" should see it. Excellent DVD with good replaybility.</p></body></html>

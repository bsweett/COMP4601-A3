<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's Powerfully Evocative Look at Men Facing Insurmountable Odds"></head><body><p>It is quite amazing how a director as classically American as Clint Eastwood can make such an emotionally audacious film about the Japanese defense of Iwo Jima during the last year of WWII and manage to do it purely from the Japanese perspective. The idea of showing the adversarial side of the war is not new (1970's "Tora! Tora! Tora!" comes to mind), but what makes Eastwood's historical epic unique is the intense infusion of humanism that courses through the story and the lack of personal judgment on the suicidal Japanese military strategy at the time. There are neither heroes nor villains on either side. The result is an empathic study of a group of men caught in an inevitably fatalistic situation. Leading the effort is Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, an honorable, aristocratic man who has a biding respect for Americans based on his travels there during the late 1920's. With neither air nor naval support forthcoming, Kuribayashi concludes that his troops will need to fight to the death.<br /><br />The central figure among the soldiers is an obstreperous young private named Saigo, who has left a wife and infant daughter back home. Along with the rest of his troop, he spends weeks excavating tunnels and trenches on the higher grounds of the island. The scope of the incoming U.S. fleet exceeds their worst fears, and the rest of the film focuses on how they face the depletion of ammunitions and rations while realizing defeat and death are at hand. We see brief flashbacks of defining moments in their lives back home, just enough to give their reasons for being there but not to the point where we get fully realized characters. I believe this was an intentional move by the filmmakers to focus on the more immediate emotional responses to sacrificing themselves for a greater good, which comes down to buying more time for the empire to win the overall war.<br /><br />Similar to "Saving Private Ryan", the film is dramatically shot by Tom Stern in desaturated, monochromatic tones that give it a black-and-white, documentary-like feel with the bomb explosions primarily in vivid color. The cast is headed by the only recognizable actor to American audiences, the charismatic Ken Watanabe, who effectively plays Kuribayashi with economic authority. As Saigo, J-Pop star Kazunari Ninomiya really holds the film together through his character's serendipitous circumstances, while effective turns are provided by Tsuyoshi Ihara as the erudite Baron Nishi (the former Olympic equestrian champion); Shido Nakamura as the belligerent and increasingly desperate Lt. Ito; Ryo Kase as the stoically vulnerable Shimizu; and Yuki Matsuzaki as Saigo's smiling comrade Nozaki.<br /><br />Japanese American writer Iris Yamashita penned the forceful screenplay based on a story by her and Paul Haggis based on a published book of the picture letters Kuribayashi sent to his family and depicted in the film. While the technical aspects of this historical reenactment are superlative, not to mention the fact that the linguistic barriers between the Japanese cast and American crew must have been daunting, this masterful work really shows how the autumnal Eastwood knows like no other director how to convey the gravitas of impending death without sacrificing the propulsive drama and human heart at the core of the story. Be forewarned that some scenes are invariably graphic and that a few of the subtitles have been obscured by the intermittent use of a white background.</p></body></html>

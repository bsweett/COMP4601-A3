<meta name="summary" content="The Master at Zenith"></head><body><p>"Vertigo" is the fulfillment of master director Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant career, a richly colorful tapestry placed on celluloid to the tune of a masterful Bernard Hermann musical score and a probing script by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor containing unending clever psychological twists.<p>James Stewart suffers from vertigo or dizziness from scaling heights after a close scrape with death on a tall San Francisco building left the fellow officer who attempted to rescue him dead, resulting in Stewart's retirement from the force.  Stewart is sought out by former college classmate Tom Helmore, who has become a powerful shipping magnate through marriage, to take on a private sleuthing job.  Stewart at first adamantly refuses, then changes his mind.  Helmore reveals that his wife is under the spell out one Carlotta Valdez, a former San Francisco resident who committed suicide one century earlier.  Despite believing the idea cockeyed, Stewart agrees to undertake the job.<p>The gripping psychological drama finds Kim Novak, in one of her early roles, playing the dual part of Madeleine Elster, the alleged wife of Helmore, and Judy Barton, a San Francisco department store sales clerk who agreed to undertake a role to aid the unscrupulous shipping magnate.  Helmore wants his wife out of the way and devises a ghoulishly clever plan to achieve his objective without suspicion being directed his way.  The discovery by Stewart leads to dramatic results.<p>Stewart is at his best as a sincerely intentioned ex-cop who falls head over heels over a woman he ultimately learns never existed, except in counterfeit form.  Helmore did a perfect job of making the commonly spoken, decidedly middle class Judy Barton into the elegantly dressed and articulate aristocratic socialite Madeleine Elster.  Stewart desperately seeks to make over Barton after meeting her, while she attempts to hang on to her individuality and get him to love her for herself, fearing that he will unlock the mystery surrounding her past. The psychological clashes are stupendous with Stewart and Novak making screen magic.  She loves Stewart while he cannot forget the haunting image of Madeleine Elster.</p></body></html>

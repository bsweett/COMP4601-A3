<meta name="summary" content="American History X"></head><body><p>I remember when I was a kid the most I knew of American History X was the curb stomping scene. I didn't know anything more about the movie, so prior to seeing the movie the message was obviously not being translated properly within the minds of my peers. Looking back, though, that was fine by me as I'm mulatto and the friends who introduced the stories of American History X to me were all white, meaning they didn't have any of the personal issues the film mainly referred to.<br /><br />Recently though, I mean within a week of writing this review I have a friend who told me that he would have loved this movie had it not been for the ending (he didn't quite say it that way, but the ending ruined it for him which is the same in my small little mind). I think this is largely due to the editing of the movie putting the focus in an area that kind of throws our reasoning of the movie slightly off.<br />For those of you who may not have seen American History X here's a little break down of the plot: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), an open white supremacist, has been in prison for several years due to the voluntary manslaughter of a couple of black people who tried to carjack him. On the day of his release his brother Danny (Edward Furlong), after turning in an assignment advocating Hitler's Mein Kampf, is required to write a history paper based on Derek's experience.<br /><br />First, I would like to say that this film is brilliant. In its exploration of white supremacy it views all of our stereotyping as a gateway to more virulent hate. Despite it's, at times, extremely violent imagery, X is very much a call for reform in the way that we think of race and of each other as individuals. Many people will, and have, found this movie preachy, but in my opinion it's not as preachy as other race related movies that others have "campaigned" against that I have enjoyed (i.e. Crash).<br /><br />The ending is still quite a point of contention though, and with good reason. As I mentioned before, I think this owes a lot to the editing of this movie. Unfortunately, director Tony Kaye was unable to offer an edit of the movie that the studio was willing to work with, and other editors were brought in and Norton assisted with the editing. The result was an edit of the movie that was extremely Norton heavy, although the finished movie was still thoroughly enjoyable. That also meant the message of the movie was fairly diluted.<br /><br />Viewing the movie from my perspective, though, the story was actually speaking to everyone trying to reform Danny through Derek's story. Sure partially to the movie's detriment the story is overly focused on Derek, but Danny is our way into the story of the movie and he also represents the audience. He's exploring the story of his brother, as we are, because he needs to learn something from it. The whole reason for that exploration: to turn back before it's too late.<br /><br />It's easy to miss that point in the wake of the ending, but if you allow yourself to bypass the end, you'd realize that it really represents the seemingly never ending circulation of hate. Trying not to give away the ending, this is really what we see. Danny has given in to the story of Derek and has freed himself of the hate that once consumed him, but he passed it on to another person who willingly partakes of that hate. It's a cycle that we need to break, and that's really what the ending, including the ending Abraham Lincoln quote signifies.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. I know some people will find it contrived, and a little too on the nose, but I feel there is quite a bit of drama to offset the preachiness of this film. The only other issue that I had with this particular film concerns a score that over emphasizes moments of the movie as grandiose or too foreboding considering the more documentary like style of the shoot. Overall, though, I think it effectively evokes emotion while conveying a message to end the cycle of hate.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />For more review check out: &lt;...></p></body></html>

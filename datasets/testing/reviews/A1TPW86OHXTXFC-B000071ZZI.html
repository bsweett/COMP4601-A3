<meta name="summary" content="Thrilling, Exciting, Spies Among Us!"></head><body><p>Robert Ludlum wrote &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; in the 1980's and it is the quintessential &quot;spy&quot; story. It is a thriller and the characters are so rich and well drawn.  <p>A man is dragged from the sea. He has two bullet wounds and a &quot;chip&quot; embedded into his body. These are removed; the man recovers from this ordeal. He does not, however, remember anything, His name, where he is from from and his entire identity has been lost. He takes the chip and goes in search of himself. In a bank in Zurich he finds his identity- Jason Bourne and several other passports and lots of money. Enough information for Jason Bourne to change his identity whenever he needs to. But what does this mean?  It appears to mean that many people are after Jason Bourne, that he has information that many people want or they want this information to die!! Around every corner is danger and there is no one that he can trust. He meets up with two CIA analysts who appear to be trustworthy, but are they really?  He travels all over Europe and changes identities at every turn. He meets very interesting people at every turn. His life is full of risk and danger.  Jason Bourne is an important person with so much hidden information that he doesn't remember. But as time goes on, the people he meets share some of what he is missing, and he is beginning to put the pieces together.  He begins a love affair, and he thinks this is what he has been looking for. Why can't he be happy as a single man leaving the &quot;spy&quot; profession and finding his true love?<p>The movie stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, and he does a credible job. The action filming is wonderfully done. The car chases and the flights on foot and in trains are very real and I felt I was amongst them. I was part of the action!! Franke Potente plays Jason Bourne's love interest. Chris Cooper is the enemy and as always is a star- a cruel man who completes his job. The scenery is fantastic and brilliant. What I did miss in this movie that was not transposed from the book, is the storyline of Carlos, The Jackal. This is an important part of the book, and is not in the movie at all. Jason Bourne and Carlos have much admiratiion for each other even though they are sworn enemies. This is a significant loss, and the movie does not have the drama, background and richness of the book.  This is, however, a movie to be enjoyed- I understand the sequel, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is out this week. A Must See. prisrob</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still scary!"></head><body><p>There's little new information to be gathered from any of the Special Features on this "Collector's Edition," nonetheless you must own this excellent copy of PSYCHO if you're a serious film fan.<br /><br />Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins are both splendid in their roles as Director and Star---tho' there's little resemblance between the story of Norman Bates and the terrifying true tale of Ed Gein, on whom the original novel PSYCHO was based.<br /><br />Janet Leigh is great, even if in the Special Features interviews she seems to be auditioning for the next sequel.  She deserves credit, though, for having the strangest resume of Hollywood stars.... I mean--to have the same actress in PSYCHO, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and BYE BYE BIRDIE!?!!  Bizarre!  That should wreak havoc on anyone's "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon."</p></body></html>

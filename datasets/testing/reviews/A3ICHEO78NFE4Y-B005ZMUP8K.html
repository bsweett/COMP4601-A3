<meta name="summary" content="I don't know who was more bord, me or Depp"></head><body><p>Somehow i just don't find this movie all that entertaining.  Johnny Depp looks bord in many of the scenes of this film.  Special effects are not anything i really enjoy or get excited about but give me the older days when pirates were pirates.  He sort of look like a badly made up drag queen.  To me the good films of today are very few and far inbetween.  This one is way far inbetween.  Don't bother.  Rent yourself an old Gene Kelly MGM Pirate movie instead.  Actors today,,,,yuk!</p></body></html>

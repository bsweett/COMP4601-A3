<meta name="summary" content="Ridiculous movie"></head><body><p>And again, everyone loves the emperor's clothes and how pretty all the colors are. Dustin Hoffman's career is circling down the drain much in the same manner that Robert De Niro's is, by showing up in films like this that are so utterly undeserving of his talent. If this is esteemed as a work of vision and depth, then the fix is truly in and the moviegoing public has been broken on the wheel of mediocrity- happily ingesting any substandard, contemptible feed Hollywood wishes to slop into the entertainment trough. Just because someone can recreate the streets of Paris or can CGI color a few fruits and hairdos to convey beauty and richness of experience doesn't mean that we should all clap and be awestruck. This movie is meaningless and unbelievable, a mockery of the period piece, the detective thriller, the psychosexual drama, the tortured genius expose, or any other genre it unintentionally parodies.<br /><br />In politics, some say we get the government we deserve. By heaping praise on hollow window dressing like "Perfume", it looks like we will all continue to get the movies we deserve. Giving further life to this box office bomb via rentals or DVD sales is simply irresponsible. I bet the author of the book had to be restrained from going into the lot when this was filming, hoping he could find the screenwriter and sock him(and I say 'him' because I'm having trouble with the idea that an intelligent woman would countenance abetting the creation of such mindless exploitation of the fairer sex) in the jaw.</p></body></html>

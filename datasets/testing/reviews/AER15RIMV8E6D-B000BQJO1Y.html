<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Classic!!!"></head><body><p>There are a lot of things I love about this movie. I love the dialogue about the zombies including "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth." I love all the gore scenes; like toward the end there is an awesome gore scene where the zombies are ripping some guy apart and showing his guts. It even has the classic look of the 70's! Not long after the original, the zombies are still coming back to life and feeding on the flesh of the living. A group of friends named Stephen, Peter, Roger, and Francine leave Philadelphia in a helicopter and see that the epidemic is worldwide. They soon take refuge in a huge mall and make themselves at home. Soon, more zombies get inside the mall and they must fight for their lives. I highly recommend DAWN OF THE DEAD!!!</p></body></html>

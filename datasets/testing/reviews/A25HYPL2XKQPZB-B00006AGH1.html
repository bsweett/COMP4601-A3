<meta name="summary" content="A no-win situation"></head><body><p>The Sum of all Fears is a gripping thriller in which a young Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) must by himself stop the US and Russia from blowing each other to pieces via nuclear war.<p>The exciting climax comes about because of a nuclear attack.  The US thinks it is Russia and are prepared to retaliate.  The nuclear attack was in fact caused by a third party.  Here is the problem of the movie.<p>In Clancy's original novel, the terrorists were anti-Israeli Islamic extremists.  Before the 09/11 tragedy, the movie decided to the politically correct route and replace the Islamic terrorists with facist Nazis.  Thus, thousands of Americans die by a nuclear bomb and the movie portrays it as the responsibility of only a few deranged Nazis.  In retrospect, the producers would have made a better movie by keeping the bad guys as the Islamic terrorists, but I don't think anyone would want to see that kind of movie.  It would be too realistic.<p>So Sum of All Fears is a good movie that uses bad guys (Nazis) that aren't really a threat instead of someone like Al Queda, who are a threat, to get to the thrust of the movie.  If you can overlook who the bad guys are, this movie turns out to be really exciting.</p></body></html>

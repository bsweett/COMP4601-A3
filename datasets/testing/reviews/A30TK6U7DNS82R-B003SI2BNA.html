<meta name="summary" content="Phenomena Revisited"></head><body><p>DARK WATER's a good horror film, if a bit overlong, and it's fueled by the passionateb performance of Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia, a woman with mother problems of her own and a history of mental instability (or merely migraines)?  Her intensity is mirrored by her little girl, Cecilia (Ariel Gade), who is like a little "Mini Me" version of Dahlia, and just as exquisite.  I remember this little girl from INVASION, and I hope the poor thing doesn't grow up with hydrophobia after her exposure to dripping ghoulish water in this film and in that ill-fated Everglades based sci fi series.<br /><br />I kept flashing back to Connelly herself as the world's most beautiful little girl actress, in Dario Argento's giallo PHENOMENA, where she had the strange power to talk to insects and make them obey her.  Just as Dahlia and Cecilia seem to be haunted by the spirit of a little girl ghost turned malevolent by the trauma of being abandoned by her mother and father (and possibly murdered by a building super?), it seemed that Connelly's American schoolgirl in Italy in PHENOMENA was also "acting out" from being abandoned by her father, an American movie star on the order of Sylvester Stallone (or Al Pacino).  Thus I think Walter Salles picked out the perfect actress to play the central part in DARK WATER, for so many of his shots recall Jennifer Connelly as a young girl, so that the performance itself is haunted by an earlier performance, and we see like X-rays the bones that made this presence work.<br /><br />I didn't understand if Dougray Scott, whom Dahlia spies talking to two evil teens who menace the building and its occupants, was in cahoots with them for real, perhaps paying them to drive his former wife crazy, or is Dahlia just paranoid?  I'd be sort of paranoid myself, especially if I sat down for a nap and didn't wake up for 24 hours.  Salles and his screenwriters lay on the agony a little thick, but how can they help themselves when they have one of the USA's most expressive actresses to bring their torments to life.  One thing I don't understand about Japanese-based horror films, don't the angry ghosts ever find a shred of happiness, or do they always just want revenge on the living?  If so, why doesn't the little Russian girl go after Pete Postlethwaite?</p></body></html>

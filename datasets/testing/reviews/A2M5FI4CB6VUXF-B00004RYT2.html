<meta name="summary" content="Can't say enough good about this movie!"></head><body><p>There were a few "hollywood" inaccuracies that bothered me. For example, it was Meniere's disease, not an ear infection that plagued Al Shepard. Furthermore, it wasn't Menieres that kept him off Apollo 13. It was an administrative decision based on the need to give him and his rookie crew more time to train.<br /><br />Other than those minor nitpicks, I REALLY enjoyed this film. I didn't obsess over the missed details, mind you. This is, after all, a hollywood adaptation of Jim Lovell's recounting. Facts are going to be skewed a bit here and there. As entertainment value goes, it was wonderful! Suspenseful, emotional and, all-in-all, pretty close to the reality of the situation.<br /><br />As historical movies go, it actually wasn't too bad on accuracy. And what it lacked in accuracy, it more than made up for in sheer entertainment value.<br /><br />Jim Lovell's cameo in the end was the icing on the cake.</p></body></html>

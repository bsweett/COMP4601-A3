<meta name="summary" content="strong cast in a script that's wanting"></head><body><p>It's not easy to critisize filmmakers you respect (have liked Fargo, Blood Simple, Barton Fink, etc.), but this one here could have been something truly great...alas, the story limps along and finally leaves you saying What the hell?<br /><br />One solution may have been to make the film longer, because as it stands there is hardly enough time to tell everyone's tale as it should have been told: three different storylines going simultaneously that finally collide and/or connect to some sort of deneument.<br /><br />All you have to do is take a look at Sergio Leone's masterpiece Once Upon A time In America to get what I am saying here: the short version was choppy and didn't work, the long/director's cut works terrifically and is considered (by many) to be one hell of a motion picture, perhaps even a classic of its kind.</p></body></html>

When I heard that it was being made into a film I was very skeptical as most of the novel seems to be interior monologue.  Anyway - I don't know how they did it, but they pulled it off beautifully.<br /><br />Most of the success must be handed to Daldry for managing to make such an interior novel into a filmed, blended story.  An amazing feat, really.<br /><br />The perfomances are all exceptional.  These are actors who understood the material and respected it.  Streep, Kidman, Reilly, Harris and Colette are just perfect.  Moore is just brilliant as Laura Brown.<br /><br />This is a dark, sad melodrama- so it's not for everyone.  If that is your cup of tea, however - get it now!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Classic"></head><body><p>I watched this movie last night (on Groundhog Day, of course!) because it's one of my all-time faves, and always a treat. I loved it when I first saw it in the theater, and I've watched it three or four times now. Each time, I notice more tidbits that just add to the wonderfulness.<p>I won't go into details about the storyline, as others have already done so. However, I will note that not only is the script clever and Bill Murray's performance terrific, but the structure and pacing of the movie are almost perfect. Each time you go &quot;around the loop&quot; you get just enough new information to follow the story as new elements are introduced. There's not a wasted moment in the whole movie.<p>I know it's a cliche.... but I'd have to say that if you could only buy 10 movies to watch over and over again, this should be one of them.  It's that good, and it holds up that well. Think of it as a modern-day &quot;It's A Wonderful Life.&quot;</p></body></html>

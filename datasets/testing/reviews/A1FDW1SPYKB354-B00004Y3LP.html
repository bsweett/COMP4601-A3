It is a truly &#34;fun&#34; movie experience from start to finish. And evidently a bunch of other folks agree with me, because &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; earned approximately 357-Million dollars at the box office after premiering in movie theaters on June 11, 1993, placing the film in the Top 10 of all-time money-makers in motion-picture history (as of this writing, the film ranked #10).<br /><br />Spielberg was making &#34;Jurassic&#34; at precisely the same time he was also directing the emotionally-draining &#34;Schindler's List&#34;, which is a film that would go on to win the 1993 &#34;Best Picture&#34; Academy Award. Talk about a large workload! But Mr. Spielberg seemed to thrive on this juggling act of making two pictures at virtually the same time. And both movies came out in fine shape too, a fact which is backed up by the accolades (and huge box-office numbers) each movie garnered. (&#34;Schindler's&#34; earned just under $100-Million at the U.S. box office; and approximately $321-Million in worldwide release.)<br /><br />The personal storylines that were written for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; are a smidge on the weak side, true. But that doesn't really matter all that much in the final analysis -- because the movie is so much fun otherwise! And the choice of actor Jeff Goldblum to play the part of &#34;Dr. Ian Malcolm&#34; was the best casting decision made for the whole picture, in my view. He adds a lot of humor to the film.<br /><br />I've liked Mr. Goldblum in everything I've ever seen him in; and the &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; films are no exception (he reprised his role as &#34;Ian&#34; in the second &#34;Jurassic&#34; picture as well). His dry humor and easy-going style come across nicely in this film. Such as his humorous line: &#34;Yeah, I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.&#34; And, of course, THE funniest moment in the movie, when Ian/Jeff utters the hilarious line of dialogue that I've used as the title of this review (after narrowly escaping a rather large predator in a high-speed chase). LOL!  :-)<br /><br />Plus, yet another witty Goldblum-ism (reacting to a disappointing dinosaur-less tour of the park): &#34;Now, John, you will eventually be having DINOSAURS on your dinosaur tour, right? Right?&#34; :)<br /><br />Mr. Spielberg blends a great deal of comedy in with what should be a major calamity --&#62; dinosaurs coming back to life and running free, spreading death and destruction! Sounds pretty serious, right? Well, it is -- but Spielberg manages to lighten up this scenario skillfully, with several humorous scenes. Besides the aforementioned funny Jeff Goldblum moments, there's also &#34;The Guy On The Toilet Meets Dino&#34; scene; as well as the nerdish computer programmer (played nicely by Wayne Knight), who gets way more than he's bargained for in the end.<br /><br />The great John Williams composed the music score for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; -- and it fits the movie like a glove. I don't know how Mr. Williams keeps doing it, coming up with first-rate musical scores for film after film -- but he does. Amazing.<br /><br />This Universal Studios single-disc &#34;Collector's Edition&#34; DVD of &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; offers up great picture and sound -- via a full and booming Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack and a handsome Widescreen (1.85:1) Anamorphic video transfer. Those pre-historic beasts really &#34;come alive&#34; while watching this DVD.<br /><br />A generous helping of Special Features is dished out by Universal, too -- with the top prize in the package being the very informative behind-the-movie documentary featurette, &#34;The Making Of Jurassic Park&#34; (hosted by James Earl Jones). Mr. Spielberg has lots of on-camera time during this eye-opening featurette, explaining much of the creative work that went into getting this film to the movie screen.<br /><br />This Making-Of program throws the viewer right into the center of Steven Spielberg's movie-making process. Included are many details about the computer-generated effects, which were quite new and untested in the motion-picture industry at the time of the film's production in late 1992 and 1993, making &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; a true pioneering film in many &#34;CGI&#34; ways.<br /><br />Other bonus items on the disc include: An &#34;animatics&#34; feature, storyboards, production photographs, design sketches and paintings, theatrical trailers, DVD-ROM stuff, a &#34;Dinosaur Encyclopedia&#34;, and some cast-&-crew text notes.<br /><br />Additional Data Concerning This DVD .....................<br /><br />&#62; French language soundtrack included (in Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround).<br /><br />&#62; Subtitles in Spanish.<br /><br />&#62; Running Time for Main Feature = 2 hrs., 7 min.<br /><br />&#62; MPAA Rating -- PG-13.<br /><br />&#62; Any Paper Insert(s)? -- Yes, a 4-page mini-booklet, with some behind-the-scenes pics and a Chapter List (20 total scene selections).<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />Parting Jurassic Thoughts ...................<br /><br />There's a certain &#34;magic&#34; that emanates from &#34;Jurassic Park #1&#34; -- with its three main ingredients for success (and fun) being: Director Steven Spielberg, John Williams' terrific score, and those first-of-their-kind computer-generated images that we see on screen, which make the dinosaurs seem, almost literally -- alive!<br /><br />The &#34;Jurassic&#34; sequels that were released in 1997 and 2001 were, IMO, okay films in their own right. But you can't top the original.</p></body></html>

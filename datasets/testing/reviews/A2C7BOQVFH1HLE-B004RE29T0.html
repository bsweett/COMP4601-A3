<meta name="summary" content="My Favourite Alien Installment Now On Blu-Ray To Mixed Results!"></head><body><p>I was expecting quite a bit more from this release and while I can understand Fox's preference for consumers to buy the whole Alien Anthology package which costs a lot more and hence translates to higher revenue for them I think it is also wrong to penalise the fan who is only interested in one or a couple of the installments.  If it is a matter of disc space then I can understand why there are no Special Feature documentaries on the making of the movie are on this as having both the 1979 Theatrical and the 2003 Director's Cut on the same disc is great although I wouldn't have minded something similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001992NW4">The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] where we get a nice digibook plus 2 discs with the different versions on each disc plus great Special Feature extras.  I still think as far as blu-ray releases go that this one is the best I've seen so far in regards to being as perfect a blu-ray release to satisfy the fan that I've seen to date.<br /><br />Also, for some reason my disc keeps skipping and stopping at key points making me suspect I got a bum disc as so far no one else has complained about it.  When my disc was working correctly though, I thought the picture quality was very good and so was the THX DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround Sound quality as well.  Having watched both versions I personally preferred the 2003 Director's Cut as it speeded things up a little to suit modern tastes and despite the addition of new scenes still ran at about the same length as the 1979 version.  Truth be told though I thought both versions were very good.  I liked the homage Ridley Scott clearly paid to one of my all time favourite films <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66J1M">2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>] and it certainly had a very Stanley Kubrick feel about it.  The theme of greedy big corporations putting profits ahead of human life seeking to implement weapons of mass destruction is sadly still relevant today whether it is biological as it is here or financial as in real life.  Can Corporate Social Responsibility really be embedded into the culture of powerful corporations or is it just a construct to keep us happy while the boards of directors laugh at us behind their closed-door meetings?<br /><br />Overall, this release was a mixed bag for me as it could have been a lot better and not just an afterthought when compared to the complete anthology version.  Even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00319ECGK">The Matrix [Blu-ray</a>] release was decent for those who didn't want to get the entire trilogy.  Instead I get the feeling I'm being punished by Fox for not getting the entire Anthology with a pretty pitiful release of "Alien" on blu-ray.<br /><br />Verdict: wait for a better release.</p></body></html>

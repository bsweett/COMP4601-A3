<meta name="summary" content="A much better film than Prisoner of Azkaban!"></head><body><p>Cuaron destroyed the movie Prisoner of Azkaban to the point that it held little if any real resemblance to the book from which it was adapted. Goblet of Fire, in the hands of a REAL director, luckily returns to many of the things that make the series so grand. You have plenty of substance. You have storyline and plot that really moved this series along about as well as the book does. The problem with part four is that it DOESN'T really serve much purpose in the series. It merely foreshadows what will come.... and serves to show that Voldemort is evil. We already KNEW That!<br /><br />But as movies go, it's a great adaptation. The only problem I had with it was a similar problem I had with part three.... Too much cutting of important information. The usual Potter MOVIE fan is going to be confused as to how Harry makes it to Hogsmeade village in future parts without knowing that, at the end of book 3, a certain character signs his permission slip, thereby granting him said permission. This is just one of the glaring deletions that are going to make the movies really hard to follow...<br /><br />I also missed Dobby and S.P.E.W.<br /><br />I understand why they were deleted, but so much more could have been done.<br /><br />Note to future directors. Don't be afraid to make the film 3 hours. Many obsessed fans such as myself won't mind spending the extra time with our beloved Harry Potter!</p></body></html>

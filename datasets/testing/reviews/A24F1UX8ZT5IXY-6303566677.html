<meta name="summary" content="The sequels only diluted it."></head><body><p>The Terminator remains the great 80s B-Film. Not only does it have a sexed-up "Outer Limits" plot with a brilliant conception of a futuristic war against self-generating machines, but in in the best "Escape From Planet of the Apes" tradition, it even takes place in the present day.<br /><br />The Terminator was a breakthrough film that altered the Sci-Fi mainstream. Its nihilism and violence killed off the Star Wars era, and ushered in the second half of the 80s, during which McTiernan/Cameron thrived. But all of this cultural relativism aside, The Terminator is a well-constructed, skillfully shot lower-budget film. The unrelenting pace has a become a textbook for subsequent directors.<br /><br />But I do I think it is unfortunate that there were sequels made. "T2" immediately does away with the Del James-esque poetics of the first film and goes for pure commercialism. It has neither the nihilism nor the urgency of the first, and the science fiction element is simply rehashed, with mediocre results. Terminator 3 does a decent job of continuing with the story, but it too just makes the same point (in a much less subtle way) than this first film, which stands on its own.<br /><br />And the blu-ray looks great.</p></body></html>

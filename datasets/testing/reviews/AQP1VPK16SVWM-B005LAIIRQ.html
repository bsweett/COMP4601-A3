<meta name="summary" content="Plane crash survivors must brave the wilderness and a pack of grey wolves if they are to live in "The Grey","></head><body><p>Liam Neeson gives a riveting performance in a dark thriller set in the Alaskan wilderness. When a plane carrying Alaskan pipeline workers crashes in the middle of nowhere, the nine survivors find themselves in a struggle for survival; their plane has crashed in an area where a pack of grey wolves hunt and the seven survivors must face off against a brutal, fierce enemy that has every advantage except one--the human will to survive.<br /><br />Featuring a terrific supporting cast (Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo among others)and a strong script that manages to quickly sketch in the seven characters at the heart of the film.<br /><br />A bit of a left turn for director Joe Carnahan after the big studio productions he has directed of late ("The A-Team"), "The Grey" returns the director to the smaller ensemble based thrillers/dramas he began with--"Narc" and "Smokin' Aces" that help make his reputation- demonstrating that, as good as he is at big Hollywood productions, he's better with smaller, more intimate productions like "The Grey".<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a sharp, nicely detailed transfer. Audio sounds powerful and is VERY active putting you right there in the wilderness with our main characters.<br /><br />The special features are a bit limited--we get deleted scenes (some extended versions of some in the film) and a great, very frank commentary track from the director with editors Roger Barton and Jason Hellmann. It's a very informative and nicely done commentary track.<br /><br />Although a bit on the lite side when it comes to the special features what matters is the film itself. Although "The Grey" is very much a downbeat film, it's also a powerful film and well worth watching.</p></body></html>

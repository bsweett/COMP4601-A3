<meta name="summary" content="Gorgeous, well-directed, but without much depth"></head><body><p>This is a very well made and well-directed film, but I have to agree with previous reviewers who have found it superficial and . . . well, not very deep. The story just doesn't amount to very much, and while there are hints that the film is trying to say more than is on the surface, it doesn't do a very good job of making it clear what points, if any, it is trying to make. On one level, the film is about the relation between fathers and sons, but if you compare this film on fathers to FEAR STRIKES OUT or any of several dozen films one could name, it looks pretty lame. I also suspect that most people will find the end of the movie rather unpleasant.<p>Nonetheless, the film does manage to do several things spectacularly well. Although many films have managed a great period look and feel, this one manages that as well as any I have seen. The film is set in 1931, and the amount of detail is quite stunning. There is also judicious use of computers to eliminate much modern detailing in shots. I live in Chicago where much of the action was filmed, and recognized the exact or approximate locations of many of the scenes, and noted that many details have been miraculously eliminated. The film is also magnificently photographed, and is always utterly beautiful to look at. The musical score is lush and somber and perfectly suited for the film's action. The movie should get a lot of Oscar nominations for art direction, music, sound, and photography. <p>The acting is very competent, but this is not an actors' film. Apart from Jude Law's quirky part, there are few opportunities for thespian histrionics. Most of the performances are muted, as if successfully containing a horde of emotion within. There are few "big scenes." This doesn't mean that the performances aren't enormously competent. But the viewer won't leave the theater thinking, "Lord, that guy can act." Tom Hanks is fine, but this won't rank among his most memorable performances. It was more wonderful than I can express to see Paul Newman in this, given his relative inactivity in recent years. I would take bets right now that he will take home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Daniel Craig turns in an appropriately loathsome performance as Newman's son and the manufacturer of all the tragedy in the film. I was not as enamored of Jude Law's performance as some of my fellow reviewers. For a few years now I have felt that Law was just one or two pictures away from superstardom. In ROAD TO PERDITION, he plays completely against type. Although one of the most handsome actors working today, he is made up to look slovenly, pale, and incredibly unhygienic. But his particular performance required little in the way of acting skill. I still expect him to break out hugely in the future. He is a very fine actor with absurdly good looks, and I will continue to await his future roles with great interest. Tyler Hoechlin did a fine job as Tom Hanks son.<p>This picture will receive a great deal of Oscar hype, and most of that I believe will be undeserved, apart from technical nominations. This is an exceptionally constructed film that ultimately could be considered somber and serious fluff. Not a masterpiece, but also not at all a waste of time.</p></body></html>

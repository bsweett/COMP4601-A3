King Harold is on his death bed and is nearly ready to croak. He informs Shrek (who does not want to be king) that there is one other, Arthur (Pendragon). Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots set off to retrieve Arthur. As the ship leaves, Fiona tells Shrek that she is pregnant. Shrek does look forward to being a father. He is worried that he would be a bad role model. The trio arrives at Worcestershire Academy where Arthur is a student. He is a sixteen year old kid who's from the school bullies to the class nerds taunt Arthur. Shrek tell Artie (as he likes to be called) that he is the new king of Far Far Away. At first Artie is excited about being king. On the ship Donkey and Puss In Boots start talking about the responsibilities of being king and Artie begins to have second thoughts. Artie tries to turn the ship. Shrek and Artie are now in a battle of the ship wheel and during the struggle the wheel breaks and the ship crash on some rocks. Shrek, Donkey, Puss In Boots, and Artie make it to shore. The foursome find the home of Merlin; a retired wizard from Artie old school. Meanwhile Prince Charming and all of the evil characters hatch a plot to take over Far Far Away. Prince Charming and the gang capture Fiona, Queen Lilian, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Doris the Ugly Stepsister, and Cinderella. Prince Charming finds out through one of the three little pigs that Arthur is the next in line and Shrek went to get him. Prince Charming sends Captain Hook and some thugs to kill Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots and bring back Arthur. Captain Hook and the thugs fail and Merlin cast a spell that would send all four of them back to Far Far Away. When they arrive at Far Far Away. Donkey is inside Puss In Boots body and Puss In Boots is in Donkey's body. The four make it back to the castle and Shrek finds his way to Prince Charming and is about to clobber him, however, Prince Charming is able to call for his men and capture Shrek. Shrek manages to trick Prince Charming to take him and let Artie go. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are thrown in the tower. Prince Charming plans to kill Shrek in a play tonight. Queen Lilian literally butts her head against a couple walls so the folks in the tower can escape. Once free the princess, Donkey, and Puss In Boots make plans to win back Far Far Away and save Shrek. At the theater Prince Charming is at the part in the play where he is about to kill Shrek until troops arrive and are about to save him until Prince Charming summing his thugs and captures the rescuers. Just as about Prince Charming is about to slew Shrek, Arthur arrives and reason with the villains to turn over a new leaf. The villains lay down their weapons and release the captives. Prince Charming is angry and picks up a sword to kill Arthur, but Shrek intervenes and is able to save Arthur and defeat Prince Charming. Arthur finally accepts the crown. Shrek and Fiona become parents of triplets. The first half of the movie is not bad, but fall about at the end. The movie could have a better ending and more story.

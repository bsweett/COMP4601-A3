<meta name="summary" content="A bad remake."></head><body><p>This movie kind of proves that you can't improve on the classics.  I feel so bad, as to how bad, that i don't want to say any more bad things about this film.  It's just poor.  Get the original and rent it.  Check out the actors of yesterday against these want-to-be's.</p></body></html>

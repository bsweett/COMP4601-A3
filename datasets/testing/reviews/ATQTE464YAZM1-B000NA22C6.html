<meta name="summary" content="Another King adaptation gone horribly dull"></head><body><p>I had high hopes for this movie. Then the words "Based on the Stephen King novel" came on during the opening credits and I knew I was in for something. Maybe other reviewers will have to forgive me, you see I've had bad experiences with "Storm of the Century," "The Langoliers," and the recent "Dreamcatcher," so maybe I'm being unfair...or maybe I just find myself let down by every single adaptation of a Stephen King novel I've ever seen.<br /><br />As usual, the characters like to take the hardest path out of a difficult situation. Johnny Depp is a writer who is out in the forest living in a cabin trying to come up with a new story when a Mississippi hick comes up and says, "You copied my story!" Eventually Depp points out that his version was published two years before the hicks, but the hick wants proof - which Depp can easily supply via the original copy of the magazine the story was published in. Of course, that would be TOO easy. Instead Depp decides to take a few naps and procrastinate. To get some action out of our hero, the hick kills his dog.<br /><br />Here is the only brief shining moment of intellegence in the movie: Depp is told by the hick not to tell the police...so he does! Yet there's a problem, (doh!) that being the local sheriff doesn't think a man going onto another man's property, grabbing his dog, and stabbing it to death with a screwdriver is a crime. And so for the rest of the movie its pretty much like "Storm of the Century" except "Give me what what I want and I'll go away" is replaced with "Show me the magazine!" This goes on and on...and instead of, you know, SHOWING him the freggin' magazine Johnny Depp just keeps digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble. Most of the time I'm left thinking, "What a MORON!"<br /><br />Of course, things clear up near the ending. But at an incredibly slow pace. Indeed, this had to be one of the longest, most drawn out conclusions ever. The fact that I saw it coming an hour into the movie didn't help either - you don't believe me? The exact same thing was done in "The Usual Suspects," "A Beautiful Mind," and "Fight Club," they just combined them all together. Sad thing is, those great plot twists combined don't work with this particular movie. I thought it was going to be a good ending - you know the kind Depp was striving for in the story - but it was just a typical suspense/psychological/killer ending. Maybe Depp's character should have written the script.<br /><br />Depp's acting in it really wasn't THAT great. He must have two expressions the whole time, and his voice is on constant stoner mode. Even when he impersonates the hick at the end he still sounds basically the same monotone voice, except with the southern accent. He was basically the same as I saw him in "The 9th Gate." Really, all in all this movie is a major letdown. If it received high critical acclaim, then its overrated, simple as that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Offbeat Crime/Comedy Flick"></head><body><p>I'm not quite sure how to describe Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; it's not quite a crime drama, as it has plenty of great offbeat jokes, but it is no light comedy.  The film contains a good mystery plot revolving around two mysterious murders in Los Angeles.  And the characters that inhabit the world of the film are very off-kilter.  In fact, there is no one in the film that I can even label as a straight man.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a two-bit con from New York City.  One night after a heist-gone-bad, he stumbles into an audition while fleeing from the cops.  Despondent over the death of his partner, which he may have caused, he is handed a script for a detective movie in which the character he is reading for JUST WITNESSED HIS PARTNER'S DEATH AND MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR IT!  His emotional state allows him to give a heartfelt performance, and he is asked to come out to LA to get ready for the part.<br /><br />Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan) is an ex-small town girl who came to LA to become a famous movie star.  Well, she did become famous, but for something very different (which I won't spoil).<br /><br />Perry (Val Kilmer) is a homosexual detective who is known around town as Gay Perry, and he is a no-nonsense PI in charge of giving detective lessons to the moronic Harry.  To say that he is less than thrilled to have to babysit the pathetic con man is an understatement.  However, things change when the three of them are inexplicably pulled into a murder plot involving Harmony's sister and the daughter of one of LA's most powerful men.<br /><br />The film is narrated by Harry, but he takes on the job in a way very few before him have; he is self-aware as a narrator, and he often criticizes his narration style, kicking himself for omitting critical details, and actually "stopping" the film to go back and show us the scene in question.  At one point, he even yells at two people in the film who are obscuring something to get out of the way.<br /><br />In addition to Harry's bizarre narration, a lot of the humor stems from Perry's constant insults towards Harry, which Kilmer always delivers in a delightful deadpan.  Also, there are numerous situations in the film that are just so strange that one can't help but laugh as they break the tension of the gritty plot (which is perfectly set against the grittier side of LA, though lately, that is the only side that is showcased in film and television nowadays).<br /><br />I will say that the solution to the mystery is a little convoluted, but they go through it enough times to allow us to wrap our heads around it.  Overall, this film is very enjoyable, and while it may put some people off (at the end, they actually apologize to "all the nice people in the midwest" for using the f-word so much), it is worth checking out, if only to hear Downey's hilarious narration techniques.</p></body></html>

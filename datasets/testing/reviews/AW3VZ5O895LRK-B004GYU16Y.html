<meta name="summary" content="Jolie Top Notch In Action Genre Film"></head><body><p>I am not an action adventure film fan and watch few of them.  However, Angelina Jolie interests me.  When asked to play a "Bond girl" because of her great beauty, she replied that she was only interested in playing Bond. Bravo! She teams well with director Phillip Noyce in making riveting action sequences.  He stages them with split second precision and she executes them flawlessly. Whenever stunt people take over, you simply cannot tell.  It is seamless. She is also built right for the part.  She does not have a delicate build.  Her hands, arms, feet, and legs are believably those of someone who is honed to military like performance.<br /><br />The plot is as convoluted as it always seems to be in these entertainments.  It involves Russian moles in US intelligence and the USA suddenly believing she is one of these moles.  This puts her on the run from US intelligence, the Secret Service and the police.  "On the run" are the operative words and are really the jist of this film. She vaults from one edge of your seat situation to another.  If you need something deeper, it is not here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Classic Never Seen"></head><body><p>Fans of futuristic action will not be disappointed with this film; While it offers some of the most memorable gunfights in recent cinema history, it also boasts great perrformances; As usual, Christian Bale brings credibility to a film that could go so wrong in another actor's hands; You read his anguish in his face, his clenching jaw...he puts himself emotionally into his role and sells it. Taye Diggs hits all the right marks as Bale's partner, and Watson is great for the little screen time shes given. Too bad Sean Bean wasn't used more...This movie could have been extremely silly, but the people involved cared enough to make it both a film with action and depth.</p></body></html>

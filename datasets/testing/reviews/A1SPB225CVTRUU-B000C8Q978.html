<meta name="summary" content="Where Have All the Ex-girlfriends Gone?"></head><body><p>Broken Flowers is no doubt a star-showcase film for Bill Murray, since he is in every single scene, and he managed to delivered a heartfelt if not as funny as his Lost In Translation<br />performance. This film didn't work well as a comedy, because it's rather slow-paced, conversational, and a lack of jokes. There are numerous silent moments when Murray performs solo scenes, and it seemed like a waste of screentime, considered that the actresses in this film had very little screentime. Murray's interactions with the ex-girlfriend characters were far more captivating and entertaining than the scenes of him observing other people or having flashbacks at the airport and in the plane.<br /><br />Bill Murray plays an over-the-hill playboy named Don Johnston  as his current girlfriend Sherry(Julie Delpy) calls him before leaving him to do some self-discovery, and confronts to him that she felt like a mistress to him even when he's not even married at his age. Don receives an anonymous letter from one of his ex-friends telling him that he has a 19 year-old son and is on the way to find him. He's surprised and confused, and had to seek the advice of his neighbour Winston(Jeffrey Wright). From there Don would travel on the roads and flights to visit his four ex-girlfriends in hoping to unsolve the mystery.<br /><br />Sharon Stone plays Laura, a single mother with an ultra-precocious teenage daughter named Lolita(Alexis Dziena), who was always walking around either naked or in bikinis inside the house. Don wondered why Laura would give such a name to her daughter. Frances Conray plays Dora, who's happily married to Ron(Christopher McDonald), and they are successful in realty business. She was very suprised by the unexpected visit from Don, and it was obvious that she still has feeling for him. Jessica Lange plays a lawyer turned "animal communicator", and she's by far the most eccentric of them all. Her intense and controlling assistant is played by the scene stealing Chloe Sevigny. Finally, the least exposed Tilda Swinton plays Penny, an angry woman resided next to two mean truckers in an isolated area.<br /><br />As a fan of Tilda Swinton, Jessica Lange, and especially Julie Delpy who was unforgetable in last year's Before Sunset, I was kind of disappointed that they all had less than ten minutes of screentime. Of all the female characters in this film, the most striking were Sharon Stone and Frances Conray. Jeffrey Wright provided some comic relief moments opposite Murray. Overall, Murray is very good with his restraint and subtle expressions. Even though this is a flawed movie, but Murray's Oscar-caliber performance is quite worthwhile, and the supporting cast is just irresistable.</p></body></html>

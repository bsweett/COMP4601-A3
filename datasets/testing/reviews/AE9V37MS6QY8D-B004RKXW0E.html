<meta name="summary" content="So Great it Should be Considered for a Best Picture Oscar (and not just the animated category)!"></head><body><p>I've found that Pixar films are often like The Beatles' songs: they first premiered for kids but everyone can enjoy them - and after time and closer examination, you find that they're actually geared more toward adults; they get better as the years progress; and those who don't like them, you seriously question their taste. Sure, there's maybe one or two that aren't too favorable (for me, I compare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1Y43W">Cars [Blu-ray</a>], the only Pixar film I'm not too crazy about, to "Revolution 9"), but, mostly, they're all pretty much genius. I realize there are anti-Beatles fans out there who are cursing my words. To them, I say, "Sorry, but I hope you know that whatever musician/band you really love, it's most likely they were influenced by The Beatles. You can't deny that The Beatles are a paramount in the music industry." Anyway, let's move on ...<br /><br />The franchise that built Pixar returns to the masses for a third installment. I remember the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIYWA">Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)</a> being really good but I wasn't as crazy for it as most everyone else. Then, the sequel came out and I absolutely loved it. Over the years, I re-watched the first film a few times, and each time I watched it (like the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYC1">Shrek (Full Screen Single Disc Edition)</a>), I enjoyed and appreciated it more and more. Like any third film in a trilogy, as a fan or someone who merely enjoyed the first two films, you hope that the last film is just as good, if not better, than the first two. Unfortunately, you're often disappointed. Even the sacred trilogies of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DG">Star Wars Trilogy</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray</a>] films had fell victim to a bad/subpar final third act. But for those young and old fans of Woody and Buzz and all of Andy's toys, "Toy Story 3" will not disappoint you in the least!<br /><br />The brilliance of the "Toy Story" films is that it's not just a story about talking toys for kids to go ga-ga over. It's also a story about getting older and what that means to you and to those you care about, concern over growing out of relationships, building new relationships, accepting yourself for who you are and being OK with it, and moving on to what's next in life ... even though it can be excruciatingly scary. In this installment, we find the toys looking to find a place for themselves - and overcoming their own insecurities - now that their owner Andy is grown up and moving to college. Now here's where "Toy Story 3" shows its genius. In a trilogy where the human characters, although central to the storyline, haven't had much screen time, this film wraps up Andy's childhood in his home with his mom all in front of our eyes. And for any parent, whether you've had to see your kid(s) off away from home already or still have yet to experience it, it's understandably a bittersweet moment. It's that moment that will have moms weeping like babies, dads struggling to choke back the tears (even for me, who watched this scene with my daughter next to me), and those who don't even have kids appreciating the raw emotion and impact of such an inevitable moment in life.<br /><br />But let's not overlook the extremely clever humor that also goes with the trilogy and especially "Toy Story 3." Not only are talents like Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear), Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head?), John Ratzenberger (Hamm the Piggy Bank), Joan Cusack (Jesse), Wallace Shawn (Rex), Blake Clark (filling in for Jim Varney as Slinky Dog), Estelle Harris (Mrs. Potato Head?), and Jodi Benson (Barbie?) effortlessly bringing great laughs, but also newcomers Michael Keaton (Ken?), Whoopi Goldberg (Stretch), Jeff Garlin (Buttercup the Unicorn), Kristen Schaal (Trixie), Bonnie Hunt (Dolly), Timothy Dalton (Mr. Pricklepants), and even baddie Ned Beatty (Lotso) add more humor that is subtle but hilarious without being too goofy or over-the-top - like most kids' movies nowadays. "Toy Story 3" has the entire package: drama, comedy, action, and even romance. But most importantly, it's got heart! This may sound hokey, and any film that tried to capture all of these different genres might come off as such. However, Disney Pixar has mastered their storytelling, and they have an uncanny way of tying all of these perfectly together to churn out some of the best movies (animated or not) today. Their animation has also emphatically improved with this latest release. In the scene where Buzz Lightyear's back panel is being opened and the tiny screws are taken out, when the camera closes up on them, the screws look like actual live-action, non-animated screws. There are several instances where the animation doesn't look like animation at all!<br /><br />One of my absolute favorite films last year was Pixar's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6G6">Up (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>]. In fact, it's one of my favorite films of all time. With every feature that Pixar has released, I keep wondering when their streak of great films will end. I'm happy that they have yet to release a bad film. Even their animated shorts at the beginning of their feature films are great. This time, their short feature, "Day & Night," is the best they've ever done - in animation and in story. It's my new favorite, taking the place of "For the Birds" which preceded <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168OIOE">Monsters, Inc. (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>], and it should win awards. Overall, I would take movies like "Toy Story 3" over supposed hits like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray</a>] any day! I've seen James Cameron's blockbuster and even though his filmmaking techniques were groundbreaking, the story was extremely predictable just from watching the trailer, uninspiring and trite (the story being a recycled product of several films, most notably "Dances with Wolves," "Pocahontas," and even Cameron's own earlier, better release <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V7OL">The Abyss (Special Edition)</a>, which focused more on emotion rather than special effects).<br /><br />Sure enough, Pixar has done it again! Their latest is sure to win an Oscar and I'd be surprised if it didn't. "Toy Story 3" is an enjoyable moviegoing experience, regardless of whether you have kids or not. It's a fun ride for all and not to be missed; this should be one of the films you definitely see in the theaters this summer!</p></body></html>

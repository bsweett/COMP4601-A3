This is his first film and I have to say, bravo.  I'm not really into gangster movies, but I heard good things about this film, so I took a chance. It is a masterpiece that will never be forgotten. It's a heist picture, with no actual heist. Tarantino went in a different direction with "Reservoir Dogs" by not showing the actual robbery, but it's visualized with descriptions provided by the characters. That's what made this film so great. This is a definite-must buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint can get away with this"></head><body><p>I am normally not interested in stories about spirits and the departed, nor can I find the conviction to attach importance to the reports that we receive sometimes about 'near death' experiences, which are often claimed to have been post-death experiences, by people who came back to life.<br />I gave this film a chance, because it is 'made' by Eastwood and it stars Matt Damon. That, I thought, would at least guarantee that it is not outright stupid. It isn't.<br />Actually, once you start with the beginning and the South East Asian tsunami pulls you in, and the heartbreaking story of the London twin boys with their addict single mother, it is hard to walk out, though Damon's part (the psychic)tries hard to demotivate me.<br />We have three threads in Paris, London, and San Francisco leading to a unified ending via a London book fair. Whatever the realities behind the ghost world, Clint tells the story well. The hereafter might very well be a genuine concern of his, as it probably is for many of us. I can't quite manage to be convinced that the so-called near-death experience is what it is claimed to be.</p></body></html>

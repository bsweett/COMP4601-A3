<meta name="summary" content="Could have been a GREAT movie, turned out OK"></head><body><p>"28 Days Later" could have been a great movie! Other reviews have covered the plot lines, so I'm not going to rehash them here. This movie had a lot going for it, including a strong plot, good actors, decent effects, and interesting twists. Where it fell down was in the editing and roundabout storytelling. In short, the movie was disjointed and just too long.<br /><br />Only recommended for fans of the genre. The squeal, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN80">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>, is actual a better movie and worth seeing if you like this one.</p></body></html>

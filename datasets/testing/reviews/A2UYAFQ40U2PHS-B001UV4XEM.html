<meta name="summary" content="Not the greatest comedy ever made, but OK for what it is..."></head><body><p>This is not the greatest comedy ever made.  It's probably one of the most overhyped comedies in recent memory.  But it isn't terrible, and it's not the gross out comedy that many have said it is.  It's a mediocre film at best that has some funny moments, and has some moments that make you wonder who could write such a bad script.<br /><br />Many times in the film you see a situation (like when the boys wake up and find a tiger in the bathroom), and the characters in the film constantly say "oh my god, there's a tiger in the bathroom.  How the f*** did that tiger get in the bathroom?  Man, I can't remember how that tiger got in the bathroom" and so on and so on.  This type of situation happens a lot during the film (especially the first half), and it's really poor scripting.  The first half drags because of this poor scripting.  I almost shut the DVD off, but luckily, the film picks up in the 2nd half.  It's almost like the filmmakers realised that they had to finish the film, and decided to wrap things up very, very quickly.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper's character is a very smarmy guy and not very sympathetic.  The dentist is actually a decent sort saddled with a ferociously bitchy girlfriend (played by Rachel Harris), and Zach G plays a guy who is supposed to be nerdy and funny, but quite often he comes across as weird and creepy, not funny.  But there are some good moments in the film, especially the scene where the 3 guys are in the police station, and one of the officers (played by Rob Riggle) calls Zach G "fat Jesus".  Then the 3 guys get tazed by the cops and an audience of kids touring the police station.  It's the funniest scene in the film.  The black drug dealer (called Black Doug in the film) is also a good character and the performance is very funny.<br /><br />While this film is overhyped, it is not the most overrated comedy I've ever seen (that honor still belongs to Knocked Up), and I didn't feel like I was cheated after watching the movie.  Aside from Bradley Cooper's character, the overall tone of the film isn't smug.  It's just light.  So, watch the movie if you like this type of humour.  It's a decent rent.</p></body></html>

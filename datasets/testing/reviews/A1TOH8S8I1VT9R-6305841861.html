It's been a fun ride and an expensive diversion for sure.  But as the bewitching hour draws near, it is time to stop digging for a minute and pay proper respects to a film that is so widely loved that this review will simply get washed away with the tide of reviews from its adoring masses.  I give you "Evil Dead II" (imagine trumpets blaring)!!<br /><br />-"TURE HORROR FANS" CAN BITE MY ASH!!<br />Oh yea, I'm coming after you people!!  It's time to open up a can of reality woopak on you!!  Those of you who say a horror/comedy is not horror at all are living in some self-defined fantasy world of limited thinking.  Most people in their right mind will tell you that half the fun of horror movies IS THE FUN!!!  "Evil Dead II" might be the most fun normal people will have while still getting a little bit scared.  So, "true horror fans", you can take your constipated narrow view of horror and drop it in the trash can man.  Sorry for that tantrum.  But honestly, there are so few really good, completely serious horror films that I'd die of boredom watching the same ten films over and over again.  Now that's "true horror".<br /><br />Indiscriminate Spoilers Ahead!!<br /><br />-STAY OUT OF THE CELLAR!!<br />I've seen this film so many times and yet, every time Ash goes into the cellar I get a little creeped out.  So yea, this film is still scary.  It's not so dark with black, shere terror that you'll have trouble going to sleep at night, but it still gets a few chills from me.  In fact, there are many elements in this film that set the standards for creepy camera work.  Sam Raimi was very inventive here.  When you see the camera (evil spirit) chasing after Ash, just think about how difficult that shot was.  Never mind the scene with the trophy animals and the c.lock on the wall laughing at him; way creepy camera angles!!  As creepy as this stuff is, it's all done brilliantly with a light hearted wink from Raimi.<br /><br />-HOLD ON TO YOUR HEADS AND TAKE A BOW.<br />I need to honor the cast for making this one of my all time favorites.  I tend to neglect actor for the most part.  So, here's the role call.<br />-Bruce Campbell = Ash:  Campbell and Raimi clearly have a love for the 3 Stooges and are certainly Moe schmoes.  As the main man, Campbell might have the most expressive face this side of Jim Carrey.  Needless to say, he is great at slapstick and has made being a horror klown, art.<br />-Denise Bixler = Linda:  Next to Ash, Linda is the most memorable role.  Even though she technically dies very early, she spends a lot of time as a head.  Though hardly the queen of B movies, Denise gets huge respect for all the nastiness she endures in this classic.<br />-Ted Raimi = Possessed Henrietta:  His price for nepotism; spending hours in a ridiculous amount of latex!  What a trooper.  This is a pretty darn creepy character too.<br />-Sarah Berry = Annie Knowby: She has the distinct honor of being the last woman in this realm that Ash lusts after.  She gets pretty messy in the worst ways too.  Raimi was just brutal on these people.<br />-Kassie DePaiva = Bobbie Joe:  She's so sweet and helpful in this film.  It also turns out she's a tree hugger, well, they hug her anyway.<br />-Dan Hicks = Jake: Dan gets to be meat.<br />-Rick Domeier = Ed Getley:  Rick gets to be meat too.<br /><br />These people didn't always distinguish themselves but will always have a place in the hearts of "Evil Dead II" fans for making this such a treat.<br /><br />-IF YOU HAVE D' TIME SON, I HAVE D'WIL SON.<br />Well son, or daughter, or "bro" or "sis" or whatever your position in life may be, I suggest that if you haven't seen this film yet then you either don't have the time (so why are you reading this?) or the will.  Get off your butt and watch this all you fans of horror!!  Bruce Campbell is no George C. Scot, man. However, he is quite brilliant in this standard-bearing comedic/horror classic.  You can spend your Halloween all wet while you Bob for apples, and count to 22 or you can watch one of the most entertaining films a true fan of the genre could ever hope for.<br />Sorry J.  I couldn't figure out how to fit a single letter into this mess!!</p></body></html>

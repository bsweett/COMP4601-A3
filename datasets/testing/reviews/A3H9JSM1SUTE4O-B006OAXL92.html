<meta name="summary" content="A LAYERED, STEAMPUNK DREAM CELEBRATES THE BIRTH OF CINEMA"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese's beautiful film based on Brian Selznic's "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" (screenplay by Josh Logan) is full of gears and timepieces both large and small.  It's riddled with a rich, porous, dream-like fabric that in the end is a celebration of the birth of cinema itself.<br /><br />The story, set in 1930s Paris, is about Hugo, a fatherless boy whose drunken uncle brings him to the train station and teaches him how to run the giant clocks.  The kid is a natural, having learned the mechanics of maintenance and repair from his father.  So when his uncle disappears, Hugo keeps the clocks running.  Always on the run from a station inspector who collects strays and sends them to an orphanage, Hugo eventually becomes involved with an elderly toy merchant and discovers a secret about the man, birth of cinema as an art form and why movies are dreams made real (or at least reel).<br /><br />The 3-D, which I usually hate, is magnificent and most appropriate here.  It greatly enhances the film's extraordinary, multi-layered, dreamy patina from start to finish. And make no mistake, the 2-D version is more than fine.  Steam Punk fans will also find a vibe to enjoy in this sometimes slow, uneven, but heartfelt and beautiful celebration of why movies matter.  And to what level the artistry aspires.</p></body></html>

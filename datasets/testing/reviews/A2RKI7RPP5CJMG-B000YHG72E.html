From the beginning, this movie catches both the imaginations of young kids and the hearts of adults.  It tells the story of the aforementioned Buddy, an orphaned human baby who is raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole, and his attempt to find his real father who just happens to live in New York.<br /><br />Farrell is perfect as the innocent Buddy.  He is captivated by everything New York.  From the huge buildings to the gum on the handrails at the subway entrance, he takes it all in.  When he finds his father(James Caan), he tries his best to be accepted into the family, but his innocence often gets him in the way or in trouble.  Also, Santa runs into a little trouble on Christmas Eve and has to call on Buddy to help save Christmas.  The result is a heart-warming, happy-ending tale that is perfect to watch at Christmas and year-round.<br /><br />The supporting cast is splendid.  Bob Newhart plays Buddy's adoptive elf father.  Ed Asner plays a wonderful Santa.  Mary Steenburgen plays Caan's wife who is amazed by the childlike simplicity of Buddy.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of this flick is the lovely Zooey Deschanel, who plays a department store elf that Buddy falls hard for.  Their date, including a taste of the "world's best coffee," is fun to watch, and Deschanel and Farrell have wonderful chemistry on the screen.<br /><br />Language is pretty light, so the youngsters can watch this.  There are a couple of curse words scattered through the movie, but nothing you can't hear at the mall, unfortunately.  The music is fun.  Deschanel performs "Baby, It's Cold Outside" with Farrell in the film, and with Leon Redbone in the end credits.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this film will become a Christmas favorite and eventually rank up there with holiday comedies like "A Christmas Story."</p></body></html>

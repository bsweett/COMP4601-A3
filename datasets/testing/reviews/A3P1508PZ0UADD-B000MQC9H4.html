<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>This is a good movie that I enjoy as well.  I did not say that I adore this movie, but I can tolerate watching it with my wife, and she loves it.  So, you can tell that it is mostly for the females out there.  It is a stretch to think that Jack Black could end up with Kate Winslet in real life, but hey, maybe there is hope out there for us guys without the six-pack abs and metro-sexual attitudes.  The fact that all this is supposed to take place in two weeks is stretching the imagination a bit, but movies are supposed to entertain, and this one does.</p></body></html>

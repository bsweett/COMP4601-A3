<meta name="summary" content="Too short and choppy"></head><body><p>The problem with this film is that it's too short. The story starts at the wrong place, at exactly when Lecter is discovered and captured, purely by accident by Norton who is consulting him for advice on the murders.<br />Is it just me or are we unaware exactly WHAT Lecter did? Unless you read the books or look at the commentary then you don't know. It would've been nice if a half an hour or forty five minutes was given to Lecter's crimes and victims so that we would get a feelign of how evil he's supposedly.<br />Without that the other killers in this and subsequent films seem gruesomer than the master. It would be nice to see WHY these killers idolize him so much.<br />Ralph Finnes is good here but has very little to work with as we know he's going to be caught, there's no build-up to what makes one nut love another to the point of them working together to kill their rivals enemies and their families.<br />Ed Norton is as always sensational in a wearied performance as a man who's seen too much but still cares. Unfortunately the fact that we don't know what he's seen is the problem.<br />Emily Watson, one of my favorite actresses is ok as the blind woman who is forward with Finnes, thinking he's simply repressed and shy and not the whackjob he turns into. I have a theory about the Hannibal series which I detail in the other reviewes, making this movie important as part of teh triology watched as a whole but not as a stand alone film.</p></body></html>

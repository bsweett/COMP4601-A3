<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly a Good Film."></head><body><p>Viewed: 11/04, 12/11<br />Rate: 8<br /><br />12/11: Raising my rating of 8 Mile from `5' to `8', I think the film was actually well done despite the fact there had been a numerous of Horatio Alger type of music stories over the past twenty years. I think my impression at first of the overall acting to be weak, but now, I feel everybody did equally good. Probably the best parts of the film will have to be the rap battles. They are in fact well written and creatively thought out. I know that invariably I keep saying that these characters need to go back to school and retake reading remedial classes. In the same vein, rapping is a real waste of time, but it shockingly makes a lot of money for some. Finally, Eminem...he wasn't that bad at all; just liked to have seen him in more movies to see if he could create more range. Probably the best performance of the film will go to Mekhi Phifer who was pretty good as Future. All in all, 8 Mile, whether you dislike, hate, or ignore Eminem, is worth watching and makes for a good film.</p></body></html>

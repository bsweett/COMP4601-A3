<meta name="summary" content="A Fine Line"></head><body><p>"Walk the Line" is a film that covers the early career of Johnny Cash and his early romances, plus his encounters with rock n' rollers such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley while on tour. My Mum saw it at least 3 times in the cinema, and then went a whole bunch of Johnny's albums afterwards. When it came out on DVD, I had to pick it up, see what all the fuss was about. It's really well done, I thought, in pretty much every way.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny, and Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, but after a while I forgot it was them. They did a really good job, I reckon. They really looked the part, they really spoke the part, and really sung it. You could feel the humour, the struggles and the yearning in their lives. Can't say the same about the guy who played Elvis, which is the only thing that bugged me about the film. I mean, he did an all right job, but considering there are so, so many Elvis impersonators in the world, you'd think they'd get someone who looked and sounded a little truer. Ah well. Not really a big deal.<br /><br />The direction is really great, I thought. I like the way some of the shots helped you guess just what Johnny was thinking just as you needed to in the plot, if that makes sense. The filmmakers definitely have a love of the music and for the man. You can see there's a lot of care taken making the sets, reproducing the instruments and the colour of the 1950s and 1960s. There are a few things to think about besides the music too (father/son relationships, the nature of compassion, etc), but nothing feels forced, it seems to come naturally out of the story. It all feels very natural, actually, that sums up the style very well. Realistic, yet warm.<br /><br />There's only a couple of special features on the one disc edition, but it's enough for me. There's a commentary by director James Mangold, who describes why he wanted to make the film, what he was trying to evoke, and even reads some parts from the screenplay while its particular scene is playing. There's also ten deleted scenes, also with a commentary by Mangold, and the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Definitely worth a look for music fans, lovers of Johnny Cash and biopic watchers. It's a fine "line"!</p></body></html>

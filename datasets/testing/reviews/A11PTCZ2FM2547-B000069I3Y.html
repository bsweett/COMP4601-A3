You have an important event coming up in the day, then something totally unexpected happens to throw you off your game and disorient you, then the next thing you know you're spending the rest of your time fighting uphill.  So I lended a sympathetic eye to the intriguing film CHANGING LANES, when a young attorney (Ben Affleck) on his way to court to file a questionable document at best has a fender bender with an insurance salesman (Samuel L. Jackson) on his way to court to salvage his family and his life.  Once Affleck leaves the scene (and his highly prized document) everything starts to unravel, pitting the two men against each other in ever-increasing altercations of rancor and anger.  Yet as both men find their respective situations spinning out of control, both also learn some very basic things--about themselves.<br /><br />Affleck and Jackson are superb; they're totally and utterly believable as honorable men who find it all too easy to cross the civility line and allow darker thoughts to prevail.  Yet they both show their characters as men with consciences; this dichotomy is riveting to watch.  Compound this with the fact Jackson's character is a recovering alcoholic and the tension becomes even more compelling.  Other noteworthy performances include William Hurt as Jackson's sponsor and the ever-great Sydney Pollack as Affleck's unscrupulous father-in-law and senior law partner.  This is exceptional drama, although at times Jackson is a tad over the top (but name me a performance where he isn't).  CHANGING LANES is like having a whole month of Bad Mondays.<br />--D.

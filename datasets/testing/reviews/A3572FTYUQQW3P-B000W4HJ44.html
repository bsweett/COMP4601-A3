<meta name="summary" content="Lerner & Lowe, Bob Fosse, where are you when needed?"></head><body><p>Clearly I am once again in the minority because unlike the rave reviews this film is receiving, I cannot justify anything better than a so-so rating.  The story line deals with racial prejudice but it approaches the topic with such a heavy hand it borders or a parody.  It is filled with music but it all seemed to be the same tune with different lyrics.  It wasn't that the music is bad, but it lacked variety and had a deadening sameness about it.  I kept wondering what Bob Fosse or Gower Champion could have done with the choreography because I thought this was the weakest point in the movie.  But once again -- it is OK and entertaining but fell far short of what could have been done by a great choreographer.  I really didn't have a problem with John Travolta in drag, but why did the director feel this was necessary?  Couldn't they find an actress willing to wear a fat suit?  Travolta did a good job as did Christopher Walken but they were little more than props.<br /><br />The entire storyline stretched credibility to the very limit.  The "white folks" were suitably and virulently prejudiced -- the "black folks" really had rhythm and the cops were suitably dumb.  All of this was so extreme as to seem like a parody but like most musicals the plot was only a vehicle to carry the music and dancing which I thought were OK but never rose above "competent".  I saw it , I watched it to the end, and unlike Chicago which I have seen many times, I probably will never see Hairspray again.  Three stars was all I felt it deserved.</p></body></html>

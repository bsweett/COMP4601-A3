It's a simple child's tale of the all-American Christmas, capturing a picture-perfect portrait of holiday warmth and zest through its delectable combination of laughter and touching moments. Most importantly, the film recalls the pleasures of childhood during the Christmas season, and that can provide as much joy as any other film. <p>The story is based on a segment of Jean Sheperd's novel &quot;In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,&quot; a personal memoir of his experiences. It helps that Sheperd collaborated in the creation of the screenplay, as well as lending his narration as the adult voice of Ralphie Parker (played by Peter Billingsley), who wants nothing more than to wake up on Christmas morning and find a &quot;genuine Red Ryder 200-Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle&quot; under the tree. Ralphie doesn't merely want this gift, but yearns for it with every fiber of his childhood being. His convictions that an English paper on what he wants for Christmas, as well as putting in his request to Santa Claus, stand as his assurance that he cannot fail in his quest. <p>Of course, there are obstacles, made whimsical and witty by director Bob Clark's wonderful knack for situational humor. His mother's words, &quot;You'll shoot your eye out,&quot; seem to echo from the mouths of everyone around, including his would-be alibi, Santa Claus, who is seen in a most frightening light by the children who line up to sit on his lap. Even Ms. Shields, his teacher, is a dead end, granting him a C+ on his &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot; theme paper with a small note toting Mrs. Parker's infamous warning.<p>The film is a very warm and inviting Christmas story, capturing the holiday season of yesteryear in an authentic and gleeful manner. Set in Indiana in the 1940's, Clark captures small vignettes of the time period through Ralphie's life experiences, from his eager anticipation of a secret decoder machine sent by the radio show he listens to every night at 6:45, to his punishment for using foul language by keeping a bar of Lifebuoy soap in his mouth for a prolonged period of time (&quot;Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur pf soap...&quot;). <p>What helps the movie in the long run are its characters, who never overstay their welcome or lose the appeal they possess. Ralphie's parents, known only to us as Mom and the Old Man, are the perfect parents: his mother, played with supreme charm by Melinda Dillon, is a warm and caring woman, as shown in her methods of getting younger brother Randy to eat by referring to him as &quot;Mommy's little piggy,&quot; and in her protective yet nurturing nature in regards to her children. His father, a stern yet gentle man, is the ideal working-class family man who sits at the table, reads his paper, but still exudes a great deal of caring for his family. Darren McGavin's performance as Mr. Parker deserves high praise, especially in his childlike glee over winning a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg. <p>Billingsley is the most notable of these actors, instilling Ralphie with all the emotions and thoughts a normal child experiences. His run-ins with neighborhood bully Scut Farcus provides a truly satisfying scene of turning the tables, while his daydreams of getting an A+ on his English paper and his going blind from &quot;soap poisoning&quot; are filled wit merriment and humor. <p>I think what &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; captures most effectively is the unbearable countdown to Christmas Day, which, for a child, can be the most excruciating twenty-four days of the year. Here is a movie that is guaranteed to bring back wonderful memories of childhood, with something that everyone from all generations can relate to, whether it be the joys of the long-awaited Christmas morning, or the shared pleasure of reliving the time and place, and the painstaking accuracy with which it is portrayed.</p></body></html>

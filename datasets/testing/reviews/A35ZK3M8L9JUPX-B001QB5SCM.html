She does so, but with great difficulty. After asking if she is dyslexic, the professor encourages Maggie to continue reading to him while offering emotional support to her. Maggie finds a friend in the professor, the first person in her life who does not ridicule her difficulties with reading, and actually helps her to improve in this area. As time passes with the professor, Maggie's confidence grows not only with reading but with her general image of herself. In addition, she also becomes friendly with the residents of the retirement community. In doing so, Maggie discovers a livelihood that is greatly needed among the elderly women, a personal clothing shopper, an activity for which Maggie shows enormous talent. Ella who also does not ridicule her difficulties with math, offers to run the financial aspects of the business. In the process, they become close and resolve their past history. "In Her Shoes" is an enjoyably entertaining comedy/drama featuring a number of topflight performances and some hilarious dialogue.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mona Lisa's Smile"></head><body><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />There are several serious "crimes" in movie making - unfunny comedy, unmoving drama, and non-thrilling and boring thriller/mystery. "Da Vinci Code" the movie has committed several of these crimes - as a mystery it is boring, as a thriller, it does not thrill, and its attempt to drama lacks any interesting characters I could care about. I am the last person to believe that the book was a work of art but it was fun to read. It was dynamic, well paced, and it gave (at least it tried) an insight to the characters' motivations and reasons. I don't even mention the references to history, Art, history of Art and religion that made the book one of the best selling works of fiction of all times whether we like it or not. How the movie made of that book happened to be lifeless, slow, and non-involving is beyond my understanding.<br /><br />If the most alive in the movie is Giaconda's (Mona Lisa's) smile and the rest of the characters all look and move like Zombies; if there is more chemistry and interest to each other between Christ and Mary Magdalene from Da Vinci's fresco "The Last Supper" than between Hanks's and Tautou's characters, and if the movie that takes place in the spectacular locations does not even look interesting, I'd say, "Houston, we have a problem." I have come up with my own grading system for the movies based on the options I have:<br /><br />From bad to so-so: Small TV with the cheap DVD player on the kitchen<br /><br />Good: Home Theater #1 - 42" Plasma and good sound system.<br /><br />Great: Home Theater #2 - Panasonic projector with huge screen and great sound system.<br /><br />Masterpiece: I wish I'd seen it in the theater.<br /><br />"Da Vinci Code" deserves to be watched on the kitchen while I make dinner or feed the birds. I would not miss much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Independence Day" minus the aliens, plus eco-propaganda."></head><body><p>If you've seen the 1997 sci-fi hit "Independence Day", then for all practical purposes you've seen this movie too.  The only real difference is that instead of a bunch of ticked-off aliens, the threat of human extinction comes from a ticked-off "Mother Nature".  In the former, however, it was all about "us versus them" and the triumph of the human will to survive.  In "Day After Tomorrow", the message is:  "We have met the enemy, and they are the Republicans."<p>Yeah, the movie is about the epic struggle to survive in the face of an overwhelming natural catastrophe, but it's pretty obvious that the producers were less interested in telling a story and more concerned about sending an election-year political message.  From the early scenes of the movie, the "hero" character (a very forgettable paleoclimatologist played by Dennis Quaid) serves as the "voice crying in the wilderness" against the environmentally unsound excesses of corporate America.  He warns of the doomsday scenario which does in fact unfold throughout the movie, but the heavily stereotyped conservative politicians (who are, no doubt, in the pockets of the polluters) shrug off his warnings.  Maybe it's just me, but I thought the "vice president" character looked uncannily like Dick Cheney.  Coincidence?  I don't think so, but feel free to decide for yourself.<p>The main story is about a dysfunctional family whose members find themselves separated by the unpredictable (yet somehow predicted) chain of natural events.  Of course, the events aren't really natural -- they're caused by foolish and greedy men who fail to pay attention to the needs of Mother Earth.  Somehow, against incredible odds, the family manages to reunite, save the human race, and resolve their own domestic issues all at the same time.  And of course, the tale is duly concluded with the humiliation of America and its (implied Republican) leaders, as well as some cheap jabs at American immigration policy.<p>In short, this is enviro-hysteria at its cheesy best, but election year political propaganda at its worst.  There isn't even a mild attempt to veil the message -- it's right there in your face.  If you're a Bush-hater, you'll cheer.  If you're a little more honest with yourself, you'll see this film for the cheap trash that it is.  The ONLY reason I gave it a second star was because it was chock full of stunning visual effects from beginning to end.  Beyond that, your enjoyment of this movie will stand in direct relation to your political affiliation.  That's no way to make a movie.</p></body></html>

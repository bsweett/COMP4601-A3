Evan is a sad young man who deals with his problems and fears the only way his mind knows how, with blackouts.  His father experienced the same condiction.  We go through the movie seeing this happen to Evan from youth up to his young adult age where he is happy that he has no more.<br /><br />  Evan, like his dad kept a journel of his life.  In looking back upon this journey, Evan is able to return to those events, remember them and change them.  There is one problem however, the new outcome is not always better than the one before.<br /><br />  This was a different movie, disturbing at times with its content, but nevertheless quite good. We all have thought, if I could go back and change that event, I would.  But perhaps the final result of that would not be any better than what we are now experiencing.  Who can tell?  Interesting isn't it? A movie that is a little bit like a mind tingler and will leave you with a few things to think about.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson</p></body></html>

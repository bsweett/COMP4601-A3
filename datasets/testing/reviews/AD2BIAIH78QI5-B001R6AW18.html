They stand in the wings of a theatre, looking at the giant ape now held by chrome steel chains on stage, but little do they know that Kong is far from vanquished, that his fury is only moments from being unleashed on New York City itself. &quot;King Kong&quot; really is one of my favorite movies of all time. Where else can you find gritty Depression era sentiments mixed up with a wild action horror film? Other horror movies from the 30s--&quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, even &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for the most part--concern elegant drawing room aristocrats in full evening costume, but &quot;King Kong&quot; is about working class folks trying to make a living, whether it's cranking out a jungle movie like Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) or running a ship like Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). And poor Ann Darrow, who can't even find work back in NY, becomes a figure of obsession for the dangerous natives of Skull Island.  If you love movies like &quot;42 Street&quot; and &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, I assure you,  you would find the same kind of dialogue in &quot;King Kong&quot;. Every time I watch it, I focus on some other detail, like the mutterings of the ship's crew as they make their way through the marshes trying to track down Kong, who has absconded with Fay Wray in his fist. Or the wonderful histrionics of Fay as she reacts to Kong's battle with a Tyrannosaurus Rex--and remember, she's really seeing nothing, all the figures are really clay models added later! Or the little faces at the skyscraper windows who watch as Kong destroys an elevated train near Herald Square. Here is one movie I genuinely never tire of watching. I can't imagine that there's somebody who has never seen &quot;King Kong&quot;, but if that's so, don't deny yourself the pleasure any longer!</p></body></html>

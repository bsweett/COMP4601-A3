<meta name="summary" content="And he did it all before his 21st birthday!"></head><body><p>The story is true. Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man who, before turning 21, forged numerous checks and became one of the biggest con men in the United States. Catch Me If You Can is, of course, loosely based on his life and work, but it's still entertaining and fascinating to watch. Normally, I'm not a fan of Spielberg, but he's done a really good job with recreating the 50's and 60's. The costume and set designers should be given equal credit with their excellent work. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a believable performance as Abagnale himself, while Tom Hanks is brilliant as the Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who is willing to stop this man from creating more fake checks and assuming more fake identities. Christopher Walken does what he does best, even if he doesn't seem to fit the role as Frank's father. Nathalie Baye as Frank's mother is very convincing, probably even more convincing than DiCaprio. Martin Sheen is also a nice addition to the supporting cast.<br /><br />Keep in mind, though, that this is not a serious hard-hitting biography, but rather, a comedy-drama that doesn't really take itself seriously. It's good for laughs, and it does its job well. The only problem is that it's a bit too long, and it could have been slightly shortened. Catch Me If You Can is still an entertaining movie, and if you love Spielberg (or Hanks, or DiCaprio for that matter), then you'll love this one.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

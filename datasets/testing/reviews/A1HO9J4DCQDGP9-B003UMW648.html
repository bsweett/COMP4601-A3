<meta name="summary" content="Not a bad sequel to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"></head><body><p>Managed to get to see this particular film at the cinema and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />It is a year since the Pevensey children were in Narnia, all are on their way back to boarding school, when they are pulled back into a world that they think they only left a year ago.<br /><br />However over 1000 years have passed in Narnia, they as the children of Adam have long been forgotten and for the moment their is no sign of Aslan.<br /><br />Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are destined to fight for Narnia once more, but this time to put Prince Caspian on the throne, as his evil uncle wants to kill him and ensure that his son, only recently born will take over after him as regent.<br /><br />Peter at 16 years of age is an angry young man who is trying to find his place in the world, having been an adult for so long and then having to make the transition back to childhood, he is confused and resentful, he makes some misguided decisions which results in the death of many Narnians and only Lucy and Peter  seem to have a grasp of what must be done, for even their old sister Susan is struggling to deal with her won losses, which include her childhood and the fact she will never return to Narnia.<br /><br />There are fantastic special effects, amazing battle sequences and some truly great characters, Peter Dinklage as the gruff but kindly dwarf Trumpkin is especially likable, and Warick Davies shakes off his good hearted Willow image when he turns into a Narnian who wants the ice queen back on the throne and tempts Prince Caspian to bring her back in order for him to have a powerful ally in the forthcoming battle.<br /><br />All in all a great sequel, and one I will be getting the DVD for when it comes out.</p></body></html>

That's what's been written on the plaster cast on the aforementioned Jeffries, an ace photographer who's been in a wheelchair for seven weeks because he got too close during a race car match.<br /><br />Jeffries is bored and listless, but at least his days in limbo gives him a view of life's passing parade through his binoculars, namely the other tenants whom he can see through his window.  The show's starring attraction is Miss Torso, a blonde buxom ballet dancer who can be seen shaking her thing and wearing nice pink bikinis-Jeffries expression on seeing her is priceless.  (Yes, she is nice, isn't she?) The songwriter who's lost his muse, a pair of newlyweds, a couple with a dog who fight the hot summer heat by sleeping on their balcony, and Miss Lonelyheart, a single woman who undergoes the being single blues.  However, during a particularly sleepless night, he notices how Mr. Thorvald, a jewelry salesman with an invalid wife, goes in and out of his apartment three times during the late hours, returning once with a large saw.  Why hasn't he been in his wife's bedroom all day?  "Something's terribly wrong," he surmises.<br /><br />Jeffries is also going through a bit of a crisis with his girlfriend Lisa Freemont, and they are quite a pair.  He's more a rough action-type of guy, having served in the war, going on tough assignments on one suitcase, entering tough situations, while she's "too perfect," having that chic, ultrasophisticated, rarified Park Avenue ambience, never wearing the same dress twice.  Jeffries is thinking that he wants someone too ordinary, someone who can bear up to his way of life if she wants to come along.  He's the old-fashioned type who thinks that "nothing has caused the world more trouble than intelligence," and goes on to discuss how psychoanalysis and interpretation of different emotional levels as examples.<br /><br />It takes the goings-on of the Thorwald apartment to draw the strained couple together, as Lisa uses her feminine intuition to realize that indeed a woman wouldn't leave such an expensive handbag, jewelry, and her wedding ring behind if she was going to leave on a long trip.  However, feminine intuition and Jeffries' speculations don't convince his war buddy and now detective Tom Doyle, who does some digging around to humor Jeffries and finds out the wife isn't dead.  And the final half hour, after a dramatic incident, when Lisa, Jeffries, and the latter's insurance-provided nurse Stella all join in and decide to brashly throw caution to the wind, that the excitement rises to a fever pitch.<br /><br />Rear Window's also one of the many New York films, showing the apartment life of the tenants as seen through Jeffries, played superbly by James Stewart in his second Hitchcock film, the other being Rope (1948), the next one to be the tepid remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), and later, another classic, Vertigo (1958).<br /><br />Like Stewart, this was Grace Kelly's second of three Hitchcock films, the other two being Dial M For Murder and To Catch A Thief.  As Lisa Fremont, she gives one of her cold ice princess roles.  She looks elegant in her pink nightgown, and dresses well, but she provides a shot of audacity herself in the final half hour.<br />And Thelma Ritter does another great turn as Stella, giving her usual wisecracking schtick as a supplement to James Stewart's flippancy.  She tells of her talent as a foreteller of bad things, saying of the Wall Street crash, "When GM has to go the bathroom ten times a day, the whole country has to let go."  The other two players worth mentioning is Judith Evelyn as Miss Lonely Heart and as guilty pleasure/eye candy, Georgine Darcy as Miss Torso.  And it's Raymond Burr (Perry Mason, Ironside) as Mr. Thorvald himself.<br /><br />One of Hitchcock's all-time classics, and one of my favourite personal four, the others being Spellbound, Vertigo and The Birds.</p></body></html>

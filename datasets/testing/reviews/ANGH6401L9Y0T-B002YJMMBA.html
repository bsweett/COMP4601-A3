They were (are?) a secret society of scientists dedicated to preserving scientific truths against the Vatican's attempts to suppress them.<br /><br />Vittoria Vetra (Avelet Zurer) has been working on the Hadrian Collider, and collected the first substantial bit of antimatter. It's perfectly suspended in a magnetic bottle, but the bottle relies on batteries that must be changed every 24 hours. Frankly, I found that rather artificial aspect of the suspense a bit hard to swallow. Anyway, using a rather gruesome method, the bottle was stolen from the lab despite extremely tight security. Probably an inside job.<br /><br />Now the old pope has just died, and a conclave is called to select a new one. And during this time, an ambigram has shown up with the name "Illuminati." An ambigram is a neat bit of graphic art that reads the same upside down and right side up. There was a "legend," according to Langdon, of four brands for earth, air, fire and water which were all done in ambigrams. One cannot help trying to figure how they were done hundreds of years before the sophisticated computer software necessary to create them today.<br /><br />So why was Langdon called to the Vatican? Because four cardinals have been kidnapped, the four most likely to be chosen as Pope. A message is received from the Illuminati (or someone claiming to be them) that one of them will be killed at 8 pm, 9, 10 and 11, and the Vatican will be blown up at midnight. Langdon has written part one of his study of the Illuminati, and can be acknowledged as an expert on them. But he has been petitioning for some ten years to gain access to the Vatican archives so he can complete the second volume.<br /><br />So, the Cardinals, minus the four kidnapped favorites, have been locked in the Sistine Chapel by the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), who was the dead pope's closest assistant and acts on behalf of the papacy itself until a new pope is chosen. He is thus available to help the Swiss Guard, the Vatican police, Langdon and Vetra to search for the kidnapped cardinals and ultimately the canister of antimatter.<br /><br />There. I've set it up for you. There is much racing all over Rome, of course, looking for clues among the art treasures, in the Vatican archives, crypts under churches, and all sorts of creepy places. I'm not going to ruin the incredibly complex plot by telling you any more, except to remind you that just as the theft of the antimatter was apparently an inside job at the lab, clearly there is an inside man in the Vatican and nobody is to be trusted. OK; you can trust Langdon and Vetra; but watch the rest of them very carefully.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Perfect Spy Thriller"></head><body><p>Who knew?<br /><br />Because there was all kinds of buzz about The Bourne Supremacy, I decided to watch The Bourne Identity simply out of curiosity. I had never seen Matt Damon in any movie, and was not expecting a whole heck of a lot since I obviously live under a rock and did not realize just what a phenomenally talented actor Damon is.<br /><br />Surprise. This movie is incredibly riveting from start to finish, a true tour de force, and I don't even like spy movies as a rule. The acting is taut, true and not a bit overdone as Damon plays a hired assassin who wakes up on a fishing trauler off the coast of Marseilles with no memory of who he is and what he does for a living. He does not know why he is proficient in several languages, why there are multiple passports, international currency and a heavy duty gun in his effects, and why he has a sixth sense tuned in to danger from bad guys.<br /><br />And bad guys there are, as the CIA et al try to bring him down as a trained automaton gone haywire.<br /><br />Damon runs the gamut of emotions from wary terror to fear to acute frustration to sensitivity (yes, there is a girl, and no, there is no gratuitious sex) in a way that lets him kill in cold blood and still remaine the hero. If you haven't already seen this movie, get your hands on it, because you will not regret it.</p></body></html>

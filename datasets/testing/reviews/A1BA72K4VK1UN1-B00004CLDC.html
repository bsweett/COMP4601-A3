I seriously doubt that Hollywood will ever yield a better one.<br /><br />The story is one of the Mafia glitz and how they were, to a man, ruthless murderers that we love to glorify because they got to do all the stuff we couldn't afford to do, either financially or legally. Only the best for these guys. The setting is the 50s, 60s, and early 70s.<br /><br />The top character is played by Joe Pesci, who loves to shoot and stab any fool who gives him the slightest bit of verbal guff. He's a diminutive figure who is out to prove that a hunting knife and a .357 Magnum manifest all the equalizer he needs to become a "Made Man".<br /><br />So this pack of Mafia scoundrels steal from, hijack, rob, and assault all whom are unfortunate enough to enter the circle of their realm and this even includes a number of their own brotherhood when the FBI begins to turn up the heat, generating an insider snitch here and there. The old conflict about some mafia members not wanting to enter the dope business also raises the stakes.<br /><br />This is a violent and graphic film in terms of language, murder, and darn near everything else.... and I loved it all. The soundtrack is equally incredible. Political correctness be damned!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The con is on"></head><body><p>One of the original Ocean's 11 gang (Elliott Gould) is stiffed by a business partner (Al Pacino) and suddenly George Clooney's gang reunites to wreak revenge.  They plan a high tech/hijinks sabatoge of Pacino's new casino in which they turn the opening night into a fiasco.  The plan is complex and multi-faceted and begins to run together in a confusing mess before the film is over.  There are so many stars who need good lines that there are not enough to go around and the plot sputters as a result.<br />Despite these flaws, there is some fun to be found in the third of the Ocean's 11 series.</p></body></html>

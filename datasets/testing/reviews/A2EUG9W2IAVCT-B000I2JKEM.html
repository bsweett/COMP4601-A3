<meta name="summary" content="Good film, great animation & characters"></head><body><p>Tim Burton set a high standard with The Nightmare Before Christmas but supplies audiences again with Corpse Bride, a re-telling of a Russian/Jewish folktale.  Sadly, the title character, Emily (the Corpse Bride), does not have herself a happy ending and her tale of her eminent demise (by murder for her money) is not the typical happy-ever-after associated in most animated films; still, the movie maintains an aura of whimsicality and jubilee despite its horror film-like antics.  Entertaining but somewhat sad film, but long overdue.</p></body></html>

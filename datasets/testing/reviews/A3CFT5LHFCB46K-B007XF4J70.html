<meta name="summary" content="Superb movie, but only an average DVD"></head><body><p>"It's the stuff that dreams are made of"<p>Okay, so that's a quote from a different Bogart movie. But if one thinks about it, that applies to this movie as well. The casting in this movie is perfect. I mean could we think of anyone else better for the lead roles besides Bogie and Bergman? Had it been Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan, this movie would have been forgotten in a week (Not saying that they weren't good actors, just wrong for the parts).  <p>But there are many other elements that all work together and are what makes this movie so great. Perhaps it's the sharp, crackling dialogue. Maybe it is the impressive cinematography and set design. Michael Curtiz's direction or Max Steiner's music, perhaps? Maybe it is the colorful supporting characters played by the likes of Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Or it could just be the countless memorable scenes (Your Pick. My favorite, apart from the ending, is the duel of the French anthem La Marseillaise and the Nazi song Die Wacht am Rhein), but none of which could have been possible without the elements described above.  <p>Although this is good quality DVD, I think a film on the level of excellence and popularity like Casablanca should get more respect than this. The film itself, for being nearly 6 decades old, looks great, although I did spot occasional scratches and grain. There were times, however, when I needed to turn up the sound volume, but it sounded  clear and was free of unwanted noise. <p>Extra wise is where this DVD comes apart though. There is the original trailer and several bonus trailers for other Bogart movies. The main highlight is an impressive 30 minute documentary called "You Must Remember This", hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. But here is where my complaints begin. Throughout the documentary are shown (According to the film cover) "Recently unearthed outtakes". However, such outtakes, if they are so important, are not shown as a separate feature but rather are on the documentary. Mostly, however, as a backdrop during the credits or while a certain scene is being discussed. These outtakes could be bloopers, test footage or even deleted scenes. Isn't that important enough to allow a separate extra itself (Perhaps with audio commentary or summary captions)? Also, there should have been some other extras, like  Production Notes or a booklet or perhaps a photo gallery or commentary from historians or film critics. Come on, if Armageddon can get a deluxe, 2-disc special edition from Criterion, than so should Casablanca.  <p>The DVD is worth buying just for the movie alone. But if you desire absolute perfect picture and sound quality or a lot of extras, wait for another edition, whenever that should come.</p></body></html>

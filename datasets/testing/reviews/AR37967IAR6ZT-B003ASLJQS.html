<meta name="summary" content="Good acting, interesting story. But I wish I'd liked it more"></head><body><p>Now, if you're going for a thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat or if you're seeking a mystery that's plot-driven and all about the clues, then MYSTIC RIVER is definitely not going to satisfy you. I went to see it because the cast that director Clint Eastwood assembled is incredible, and the story is motivated by character-rooted actions and decisions.<p>Still, I was underwhelmed by MYSTIC RIVER. <p>Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant playing a neighborhood ex-con who becomes a successful businessman, yet he cannot escape his past when his daughter is brutally murdered. It's a role that seems like the sort of part Penn has played well before, yet there are layers to his character that are fascinating to watch. Still, at the same time, his character Jimmy never really surprised me with any of his actions. I saw where the film was pretty much going from its opening moments, and it went exactly in that direction.<p>Tim Robbins, playing an adult survivor of a childhood abduction and molestation, does incredibly well at creating a suspicious yet sympathetic character. He, though, is also saddled with a plot contrivance that was brought in from the book, where he doesn't share crucial information at a point when you would expect him to, even when he can. That's an incredibly frustrating thing to watch in any film, where you feel that the characters are withholding information merely to service the film's plot.<p>Kevin Bacon, playing the third lead character, has far less to do in the film. He's saddled with a strangely-filmed subplot involving his wife, who calls on the phone throughout the film but doesn't speak and whose face is never shown. His character, as well, isn't as well-rounded as the other leads.<p>In supporting roles, the amazing Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden play the spouses of men caught up in a bizarre murder mystery. Linney's closing speech at the end of the film is so good that I wished the film had more moments with her in them. Harden's final scene is compelling and heartbreaking.<p>All in all, I thought MYSTIC RIVER was an incredibly acted, flawed mystery film.</p></body></html>

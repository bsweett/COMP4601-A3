Let me start by saying King Arthur isnt a bad movie but it's not exactly a 5 starrer. I didnt dislike the movie because I didnt expect anything from it. It's a movie I'd rent and watch on my couch once in a lifetime and then later someday watch it on HBO and forget about it. I really dont know what 5 starrers are about although I would like to know.Ive seen some better big budget axes and archery films of late than King Arthur.<br /><br />King Arthur has limited action potential thrill.Although it's better than "Van Helsing" it remains lacklusture in comparison to bigger projects.What I liked about the film is the absence of pretence which is quite evident by the absence of details to character chiasis.The direction isnt good and there were a few loopholes. I'm not the kind to take out mistakes. However, there are erratic tempo shifts in dialogue deliveries and accents. The accents sound a bit too forced.I must say I liked the jungle scenes (3 of them).<br /><br />PLEASE READ:<br /><br />This movie takes a big hit because I felt the supporting actor was far better drawn out and hero like than King Arthur himself.<br /><br />I'm talking about Sir Lancealot (the better actor too).<br /><br />Watch this movie on HBO,Rent it at the most. If you're buying this as a DVD then well either your very rich and a bit stupid like me or you liked this film.(5.5/10)</p></body></html>

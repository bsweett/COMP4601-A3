<meta name="summary" content="3 and 1/2 stars. Good fun"></head><body><p>These movies were both good sci-fi/ action/ horror movies that are still inferior to the Blade trilogy. So if you want to have the best sci-fi/ horror movies of the 2, Blade's better. If you want to have the classic, check out the Alien Quadrilogy, but if you just want to have some fun, buy this set. They're both good, solid movies with good suspense and great action and special effects.<br /><br />Resident Evil (# 1) is about a group of soldiers that must destroy a virus before it has a deadly effect on the world.<br /><br />Resident Evil Apocalypse- Alice played by Mila Jockavich has to help fight the undead and has to rescue a missing girl.<br /><br />Both movies have good action scenes where you'll be like:" wow! That was cool!!" but the 2nd one is better with better action and more memorable stuff. I recommend them as rents to everyone and buys for absolute die hard funs. You'll just have a good time watching them.</p></body></html>

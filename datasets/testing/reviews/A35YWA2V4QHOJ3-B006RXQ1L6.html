<meta name="summary" content="Roxie, take me away!"></head><body><p>Here's a movie that is sure to really take your breath away, whether you like musicals or not.  Every so often Hollywood comes out with an ambitious production that is pulled off beautifully by director, cast &amp; crew.  This is one such example of this!<p>The film stars Renee Zelwegger and Catherine Zeta-Jones as two women awaiting trial for murder during the Roaring 20s.  Zelwegger plays Roxie, a somewhat neurotic young woman who dreams of being the &quot;center of attention&quot; on a broadway stage.  Jones plays Velma, a woman who has already experienced such fame.<p>Roxie looks upon everything that happens in her life thru the lens of Vaudeville.  [It's because of this that the film turns out to be a musical].  By the time she gets to prison, Velma is the &quot;celebrity prisoner&quot; who gets all the publicity.<p>Richard Gere plays a fast-talking, suave lawyer who is hoping to get both of the girls off the hook (for a price).  His goal is to manipulate the media, public opinion and the jury in the girl's cases.<p>In the process, Roxie ends up supplanting Velma as the #1 prisoner celebrity.  Ironically, Roxie gets all the attention that she craved all her life, only it's from being a murderess instead of being a star.<p>Lucy Liu has a cameo as a heiress who threatens to usurp the celebrity status from both of them and grab the spotlight for herself.  All 3 women are cute in their 1920s short hairstyles, tho I must say I'm glad those hairstyles are no longer around!<p>One of the most impressive aspects of this film is that all the actors did their own singing and dancing.  There were no body doubles, stand-ins or lip-sinking.  Zelwegger said afterward that this was the most physically demanding movie she'd ever done, and it shows.<p>As a sidenote, it's interesting to note that the film is based on a play that was published in 1930.  The play was written by a journalist of the time and was a satire on women getting off of murder raps.  The film details how the courtroom itself can be turned into a stage for choereographed theatrics as opposed as a venue for finding the facts of a case.<p>While the duet between Jones &amp; Zelwegger is in itself worth the price of this DVD, there is so much more.  This one is a can't-miss film.  It is feel-good in the sense that a talented group of people went out and tried to pull off a near-impossible project.....and they nailed it!</p></body></html>

As he opens camera store in San Francisco with his partner Scott, they soon realize that in order to be successful in their new business, they will have to merge their alliances with other businesses who supported gays from the neighbrouhood.  What starts as a business plan turns into an artform of social activism.  Harvey and his social network become powerful national presence in fight for gay rights.<br /><br />It is needless to say that Sean Penn fully deserves his Oscar win for the Best actor role in a film.  His supporting cast is great.  Story itself, true to its core is a testament that determination of one man can become an inspiration to many generations that follow.  His tragic end is a constant reminder that for every noble cause there is a fanatical disgruntled maniac incapable of reconciling their personal beliefs with the ever changing world and social norms.<br /><br />Delightful film.</p></body></html>

It seems it may have been billed as something other than what it was, which is a film about hope and survival.  As for me, I loved this film and think that the performances were outstanding, as was the story, and the telling of parallel packs.  There are a lot of subtle things taking place in this film, which makes it worth more than one viewing.  Well done.</p></body></html>

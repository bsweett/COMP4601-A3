But something even trickier is casting the right person in the role to really capture the subject they are documenting. Jamie Foxx, as Ray Charles, may just go down in the history books as one of the all time finest portrayals of a real person. I've seem good ones before, but I haven't seen a job thid good before in a loooong time. After watching him in the movie, you can't see him as being Jamie Foxx. You see Ray Charles. And when the movie is over, you can't see anybody as Ray Charles than Jamie Foxx. When I first saw the trailer in a "sneak peek exlucisve" on one of those entertianment shows, I knew right then and there that Jamie would win an Oscar. The film chronicles the life of the legend from 1948 until the mid 60's. There are flashbacks tho to his childhood strewn all thru the film, and a brief moment at the end taken place in 1979, but the majority of the sprawling film is from 1948 to about 1965. So no, it does not take on the last two decades or so of his life, or his saddening death. The film showcases the amazing and sometimes out of control life of this music pioneer. When he first went blind as a young child, to leaving home to Seattle to start his career. Ray worked in clubs, and was the piano man in bands, but always wanted to go slowly. Ray Robinson, as he was born, quickly took his middle name of Charles as his stage name, and went on the road that eventually led to super stardom. The film highlights his highs and lows, and puts together his genius as a performer/singer/musician alongside his problem areas as a philandering husband, and a man with a serious heroin addiction. Foxx is so good in his role it's scary. He has the Ray Charles mannerisms down to perfection. Ray has a distinct walk and a way he holds himself, and Jamie did it as if it were Ray himself. In fact, everything he does is as if it was Ray himself. Becuse that's who you see. Ray Charles. Not Jamie Foxx. And I think that is as big a compliment as you can give. He is utterly stunning. The good news is that the good stuff doesn't end with Foxx. He is surrounded by a strong cast who all put in noteworthy performances. Kerry Washington as his first wife, who he affectionatley called B, is wonderful. As is former "227" star Regina King as Margie, one of the Ray-lettes who he had an affair with and later bore one of his children. Clifton Powell is strong and steady as Jeff, Ray's good friend and partner thru many years. Larenz Tate has a small role as a very young Quincy Jones. Richard Schiff from "The West Wing" also appears as a producer from Atlantic records. His partner at Atlantic records is none other than "Revenge Of The Nerds" star Curtis Armstrong(who played Booger), who appears to have shaved his head for the role. He is not really bald. Director Taylor Hackford directs the proceedings with a firm hand. He re-creates the years and decades with impeccable accuracy. He really gets the right look, clothes, cars, mood, and music. He brings Ray and his surroundings to life. Some say there was a lot more to be told that wasn't included. The movie is two and ahalf hours long as it is. Any more stuff and the film would of been 5 hours long. Then there is the music itself. Most of Ray's most famous recordings are heard and seen when he first did them and they were first heard. Ray's music was one of a kind, and the music you hear in the picture is the real deal. Some people might not of known of Ray's real life, so the film may of come to a sort of a shock to them. But it is so painfully brave and truthful to get Ray and his story out there, that you have to stand up and salute Ray for telling it like it is. Warts and all. And for Jamie Foxx, for bringing to life an extraordinary performance of an extraordinary man. This was a good year for bio pic movies, and "Ray" is one of the best in a long time. May Mr. Charles and his music live on in our minds, hearts, and souls, for eternity.</p></body></html>

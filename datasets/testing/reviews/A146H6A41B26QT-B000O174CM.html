The story is familiar and fascinating--especially for those of us of Baby Boom vintage---and the all-star cast was wonderful. Eddie Murphy has to be the most versatile actor around; I couldn't believe it was he in the part of the fading R&B star. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson sings her heart out, and Beyonce` is drop dead gorgeous as well as credible in the Diana Ross role.  The music echoed the golden age of Motown and carried the story. The audience clapped--hard!--when it was over. Forget the press and see the movie--it's great!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Possibly the best mob movie ever"></head><body><p>One of those rare cases where everything just seems to click, Goodfellas is one of a kind.  Nearly perfect in terms of casting, acting, directing, and so on, this is director Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Raging Bull) at his finest.  Revolving around the life of mobster turned rat Henry Hill (Ray Liotta, perfectly cast), we bear witness to his rise in the mafia.  His wife Karen (a pre-Sopranos Lorraine Bracco) is along for the ride as she discovers more and more of Henry's "other family" which both frightens and excites her.  Liotta and Bracco are excellent, and the rest of the cast including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning role are the stuff that film legends are made of.  Scorsese perfectly captured the time period, and his use of music in certain scenes could not be more dead on.  I still don't know if this is indeed the best mob movie ever (it's tough to top the Godfather), but if it isn't, it's pretty close.  Look for Samuel L. Jackson in a minor role, as well as pre-Sopranos stars Michael Imperrioli and Tony Sirico.  Warner Bros. finally decided to give Goodfellas the DVD treatment it deserves, and the commentaries by Scorsese and crew and Hill himself are worth the price of admission alone.</p></body></html>

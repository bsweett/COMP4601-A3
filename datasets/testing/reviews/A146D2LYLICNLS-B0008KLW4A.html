<meta name="summary" content="A so-so movie enhanced by a great DVD"></head><body><p>I'll start by saying that I'm a fan of "Catwoman." I, along with many other fans, like it mainly because of Halle Berry, not because the actual movie is very good. We have to admit that as a whole, this movie is quite mediocre.<br /><br />But now that the DVD has finally come out, I've decided to raise my review to 4 stars. My opinion of the movie has not changed; Halle Berry makes it what it is. I've added on the extra star strictly for this DVD presentation, which is quite impressive. If you didn't like the movie in the theaters then obviously you won't be getting this DVD and might as well stop reading this review right now. But if you're a fan and are thinking about whether you should get the DVD, I strongly urge you to.<br /><br />For one, it has a great transfer with superb sound and picture quality. Colors are vibrant and bright. Blacks are rich and deep, which helps a lot since most of the movie takes place at night. Simply put, this is a DVD that will go quite well with your home theater system.<br /><br />Bonus features are quite good. The "Many Faces of Catwoman" segment has all the actresses who played the role of Catwoman tell about her character, the story of Catwoman, her attributes, and their own opinions and experiences playing that role. This is definitely the gem of the DVD. The other segment, a behind-the-scenes section, is fairly standard stuff and is pretty much the same as any other behind-the-scenes feature. There are several deleted scenes which are worth watching such as when Patience first gets transformed into Catwoman and is chased by a few dogs at a junkyard. Finally, there is an alternate ending which is the actual ending from the Elizabeth Hand novel. It has a more romantic feel to it and I can see why it wasn't chosen for the movie's theatrical ending.<br /><br />All in all, a great DVD. Now only if they released the darn soundtrack! How long do we have to wait for that??!!</p></body></html>

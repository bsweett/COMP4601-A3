But, then again, so does she."<br /> - Budd informs his brother, Bill, he isn't afraid of commitment in "Kill Bill: Volume 2".<p>Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue (in this case its a pregnancy test). "The Bride" finishes what she started as she closes in for the kill in "Kill Bill: Volume 2".<p>"Vol.2" continues the story of "The Bride's" revenge with the chapters "The Massacre at Two Pines" (the viewer finds out it wasn't actually a wedding but a dress rehearsal), "The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz", "The Sadistic Training of Pei Mai", "Elle & I", & finally "Face to Face" (for the record, O-Ren Ishii, a.k.a. "Cottonmouth", received a tragic brain transplant, while Vernita Green, a.k.a. "Copperhead", got "The Bride's" point over a bowl of "Kabooms" in "Vol.1"). <p>The film, like "Vol.1", has "cult film" written all over it (this has got to be, arguably, Quentin Tarantino's two best films). "Volume 2" is less violent than the first "Bill" and keeps the blood spurting in check. The action is still great (the fight between Hannah and Thurman is claustrophobic and has some funny moments, but, I couldn't stop thinking where in the hell that damn snake was hiding! Since I hate snakes, I was waiting for it to jump out!). <p>The performances were great throughout. Michael Madsen gives an outstanding performance as Budd (its hard not to like the guy. Yeah, even after he puts 2 slugs (full of rock salt) into "The Bride's" chest & then buries her alive). He also has some of the better lines in the film ("Wrong brother, you hateful b*tch." , is his greeting to Elle Driver on his cell phone). Daryl Hannah is awesome as the menacing, hateful Elle Driver (it hurt to see Budd go into that final goodnight but it was great at what happened to Elle!). Uma Thurman's cold, pissed off, daggers in the eyes, facial expression's to Bill while she hugs her new found daughter was the price of admission alone and David Carradine, as Bill, goes from phantom menace in the first "Bill" to jilted lover in this film is quite a revelation. The final showdown itself is quite good but not what I expected.<p>Tarantino's direction is great, as always, this time, paying tribute to the spaghetti western (think desert heat. Lots of it). Hittori Hanzo is heard but not seen. The soundtrack is outstanding, borrowing from the great Ennio Morricone and artists Chingon, & Shivaree (both play over the closing credits). "Kill Bill" is a must see for fans of the Shaw Bros., Sergio Leone, westerns and any and all action films of the genre.<p>I'm anticipating "Volume 2" to hit DVD in Sept. or Oct. of '04 and hopefully, an ultimate box set with director commentary (Tarantino certainly has the mouth for it) with everything but the Vasilube thrown in sometime in the near future.  <p>Above all, "Kill Bill" is, basically, a love story. What a valentine. Thanks "Q & U".</p></body></html>

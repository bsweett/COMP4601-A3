<meta name="summary" content="Forget Spider-Man, this is the best comic to film adaption!"></head><body><p>The original Blade was regarded as the beginning of the resurgance of comic book movies, and its sequel tops it in every way possible. I just saw this last night and my head is still spinning. Vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes looking totally badass) returns two years after the original movie in search of his reincarnated mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), and after he finds him he is made an offer. A new breed of vampires called the Reapers are taking out normal vampires, and the vampire lord offers Blade a temporary truce so he can hunt them with his new associates the Blood Pack which is led by Reinhardt (Ron Perlman). The movie is slow in the first hour and a half, but the pace quickly builds up when secrets are revealed and Blade learns all is not what it seems, and what results are the best action scenes in a movie I've seen since The Matrix, excellent special effects (although some of the CGI could have been more polished), and the bloodiest goriest martial arts melee you'll ever see in a movie adapted from a comic book. My only complaint is that we didn't get to see martial arts great Donnie Yen (a member of the Blood Pack) for very long, it would have been great to see him and Snipes go at it in a fight scene.  All in all, Blade 2 is one of the few cases where a sequel outshines the original film, and this Platinum Series DVD is packed with extras: commentaries by director Guillermo Del Toro and Snipes himself among others, trailers, a strategy survival guide for the upcoming PS2 and XBox Blade 2 video game, and a Cypress Hill with Roni Size music video.  Sink your teeth into it as soon as you can.</p></body></html>

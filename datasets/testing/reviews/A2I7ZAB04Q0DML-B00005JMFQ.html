<meta name="summary" content="I Actually Loved "Love Actually" -- And I'm A Guy!!"></head><body><p>When my wife said she really wanted to see "Love Actually", I was indifferent, not overly anxious to go sit in a theater and watch another "chick-flick", but equally uninterested in spending a night home alone-and so we went.<p>I have to confess, it was a great film.<p>The premise is a bunch of individual relationships reflecting the many facets of love.  At one end of the spectrum, there is the dignified, new elected Prime Minister of England, (Hugh Grant), who is at once smitten with one of the many assistants working in his office.  At the other end there is a brash, aging rock star, whose self indulgent lifestyle and brazen behavior has made him a loner, never having found true love.  In between are seven other relationships-newlyweds, an old married couple struggling with fidelity, a husband whose wife has recently died leaving him with a step-son he hardly knows, a man who struggles with bachelorhood after he catches his wife sleeping with his brother, a young couple who meet on the set of a movie they are both "starring" in, a woman who struggles with approaching a man she has secretly loved for years, and a young man who sets out for the United States in search of the other great American dream-dating a supermodel.<p>The movie is fun and funny, at once touching and satirical, painting a vivid portrait of the many struggles every individual and couple faces throughout the course of their particular lives and in the life they share with one another.  The film has a very warm feel to it, and really touches on the many issues that love carries with it.  It is great for men and women alike.  For the men, the story touches on the many challenges we all experience in trying to live up to the expectations, demands and needs of the women we love.  For women, it has the warmth of romance, combined with the reality of the imperfections men never see in themsleves.  Surely, this film is a reminder that all relationships, even the great ones, have flaws, speed-bumps and little curves that nobody can expect or see until they encounter them.  Whats more, this film is genuinely funny, and will leave the audience laughing as they exit the theater. <p>Rated R for sexuality, nudity and language, the movie should be reserved for older viewers.  The R rating is there with good reason and should not be ignored.  This is not a film for children, and it is doubtful that children would enjoy this as much as the more "mature" audience for which the film is intended.  <p>So men, fear not, this movie isn't just for women, you will enjoy it as much, if not more, than they do.  Go see it, I promise you won't be disappointed.<p>Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SOMETHING BEYOND THE RETRO FASHION FEST WOULD'VE BEEN NICE!"></head><body><p>More of a costume party than a real film, with more 70s references than plot points, Starky & Hutch is mostly about Stiller and Wilson playing dress-up, jiving with each other and making countless 'insider' jokes about the mod/pop culture of 30 years ago.<br /><br />And when they run out of ways to make fun of afros and other sundry items of retro fashion, they resort to leering at bimbos (enter Carmen Electra and Amy Dumb), making what starts out as just harmless junk into callow, obvious junk.<br /><br />Most of the 'jokes' seem targeted at the 13-18 year-old male demographic. On a humorous scale of 1 to 10, it scores a magnanimous 0.5 -- idiotic and disturbingly reliant on a conversance and affection for a television show that most of us remember as being about a red Grand Torino if we remember it at all.<br /><br />Two stars for the occasional funny moment that sneaked in.</p></body></html>

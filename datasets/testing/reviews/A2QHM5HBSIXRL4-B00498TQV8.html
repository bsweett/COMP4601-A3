[I put the 'fiction' qualifier in there because my favorite film overall was Lucy Walker's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CJQVQC">Waste Land</a>, a documentary.]  'Bone' deserved its Oscar nominations and Spirit Award wins.  There's a grittiness and realness present in this film that's lacking from a lot of Hollywood product.  Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini's outstanding screenplay - adapted from Daniel Woodrell's superb novel of the same name - indelibly documents the extent of the impact that the methamphetamine epidemic has had on rural communities.  It does that not only in terms of rendering the primary circle of addiction in stark relief, but also by depicting the wider, secondary circles of mistrust, paranoia and broken families it engenders.<br /><br />Director/co-writer Granik has tabbed an outstanding set of actors to depict this flat, colorless, frightening world.  It's now well-documented that Jennifer Lawrence shocked the daylights out of everyone with her performance as Ree.  Anyone who says they saw that coming is fabricating.  Excellent screenplay and direction notwithstanding, Bone's make-or-break rests on Ms. Lawrence's shoulders.  To say she nailed it is an understatement.  She buried that nail so deep, she shot right to the very heart of the Hollywood A-List.  To this viewer, it's clear that Lawrence's performance was enhanced greatly by the great work of John Hawke.  His 'Teardrop' is the single best thing about this uniformly excellent production.  Ree and Teardrop on the screen together make for the film's standout scenes.<br /><br />That's only topped by whatever scenes Dale Dickey appears in.  She's the first line of defense in local kingpin Thump Milton's rings of protection.  In countenance, physique and cadence, Ms. Dickey is pitch-perfect in every way.  She's downright menacing.  Her part in bringing Ree's quest to a very undeniable finality is not something you'll easily forgot.  She won an Independent Spirit award for her portrayal.  It was both well deserved and well awarded.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as I would have hoped"></head><body><p>I had heard a lot of hype about this film, so I went into it expecting a lot.  The last Australian horror I had seen was Undead, which I just found to be ok.  This film is low budget, but you can see the people making it have talent that shines through.  The acting is decent, though some of the Aussie accent and slang is hard to make out.  This film would be the Australian answer to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  My problem with the film is that the beginning is a bit slow, and I wasn't really convinced by the (psycho) main bad character.  Maybe if they had shown him actually torturing the people and really building the tensions it would have been better.  Instead the characters fall asleep and awaken in a bad state.  This one is okay for a watch, but I don't think it would be getting a tenth of the attention it has received if it was just another low budget U.S. horror release.</p></body></html>

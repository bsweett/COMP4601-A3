<meta name="summary" content="Courage in the face of horror and confusion"></head><body><p>Writer / director Paul Greengrass presents a plausible imagining of events aboard the ill-fated United Flight 93, which went down in a grassy field after the passengers stormed the cockpit rather than allow the hijackers to pursue their objective unchallenged.  This story is interwoven with the events in various control rooms as air traffic controllers and military personnel gradually realize what is happening and find to their horror that they are unprepared to stop it.<br /><br />This film keeps a tight focus on the events of the day, thereby honoring the memories of the fallen by keeping our attention on their plight and their reaction to it, rather than making political points about the big picture.  There is no mention of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Afghanistan, or Iraq.  The audience becomes observers at the various locations and learns nothing that the actual participants would not have known.  We learn nothing more of the passengers on United 93 than we would if we were fellow travelers on the same flight.  The result is far more powerful than if the filmmakers had strained for effect through trumped up sentimental backstories or political proselytizing.  We are presented with a day of horror and confusion and the nobility of average people struggling to confront it with courage and dignity.</p></body></html>

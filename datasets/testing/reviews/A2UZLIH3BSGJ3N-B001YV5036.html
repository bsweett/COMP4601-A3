<meta name="summary" content="Great Story Telling"></head><body><p>This is a phenominal story of the late,great James J. Braddock.A guy who at one time had his title shot,and when the market crashed in 1929,he(like most everyone else)lost everything.This is not a film about boxing,boxing is merely a character in the film like everyone else.This is a film about family,struggling through hard times,not giving up and following through with your dreams and instincts.Russel Crowe again puts on a spectacular performace as well as making the physicaly transformation into a boxer.Paul Giamatti is also a fantastic on screen presence and puts on a great performance as Braddock's manager&trainer,as well as Renee' Zelweger as Braddock's wife,the very fabric and drive of his will to succeed.All together,with an excelent plot/screenplay and great directing yet again by Ron Howard this is a film you should not miss,and is well worth owning.This is an oscar contender,and I wouldn't be surprised if it even takes home a few at the same time.Paul Giammatti for sure will get a nomination,if not win a supporting actor oscar,as well as Russel Crowe not managing to get a nomination himself and Ron Howard for directing.For a great "feel good" movie,you can't loose on Cindarella man,and this movie litterally K.O's most other competion.</p></body></html>

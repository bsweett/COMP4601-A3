Clash of the Titans is a rare remake that's actually good. The film looks great and it's also exciting. I don't know why most critics didn't like the movie because it's actually much better than I expected. A critic at Newsday even said we didn't need Clash of the Titans since Percy Jackson already taught about Greek gods, but this movie is way better than that was.<br /><br />  Sam Worthington is one of the better action stars around these days and he's good in this movie. My only complaint is that he looks like he just got a buzz cut for the role. He looks pretty awkward next to everyone else that has long hair in movie, they could have at least thrown a wig on him or something lol. I guess since the gods give Perseus (Sam Worthington) weapons for his journey, that they also shave his head when he's sleeping. Hey, they are gods so maybe they even had electric razors in the early days of mankind.</p></body></html>

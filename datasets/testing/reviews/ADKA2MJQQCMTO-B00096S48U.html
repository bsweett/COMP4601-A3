If Hollywood is so insistant about trotting these reissues out, then for the love of God, remake a BAD movie.<br /><br />The short version of this review is that if you've seen the original (a CLASSIC, by the way) there's no reason on earth to watch this.  If you haven't caught the original yet, then go watch that.  The '06 version, at its core, is a nothing more then a pale carbon copy of it's source material that tries to mask its (many) shortcomings by turning the sound and effects up to eleven.  It has nothing even remotely new, inventive, or interesting to offer.</p></body></html>

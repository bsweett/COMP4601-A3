<meta name="summary" content="Epic Film Sustains the Kryptonian's Legend But Just Misses Cinematic Greatness"></head><body><p>There's a lot that is supremely well done about this expensive-looking 2006 revival of the long dormant blockbuster franchise, and having the talented Bryan Singer ("X-Men", "The Usual Suspects") helm it was a smart decision since he has proven abilities in creating a singular cinematic vision without compromising the integrity of the story at its core. However, the overriding challenge centers more on the somber, almost reverential tone that Singer has felt a need to imbue the film. That's not to say there are not thrilling moments or even some comic ones, but the most pervasive sense in the epic-length movie is the priority placed in sustaining the mythic stature of Superman and reusing familiar elements from the previous films to ensure we are not disappointed with any possible discontinuity with the legend. I just wish Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris could have looked a little deeper into the irony of a superhero now that we are dealing with a greater sense of ambiguity between good and evil.<br /><br />The film picks up the story about five years after the end of 1980's "Superman II" as the superhero returns to Earth after a lengthy sabbatical in which he was futilely trying to find survivors of his home planet Krypton. The world has fallen into inevitable chaos in the interim, but more pertinent, his longtime love Lois Lane has moved on with her life. Still a star reporter at the Daily Planet with a Pulitzer Prize in hand, she now lives with fellow reporter Richard White, the nephew of editor Perry White, and has a young sickly son. Meanwhile, arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, released from prison, embarks on a diabolical plan to create a new continent and destroy North America using the Kryptonian crystals he steals from the Fortress of Solitude. From this elaborate set-up, the plot covers pretty familiar ground for most of the duration, but it is punctuated by some amazing sequences like the young hero's discovery of his powers over gravity in a cornfield, the derring-do rescue of a 737 with Lois aboard, and Superman's misty-eyed airborne seduction of Lois. The story takes an intriguing turn when things look the bleakest for our hero in the last third, but it all ends with the door unsurprisingly wide open for a sequel.<br /><br />Although he has a tendency to look a bit glassy-eyed, Brandon Routh turns out to be an ideal choice for a sincere and somewhat melancholy take on the icon. When he reverts to alter-ego Clark Kent, he seems to be channeling his predecessor Christopher Reeve's bumbling charm, which makes these gratefully brief scenes feel a bit derivative. Given Kevin Spacey's innate tendency toward hamminess, I am surprised that he doesn't seem more inspired by Luthor's utter villainy and satirical sense of cruelty. It's as if the fun has been exhumed out of his performance. Following in Valerie Perrine's footsteps, Parker Posey plays Luthor's moll with air-headed assurance, though the actress' idiosyncratic persona is not fully utilized here. The most problematic casting, however, comes with Kate Bosworth as Lois. Sincere and as committed as she seems to be in the role, she lacks the gravitas and maturity to be remotely convincing as such an accomplished woman. Eva Marie Saint barely has any screen time as Martha Kent, and outtakes of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's deceased father, are used rather cryptically near the beginning.<br /><br />Not too surprisingly, the film is much more visually lustrous than its inspiration thanks to Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography, Guy Dyas' production design (especially of Metropolis) and the truly superb special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD set has the 154-minute movie on the first disc though unfortunately without a commentary track from Singer, the screenwriters or the principals. The second disc offers extras that would be of interest to fanatics, specifically a five-part documentary that lasts nearly three hours and should have been really edited down for the general audience. There is a quick short, "Resurrecting Jor-El", that is somewhat interesting to see how the Brando footage was prepared, as well as fifteen minutes of relatively uninteresting deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Cast-Mediocre Movie"></head><body><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Giovanni Ribisi among others.<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the special effects are excellent, and the plot is way below average.<br /><br />Specifically, the characters are plain, weak and not original at all.<br /><br />There is the usual German "bad guy" clich&eacute;, and together with the usual "doomsday machine" in the shape and form of a modern Noah's Arc do not help in making this film anything special or out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Moreover, it seems as though the chemistry between Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow is not all that great.  To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given (what were the writers thinking?).  To make things worse, Giovanni Ribisi who is otherwise a great actor, was presented with a very uninteresting/unoriginal character to play (the overly intelligent young scientist) with whom he could not really do much.  A bit of a waste there...<br /><br />Furthermore, apart from the humor-or lack of it-there are major weaknesses in the story, such as when it just so happened that Dex and the other scientists were escaping their robot captors at the same time as the heroes were entering the secret stronghold, thus providing too much of a convenient coincidence for the benefit of both groups.<br /><br />On the positive side, the 1930's were a very good choice for the setting of the movie.<br /><br />The film is action packed so those with a soft spot for adventure will enjoy it!<br /><br />In addition, they've done a very good job of giving the film the darkness that one finds in that genre of cartoon strips.<br /><br />To a certain extent, the film is a cross between Jurassic Park and the Lost World on the one hand, and James Bond's Moonraker and the Indiana Jones trilogy on the other.<br /><br />Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.<br /><br />A shame really...<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it;<br /><br />No masterpiece here...</p></body></html>

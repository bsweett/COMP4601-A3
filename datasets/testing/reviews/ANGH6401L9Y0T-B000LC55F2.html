<meta name="summary" content="Inside the Ways of Stage Magicians"></head><body><p>The cover says "You want to see it again the second it's over." Right. But I am resisting the temptation to tell you what that means: YOU WILL NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED! Except maybe my friend Paranormal Princess, who is herself a stage magician.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) worked together as "shills" that tie up the magician's assistant, who just happens to be the wife of one of them. At one point, they decide to try a different knot to tie her hands. Her husband ties her feet. She is put into a tank of water which has a trick lock; as soon as the curtain is put over the tank, she's supposed to spring the trick lock and get out of the tank. Something went wrong, and she drowned.<br /><br />The husband's theory is that his partner who tied her hands used the wrong knot. He admits he does not know for sure what knot he used. Thus begins a deadly rivalry between the two that seems to know no limits.<br /><br />When it gets really complicated, one drops a hint to the other than Nikola Tesla is the key to a really impressive trick that he can't figure out how he did it. So he goes to Colorado Springs, where Tesla has electrified the entire town in exchange for being permitted to use the electrical plant for his experiments in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep.<br /><br />The question becomes did Tesla build an apparatus for the first magician? Is the one he built for the second real magic? And after awhile, you have a more general question: what the heck is going on? It is not made easier by the story being told out of time sequence. It starts with the trial where one of the magicians is charged with murdering the other. Then it jumps back and forth without much regard to whether or not the audience is totally confused, because that's what magicians do: they totally confuse their audience.<br /><br />This movie is very, very successful at doing that, although I had some pretty clever guesses as to what happened along the way. I didn't really figure out very much, but I think it's impressive that I got anything right.</p></body></html>

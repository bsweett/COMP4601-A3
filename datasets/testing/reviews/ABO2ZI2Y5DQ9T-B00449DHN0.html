<meta name="summary" content="Scorsese's "Apocalypse Now""></head><body><p>"Gangs of New York" is, for all its merits, not a masterpiece.  That's cerain no matter how you try to defend it.  The script is weak, the cast is wasted, and most of all, the conclusion is overblown -- see how the film ends, and no one can gives this film a full mark.<p>In a way, the film title tells it all -- it's all about the "Gangs of New York" before the time such films like "Godfather II" covers.  The film starts in 1846.  Over the territory called Five Points, two groups -- Irish "Dead Rabbits" and "Native Americans" -- are about to settle the final score by the most bloody battle on the snowy street in New York.  During the battle, one of the leaders is killed by the other, and the now orphaned boy is sent to an institute to be raised there.  <p>Cue to years later.  Now the boy Amsterdam (DiCaprio) comes back to town, and comes to know how to live streetsmart, under the wing of Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), the very person who murdered his own father before.  Now learning the way of living in this rough and tough dtrrict, Amsterdam meets his love, a beautiful and smart pickpocket Jenny (Diaz), who has a shady past she wants to leave behind.  <p>Thus the story goes.  But as you will see, the plot is there as if to be an excuse for showing the detailed re-construction of New York City and its now forgotten customs, and the character of Amsterdam is too unconvincing because we don't know what he really wants to do all through the film.  Actually, the love-triangle around Leo's character becomes nothing just before the meticulously researched details of New York in the 19th century.  So, you will see how the fire brigades fight each other (not the fire) because of their disputes over territories; or how things can be stolen from aristcratic mansions with ease.  Details are the life of the film, and the story is almost non-existent.<p>This is the greatest merit and demerit of watching "Gangs of New York."  Don't expect too see DiCaprio's character display any depth, or Diaz's groundbreaking acting.  There is none simply because the film does not allow that.  Even the ever-great Day-Lewis is often buried among the tidal waves of facts about New York, which in themselves are visually striking in the same way as the London of David Lean's "Oliver Twist" (which the production designer Dante Ferretti saw with the director).  <p>The film ends with one of the most overproduced conclusion, and though as a storytelling the film is a mess, the visuals are always impressive -- after all you know that they all created  these buildings in Italy for this occasion only.  The cast is great, but I could not believe Ms. Diaz is really suitable for the role of 19th century drama -- she has shown herself too many times in films like "The Sweetest Thing" -- and as I said, if you are a fan of DiCaprio, you can skip this one and go to see "Catch Me If You Can" -- not least when you love him as Romeo or Jack.  There are impressive cast -- Liam Neeson, JC Reilley, and Jim Broadbent -- but regrettably too small amount of attention is given to their roles, making them look truly wasted.  <p>This is, I think, Scorsese's "Apocalypse Now" -- he is trying to draw a grand-scale picture which he can never finish.  And see the analongy here -- the cost, the confusing ending, good cast behind the overblown productions, and long, grueling shooting.  Like Coppola's film, "Gangs of New York" might need some time to be appreciated.  But remember, some people still say that Coppola's film is not a masterpiece, if a great attempt.</p></body></html>

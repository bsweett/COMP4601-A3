<meta name="summary" content="Sigourney is better than the material"></head><body><p>Alien was a great horror film.  Aliens was a great action film.  Alien 3 is just an okay film.  Ripley is a great character and the one that Sigourney Weaver will be always remembered.  But this round the plot felt like it was already outdated.  The one thing is Weaver knows Ripley better than the writer and makes the character three dimensional.  Unfortunately, that is the only thing in this film that is three dimentional.<br /><br />If you liked Alien and Aliens, you probably will want this to get this film and Alien Resurection to have the entire set.  But as a stand alone, pass on this and go for one of the first two.</p></body></html>

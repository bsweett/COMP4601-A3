<meta name="summary" content="Best film of 1999"></head><body><p>This is the kind of film that can restore your faith in American cinema. That it was even produced is a miracle, let alone received Oscar nominations. Unjustly deprived of the award for Best Original Screenplay (losing to "American Beauty"), Charlie Kaufman's magnificently absurd story works on so many levels: as surrealist fantasy, as a critique of our fascination with fame, as an acid inquiry into gender, power games and sexual manipulation, and, more simply, as just one hell of a funny trip. What's particularly impressive is that despite his story being relentlessly and increasingly ludicrous, Kaufman manages to tie-up all the loose ends and deliver an ending which is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious. He also gives us some of the funniest lines ever spoken on screen, to wit: 'Behind the stubble, the too prominent brow, and male pattern baldness, I sensed you feminine longing.' Spike Jonze extracts near-perfect performances from his high-calibre cast, with Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener cleverly playing against type, and John Cusack showing his incredible versatility. Three cheers for originality and having the courage to follow it through.</p></body></html>

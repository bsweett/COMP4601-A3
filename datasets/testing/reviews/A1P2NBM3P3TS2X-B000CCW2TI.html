<meta name="summary" content="Craven elevates pedestrian script, but only slightly."></head><body><p>First off, Rachel McAdams is a real stunner.<br /><br />Had to get that out of the way.  I'm sorry, but it had to be said.<br /><br />Moving on.....<br /><br />Director Wes Craven has taken a rather pedestrian script with stock supporting characters and little originality and elevated it to a reasonably tense thriller.  Well, it was reasonably tense for a little while, at least.  The scenes on the plane work rather well.<br /><br />Beyond that, however, it is largely formulaic and forgettable.<br /><br />Actress Suzie Plakson is in this film as a flight attendant.  Plakson is a wonderfully talented comic actress and theatre veteran.  She deserves better material than this.<br /><br />The two leads in the film play well off each other, but once the film changes into a series of chases and cat-and-mouse sequences in the third act it feels like something we've seen a hundred times before.<br /><br />**MILD SPOILER -- but relax, it's not too much**<br /><br />As Cillian Murphy's character exits plane to chase after McAdams' character at the Miami airport, he grabs a scarf off a female passenger to wrap around his throat wound.  He wears it like that for the rest of the film.  But when he ends up chasing/stalking McAdams' in her father's house, he looks in several shots like Paul Lynde in a neckerchief.<br /><br />Ooh, now that's scary.<br /><br />One of the few moments in the film that seemed original to me was a brief bit of business on a fishing boat.  How does one hide weaponry on a boat from a Coast Guard inspection?  Find out in this film.<br /><br />And the Security team that ordered the search referred to the inspection team as the Coast Guard, but their vests read "Shore Patrol".  Limited costume budget, perhaps?<br /><br />And having that neckerchief cover up the throat wound all the time sure saved time and money on special effects make-up too.  Not decisively proof of a budget decision, but it was the first thing I thougt of.<br /><br />Worth seeing?  Maybe once.<br /><br />Worth buying on DVD eventually?  Hard to say.  The film runs less than 90 minutes so it at least is spared of any fat.  The "fat" is what tends to drag down suspense movies on repeat viewings, so "Red Eye" has the advantage of avoiding that problem.<br /><br />The premise for this film was interesting but not inspired.  In the hands of a lesser director it would probably have been completely forgettable altogether.  At least Craven instills it with a degree of filmmaking cred.</p></body></html>

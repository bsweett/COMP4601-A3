This is Hitch's most mature statement as a film director and artist and certainly  is one of the ten best films made.<p>Executives at Paramount thought that  Hitchcock was mad when he explained the &quot;suspense&quot; elements of  the plot less than midway through the picture. Most were sure that  audiences would walk out and, indeed, the film didn't do well financially,  but for different reasons. It just so happens that VERTIGO was 40 years  ahead of its time. This was a Hitchcock new to audiences expecting the fun  suspense of STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. The complex narrative, themes and  characters helped develop new standards for American film. <p>VERTIGO,  along with TOUCH OF EVIL, stands out as among the very best of American  cinema in the 20th Century.</p></body></html>

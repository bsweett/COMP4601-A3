That should tell you how bad it was, that schools would only talk about it as a secondary item to something history deems more important. In fact, Waco was given more attention than the murder of more than 1,000,000 million people. It's sad, to think about this now and realize how misinformed as a country we had been.<br /><br />Thankfully, there are people out there who feel a certain obligation to make us know what had happened to the poor people of Rwanda. Hotel Rwanda, and plenty of other movies and books dealing with the Rwanda Genocide, came out recently and started to finally shed some light on this event. Though it took ten years, we are now finally getting to chance to understand.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda is very much like the movie Schindler's List. It's about a real man who is forced to act, put into a situation where he became the protector of the people of his country. Paul Rusesabagina is the manager of a four star hotel who, when his world breaks apart because of hatred and civil war, takes on some pretty severe responsibilities simply because he was the only one who could, as the entire world has backed itself out of the conflict in Rwanda. Though a realistic thinker, he's also a man of high morals, and gives everything up--money, possibly his job, even his self-respect--to save those who come asking for his help. Using his influence and his intelligence, he finds ways to continually keep the Hutu militia from his hotel. But soon, it becomes an impossible task, and he must think about leaving the hotel. With little outside help (only a small force of UN officers and the Red Cross) he attempts to take that next step.<br /><br />The character of Paul Rusesabagina is played by Don Cheadle, one of the finer actors of today, and his presence in this movie is felt in absolutely every scene. He plays Paul as a silent and  cunning man who looks at his Hutu heritage as if it were a hated middle name, something easily passed over. He knows how to work those around him, and understands more than most that the world revolves around money and bribery, and is more than willing to use this to save those around him. He chooses to be a caring human before saving his own self-respect, and this is what makes the character of Paul so special, both real and in the movie.<br /><br />Though I usually cringe when recommending movies of this nature (something about historical movies always tend to twist the events to serve the needs of entertainment) I don't do so with Hotel Rwanda. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, and in fact I wish everyone could see this movie. It's equally as important as Schindler's List. It's a story of human strength and human weakness all in one, and makes a strong distinction between the two. Hint, the people with the guns and the power aren't necessarily strong.</p></body></html>

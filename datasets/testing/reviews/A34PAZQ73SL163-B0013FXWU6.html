The actor, Paul Dano, was previously unknown to me, but he did a fine job portraying the Sunday brothers here. There Will Be Blood may not be faithful to Upton Sinclair's original story but it is a compelling portrait of evil in this world. I always laugh at those who think human beings are more good than evil. I have never seen any evidence for this being true in the course of my life. Evil is capable of corrupting us all, and Lewis's Daniel Plainview is a haunting portrait of a man who emits villainy the way most of us emit carbon dioxide. For this reason, Paul Thomas Anderson has put together a classic and valuable movie. I admit that it wasn't pleasant to watch but it certainly was excellent.</p></body></html>

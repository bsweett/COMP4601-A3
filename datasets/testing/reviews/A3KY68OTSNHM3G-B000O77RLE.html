In that vein, "Letters From Iwo Jima" gives the viewer an entirely new look at the battle, and perhaps a new perspective of the Japanese soldiers who were defending the island.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe stars as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.  He was put in charge of formulating a defense of Iwo Jima.  Kuribayashi was not the typical Japanese General.  He worried greatly about the well-being of his family and the men under his command.  He refused to eat special rations; rather, he insisted on eating the same food as the soldiers.  He routinely made inspections on foot rather than from a vehicle.  And, perhaps most importantly, he didn't abide by the Japanese bushido code.  Upon taking command, he set about re-formulating Iwo's defenses from a beachhead defense to a complex system of tunnels and caves.  These would prove most difficult for the Americans to break.<br /><br />Kazunasi Ninomiya stars as Saigo, a young Japanese soldier who is part of Iwo's garrison.  He was told at his home that he was drafted into the army.  This news greatly disturbed his wife, who was pregnant at the time of Saigo's induction.  He worked as a baker before being drafted, and he had several run-ins with the Japanese secret police.  Now, realizing that the war is hopelessly lost, he longs to be back with his family.<br /><br />As the movie goes along, the American invasion draws nearer.  The Japanese fortifications are strong, and on D-Day, the Americans suffer many casualties due to Kuribayashi's defenses.  However, it is soon clear to the Japanese that the battle cannot be won.  Many men commit suicued by blowing themselves up with grenades rather than surrender.  Saigo and another Japanese soldier even decide to surrender rather than commit suicide or die of starvation, but the attempt is foiled.  Saigo's friend manages to surrender, but Saigo is caught and taken back to his unit.  His friend is eventually shot by two American soldiers who don't want to watch over him.<br /><br />In the end, Kuribayashi leads an attack against the American positions, only to be severely injured by shrapnel.  As he lay dying, he pulls out his pearl-handled pistol, a gift from friends in the United States, and shoots himself.  Saigo, who was told by Kuribayashi to bury him, is eventually captured by the Americans, but he ended up surviving the battle.<br /><br />This is a fantastic movie.  Clint Eastwood has went a step beyond "Flags" with this movie.  Although I liked "Flags" very much, I enjoyed "Letters" more.  Ken Watanabe delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as Kuribayashi, while Ninomiya's portrayal of Saigo is just as good.  The battle scenes are very realistic, and it is sobering to see that many of the Japanese soldiers were not evil killing machines; on the contrary, they were very much like the Americans; scared and missing their homes and loved ones.<br /><br />I give this film my highest recommendation.  Clint Eastwood has crafted a masterpiece that is sure to become a classic.</p></body></html>

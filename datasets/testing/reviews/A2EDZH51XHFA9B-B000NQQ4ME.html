I don't know what other movies these folks are watching. The Passion of the Christ, for one obvious comparison that's just as mainstream, was far, far more violent than this was. There are movies less than half this long that are far more violent. I think the bottom line as far as this goes is that if you have a weak stomach, you might want to avoid Apocalypto, but if you had no problem with The Passion of the Christ (or, honestly, Eastern Promises), then don't let all the shock over the "extreme" amount of violence in this movie get to you. If you want to see it, the violence won't bother you.<br /><br />In any case, the story: Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a warrior and hunter in a small rural tribe. Everything's going along swimmingly until a Mayan slaver band attacks and captures almost the entire tribe. Jaguar Paw is able to send his wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and son off to hide in a hole, but the slavers find out about it and cut the vine she's supposed to use to climb out. Thus, Jaguar Paw has to find a way to escape before he's sacrificed and rescue his wife and son before they starve, or die of thirst.<br /><br />Not a bad little revenge thriller, this, and Gibson, as he did with The Passion of the Christ, adds the mystique of a foreign setting and a language far removed from that most people are familiar with. As a gimmick, I'm sure it will grow old eventually, but Gibson is a proven director on ground he's very familiar with. As a result, the film is very effective. The cinematography is gorgeous, unsurprising as Gibson once again pairs with Dean Semler (Dead Calm, The Road Warrior, Razorback), one of those fantastic cinematographers they grow down in Australia. The make-up jobs are gorgeous, and the action sequences are choreographed in such a way that you'd never think they were choreographed. This is good stuff. Gibson turns in another winner; when he's behind the camera, it seems, he can't lose. *** ?</p></body></html>

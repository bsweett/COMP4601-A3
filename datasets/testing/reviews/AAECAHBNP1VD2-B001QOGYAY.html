But the movie as a whole just doesn't jell. The main reason is what others have said; far too much attention to the afterlife and not enough interaction with the real world. It's never explained how Susie's father knows Harvey is the killer; it just suddenly comes upon him. Ditto her sister. They were major plot holes that really worked to spoil the film. Worth seeing? Yes. More than once? Doubtful.</p></body></html>

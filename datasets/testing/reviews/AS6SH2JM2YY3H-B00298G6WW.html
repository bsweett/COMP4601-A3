<meta name="summary" content="Is there an assassin's retirement home?"></head><body><p>The Matador was a surprisingly funny, R-rated comedy that makes the viewer feel sorry for a paid assassin.<br /><br />As a "facilitator of fatalities," Pierce Brosnan is the perfect actor.  He demonstrates great breath and ability in this movie.  He is still that "James Bond" ladies man, but it has to be because of his smooth talking (and his bankroll).<br /><br />My complaint is the ending.  I don't want to write anything here to ruin it for you, but there is something placed under a window wiper.  It has significance.  Is it something the assassin is giving up?  Is it the equivalent of a business card?  If it was spontaneous, is it one t***** or two?  What did I miss here?  What?  Not even my viewing buddies could help me with this one.<br /><br />The scene of Pierce walking through the hotel lobby in his bathing suit and ankle high boots has been seared in my memory.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="These Streets have Spoken  (4.5 stars)"></head><body><p>&quot;Training Day&quot; is a dark film that isn't afraid to take risks.  It's a movie unlike any I have seen of its genera.  Even from watching some of the previews of the movie, I knew I was in for a wild and unpredictable ride.  And I was right.<p>Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke star in this powerhouse cop thriller.  Hawke plays rookie cop, Jake Hoyt.  Hoyt has dreams of becoming a detective, and hopes that he will be able to put away every single scum-of-the-earth criminal for good.  But before he can do that, he must survive a day with Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington).  And on this day, Hoyt will see the dark side of the streets, the job, and most importantly, the dark side of human beings.  The next 24 hours will be the longest hours of Rookie Jake Hoyt's life.<p>The acting is really amazing.  Of course, Washington is great, as he is in almost every role he takes.  But, he shows us he can break away from his traditional &quot;likable good guy&quot; roles, and take on the role of a sadistic and psychopathic cop who will do what it takes to get the job done at any cost.  Hawke is also terrific, and should've recieved more recognition for his part in the movie.  I also liked seeing Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as well; they proved to be very talented actors.<p>The writing is really effective; with very realistic and believable dialogue.  And Antoine Fuqua does a fabulous job as director.  Being that he knows exactly how it is on the streets, it made him that more of an effective director, and adds to the movie's credibility.<p>The DVD is not bad as well, being that it is a Warner Bros. DVD.  Usually, they don't add too many special features, but they did on this one.  Theres a bunch of deleted scenes, a making of feature, 2 music videos, the trailer of the movie, and many more.  The picture is crystal clear; presented in 16:9 widescreen.  And the sound is also great; quiet when it should be, and loud when it's supposed to be.<p>&quot;Training Day&quot; is a great movie filled with action, drama, and a lot of unpredictable twists and turns.  If you're looking for a good cop action/thriller that is unlike any other, then this just might be the movie for you.  A very unique and awesome movie that never gets old.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Make some guaca-MOLE and watch Goldmember"></head><body><p><p>I had seen the first two movies in this series and figured Goldmember would be more of the same - and it was. A lot of the classic characters return, along with new babe Foxxy Cleopatra and new villian Goldmember (whose disgusting habit of picking his skin and eating it crossed the gross-out line).<br /><p>In this installment (very basically), Dr. Evil is back on his mission to destroy the Earth and he calls on Goldmember for help with his plan titled 'Preparation H'. To keep Austin Powers occupied, they kidnap his father Nigel. Austin and Foxxy foil Dr Evil's plan and save the planet.<br /><p>My favorite part is all of the pop culture references - the Osbournes make cameos and Fat Bastard goes on the Jared/Subway diet! There are also some crazy, unexpected twists that I do not want to give away, but they leave the door wide open for at least a couple more sequels....</p></body></html>

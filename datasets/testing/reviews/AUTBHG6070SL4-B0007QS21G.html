<meta name="summary" content="Good effects, worthwhile points -"></head><body><p>- but I ran into problems trying to care about any of the characters.<br /><br />One very good point is that "global warming" doesn't necessarily mean that everything gets warmer everywhere. It does mean that the world's weather is a mchine driven by heat, and that warming is like nitro in the gas tank. Hots get hotter, colds get colder, everything becomes more of whatever it was, and not necessarily where you'd expect. Another good point is that indirect effects, like shifts in ocean currents, may exert surprisingly strong control over the climate.<br /><br />For dramatic purposes, all those effects were compressed from decades to days or even minutes. Rising ocean levels were crammed into a single wave that flooded New York to waist depth on the Statue of Liberty. Nice effects, but I just don't think many buildings would be left standing if hit by a wall of water ten storeys high. Maybe, opposite of the intuitive result, global warming could trigger a new ice age. That would certainly be dramatic, but I suspect that it would take more than the hour or two shown here.<br /><br />Set your expectations properly: it's just a disaster movie, about as plausible as those asteroid movies a couple of years ago. If you've already dedicated yourself to a useless evening, you may as well watch this.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

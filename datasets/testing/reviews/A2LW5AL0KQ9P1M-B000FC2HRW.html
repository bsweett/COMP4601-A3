The original film presented a youthful but talented cast. It also offered a remarkably original premise injected with a bit of dark humor. Quite a treat! Moreover, while "Final Destination 2" had a thinner plot, the technical effects were completely unexpected -- utterly groundbreaking. The mature casting granted the film an interesting sense of plausibility. So phenomenal a visual-spectacle is the second installment of this film that I shared it with my film-studies class! Now for "Final Destination 3"... Not only are the actors ridiculously inexperienced (this is the first foray into acting for some...and it shows!), they seem to be entirely unaware of their less-than-mediocre talents. This is not a problem of editing, this a serious problem with casting. These actors literally have their foundation in television-acting (check the bios) ... and we are talking bad, bad cable acting (or the CW). The talent is so heinous that that viewer hopes for these actors deaths (not because he/she craves the brutality, but merely as a relief from the "acting"). But, and here is the worst crime the film commits, the deaths are ineffective. The problem: they lack creativity. The first two installments of this franchise used viewer-misdirection to shock its audience with appalling death-scenes. In this instance, the deaths are both predictable and obvious. A tremendous disappointment, indeed.<br /><br />And, for those "Final Destination" fans who think they are going to see a slightly dumbed-down echo of the first two films. ... think REALLY dumbed-down. The grotesque caricatures of teens, the crass/vulgar humor, the gratuitous nudity, and the excruciating writing was shocking. It is unusual to see a director deliberately disregard a film's cult-following. Not only did Wong ignore the intended audience for the film, but he insulted them.<br /><br />For all horror enthusiasts: be prepared to walk-away from the film angry ... and it's not just the SLOPPY, SLOPPY conclusion. Trust me. This is not "Final Destination 3" . . . This is Friday the Thirteenth Part 40 . . . it is base, it is amateurish, and an utter disgrace.</p></body></html>

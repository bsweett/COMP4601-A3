<meta name="summary" content="A SHEEP IN WOLF'S CLOTHING"></head><body><p>The premise of the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), from a college frat-like tough boy club, where pig-pen mud wrestling and macho truth or dare sessions, ("Tell us something about yourself you've never told anyone"), were the order of the day, through to a troubled and scrutinized CIA in the early 1960's and the Cuban Bay of Pigs missile crisis, makes, as backdrop, a much more intriguing story than THE GOOD SHEPHERD's main focus - an upstart recruit's success and conflict, during the founding years of the organization, as he tries to live by his belief to know who you can trust. He soon finds he can trust no one but himself, but before we are accustomed to Matt Damon's bookish characterization of a serious minded government agent, (he's described as a tight-"behind" with no sense of humor), we can't help but wonder why he was so aggresively sought out by the CIA as a junior member. He's first seen, in drag, make-up, wig and falsetto voice, on a college theatrical stage singing in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. He is, (gulp) a poetry student, and his father committed suicide with the distinction of being a traitor to the U.S. government. These should not be high marks on a CIA score card. But without further explanation he's sought after as if he's the ideal candidate. The rest of the film is a series of knee-deep espionage, and double agent revelations that apparently astounded the filmmakers, (musical score soars), but which could be found as passive page-turners in a mediocre paperback spy novel, (watch out for the brunette with the 'hearing aid' and eastern European accent who asks you over for dinner; wink, wink, nudge, nudge). The film goes on for three hours and is missing a narrative drive despite some dramatic pitstops along the way; Angelina Jolie is quite effective as Damon's socialite wife, and the Bay of Pigs segment seems an accurate portrait of the blundering by the U.S. government, but THE GOOD SHEPHERD mostly shepherds along as if searching a landmark statement it never reveals.</p></body></html>

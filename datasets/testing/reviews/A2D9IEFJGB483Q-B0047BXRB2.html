<meta name="summary" content="One of the top three sci-fi films ever."></head><body><p>There are three sci-fi film essentials: Fritz Lang's "Metropolis,"  "The Day the Earth Stood Still," and "Forbidden Planet."  There three films defined science fiction, as we know it today.  "Forbidden Planet," for example, is the father of the Star Trek franchise, and the sets provided the basis for "Lost in Space."  And look at all of Robby the Robots grandchildren!<p>This film is a science fiction rewrite of  "The Tempest," which helps explain its sticking power.  It has the rescue vessel, the mad scientist, and the alien mysteries, all of which capture your interest and never let you go. IT has elements of a murder mystery, with hilarious subplots about a na?ve young girl and hungry boys lucked up in psace for a year.  IS it 1950's cheese?  Yes, but it is fun to watch.<p>The killer is an invisible villain.  Aside from being cheaper, this builds the suspense to an incredible level.  Come on-you see "Alien" and you see a lanky guy in a rubber suit. But an invisible villain lets your imagination run wild, which can be wilder than anything Hollywood can ever make.<p>The situation of a scientific-research vessel that discovers now life and new civilization provides the pattern for Star Trek:  the main characters being the Captain, the ship's doctor and the engineer interacting.  Leslie Neilson has the same soul as William Shatner.  For good or bad, there is no Star Trek equivalent of Robby the Robot, unless you count Mr. Spock.  But I digress.<p>Another observation is Altair's insidious wardrobe changing, which preempts Queen Amildala by five decades.  Walter Pidgeon gives a masterful performance, and steals the show.  So many mad scientists are flat and soulless-they are even passionless went it comes to their passions in science.  But Pidgeon breathes life in what could have been a cheesy 1950's science fiction throwaway.<p>The costuming and sets are superb.  True this is 1950, so some of the sets look like they were done with Crayolas, but can any "cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?"  The doorways in the film give you the weird impression of alien civilization. The lab and Krell building blow your mind with all of the gizmos. Nothing specific, but the overall atmosphere suggests things alien.  I wonder if they actually had an image of the Krell, or if they just made it up as they went along the image you see haloed in laser-fire may be a Krell, or may be the Krell equivalent of a Frankenstein's monster.  The plaster cast of the monster's foot suggests that the monster is an imaginary composite, but we will never know. By the way, the idea that a civilization would not have pictures is not weird ay all-Islamic art does not allow for graven images to be made, so they focus on Arabic calligraphy.  .<p>The soundtrack is theremin based-the eerie "oooh"-making machine from the Beach Boy's song "Good Vibrations."  It adds to the weirdness of the movie, and is comparable to the soundtrack in the 1981 remake of  "Flash Gordon."  Most experimental soundtracks flop, but this comes off perfectly, since it is suggested that the music we a re listening to is actually Krell music.<p>The DVD is an annoying two-sided disc with letterbox and "pan and scan" on each side.  People-Wide screen, wide screen, wide screen!<p>Two parting thoughts:<p>First, at the heart of this movie is a psycho-thriller that brings your mind to the edge as you are forced to look at yourself.  We have the technology and the power to be gods, but can we stand it if in our hearts, we are devils?  Look at this war we are fighting.<p>Second, if this film seems familiar, it is because everyone has ripped it off.  You do not counterfeit a worthless coin.</p></body></html>

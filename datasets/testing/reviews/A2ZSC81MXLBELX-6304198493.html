<meta name="summary" content="The Devil Made Them Do It......."></head><body><p>"This review refers to the Special Edition (MGM)DVD of "The Usual Suspects".....<br /><br />The "Usual Suspects" is one of those rare films that after the first view you just want to call everyone you know and tell them about it. And aren't we lucky to have DVD now and not even have to wait to rewind to watch it again! It's a sleek, stylish mystery/thriller, with a brillant screenplay that will have you hanging on every word of dialouge.The all star cast will have you hypnotized with their powerful performances as well.<br /><br />Five of New York City's small time hoods, have found themselves involved in what might be the biggest and most dangerous heist of thier lives.They were brought together by,'Keyser Soze', a man many compare to the devil himself. He's a legendary underworld figure who is seen by none but feared by all.There's alot to gain(over 90 million dollars), but more to lose...possibly their lives.To say anymore would be giving too much away and ruining the fun of this film.<br /><br />The story, told by Roger "Verbal" Kent(one of the suspects), is a chilling one. It is fraught with mystery and suspense that will have you on the edge of your seat throughout, and even adds a bit of comic relief occasionally.It is totally unpredicatable and absolutely intriguing.The Cast is big...It includes Kevin Spacey, who by the way took home an Oscar (Best Supporting) for his brillant work,Gabriel Byrne,Chazz Palminteri,Kevin Pollack, Steven Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro,and Pete Postlethwaite. The musical score(John Ottman) is haunting and the photography fabulous.It is modern film noir at it's finest and a must see for fans of the genre.<br /><br />This 'Special Edition" DVD will delight fans of this film. It's a beautiful transfer. You have the choice of widescreen or full screen(choose at the beginning of the film),the surround sound is excellent and is in Dolby Dig 5.1. It may also be viewed in French(stereo) and has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. There are so many special features,including featurettes and deleted scenes(see buying info here for complete list), they have a whole side of their own.The film may also be viewed with commentary by Director Bryan Singer or John Ottman.<br /><br />Is Keyser Soze the devil? Does he really even exsist?..if he does..who is he? You be the judge.<br />Watching it for the 1st time of the 50th, it will never get old!<br />Get the popcorn ready and enjoy.....Laurie<br /><br />also available in this 2 pack(check individual prices vs. 2 pack):<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DI8ZDC">L.A.

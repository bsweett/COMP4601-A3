<meta name="summary" content="Up in the Air"></head><body><p>`Up In The Air' is a film that follows a man called Ryan Bingham (played by George Clooney) who travels around America firing people for various businesses and clocks up millions of air miles in the process. He prides himself on his independence and ability to have no responsibilities or commitments and seems to live a highly charmed life. That is until a young woman joins his company and tries to change the business model so he will eventually become grounded and virtually obsolete himself. He also strikes up an unusual relationship with a fellow traveller which starts to break down his hard outer shell and brings some real warmth to both Bingham and the film. Although there are some very funny moments in this film, this is not an outright comedy and in fact by the end it is tinged with a certain amount of sadness. Clooney plays his role excellently and I don't think I have seen him act as well as in this film. He is charming, detached, vulnerable, funny and more besides and manages to portray his character superbly. The other actors are also very good and Vera Farmiga is great as the fellow traveller who wends her way into his life. This is a gentle film and is very well written and this had me laughing out loud at times and also feeling a certain sadness at the end as well. The direction is great and I feel this to be one of Jason Reitman's better films to date and if he carries on like this then things can only get better. All in all this made for just over 100 minutes entertaining viewing and whilst it has a slightly downbeat feel to it, you will still reach the end having enjoyed it and with a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

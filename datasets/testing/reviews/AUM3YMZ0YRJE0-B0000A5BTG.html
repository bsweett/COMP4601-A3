<meta name="summary" content="mediocre scifi"></head><body><p>Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by this film.  I was looking for hard scifi, something that is entirely plausible, yet projected into a fascinating future.  Red Planet comes to mind, as does Andromeda Strain:  you can really believe the story if you are knowledgeable about science, at least while you're watching it.<br /><br />This film starts promisingly:  there are mysterious catastrophes that are linked to man's messing with the Earth's core.  They have to fix it.  Unfortunately, what they come up with is what can only be called a magical technology:  a ray to cuts anything, and a material (for a tunneling device) that is more or less infinitely strong.  Once this magic is established, it has to succeed.<br /><br />The characters are the strongest part, as the actors are really good.  Also, some of the underground locales are fun.  But this isn't good hard scifi.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless you want action rather than hard scifi.</p></body></html>

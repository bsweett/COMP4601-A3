<meta name="summary" content="The Ghosts Have Arrived..."></head><body><p>I love a well-told ghost story. THE ORPHANAGE is fantastic! It is a flesh-bubbler w/ loads of mystery and dread. If you enjoyed THE CHANGELING (w/ George C. Scott), THE HAUNTING (the original version), or any intelligent spooker, then consider this movie a gift from the ghoul-gods! I was very satisfied w/ the story, the heavy atmosphere, and the puzzle to be solved. The ending is both terrifying and heart-breaking at once. THE ORPHANAGE deals w/ the agony of tragic loss as well as the supernatural. It is a human story that slowly shifts into nightmare. It is also about the unbreakable bond between a mother and son. Highly recommended. Spanish w/ english subtitles...</p></body></html>

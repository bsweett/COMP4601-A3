The leader of the government force is Captain Vidal, and the film begins with the arrival in camp of his pregnant wife. His wife is accompanied by Ofelia, her daughter by another man, now deceased, by what manner is not told. The girl is a bookworm and fond of fairy stories. After finding an odd stone in the road, she activates a magical process that awakens the interest of a curious, clicking insect, which she regards as a fairy and follows her to camp. The camp itself is a cauldron of intrigue, with suspicious soldiers rounding up and intimidating peasants and locals seemingly in cahoots with the rebels. Ofelia's mother is soon sidelined with complications of the pregnancy, and Ofelia becomes more and more entangled  in a mysterious and fantastic underground world. She meets a faun, a sort of goat-horned semi-deity, who takes Ofelia for the daughter of a king. The faun gives Ofelia a book and a series of tasks that she must perform to demonstrate her royal credentials.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth is frightening and violent -- on both sides of the magical divide. The major question running through the film is the relation of the realms to one another. Is the fairy realm real? Or is it a figment of Ofelia's fragile imagination? It's not giving much away to suggest that this question will not bee resolved by the end of the film. Arguing against the idea that Ofelia seeks refuge in fairyland is that the creatures she meets there are as ugly, murderous and demanding as the ones in her real life. If anything, the creatures offer nightmarish parallels to the characters above ground. What differentiates the two realms is that ultimately, the fairy world, though subject to harsh and uncompromising laws, is ultimately benign and intends only good on those who abide by its rules. The world above is harsh too, but wishes only to dominate and terrorize its subjects, not to rule them justly.<br /><br />The film is a luscious feast of images from beginning to end. The Captain, a malevolent and dictatorial man, is seen gently oiling a watch that may have been his father's. The faun, wise and kind in the moonlight, gently brushes Ofelia's face with his long, twiglike fingers. An underground ogre, with eyes in the palms of his hands, holds his eyes up to his face, fingers spread into a frightening fringe. The films' effects are mostly well-handled, with fairies flitting noisily about and graphic violence and torture convincingly portrayed.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth does not offer up an easy solution for the problems it poses. It offers up a complex and many-layered ending that is hard to comprehend as a clear-cut victory for any side. If anything, it parallels the world wee all live in, in which victory is a distant goal, even an illusion, that empowers and propels action, and in which the events of any single day cannot always be seen as trending to our good or our ill. Pan's Labyrinth is about one girl's determined desire to respond with openness to her world, with all of its ugliness and beauty, come what may.<br /><br />Despite its fairytale subject matter, the movie is not for kids. It well ddesserves its R rating for graphic violence, including an amputation, executions and field surgery.</p></body></html>

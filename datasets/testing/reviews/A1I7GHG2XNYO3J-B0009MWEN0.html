<meta name="summary" content="New age of big bugs"></head><body><p>Ive been a fan of the "big bug" flicks since first viewing "Them" as a youngster. Starship Troopers, is a modern, 50's genre sci-fi classic. The sound and visual FX are a marvel and the movie does manage to capture the magic of the "creature features" of old. High tech "big bugs" are out to destroy earth and its a galaxy spanning battle to save mankind. Great fun.<br />I dont know what this is pictured with my review but my review deals with the original movie!</p></body></html>

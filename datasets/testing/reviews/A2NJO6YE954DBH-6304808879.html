<meta name="summary" content=""Time to play," says Pinhead.  Everybody out of Hell..."></head><body><p>It is surprising when you go back and watch "Hellraiser" again, after having steeled yourself for the experience because this time you know exactly what is coming, that Pinhead, the leader of the Cenobites, has so little screentime.  Of course, this shortcoming has been rectified by the various sequels to the original, but even if there had only been one "Hellraiser" the image of Pinhead would remain one of the most disturbing images of contemporary horror films.  <p>However, even without Pinhead, "Hellraiser" has plenty of intensely disturbing images.  We begin with the compelling little Lamont Configuration, an exotic puzzle box that opens a door to Hell, which is what poor Frank (Sean Chapman) discovers just both the Cenobites rip his body to pieces.  But when Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his second wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into a new house and Larry rips his hand open on a nail, the blood brings Frank--well, part of him--back from the Hell dimension.  It seems that Frank and Julia had been lovers, and she had promised to do "anything" Frank wanted.  Julia was looking for something in the area of sexual deviancy we assume, but Frank now has something else in mind as he holds Julia to her word, namely, seducing men to come back to her house and up to the attic where their life's blood can help further regenerate Frank's body.  By the time poor Larry and his daughter Kristy (Ashley Laurence) have a clue what is happening upstairs, it is pretty much too late. <p>Writer-Director Clive Barker does not pull any punches in his first film when it comes to putting as much raw horror on the screen as he can cram into this 94 minute film.  "Hellraiser" rewrites the rules in terms of how far you can go and what you can try to do to the poor viewers of your horror film.  The key thing is that as gross as things get on the screen, there is an intelligence and a creativity behind the horror that can neither be ignored nor easily dismissed.  You can imagine Barker saying, "What?  You WANTED to see a movie that would give you nightmares, didn't you?"  This is not a particularly polished film, but I really think that adds to its effectiveness.  "Hellraiser" is a primal horror film, operating on a raw level that is as innovative as it is disquieting.  If they had rated this film "X," I probably would have agreed with the judgment.  Not for the squeamish (or their neighbors).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jamie Foxx channels the late, great Ray Charles"></head><body><p>After watching the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards I was thinking that Jamie Foxx is going to win the Best Actor Oscar for "Ray" because everybody is going to want to hear him do another acceptance speech (he has to be saving the best for last).  Of course, after watching "Ray" it becomes obvious the members of the Academy have an even better reason for honoring the performance, even if Foxx is not having a year in which his career has reached the high water mark with another Oscar nomination for his "Supporting Role" in "Collateral and his SAG nomination for his performance in "Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story" on television.  True, Foxx does not do his own singing in "Ray," but he does play the piano and why would you want to hear anybody other than Ray Charles sing?  In 20th century American popular music in terms of signers there is Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Ray Charles.  I keep trying to come up with one more for the thumb, but Woody Guthrie or Bob Dylan are more songwriters than singers and everybody else you can name as singers are just not in that league.<br /><br />The film by director Taylor Hackford and screenwriter James L. White basically tells the story of how Ray Charles came to two pivotal moments in his life.  The first is when he took the emerging sound of Rhythm & Blues and added gospel powered vocals to basically create soul music when "I Got a Woman" was released in 1955.  Everything he sings before that point is pretty good, such as "Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand," but it is not great and it all sounds more like Nat "King" Cole or Charles Brown that the authentic Ray Charles.  So the first part of the movie has to do with Ray Charles finding his voice.  The rest of "Ray" is the load road to the second pivotal point, where Charles kicks his heroin habit.<br /><br />Except for a choice moment of person redemption from the Georgia State Legislature, the story of Ray Charles is over at that point.  We can then turn from the DVD to CDs of Ray Charles singing all of the songs we heard him sing in the movie from "Night Time is the Right Time" (a.k.a. the number from "The Cosby Show" for the younger generations) and "What I'd Say" to "Georgia" and "Hit the Road Jack."  But the great irony is that after Charles kicked his drug habit he was never as great.  He was still very, very good, making any song he sang his own, as when he covered "Yesterday," "Eleanor Rigby," "Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma," "Living for the City" and "America."  But the creative fire was gone.  That is why this film ends where it does.  You would not say that the career of Ray Charles was ever in descent, but clearly the glory days of ascension had ended.<br /><br />"Ray" is a reminder of the greatness of Ray Charles as a singer.  It is sad that the singer died shortly after the film was shot because he should be deservedly basking in the glory along with Foxx.  But then there is no doubt that Ray Charles knew he was an American institution.  Still, I wonder if he had to do it over again if Ray Charles would have avoided doing drugs.  In the context of this 2004 biopic Ray's motivation for doing drugs is his feelings of guilt over the accidental death of his younger brother when they were children (and before Charles went blind).  His ability to kick heroin is tied to his coming to terms with that personal tragedy, so the argument is that it was not the drugs that fueled the way he played the piano and sang, but rather guilt.  If you took away that guilt would that destroy his passion?  If you took away the drugs would that passion have simply destroyed him?  Today we live in a world with Ray Charles, but this film suggests the possibility of a world where we never would have known he was alive and convinces us that would have been even worse.</p></body></html>

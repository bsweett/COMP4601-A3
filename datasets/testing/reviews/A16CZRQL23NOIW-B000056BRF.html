This movie has always been a reference match against all the others.<br />Outstanding script, superb performances. Heston as the jew and Stephen Boyd as Messala make a couple team unforgettable.<br />The race sequence I 've seen at least one hundred times. It's spectacular and arresting.<br />Amazing transference.<br />A timeless work.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It Answered All my Questions About the First Film!"></head><body><p>4 1/2 Stars = Minor Marerpiece<br /><br />Coming from a guy who went to see the first Alien film in the theater, to seeing it to many times to count afterwards. Wanting to try to figure out all the ambiguities of that film, & it was very ambiguous, with no clues about the xenomorph & the alien spaceship, & where they came from. So, all I have to say about "Prometheus" is, without giving it all away:<br /><br />Genius, pure, genius! It answered all my questions about the first film, then some! It also created more ambiguities, but that's the charm of many great films, leaving the viewer wanting more. Just like life, there is never no complete answers on where you'll be tomorrow, what will happen to you after you die, or who is responsible for life on the grand scale. So goes "Prometheus," for it can't answer those questions either, but it does make you wonder.<br /><br />A new chapter has been born, one that leaves room for other, maybe more intriquing chapters to come, full of more ambiguous questions for the next film to explain?<br /><br />Quite the accomplishment, Mr. Scott!</p></body></html>

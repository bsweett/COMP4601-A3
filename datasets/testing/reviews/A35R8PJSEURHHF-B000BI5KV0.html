<meta name="summary" content="Just a documentary, nothing special."></head><body><p>Since this was in the theaters, I figured there was some "movie" to it.  Turns out it was just a slow moving documentary, much like the ones you sit through in high school.  All the information in it could have been done in one half hour.  Very little commentary; most of the time you just watch penguins walking or standing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ford"></head><body><p>This is really a very generic genre picture that only really shines a little bit because of Harrison Ford.  Ford is great as always.  Very believeable as a nice family man with a good job and a nice house.  He finds his family kidnapped and threatened with death unless he helps a gang of criminals hack into his banks computer system and transfer 100 million into their account.  From there you have your little chase scenes and a few anxious moments.  But they are nothing new or special and a very fomulatic ending.  This was enjoyable enough to catch on cable, but I wouldn't go out and buy it for my permanent collection.</p></body></html>

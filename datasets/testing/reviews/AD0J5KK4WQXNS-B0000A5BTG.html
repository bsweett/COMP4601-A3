Truth be told, I enjoyed it because the film is less - USA is going to save the world! and more about the characters in this film. The premise is sci-fi simple. The Earths core is no longer rotating and that means we are all going to fry unless some scientists can get together and develop a unit that can drill to the Earths core and launch a load of nukes to start the core spinning again.<p>Basically this is a B-MOVIE!.. and once you get that then it really does move along at a good pace. The story is character driven and the environments are pretty cool with lots of action along the way.<p>In short go into this one with low expectations and you will enjoy the core. It is great B-Movie fun!</p></body></html>

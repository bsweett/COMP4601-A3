<meta name="summary" content="HIGHLY ENTERTAINING ACTION FILM!  STALLONE VS THE KEYSTONE KOPS!"></head><body><p>This is the first film in the Rambo series and is by far the best! Most people know what the Rambo character is all about, but for those of you who don't......In this entry Stallone's character Rambo is an ex army Green Beret who is wandering across the country in search of an old army buddy. He is not welcomed in the small town he comes to and is treated in the worst way by the town's police. Rambo strikes back and rages a one man war on the town and I'm sure before it is all over, they wish they had just let the guy get a little something to eat! Stallone really knows how to make you hate these moronic cops!  Really well done and he has some good supporting characters in Brian Dennehy,Richard Crenna and a young David Carusso! This is Hollywood action and it is not completely believable, but not so unbelievable either. Compared to the sequels it is a masterpiece! The DVD transfer is excellent and it has some very interesting extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Sci-Fi"></head><body><p>Like all good film science fiction, &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; keeps its concepts simple but their ramifications grand, which is just one of the reasons it is a timeless classic.  Made at a time when sci-fi was the junk that kept restless kids in theater seats on Saturday afternoons, this ambitious take on Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; nonetheless also aims for adults that grew up on the pulp fiction of the 1920s and 30s.  (Its delightful production design is a seamless mix of colors, forms, and shapes familiar from those imaginative magazine covers.)  The premise is Star Trek a decade before Star Trek, as a military cruiser commanded by the hard-nosed but humane J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen doing an effective melodramatic turn) visits a world populated by a secretive scholar (a wonderful Walter Pidgeon), his curious daughter (a sometimes grating Ann Francis), their robot butler (the epitome of mechanical men) and a mostly unseen terror (illustrated by topnotch Disney animators).  Beyond great special effects and an innovative musical score, the film also engages a firm--if now familiar--science fiction plot, unlike so many of the noisy and expensive but ultimately overwrought and empty-headed sci-fi movies of today.</p></body></html>

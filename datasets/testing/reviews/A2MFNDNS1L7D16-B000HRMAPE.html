This is Tom Cruise doing what he does best, being a charismatic super action figure.  Also it is another chapter in the MI story. In fact, after you get past the over long tease before the credits & the annoying long set-up, (he's a good guy, ex-agent engaged to a woman without a clue to who he is or was), what you have is a complete episode like the tv series, a bit flashier perhaps, sucessfully completed. Then the second half & the movie really begins. MI:III had the incredible luck of having Phillip Seymour Hoffman as their suitably evil villian. That's the only sniff of Oscar this will ever get. Lack of a very good plot means a lots of technical mayhem. Cars blow up, choppers get shot down, Tom gets launched from building to building all a bit tedious. To his credit, Tom does a lot of his own stunts. I wasn't disappointed. The movie delivered what I expected but I didn't have high expectations to begin with. Forget the critcs & enjoy this one, the first of the summer action movies.</p></body></html>

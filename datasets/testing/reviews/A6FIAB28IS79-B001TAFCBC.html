<meta name="summary" content="Far from a spotless movie"></head><body><p>Perhaps my mistake was watching this immediately after "Stranger than Fiction," an equally overworked, derivative premise about a repressed, unfulfilled personality who requires not so much the extermination of his pedestrian self as the recovery of his more vital self (i.e. he needs the right, "spontaneous," life-endowed woman).  The prototype is Chris Marker's 1962 masterpiece, "La Jetee," a film that's as profound as it is fresh, provocative, and haunting.  The problem with these later spin-offs is not their lack of originality. Adrian Lyne's "Jacob's Ladder" is one of several films to approach "La Jetee"'s greatness.  But these most recent efforts are low-budget formula pictures with big-budget stars that unfortunately lend validity to "Chick Flick" as a dismissive term for the whole sub-genre.<br /><br />The performances are often of Oscar-worthy quality.  But I don't recall Rosalind Russell ("His Girl Friday") or Katherine Hepburn ("Adam's Rib") ever being wasted in scripts so unworthy of their talents as are Emma Thompson and Kate Winslett.  Of the two present films, "Stranger Than Fiction" is the better-made movie, but "Eternal Sunshine" is more ambitious and multi-dimensional.  The decidedly anti-intellectual message of "Stranger" is: Smelling and eating fresh-baked cookies not only satisfies the palate but heals the incomplete soul more surely than the agonized meanings of great literature.  "Spotless Mind" might be said to test this thesis by offering the viewer quotes from Nietszche ("Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders") and Alexander Pope ("How happy is the blameless vessel's lot/The world forgetting by the world forgot/Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind").<br /><br />The problem is that the quotes are spoken out of context, as if the characters of the film (and their creator) are clueless to the irony of the quoted statements, both of which condemn forgetfulness and deride the notion of a "spotless mind."  As if it weren't bad enough that the writers of the screenplay make mockery of Chris Marker's achievement, they misrepresent Nietszche and Alexander Pope, both of whom prefer to the sunshine of the spotless mind the mind that is alive "because" it remembers the past, however painful or imperfect it may be.  (How often I ponder the question of which is worse: the destruction of the world's great literary texts or the distorted, gross and even dangerous interpretations to which such texts, including the Bible, are subjected by tone-deaf, unimaginative, utterly "selfish" readers.)<br /><br />Both films overstay their welcome, attempting closure and not finding it. At least "Spotless Mind" provokes genuine reflection, and perhaps some minimal self-scrutiny at that.  Were the writers of the film as unashamedly didactic and verbal in their exit strategy as the makers of "Stranger Than Fiction," I would have offered them the following (by Kierkegaard):  "When one has once fully entered the realm of love, the world - no matter how imperfect - becomes rich and beautiful, it consists solely of opportunities for love."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid Acting in a Thought-Provoking Drama"></head><body><p>See this movie only if you enjoy a film where the acting and writing is way above average, and only if you are in the mood for a film that will induce thought. This is not a movie to settle down with if you just want to be entertained for the evening. It's basically a quiet character study about conflicting people (although it does get fairly tense and emotional at times).<br /><br />I grew up in the 1970's and went to Catholic school; it was a decade after this film's time period but not much had changed, believe me. I was used to all the trappings of the church and of nuns and priests. I was not an altar boy but I was exposed to the traditions and experiences that are seen in this film. I would imagine that someone who is not familiar with these things at all might find some aspects of this movie to be almost foreign in certain ways. But a viewer need not be familiar with Catholicism (or even with the Bronx in 1964) to appreciate this movie.<br /><br />The four principles give outstanding performances, particularly Meryl Streep and Viola Davis (Davis has just one major scene, and she is excellent in it). Streep owns the movie as the conflicted and multifaceted Sister Aloysius; this is probably the most relentless and stubborn woman in cinema since Nurse Ratched in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975 (played by Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher). I was fascinated with this character, and torn over how I felt about her. She can be considered a heroine and also a villain at the same time. It's hard to explain. She can be strict, unfair, caring, funny, impatient, and cold. And it's no surprise that this would be another (her sixteenth) Oscar nomination for Meryl Streep. She never stops creating authentic characters. In "Doubt", her mannerisms, body language, accent, and expressions were all spot-on.<br /><br />The film is sometimes ambiguous, particularly the final scene. Some things are left to the audience to wrestle with and to interpret. I enjoyed that the story becomes much more than a mystery, that it becomes more about a person's choices and judgments and decisions. Kudos to playwright and director John Patrick Shanley for making this powerful film.</p></body></html>

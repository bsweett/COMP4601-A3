<meta name="summary" content="Too much hype for "Perdition"..."></head><body><p>...In the 30's in the Midwest, crime is controlled in cities large and small by the mob.  In each city, the ethnic group in charge of criminal activities depends on the surroundings.  In the mythical midwestern city where the film starts out, the Irish Rooney family is in charge.  The film opens as Rooney patriarch, John, (Paul Newman) is hosting a wake for one of his "fellows".  The young Sullivan family (Hanks, Jennifer Jason-Leigh and two sons) is in attendance, and it becomes quickly evident that Rooney treats Michael Sr. (Hanks) as a son (he participated in Mike's coming of age, has employed Mike, and Mike seemingly is his most successful bagman and enforcer), and Michael and Peter (Tyler Hoechlin & Liam Aiken) as grandsons.  The men of the film, with the exception of Rooney's disreputable son Connor (Daniel Craig) are taciturn and solemn - all business, cold and bleak.  Hard men, for hard times. <p>Mike Jr., at 12, is convinced his father is more than just an ordinary man, but can already feel the strangeness of suspecting that what his dad does for a living doesn't fit with the religious and moral code so evident in the Sullivan household.  He hides in the car one night as his father and Connor set out for a "discussion" with a disenchanted member of Rooney's organization.  The film erupts with the violence that Mike Jr. witnesses.  Soon, both Sullivan's are on the run from the Rooney organization, which has closed ranks to protect Connor, seemingly because they cannot trust Mike Jr. to keep what he saw a secret.  Mrs. Sullivan and Peter are assassinated by Connor and the two remaining must find a way to stay safe and to gain their revenge.  The tragic tale that follows is less about the storyline and more about the parallels of father/son relationships.  <p>Mendes earned, with his reputation, the right to work with some of the best in the business.  Hanks always rises to perform as a master when surrounded by a talented ensemble, and particularly with an actor/actress of Newman's caliber.  Hanks is self-contained, communicating with his eyes and his instinctive reactions to events.  His scene at the piano with Newman, and his victory in the rain against Newman's men are both masterful displays of acting prowess.  He's not alone in these scenes, and Newman is memorable here - easily slipping from engaging man among men to fearsome patriarch to a father torn by anguish over competing responsibilities to family - should he value his own flesh and blood more than the "son" who is his by demeanor, ability and character?<p>Young Hoechlin, as Mike, Jr., is either one of the finest young actors we have seen, or, more likely, a truly successful student of Mendes/Hanks - he conveys much of what we learn about him with his eyes and his gestures.  Jude Law has a scary turn, as a smarmy contract killer, and too little is seen of Stanley Tucci as a Chicago mobster, and of Jason Leigh.  Both, however, get more screen time than Anthony LaPaglia, who was cast as Al Capone, but all of the film of his character ended up on the cutting room floor.  <p>Strong performances make memorable characters, but the plotline of "Perdition" is thin.  Mendes enhances the film with its own bleakness.  The sound and the lighting capture the suspense - both are almost visceral in the violent sequences, and the cinematography of Conrad Hall is evident in the transition of camera shots - the film manages to feel like a series of artistic masterpieces wound together as a film.  Each time two characters meet in a one on one sequence (be it Connor warning young Michael, a kindly farmwoman who confronts Mike Sr. with the knowledge of how much he means to his son, or the dawning awareness of the danger in a roadside diner where Law's Maguire  and Sullivan meet) the film draws you in to the sequence as though it were really unfolding before you.<p>There will be many filmgoers who are amazed by "The Road to Perdition", and many who will reject it because it was billed as a successor to "The Godfather", and, aside from the mob plot and the tales of family revenge and relationships, the two have very little in common.  "Perdition" takes place over 6 short weeks - "The Godfather" unfolds over two decades.  The sense of golden unreality that captured viewers for Puzo's rich storyline is missing from the quick sketch of the harsh midwestern mob life in the 30's. <p>Hardest for me as a filmgoer is the film's ending.  A little short on plot, it leaves us with an implausible, if necessary conclusion.  We've guessed it all along based on the way Mendes introduces the film, but the closing sequence, (again, beautifully filmed) is melodramatic and unrealistic.  Mike Jr. would have taken the action he had to take to survive.<br /><br />For adult moviegoers this summer, it is a quietly powerful film choice, beautifully made.</p></body></html>

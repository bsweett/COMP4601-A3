<meta name="summary" content="NOT ENOUGH FOCUS ON THE HEROES"></head><body><p>I must admit I was disappointed with UNITED 93.  I think the tv movie FLIGHT 93 captured the passengers' plight more than this bigger budgeted one.  While excruciatingly hard and sad to watch, UNITED 93 didn't make me feel as connected with the passengers and crew as I would have liked.  While FLIGHT 93 gave us the names of the passengers, Paul Greengrass' script makes them too anonymous, and I felt too much time was spent on the ground crew and even on the terrorists themselves.<br /><br />I was disappointed even insulted by John Powell's eastern-tinged musical score; I was disappointed and even insulted with the juxtaposition of the passenger's recital of the Lord's Prayer with the terrorists prayers to Allah.  While I support everyone's right for religious expression, I can't find any reason to sanitize or empathize with the actions of these men who were responsible for the horrifying deaths of so many innocent American people.  I don't think this film is as strong a tribute to those brave passengers and crew as I would have liked, and that is rather sad.</p></body></html>

I've stated before that westerns were never really my thing, and it's not like Eastwood has a huge draw on me either.  He's serviceable at best in my opinion, only on rare occasions having his overly gruff mannerisms pay off with brilliance.  After the amazing year westerns in general had last year (`3:10 to Yuma', `No Country for Old Men' and `...Jesse James...' all making my top ten of the year) I figured that maybe I should research this Oscar winning classic to see if the films iconic status was justified.<br /><br />Watching `Unforgiven' has really made me realize that you should never judge a film before you see it, because you never truly know what's in store for you.<br /><br />`Unforgiven' opens with a sharp pain of brutality as two men victimize a woman.  When the sheriff doesn't do anything more than slap the men's wrists the women of the community put out a reward for the men's head.  William Munny, a former murderer turned caring father and widower, hears of the reward and, hesitantly, decides to pursue it in order to better take care of his two children.  Along with his former sidekick Ned Logan and an overly confident young gunslinger going by the name of The Schofield Kid, Munny makes his way into town with his horse and his gun and the smell of blood.<br /><br />Eastwood really went all out with this production.  The overall feel of the film is very gritty and dark and adds weight to the moral that is brought to the full as the curtains close so-to-speak.  The film is violent, but in a repressed sort of way, allowing the majority of the film to ride on the anticipation of bloodshed and only truly rearing its head in short explosions of brutality.  This allows `Unforgiven' to become more than just an action film or a bloodbath but creates a film that is as deep and poignant as it is entertaining.<br /><br />The acting is also golden here.  Morgan Freeman seems to just coast through his scenes, but his companionship with Eastwood is unmatchable.  He just has such a natural talent that even when he isn't doing anything exceptional he is still amazing.  Clint has never really sold it for me.  I was impressed with him in `Million Dollar Baby' because I felt as though he made his harshness work to his advantage.  He does that here as well.  Next to `Million Dollar Baby' this has got to be his finest performance.  Gene Hackman steals the whole show though as Bill Daggett, the ruthless sheriff.  His savagery is embellished by his sick sense of justification and that makes Hackman's character development nothing short of extraordinary.<br /><br />In the end I'm pleased to say that `Unforgiven' stands up as worthy of the praise and attention it has received.  I can't say if it was the best film of the year (92 was such a fantastic year for film) but it most definitely ranks in my top ten and surely will stand the tests of time as one of the most effective westerns of all time, defining everything that makes the genre what it is.  I may not be an avid supporter of the genre as a whole, but when a western is done right it can be nothing short of amazing.  `Unforgiven' is done very, very right.</p></body></html>

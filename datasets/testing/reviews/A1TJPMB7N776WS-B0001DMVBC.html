Ben Kingsley as Behrani says it succinctly when he compares we Americans to children, always looking for the next thrill, the next sweet, the next thing to excite us, the next thing to keep us occupied and interested (paraphrase).<br />But whereas Dubus' novel is spare, direct and to the point, Perelman's film sometimes strays into melodrama, especially in the film's third act when the action gets too contrived and almost veers into silliness. But the epilogue is so strong, so poignant, so well acted by all that you soon forgive "The House of Sand and Fog" it's foibles.<br />Ben Kingsley's performance is a wonder. As Behrani he plays a powerful man forced out of Iran with his wife and children only to work two menial jobs in the U.S. to support his family. He is proud yet cunning, saving his money when he can, always looking for ways to improve his lot. Behrani is a man who ultimately pays for his pride in the worst possible ways, yet he accepts his fate with dignity and courage. His fall from grace is not noble, but it is understandable.<br />Jennifer Connolly as Kathy is one of the walking wounded. She is everything that Behrani is not: driven by her emotions, unable to act, overcome and unable to get passed her recent divorce, really a mass of raw exposed nerve endings. Kathy doesn't even have the wherewithal to take advantage of her beauty and her natural allure. She is so unaware, stripped of all confidence that she is a victim of her beauty.<br />"The House of Sand and Fog" is a gorgeous film to look at and Perelman uses the Northern California locales as a physical manifestation of his characters emotional state: densely foggy, bone chilling cold when emotions are in upheaval and difficult to read and brightly sunlight when things are straightforward and clear, which is not much of the time.<br />Don't visit "The House of Sand and Fog" looking for a surgically precise world free of contradiction, you won't find it. Instead, you will find a world in conflict, a world full of compromise, a world heaving and erupting from the conflict of the have and the have-nots, the confident and prideful versus the tragically lost.</p></body></html>

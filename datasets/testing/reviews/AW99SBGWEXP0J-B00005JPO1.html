<meta name="summary" content="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"></head><body><p>In 1957 Nevada, Indiana Jones (Ford) and his sidekick Mac (Winstone) have been kidnapped by Irina Spalko (Blanchett) and her Soviet henchmen.  They break into an American military facility and Spalko enlists Indy's help in finding something.  Indy manages to escape, and soon finds that he has been given a leave of absence from teaching.  Before leaving town, "Mutt" (LeBouf) enlists his help to find Professor Oxley (Hurt), who has gone missing while looking for crystal skulls in South America.  They set off, and soon find themselves face to face with Spalko again, as well as a face from the past - Marion Ravenwood (Allen).<br /><br />"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" could never live up to the hype surrounding it.  One would have hope that is was less disappointing than it is though.  It is good to see Indiana Jones back in action.  George Lucas's desire for the perfect story/script has been the major factor in the delay, and it is ironic that the story/script is the weakest point of the film.  In fact, it is downright silly at times.  Sure, it is good to see Harrison Ford back in action as Indy, but that can only carry a movie so far.  LeBouf and Blanchett are adequate in supporting roles, and it is good to see Karen Allen again.  Marion and Indy recapture some of the magic from "Raiders", but it is not enough.  "Kingdon" will make a bunch of money, that is certain, but it is likely to leave a bit of a sour taste in the viewers' mouths as they leave the theater.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wolftrix?  Draculix? Under-Zion?  HEY, IT'S STILL FUN!!"></head><body><p>This movie is getting alot of critique here at amazon.  Another one of those fringe films everyone has an opinion on.  Some of the supporters are obvious gothic horror film freeks who like anything with wowzer special affects.  Some of the detracters just can't enjoy a film that is'nt "highly acclaimed".<br /><br />  Well, I fall between these two extremes.  Here's my take on this highly watchable "horror/action/gothic/Matrix" wanna-be;<br /><br />-Obviously "The Matrix" series (and it's financial success) had allot to do with this getting made.  I would call this the horror equivelent to "The Matrix" series.<br /><br />-Now some are crying fowel. But this film gets criticized for the exact thing that "The Matrix" does; THE STORY HAD INFINITE BUT FAILED POTENTIAL.<br /><br />-Actually, I think if "The Matrix" stopped at the first film, it would have been more impressive.  "Underworld" has a less flawed story than the 2 "Matrix" sequals.<br /><br />-Say what you will, the special affects are pretty cool.  This is how this film got most peoples attention in the first place.<br /><br />-Miss Beckinsale is quite fetching in her costume... hey, you can't argue!<br /><br />-The vampires (other than Kate) seemed a little too whimpy.  For the most part, they get trounced.<br /><br />-The stories biggest flaw: Using guns to do most of the fighting.  These are supernatural creatures,  LET THEM DUKE IT OUT!!<br /><br />-I did not know that vampires could act in a consious manner with their brains detached from their bodies.  Just nit-picky I guess.<br /><br />-I really enjoyed this film on a visual level.  They obviously were going for allot of "posed" imagry.<br /><br />-Most reviewers are correct when they say you don't care much for either side.  HOW COULD YOU!!  THEY ARE, BY DEFINITION, SCARY MONSTERS THAT EAT US!!<br /><br />-The DVD is adequate for the "not-the-directors-unrated-cut-super-special-edition".  For what I paid (NOT $15) I'm happy.<br /><br />The bottom line:  I actually was very afraid to buy this based on the mixed reviews.  So, I waited for a really good sale.  I'm happy with my purchase.  Not a great film but entertaining.  It will be fun to watch around Halloween.  Given the premise, most people with a fair imagination could have come up with much more dynamic and quality alternative story-line.  But I am much less disturbed by this than the "matrix" sequals (which I also enjoyed quite a bit).  If you can't get over that part of it, then I would'nt recommend it.  Borrow or rent first.</p></body></html>

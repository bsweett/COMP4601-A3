This will surely go down as one of the classic Christmas tales. Ed Asner makes a great Santa. The story itself is touching and not at one time boring. Somethings in the film are childish, but the movie is intended for children. Just the whole fish-out-of-water story, as someone said, is what makes the film. Buddy just can't seem to fit in anywhere, but he does make a lot of friends. Recommended!</p></body></html>

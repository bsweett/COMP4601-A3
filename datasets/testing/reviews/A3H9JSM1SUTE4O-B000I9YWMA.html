<meta name="summary" content="STYLISH HORROR OK BUT NOT GREAT"></head><body><p>The bloody terror of Jack the Ripper soaks almost every frame of "FROM HELL." Although twin directors Allen and Albert Hughes deliver a detailed and atmospheric recreation of London's East End Whitechapel district circa 1888, they do not quite capture the full impact of the massive graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell on which the film is based.  Johnny Depp is a Scotland Yard detective who uses all manner of drugs to enhance his intuitive "visions" as he investigates the surgical-like slayings of five prostitutes.  Robbie Coltrane is his assistant. Heather Graham's a Cockney whore who may become a victim of the Riper and Ian Holm is a still proud, but washed-up surgeon.  The real star of this grimly gripping saga is the recreation of London's Ripper haunts in Prague.  The two disc set is heavy with extras and bonus material including commentary by directors, writer, cinematographer, many deleted scenes, an alternate ending, multiple featurettes include making-of, behind the scenes, and a tour of the actual Ripper murder sites with the Hughes brothers. "From Hell" makes a strong case for the identity of the Ripper as an heir to the British throne but it is at odds with the recent and equally compelling conclusions by crimewriter Patricia Cornwell.  Whoever the Ripper was, he was never brought to justice while he was alive.</p></body></html>

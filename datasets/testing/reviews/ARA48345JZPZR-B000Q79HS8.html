<meta name="summary" content="Re-Bourne"></head><body><p>Just to add my two cents, I agree with the criticism of so many regarding the over-use of the shakey handi-cam.  It was especially disconcerting in the theatre with the wildly cut chase at the end.  The DVD is somewhat more comprehensible.<br /><br />That aside, I give the film high marks for an interesting story in a tight script that deepens the Jason Bourne story a bit more and for the fast pace that held my interest throughout.  The movie didn't drag and made its points quickly and persuasively.<br /><br />Furthermore, I like the film a great deal because of Matt Damon, who is fully inhabiting the character of Jason Bourne, the superbly trained and ruthlessly efficient assassin.  Looking very fit and every inch a guy that could go on auto-pilot while he kicks your ay, Damon conveys the dual nature of a man that is troubled by his lethal past and yet is fully capable of employing his skills when necessary.<br /><br />While everyone fusses around about the next James Bond, I couldn't help but think this movie Jason Bourne is a lot closer to Ian Fleming's coldly able agent with the license to kill.<br /><br />In short, I hope we haven't seen the last of Damon as Bourne.  I liked the characters played by Karen Allen and Julia Stiles and wouldn't mind seeing them in future outings as well.<br /><br />And, finally, in the next one, whoever directs please note that the camera can jump around sometimes, just not ALL the time.</p></body></html>

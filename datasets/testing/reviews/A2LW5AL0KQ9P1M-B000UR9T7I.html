<meta name="summary" content="This could be a REALLY polarizing film ..."></head><body><p>Comic-book fans will have little trouble following the unusually large cast of characters (and their entanglements); nonetheless, fans of the films alone may find themselves a little overwhelmed: Mary Jane Watson v. Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker v. Eddie Brock, Spidey v. Venom, Spidey v. Sandman, Spidey v. New Goblin. The uninitiated may need to bring a notepad! Likewise, comic-book fans will not mind the "uncomfortable" tension (in fact, many will enjoy it), but fans of the films alone might find it nearly unbearable. Now, Raimi tries to inject humor to deflate the film's tension, but it frequently leaves the viewer (even fans of the comic-book) more perplexed than amused. For example: it is really bizarre to see Venom's "emo" affect on Spidey ... his black eyeliner, black sweeping hair, and black dress shirts ... like he just fell out of a "Panic! at the Disco" video. Certainly, comic-book enthusiasts are familiar with this this "dark side" trope (like red kryptonite's effect on Superman), I personally wish it was done with a little more finesse (something that might stand the "test of time").<br /><br />Now for some points on which we all may agree (maybe!) Christopher Young's compositions undermine Raimi's intent. Dramatic battles are completely undercut by his decidedly undramatic score. On a positive note: the acting has remained fairly faithful to the previous two films. Maguire does the best he can with the whiplash script, Franco succeeds in his complex role, and Dunst does a perfectly adequate job. Of course, J.K. Simmons and Ted Raimi rock ... and Bruce Campbell shines (what else would we expect?!) And, needless to say, it is always great to see Stan Lee!!<br /><br />Some will find that the conclusion is a little too "clean" (I, for one, agree with that assertion). Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that comic-book fans expect this ending ... it is faithful to its conventions.<br /><br />Like many of the reviewers here, I was relieved when the credits appeared. It felt about an hour too long, relied too heavily on awkward battle-scenes, failed to develop characters, and "took the easy way out." And yes, IMDB has Spiderman IV slated for 2009 ... so let's hope Raimi returns to simpler, more intimate plots (if he elects to sign-on for the project!!)<br /><br />If you're are a fan of the comic-book (or even just the films), see it!! Then return here and weigh-in on the debate!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I'm sure the India Tourism Board hated this"></head><body><p>"Slumdog Millionaire" portrays the India that we were always told about as kids in the US - crowded and chaotic beyond belief, chock full of nothing but poverty and violence, filthy and disease-ridden, and full of people who wanted nothing more than to steal everything you had if you looked away for even a moment.  This is a portrayal of India at odds with the modern image in every way.  Having never visited, I couldn't tell you which is correct.  But it sure puts you off of any thoughts you ever had about going to the Taj Majal or anywhere else in the country.<br /><br />The majority of this movie is a oft-distressing downer, unrelenting in its grimness.  Nevertheless, the first part of the film starts to become unintentionally funny after a while.  As in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," whatever our hero does, things always get worse for him, and you can count on a calamity whenever he starts to become comfortable or happy.  The ending is indeed uplifting and a Triumph of the Human Spirit, but it's ultimately too little, too late.<br /><br />So what's good about the film?  The performances are fantastic across the board, and we really buy into the characters.  The cinematography is colorful and spectacular.  You can always count on Boyle for great photography, whether in his best films like "28 Days Later" or his worst, "Sunshine."  And, "Slumdog Millionaire" is interesting, even if depressing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good-time Friday night movie, this is not what you want, despite how it was marketed.  Nevertheless, it's at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

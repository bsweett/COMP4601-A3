<meta name="summary" content="Worthy Entry in the Series"></head><body><p>Terminator 3 lacks the inventiveness of T1 and the style and panache of T2; however, T3 is ultimately a very gratifying entry in the series.  The movie opens as a sexy female Terminator (Terminatrix) arrives from the future and begins systematically eliminating people (much of it off-camera - the movie is not especially gory).  As with the shape-shifter from T2, the Terminatrix has some ingenious new features.  Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as John Connor, now age 20.  He's been on the move since T2 and the subsequent death of his mother, never staying in one place or developing relationships.  He and Claire Danes become entangled and gradually we begin to understand her involvement.  Of course, Arnold arrives along the way - what would a Terminator movie be without him?  <p>The plot is clever and filled with humor, much of it courtesy of Arnold's quips.  There are also some excellent stunts, particularly a chase scene involving a crane that seems to destroy much of LA.  T3 is much more straight-forward and brisk than T2.  In a strange way, the movie is a *comfortable* action film; we know what to expect from the series and it delivers.  The ending is also satisfying while also clearly leaving the door open for T4.  Overall, it's a solid action movie.</p></body></html>

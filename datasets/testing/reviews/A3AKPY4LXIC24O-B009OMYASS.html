<meta name="summary" content="Feeling Hostile Toward Hostel"></head><body><p>I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since hearing about its nasty little premise.  The idea of paying money to torture and kill with impunity is creepy beyond all human comprehension.  Sadly the film doesn't deliver enough shocks or squirms to pay off my high expectations.  Like Saw, Hostel tries to ride far too long on the messed up factor and lacks the cohesion required to, well, keep it together.<br /><br />Whether this is a reflection on society at large or my own jaded mentality toward onscreen horror, Hostel fails to provide that much needed jolt to the genre.  By all accounts this movie should have been great.  It's about one hundred fifty times better than Cabin Fever, which so many people seemed to love, so there's a plus.  Eli Roth seems to be getting the hang of the directing thing.  However, there are too many scenes where torture is happening and the imagery is left to the imagination.  This is a movie, we're supposed to see what's happening.<br /><br />So what exactly is my gripe here?  Hostel just isn't vicious enough.  That's right, for some reason Roth and Co. seemed to have held back on what was promised to the audience.  Not once do you forget that the people on the screen are just acting, which is necessary for the suspension of disbelief.  Finally, the truly disappointing bit, the gore is presented more as background than as the proper effusion of bodily fluids. Not that there isn't gore to be found, it's just not anything to tell the kids about.<br /><br />I imagine there will be an unrated director's cut with some tag line like "Too Gruesome for Theaters" or "Here's the Real Movie Folks" and if that happens I'll give Hostel another whirl.  Honestly, if Quentin Tarantino sees promise in the work of Eli Roth that's reason enough for me to follow the guy's career.  If there's a geometric progression to his growth as a director the man could bring the Horror genre something great. In the future.  Not entitled Hostel.<br /><br />Still, this is a solid attempt at brutal Horror, and for that it deserves one handed applause.  Recent amputees don't have the state of mind or the hardware for full fledged applause. Blame the blood loss.</p></body></html>

I lying in bed with a bad cold, and figured--What the heck, it's a scary movie and Nicole Kidman is in it. Might be ok.<p>By the time THE OTHERS was over, I was bolt upright in bed and feeling the chills, not from my cold but from a perfectly crafted ghost movie. I hadn't felt so absorbed and horrified (in a good sense) since I'd read Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS or James' TURN OF THE SCREW. And I think it's for the same reason a previous reviewer had mentioned: this movie has the feel of a 19th century ghost story and not a 20th century horror story. Not a single drop of blood is spilled. No skeletal or decaying corpse-like spectre threatening violence prowling around here. These &quot;others&quot;--from the other side of life--are an unknowable entity. Nicole Kidman's character is terrified by what the others don't tell her about themselves (once she believes they exist). She doesn't know what they want, and the perceived consequences of that are what fuel the second half of the film. This, combined with the fact that her children have been in touch with the others, yet they can only tell her mother so much, keeps her frustration and vigilance at fever pitch.<p>The gloomy setting, the inscrutible domestic staff, and the constant bickering of the children all add to the suspense. <p>This is an example of quality horror film making. It's the situation, the acting, the lighting, and of course a story with substance that keep it going. This is a profoundly moving ghost story with great performances.</p></body></html>

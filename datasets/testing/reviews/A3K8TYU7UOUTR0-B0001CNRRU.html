<meta name="summary" content="A seminar in great acting"></head><body><p>If you are a young actor, or just love a well acted movie, you must check this film out. I cannot recall a movie were there were so many standout performances. As always, Sean Penn displays his usual nearly supernatural talent. Penn can do more with his eyes and expression than any actor I can think of, and his capacity for effective understatement is unparalleled. He can simply move the viewer wherever he wishes them to go effortlessly, and he is always a marvel to watch. Benicio Del Toro is tremendous as well, doing what he does best - bringing to life a certain tortured repression that always seems to brood a little too quietly behind his burning eyes. <p>For me, however, the delight came from watching the women, Naomi Watts as the grieving widow who serves as a catalyst in the films' intertwined lives; and Charlotte Gainsbourg as the wife of an ex-con, desperately trying to hold her life together. Naomi Watts is asked to carry a great deal of weight in this picture, and her raw pain and emotion really had me twisting in my seat in sympathy. She actually accomplished that rare feat that happens so seldom in movies: Her pain and grief didn't seem like acting at all - it seemed rather that cameras just happened to rolling while some terrible event was happening. She was absolutely amazing.  My favorite piece of work, however, came from Charlotte Gainsbourg. With all the bigger names doing such great work around her, it is an easy role to overlook. Do yourself a favor and watch this woman take command of her role. Her portrayal of the ex-cons' wife, struggling to keep what little she has managed to salvage out of the world together, is simply heartbreaking. I wish Hollywood used more actresses like her. Ms. Gainsbourg is not a fashion model, nor is she beautiful in a high-cheekbone, pouty-lipped way. She is, instead, beautiful to watch because of her talent. <p>To tell you the truth, this type of character-based, dialogue-driven drama is not my usual meat. I like a good crime or action picture, big-Hollywood style. But when acting talent as displayed in this film comes to the table, one cannot help but pay attention. -Mykal Banta</p></body></html>

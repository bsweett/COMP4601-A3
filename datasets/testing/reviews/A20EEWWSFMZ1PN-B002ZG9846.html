<meta name="summary" content="A fun time is had by all"></head><body><p>A young man, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) notices that there are no real super heroes and wonders why more people do not try. Therefore, he orders himself a standard superhero suit becoming Kick-Ass and is carried away in his fantasy.  He barely escapes the first hero attempt and to satisfy the girl of his dreams, asks for more.  He is in over his head and as luck would have, he is spared his fate by the intervention of a real superhero, Hit-Girl (Chlo? Grace Moretz) and her Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I never read the comic. I am sure that there is the standard mix of people that like or dislike the differences. However, this film can stand on its own as fun entertainment.  I especially like the nonchalant attitude of the Mindy Macready character as she casually dispatches bad guys and evil doers.<br /><br />This is well suited for the Blu-ray experience.<br /><br />Be sure to look at the DVD extras. In one of the documentaries, they note that hit girl is dressed in a standard student uniform. Until I saw this documentary, I never thought of the fact that it was not meant to be sexy but imply that she was a poor lost child. Yet now when I look back at it I can see how it could be misinterpreted. Look for yourself and see what you think.</p></body></html>

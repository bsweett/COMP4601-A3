Without the digital do-funnies and CGI visual effects, the original stands on the weight of actors' performances, skillful direction, and well-managed physical design.  Apparently other reviewers disagree with me, but I think the 1977 film looks both remarkably current and surprisingly good.<br /><br />When the Special Edition appeared in 1997, I remember thinking Mos Eisley looked remarkably crowded and busy.  Looking back on it now, I see why: because in the original, the streets stand empty.  This is a city where heat, poverty, and neglect boil over in a cauldron of desperation, just waiting for one half-cocked stormtrooper to set things on fire.  The revised version looks as busy as a college campus.<br /><br />In the best Hitchcock style, Lucas' subtle direction cuts around several times so you never notice you didn't see blasters go off, or lightsabers extend.  Lacking high-tech gadgets, Lucas uses ingenuity and human insight to make this film, and it's visible in the finished product.  He really sells that Tunisia and Guatemala are alien planets, or that sets built in airplane hangars actually are as big as a "small moon."<br /><br />That's not to forgive Lucasfilm for the shoddy transfer to DVD.  The 1977 version is very low-res, only slightly cleaner than my old VHS tape.  Nothing I've said should suggest that the original film surpasses the Special Edition.  The 1997 version has more smoothly integrated visual effects, more dynamic creatures, crisper colors, and cleaner sound.  But in a genre that notoriously doesn't age well, the original film looks remarkably new.</p></body></html>

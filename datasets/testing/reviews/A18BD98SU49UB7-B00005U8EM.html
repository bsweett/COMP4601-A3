The question is raised, &quot;What if you had a second chance.&quot; To make things right, to clear your conscience, or even to say I love you. But, what if you were given not only one chance, but three then four. Slightly drastic? <p>What if you lived every day over and over again until you had achieved the mission of that day. Confusing? (I always say that when I get jumbled.) Well, don't be confused. If I was in the position to relive my life, knowing what I know now, by jove I think I would be a tad more towards the bright side. (As Monty said) It is true that this is a comedy, because you wonder as time goes by, &quot;When will it all end!&quot; <p>The character Murray plays is a perfect one for him. Someone who thinks they have it all together, then when they take a second look, then a fourth, realizes he is really more in the dark than he ever expected. But there is a deeper, and very serious side to the story (As there should be in atleast one out of ten comedies)...when you love someone, and don't tell them, what is the result? <p>Time after time He bumfundles his days trying to learn the every waking fact about the girl he's fallen in love with. I liked this stuff, and if you ever wondered what the same day twice looks like, see this baby. (Plus, if you have the kinda crush I have on Andie Macdowell {next to her being Geena Davis} then your gonna like it.) 5 stars for good questions, answers and a great story...<p>The idea of Groundhog's Day is an excellent one.

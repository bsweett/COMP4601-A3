<meta name="summary" content="Great 1977 Original"></head><body><p>This is the great original Star Wars, the 1977 movie in which the world first discovered the allure of The Force and the Jedi Knights. Young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Jedi veteran Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to rescue the gorgeous Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the sinister clutches of Darth Vader and the evil empire.<br />High space adventure, with creatures like Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the delightful R2-D2  (Kenny Baker).<br />With the final Star Wars (but will it be the final?) set for release later this year , the original trilogy is a great buy to refresh your memory.<p>A momentous battle between good and evil. With the empire perhaps at the time representing the evil Soviet Empire, which the free world was then fighting against for freedom in 1977. It has that wonderful 1970&#65533;s feel, and who would not want to rescue the sexy huggable Princess Leia.<br />In my opinion this great original one is the best of the lot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="28 Weeks Later doesn't dissapoint"></head><body><p>When I heard there would be a sequel to 28 Days Later sans Danny Boyle I was deeply dissapointed.  For one, a sequel to suck a great film just seemed to be a cheap cash in on the successful low budget first film.  For two, the talent was gone.  The first one had such a good conclusion, that a sequel seemed like it would just sully the original's story.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later doesn't fall victim to the folly of most sequels, however.  It also doesn't follow standard horror formula, as per the first film.  It's frightening, yes, but this is a film hardly chock full of idiotic one dimensional characters.  At the center is a family - part of one anyway.  Two children just return to see their father after mainland England has been all but wiped out by the rage virus.  They believe their mom is dead and soon discover she is still alive, with infection but without the symptoms.  The tension within the family sets off a series of events that allow the rage to take over once more.<br /><br />What makes the film successful is that this is not just a cheapened version of the first. It has first rate characters played by first rate actors.  Most notable is Robert Carlyle, as the father who's fear, regret, and lies lead to the virus being unleashed again.  One one side, we're feeling sorry for him, but also want to condemn his actions.  The children are the real central characters as we follow them through the film trying to survive. The actors are incredibly believable in their roles, with the characters continually making more realistic choices than you'd see in a standard horror film.<br /><br />Largely absent from this film that was in the first are the grander themes that made the first film so great.  There are still some rather intelligent observations on how the government reacts to the outbreak, where the military is seen taking all lives, including civilians.  Throughout the film, we are questioning their tactics and morality.<br /><br />The only dissapointment falls in probably the last few minutes of the film.  They obviously intend to spin this off into a franchise, but the last moments of the film make me feel like they may ruin what they have by creating run of the mill zombie pics.  However, it's only a few minutes we're talking about.  The rest of the film is dazzling, down to the attention taken to effects, music, and ambience.  It may turn out to be the next 'Living Dead' type horror franchise, continually pleasing.</p></body></html>

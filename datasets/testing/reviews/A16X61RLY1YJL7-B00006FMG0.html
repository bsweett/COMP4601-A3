<meta name="summary" content="Road to Perdition - A &quot;fairly&quot; decent film!"></head><body><p>I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting when I chose to watch this movie, other than what is normally an excellent performance by Tom Hanks, which he did deliver, as usual, in what is an extremely atypical type of role for him.  Rarely will you see Tom Hanks play one of the &quot;bad&quot; guys, but in the end, he's a bad guy who loves his family.  Overall though, this film just doesn't live up to its potential, failing to grab the viewer and compel you to the character or characters.  Yes, you do feel for the character and the losses he must endure, but it's just not a compelling story.<p>As is usual for Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, they both deliver exceptional performances, despite a weak story.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's role in the film is so minor as to hardly be noticed.  Jude Law delivers a very good performance in this film, which is par for the course for him.  Tyler Hoechlin's performance is quite admirable for a young actor.<p>Highly acclaimed &quot;American Beauty&quot; director, Sam Mendes led the reigns on this film and sets a beautiful tone for the film, which is thematically rich with the exception of the story itself which I found lacking.  The score for the film is &quot;dead on&quot; for the film.<p>The premise:<p>Tom Hanks stars as Mike Sullivan, devoted family man with his wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two children Mike Jr. and Peter.  Along with being the devoted family man, Mike Sullivan is an Irish mafia hit man whose family, led by John Rooney (Paul Newman) has very close ties to Al Capone.<p>One evening, young Mike Jr. decides that he &quot;must&quot; find out what his father actually does for a living so he stows away in the trunk of his father's car.  On that rainy night, he finds out in the worse way what his father does as he watches him and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig) murder three men.  He's so shocked by what he's just seen he makes a noise and his father quickly finds him.<p>As much as his father tries to tell him everything is going to be okay and to forget about what he's seen, Conner Rooney isn't going to let them just forget about and orders Mike Sullivan murdered and sees to killing his wife and children himself.  Fortunately for Mike Jr. he's not at home when Conner Rooney murders his mother and brother.<p>What follows from there is a &quot;generally&quot; entertaining but rarely captivating story as Mike Sullivan and his son are attempting to allude Maguire (Jude Law) whose been sent to kill them and at the same time, find a way to get to Conner Rooney to avenge the death of his wife and youngest son.<p>I would recommend this movie as a rental.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>- Deleted Scenes<br />- HBO's &quot;Making of&quot; Documentary<br />- Feature Commentary with Director Sam Mendes<br />- Production Notes<br />- Photo Gallery</p></body></html>

Does the mix sound right? Oh...how unoriginal. I wish I knew that the movie was going to be nearly three hours long before I rented the flick. Had I knew, I wouldn't have been interested in seeing the movie until five years later. The fact that Ridley Scott directed the film makes it all worse. At least I was hoping for a good Denzel Washington performance. Nope...I didn't get that. All he did was look and walk around. Or in other words, Denzel was Denzel. The story was all derivative and completely uninteresting, as if the plot was done million times over. So, what else new can be offered through American Gangster? Pretty much...nothing. Josh Brolin does his best to look like Razor Ramon. In a particular scene, I thought one guy looked extremely familiar until I figured it out that this cop was the serial killer from Silence of the Lambs. Mighty interesting, is it? Every time a subplot develops, it gets discarded right away. Say for an example, Cuba Gooding's character disrespects the black don loser, so as a follow-through, I was expecting the black don loser to give him a b***h slap, pour kerosene on his body, light him on fire, and shoot him about hundred of times just to make sure he feels it. Of course, the director felt it unimportant and moved on. It's hard for me to think of suggestions to improve American Gangster, but it's a lot easier to say that the movie shouldn't have been made in the first place since it glorifies the black don loser as a Jesus Christ figure or perhaps simply as noble as Denzel Washington. At the same time, I am not forgetting that this loser killed thousands of people, white or of his color, through his "brand name." In short, American Gangster is boring, uninteresting, too long, and a huge waste of time. Wondering that I didn't make a mention of Russell Crowe yet? He sucks, that's why.</p></body></html>

Marriage is just another obstacle to get around.  See, if you've got a dream, and your spouse stands in the way (for example by suggesting that you pay some attention to her and help provide for your progeny), it's totally okay to dump her and latch on to someone more exciting, someone who believes in you.  Everything will be considered your wife's fault for having opposed your dream in the first place.<br /><br />(Johnny and Vivian's daughter, Rosanne Cash, was reportedly furious over this movie, claiming that her mother actually encouraged her father's music playing, the complete opposite of what is portrayed in the film.)<br /><br />Is it just me?  Has adultery and dishonoring one's marriage vows gone so completely out of fashion that filmmakers will portray a man callously ditching his wife and family, and yet not even seem aware of what they're showing?  The whole emphasis in this film was on how Johnny's spirit "needed to be free" so he could make his wonderful music.  Not a whiff of (or even a consciousness of) the moral problems presented by such behavior.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just getting older, but I'm getting sick of this crud.  And I've been noticing more and more of it.  Next time I see a movie doing this, I'm just gonna shut it clean off.  Those who toss their wives to chase their muses have nothing to say to me.</p></body></html>

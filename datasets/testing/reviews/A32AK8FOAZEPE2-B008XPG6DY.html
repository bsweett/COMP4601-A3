<meta name="summary" content="a so-so movie adapted from a so-so novel"></head><body><p>and this kinda story were told maybe hundred times. the screenplay is okay, the casting is a bit bad, jennifer anison was a very bad casting, not a bit attractive enough to make the guy sidetrack to have an affair with her, because she looked almost the same and similar type of this guy's wife. if you want us to believe that the husband would commit an outside marital affair, that woman you'd like to have an affair with should be at least look quite different from your wife, the looks, the personality, the chamistry..., there's not even one bit of possibility that this guy would and could fall for such woman played by anison. a very very bad casting job here.<br /><br />clive owen was also a not so good choice playing this role. his whole attire, attitude, body language didn't look like a successful corporate executive at all, but a struggling, uninsured, hesitant, shabby-look downstairs guy. his martin landau+woody allen's lame duck stoop, haunched walking stature was even worse in this movie.<br /><br />the whole script was a bit far-fetched too. the wife role was also too weak, the husband-wife, daughter-father interpretations were also too weak to look real enough but cardboard-like, although these shortcomings could only be originated and copied mindlessly from the original mediocre novel. another proof that hollywood is drained from good movie ideas but could only desperately grab from ready made novels, no matter good, bad, or ugly, or how mediocre it might be.</p></body></html>

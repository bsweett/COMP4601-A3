<meta name="summary" content="Fun film"></head><body><p>I will say this - the books top the films hands-down, but that does not mean the movies are bad. Special effects are nice, and despite the differences between movie and book, this is still a good movie. Not everyone is going to love it, but I found it an enjoyable film, and the actor who played Caspian did a nice job. I also liked the scene in the beginning that explained why Miraz wanted Caspian dead, it offered a bit more depth than the one in the book.</p></body></html>

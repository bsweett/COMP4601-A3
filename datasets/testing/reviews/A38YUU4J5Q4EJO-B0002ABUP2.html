<meta name="summary" content="Not a "Cookie cutter" Remake."></head><body><p>This movie was excellent! And I love the fact that although a remake, they didn't follow the original scene for scene, like so many other remakes do.<br /><br />for starters, You just gotta love CJ, Steve, Mekhi Phifer, and the rest.<br />I also like the fact that there were MORE characters than the 4 in the original.<br />I LOVED the humor too- " The fat chick at Dairy Queen-DEAD!"..and CJ always saying "F*ckin Nursery School!"-Steve and CJ just crack you UP !<br /><br /> The only thing I really didn't care for was the running zombies, Zombies just seem more MENACING when they move<br />s-l-o-w-l-y, like in the original.<br /><br />We also don't see as much of the mall as we did in the first,and that was one of the things I found so intriguing...Living in the mall.All in all the storyline in many ways is better than the original,although I liked the original as a whole better.<br /><br />Andy across the way in the gun shop was a nice add on too.And thier escape plan, too was SOOOO cool !  .... Just an AWESOME remake that DON'T dissapoint! I REALLY wish they would make a part two, also.<br /><br />I really hated the very end where we assume they got eaten..they could fix it so they get away, and do a take off from there...I would just really love to see a 2nd part to this,the possibilities are so endless.Anyway, This movie RULES, and is a MUST for any collection!!!!!</p></body></html>

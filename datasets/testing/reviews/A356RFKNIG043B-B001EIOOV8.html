<meta name="summary" content="Classic Vegas film; barebones dvd with excellent transfer"></head><body><p>4.6 stars<br /><br />One of Scorsese's best, Casino is a classic due not only to his tight direction and a great script from Pileggi (based on his book), but DeNiro and Pesci at their best, and the only really good performance I've ever seen from Stone.<br /><br />Based on real-life mobsters Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro, Casino gets a little ways beneath the glittering surface of Vegas to show some of what was going on with the (wise)guys who used to run the show there. DeNiro is pretty much perfect and Pesci likewise, though I'm guessing from the books I've read on Tony the Ant that he was not quite as pleasant as he's depicted here. Sharon Stone is the big surprise, though, as she's as good at being Ginger as she could possibly be. Perhaps the role is just typecasting; in any case, she nails it, and every guy she can on the way. But it's DeNiro who looms over all, not just in the story but in the talent department.<br /><br />Someone once wrote that Bob isn't a great actor, as he "just plays the same New York ahole in every movie". I don't know about that, but he certainly defines this character with much precision, and makes him rather likeable, no mean feat. While not quite up to the level of Travis Bickle or Jake LaMotta or the early Vito Corleone, this is easily one of DeNiro's best roles and Casino is worth watching just for him. James Woods is a dead-on sleazeball, Frank Vincent plays to a T the exact same role he has in almost everything he's ever done (the strong, silent wiseguy always walking a few steps behind the Boss), and it's funny to see Oscar Goodman doing in a movie what he did for decades the in real life: defending mobsters in Vegas court. Before he became the Mayor of Vegas, that is. I wonder how he got that job...<br /><br />Add in a funny, sharp script, superb camerawork with all the garish oranges and other hues that were Vegas in the 70s/80s, and good turns by almost every actor in the film, and you've got a near-perfect film. It's perhaps a little long at almost three hours, but drags very little. In some ways you're sad to see Casino end, even after five viewings. The new dvd transfer is pretty much perfect, with all the bright tones intact and nice deep blacks. No special features to speak of, but that's now standard: make the suckers buy the blu-ray, even if the old dvd had plenty of extras!<br /><br />Casino is based on a true story, but reverts to fiction when discussing how the Mob was run out of Vegas. Yes, they just picked up and left their billion-plus dollar a year cash cow when asked to, and Steve Wynn and other guys who had access to billions to build the new super-casinos moved in. Casino says it was "junk bonds" that financed the New Vegas. Don't tell that to all the reporters and authors who've linked Wynn and other new bosses to various crime families, but then again we're certainly due for a movie about the New Vegas, and who better than Scorsese to front, er, direct it?<br /><br />What say, Marty? How about a rags to riches tale of little Stevie Wynn, who can snatch a billion dollars out of thin air and build some of the most lavish buildings in the world? It's got "Jackpot!" written all over it.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Casino, check it out. It's a truly fine film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Entirely Unusual"></head><body><p>A good enough crime saga with some great one-liners and several sharp twists and turns, but not something I'd revere alongside the all-timers. I felt like there was too much reliance on name dropping and intentional complications, which I guess fits in with the big twist at the very end, but that doesn't suddenly make it excusable. Tough to follow at many times, with some interesting storytelling experiments along the way; it's a good-to-very good story that often gets too caught up in itself.</p></body></html>

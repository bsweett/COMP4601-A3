<meta name="summary" content="Worth waiting for"></head><body><p>I have just seen Kill Bill vol.2, on an IMAX screen, an hour ago, and it was perfect. It did not let me down, because I loved the first one, and this was just as good.<p>The story that began in Vol 1, comes to a close, as the Bride ( they reveal her name in this movie) is seen more as a person, a mother and most of all, a human being, rather than a killing machine. <p>She gets to come face to face with Elle Driver, Bud, and Bill.<br />We get to learn of her past, of how she became this great warrior, her studies of martial arts with Pai-Mei, and we see how her jurney ends. Each fight and encounter of how she faces these characters is briliant in it's own way.<p>There were moments where I though " how on Earth will she get out of this blunder" and then there are some great conversatins she has with the people she came to kill. There was a bit less fighting, and more talking than in the first one. But all the action sequences were awesome. The one with Elle in teh trailer was great! Dont want to spoil it, but it's eye grabbing!<p>Overall, it was a beautiful movie, with views of the El Paso, desserts, and a hot climate. The music was amazing as well. A  lot of Ennio Morricone goosbump producing melodies. I think of it more as Vol 1 and Vol 2 as being a perfect one movie all in its own, and I think the Kill Bill saga, has became my favorite movie of all time. I love them.<p>This film gave me and the Bride closure.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Predator - One of the best action movies ever made!"></head><body><p>&quot;Predator&quot; can easily be counted among the top action movies of the eighties and can unquestionably be counted among the top Arnold Schwarzenegger movies!  This movie is quite simply, a pure action packed thriller that sets a level of intensity that few movies in the genre can match.  The action coupled with the superior score will definitely leave a first time viewer astonished at what they're watching.  For fans of this film, it is one of those that can be watched over and over and enjoyed every time, making the nominal price for this DVD inconsequential.<p>One of the elements of this film that makes it such the powerhouse that it is was the performance given by the testosterone laden cast.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is brilliant in the leading role.  For him, it was the perfect role; little dialogue, lots of action, what else did he need.  The supporting cast is almost legendary for the industry; from the &quot;other&quot; governor, Jesse Ventura to Carl Weathers, all of the exceptional actors performed brilliantly.<p>Director John McTiernan did an absolutely perfect job with this movie.  Considering the phenomenal movies he's made in his career, it's easy to see why he was picked to direct them as his approach to making a movie is clearly quite appealing to moviegoers!  The job that Alan Silvestri did with the music for this movie should've won him an Oscar if it didn't.  I'd almost venture to say that despite the script and the stars, this movie might not have been as big as it was had the music for every second of the movie not been the perfect match that it was.<p>The Premise:<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch who appears to be a Major in the US Army and the commanding officer of an HRT (Hostage Rescue Team) that is called in to a Central American country under false pretenses to rescue some dignitaries.  Along for the ride is Carl Weathers in the role of Dillon, a former soldier that had served with Dutch but he now works for the &quot;agency.&quot;  It doesn't take long for the action to kick in as Dutch and his team soon find another team that &quot;bought it&quot; in a very odd way and not long thereafter, Dutch and his team soon find themselves dealing with something no one has ever had to deal with before...<p>I highly recommend this DVD version of &quot;Predator&quot; to any and all who are fans of the action genre, whether you've seen this film or not, this DVD is extremely well worth the nominal cost.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>This DVD is all about the movie and the only special feature available is the Original Theatrical Trailer.</p></body></html>

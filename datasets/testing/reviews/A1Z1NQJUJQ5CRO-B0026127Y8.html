straight up,no chasers,then Taken,released in Feb.2008 and put onto DVD in /09,is THE film for you.Once the action starts,it's a hold-onto-your-seats thrill ride that never lets up.<br />The plot is pretty straightforward.An ex CIA special agent Bryan Mills is attending his daughter's birthday party.From the get go Mills we see is meticulous in his personal habits,all stemming from his background training.His CIA days are behind him but he still keeps in touch with some of his former close associates.His daughter Kim's(Maggie Grace)mother Lenore(Famke Janssen) has remarried and Bryan's relationship with her is quite strained.When Mills meets with his daughter and ex for lunch,Kim asks for his permission to go to Paris with her girlfriend.He is reluctant and he thinks about it.He eventually comes around and Kim is away,with a few stipulations her dad has made on her.<br />The two arrive in Paris and head for their rented flat.On the way they meet a nice looking young man who they arrange to attend a party with later on.While the two are unpacking some unknown men enter the apartment and Kim's friend is taken away in a big struggle.Kim has been talking on the phone with her dad and she describes to him in detail what is taking place.Frightened and barely hanging on, all due to her dad's calm demeanor/training,she hides in an adjacent bedroom under a bed.He tells her she will be taken but to leave the phone open as long as she can and,most importantly,he will come for her.<br />Kim is dragged away as Mills listens.Springing into action he contacts not only her mother but his old associates who offer some technical skills in obtaining background info on the kidnappers.Mills only positive lead is that he has heard the sound of one of the kidnappers.He flies to Paris and clandestinely enters the girls apartment.He tenders the help of an old Paris police detective which leads him nowhere.From the memory card of his daughters smashed telephone he garners a picture of one of her kidnappers.He tracks him down at the airport and just when it seems he has eluded Mills he gets killed by a passing truck.<br />Mills knows that an Albanian gang,specializing in human trafficking,is the group responsible for taking his daughter.This leads him to a construction site which also houses a brothel run by the gang.He puts a temporary stop to the place by almost completely demolishing the operation but in the process gets a lead in the form of a heavily drugged girl who has his daughters jacket.He takes her to a motel and dries her out and gets the address of the place Kim might be at.He poses as a French policeman there to renegotiate his "fee" to keep quiet about their operations and enters the den of the Albanian traffickers.While there he fingers the man whose voice he heard briefly on the phone and after some further"negotiations", leaves with his man.<br />Using some plain old fashioned torture,he gleans the info that his daughter is now in the hands of a wealthy Parisian socialite who specializes in the sale of human flesh.Mills attends that function and poses as a waiter serving champagne.While in the small room with a buyer he finally sees his daughter,which he forces the buyer to obtain.While leaving the room to get his daughter(with the buyer in tow)the security there gets the best of him and his is held downstairs to be executed.Before they can do him in he is able to get free and turn the tables.He rushes out after his daughter who is now aboard a yacht owned by a wealthy Sheik.Through a car ride to beat all car rides he tries to catch up to the boat and eventually is able to jump aboard and overcome most of the security with all the usual lightening fast moves he has so far displayed throughout the film.He finally comes face to face with the Sheik holding his daughter at knife point.At the very moment the Sheik is about to negotiate with Mills,Mills shoots him dead with precision aim.<br />Daughter Kim safely back in his arms,they both fly home.<br />Famed French writer,director Luc Besson(The Fifth Element)uses a deft hand in his control here.The editing is top notch;no filler and all meat.The action once it starts,is breathtaking to watch as Mills' former "training"/"special skills" are something to behold indeed.Neeson is right in the zone throughout which adds that much more to the believability and intensity of the proceedings.The supporting cast is great and the stunt work wonderful.<br />Technically is the film has been transferred onto DVD in its original 2:40:1 a/r,and is clear and crisp.This version has both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film.There is commentary,the trailer and a making of featurette.There is however something the buyer should be aware of and it is in the making of the DVD itself.There is a scene where Mills enters the Albanians lair(behind the red door).He presents a card to one of the kidnappers.At that moment there seems to be a layer change and the film briefly stops ans starts.This is a common thing but here the sound actually goes out of sync with the actions/mouths on screen.I have checked this on a couple of players and it does it on both.It's a manufacturers glitch and should have been taken care of but of course these things never are unless the release is successful enough to warrant a future re-release.Gotta love this industry don't you?<br />All in all a top notch effort by all involved.Neeson is the intense protagonist who you just KNOW is going to get his man,or in this case his daughter.We know the ending before it really gets going but the trick is to sit back and enjoy the ride,and what a ride it is.4 1/2 stars,recommended viewing.</p></body></html>

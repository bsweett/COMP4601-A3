Those who hate it find the film cloying, overly sappy and contrived and those who love it find it a joyous celebration of love, triumph and wholesomeness.  I think that movie falls someone in between.  The film can be annoyingly sweet, but it is also that sweetness that gives the movie a na?ve charm.  Julie Andrews is perfectly cast as Maria and Christopher Plummer is charming as the patriarch of the von Trapp family of whom Maria becomes the matron.  The film is a tad long, but the film is perfect for family entertainment where kids will enjoy and most parents will also like it as well.  The film has become something of an institution still earning screenings in the theater in most major cities.  The film was, of course, a bog office bonanza in it original release and it faired quite well at the 1965 Academy Awards winning five Oscars including Best Picture and a second Best Director award for Robert Wise.</p></body></html>

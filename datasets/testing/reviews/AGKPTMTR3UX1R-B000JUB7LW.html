Very loosely based on actual events, THE LAST SAMURAI recounts the story of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, when the Samurai forced the last stand of traditional Japanese culture against the the modernizing influences of the Meiji Restoration.<br /><br />As part of his drive to bring Japan into the family of nations the Meiji Emperor hired literal armies of foreign advisors. In the film Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a survivor of Gettysburg who later served under Custer and fought Indians on the frontier. The brutalities he has seen have rendered Captain Algren a nightmare-ridden and viciously cynical drunkard. Recruited to go to Japan and train the modern Japanese Army by his despised former superior, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), Algren at first adopts the endemic sneering attitude toward the Samurai shared by the "modernizers". However, the more he hears of the Samurai, the more respect Algren begins to accord them, much to the disgust of his fellows.<br /><br />When his green army is forced into a premature engagement with the Samurai, Algren is captured and held prisoner by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is the true star of this film. His powerful but understated performance is electric, and Katsumoto's character expresses the best of the Bushido Code and of Japanese tradition. As Algren observes his enemies (and they observe him), hatred mellows into distrust, distrust mellows into acquiescence, acquiescence mellows into acceptance, acceptance becomes respect, and respect becomes liking, and then true friendship. Algren, the professional soldier, comes to see the Bushido Code and the disciplined lifestyle of his captors as the highest expression of his own art---the Art of War. When battle comes, Algren casts his lot with the Samurai.<br /><br />Although given a safe passage to Tokyo, Katsumoto is unable to sway the young and timid Meiji Emperor, his former student, who is as much a prisoner of the "modernizers" as Algren had been of the Samurai traditionalists. Hostilities flare again when Omura (Masato Harada) the chief of the "modernizers" tries to have Katsumoto assassinated. The Samurai withdraw into the mountains and prepare for the final battle. When it comes, the Samurai nearly overwhelm their opponents, but armed with cannons and gatling guns, the modern army is insurmountable. In the end, only Algren survives to bring Katsumoto's sword to the Emperor. Although Algren is spat upon by Omura, the Meiji Emperor is so moved by Katsumoto's reverence for the old ways that he orders Omura to commit seppuku. In the end, the cowardly Omura merely exiles himself.<br /><br />THE LAST SAMURAI had only a lukewarm reception in the United States. Some reviewers felt that the character of Captain Algren was of the "White Man's Burden" ilk, that the film was disrespectful of the American historical experience, and that the Samurai were overidealized. Much of this can be put down to a festering dislike of Cruise in the wake of his divorce from Nicole Kidman. However, the film was wildly successful in Japan, and many moviegoers left the theaters in tears, moved by the powerful depiction of traditional Japanese values in the character of Katsumoto and his fellow Samurai. While it is true that much of the Bushido Code was vastly oversimplified in the telling, the essence of Samurai values permeates the film, which, after all, is a form of entertainment, not a philosophical discussion.<br /><br />The "Extras" disc is an "Extras" disc. Once a pastiche of fascinating folderol, "Extras" discs have degenerated into a predictable melange of "The Making Of...", pointless commentaries, and deleted scenes we wish had stayed deleted. This one isn't much different, though it does have a nice "Hollywood vs. History" segment that discusses the real samurai, in truth largely a repressive and regressive elite that had outlived themselves in the 19th century. What might have been very interesting would have been a discussion of how the Bushido Code was institutionally perverted into racist militarism in the first half of the 20th century. The segment barely touches on that subject.<br /><br />A vast and sweeping epic in the vein of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226039">Spartacus</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB2">Lawrence of Arabia (Limited Edition)</a>, THE LAST SAMURAI is an engaging, respectful, and moving tale well worth watching many more times than once.</p></body></html>

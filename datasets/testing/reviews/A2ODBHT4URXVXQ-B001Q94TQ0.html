<meta name="summary" content="Superb, just superb"></head><body><p>Set in Colombia, Maria Full of Grace focuses on the choice an independent-minded pregnant teenager makes in order to escape a stifling home situation, a heading-no-where boyfriend situation, boredom, and lack of other opportunities. She agrees to be a mule, a drug runner, for lots and lots of money. The process of swallowing the large capsules is described in such detail that you nearly gag along with her as she struggles to get the hang of it, knowing she will die of a heroin overdose should one break.<br /><br />Turns out there are 4 female mules on her flight from Bogot&aacute; to NYC. Only 3 make it thru Customs, and only 2 survive to carry on with their lives.<br /><br />The lead role of Maria is played to perfection by Catalina Sandrino Moreno, an actress whose face conveys all her inner conflicted feelings with a bare minimum of movement.<br /><br />Very powerful film in every way.</p></body></html>

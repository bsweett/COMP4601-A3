<meta name="summary" content=""Alien" 1979"></head><body><p>I am usually not much into Sci-fi fiction or  Action oriented movies. When I first came across the movie 'Alien', I didn't have much expectations from the movie at all. I anticipated the movie to be just another cheap sci fi movie, but I was wrong. 'Alien' proved to be a very interesting movie. The best and unique part that makes this sci fi movie different than the other ones is the fact that there is mystery in the air all the time. Excellent performences by John Hurt, Veronica Catwright, Sigourney Weaver and almost every one. This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat and will keep you wondering what will happen next. Also proves, classics are classics afterall.</p></body></html>

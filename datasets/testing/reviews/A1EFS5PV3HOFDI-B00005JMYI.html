Rauncy, wild and completely out of control, it's nothing like Elf, nor half the innocent romance of Bewitched. Rather, Will Ferrell parades, struts and otherwise flaunts himself at the idea of being serious. Thought to be immature, this comedy can only be enjoyed if you are prepared not to sit down to a very intelligent and sophisticated movie. If you already know that, you're now ready to watch this movie.<br /><br />Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgandy, a anchorman who is insanely vain, and loved by the people.Its more of a boys club in the news room as his three other buddys Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd,Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and Champ Kind( David Koechner) do everything except blatantly make fun of the rest of their coworkers. All is fun and games until the boss hires Veronica Corningstone (Christine Applegate.) Its open war between the sexes, a war which becomes even more heated when the unfortunate Veronica finds herself the sole object of adorations from the infatuated Ron Burgandy. But love will have its speed bumps, and this perfect couple is no exception. What happens is comic magic.<br /><br />With Cameos from Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Danny Trejo, Jack Black, and Vince Vaugn there is no stopping the hilarity. If you love Will Ferrell, then I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A reflection of the past"></head><body><p>I bought the trilogy for 40 bucks.  Back to the Future epitomizes youthful vision of future possiblities; classic science fiction humor of spaceman from mars; a bridging of two generations where the younger generation realized the older generation had their own standards of hip and fair play; a friendship between a wacky wild eyed scientist and a protoge; a comic strip injection of sci -fi fun;  a cramed schedule of events not to be distrubed or changed; the protrayal that the past as more clean, stylish, and exciting; a fair amount of crudity and surprising range of liberty allowing Biff freedom to swear;  a mean social statement of rape or molestation by Biff as a betrayal of the social purity of the fifties; Biffs desire to take possession of Loren in all time periods; rule breaking convert undertakings yielding to smoking and drinking;  a reoccurring center focus on the year 1955; a emotionally charged music sound track;  tons of historical memorabila, names (Hepburn and Reagan), cars, songs (Mr Sandman); a insecure, ackward, greasy hair father who complancy and ackwardness is unsettling; a smashingly cool Toyota 4x4; a Jimmy Hendrix rendition of "Johnny be Good";  a lettermans jacket, sneakers, and a skate board;  a truck load of cow manure in Biffs car; a chess game with time;  a clock tower that needs funding in all times; three love stories: Marty, Doc, and Parents; and an ice cold Deloran.<p>The fifties introduced the beginnings of social rebellion by the youth.  Under the tight tumb of their parents teenages sought to break the rules: make out in the back of the convertible, sneaking the old womans liquor, and smoking in the park lot.  <p>The future include cyborg implants, social interactive computers, flying cars, and virtual reality interactions.  The past was neatly packaged and put on museum display.<p>The wild west was rugged individualism, bandits and outlaws, and hangings over 80 dollars.</p></body></html>

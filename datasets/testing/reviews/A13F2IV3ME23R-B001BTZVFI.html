<meta name="summary" content="FAIR TO MIDDLING FOR UNDISCERNING ADULTS"></head><body><p>While I enjoyed it as simple entertainment and a closer link up to the comic that I never got around to really reading - I don't recommend it for youngsters.<br /><br />I enjoyed the actors interpertation of the characters there was just a little too much eye candy for the [men?]<br />Not up to par with "Ghost Rider" or "X-Men" - still am glad that I bought it for the comic characters collection of movies.<br /><br />Am waiting now for the "Silver Surfer" to blast through.<br /> Did thoroughly enjoy the features -- I like explainations of characters and story.<br />Poor old "Doom" was a mess.  Chiklis really brought his character to life.<br />Boy, to carry 60 pounds of costume must have helped put him in good condition.<br /><br />Definitely recommend for most adults.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This crew makes Rob Zombie look normal"></head><body><p>Over the years Sid has heard a lot about Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and decided to finally check it out. Watching leads you to one motley crew of freaks with Captain Spaulding being the most offensive and vile, if we had to pick one. He's played by Sid Haig, not of elf descent, who is one of the strangest looking human walking the earth. This guy would be just as creepy cashing a check at the bank as he would dressed up as his murderous clown character. Now we're full aware that this was the sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, but decided to watch this one first anyway since it appeared to be the better flick.<br /><br />The film takes place in Ruggsville Texas as Sheriff John Wydell (William Forsythe) and a crew of police show up at the serial killing Reject's house. Opening fire they manage to catch mother Firefly as the rest of the crew gets away. Now on the lamb Otis and his sister Baby (played by Rob Zombie's wife who just happens to be really hot) meet up with daddy Captain Spaulding and keep reeking havoc on some innocent folks at a run down motel. However Sheriff John Wydell is bent on revenge for his brother's death and catched up to the Rejects for quite a great scene.<br /><br />Surprisingly The Devils Rejects was a really good horror flick. Yes it was very gory, which we never look for, but it fit the film since these were very deranged people. As far as the reviews go it's either people love it or hate it. If you hate it then you probably went in expecting too much, which is never a good idea for a horror film. Usually if you don't set the bar too high you'll have yourself a fun watch. So to sum it up yes Sid enjoyed this and would have years ago especially for Sheri Moon Zombie, who Sid wouldn't mind chasing around the room with a pink turkey baster.</p></body></html>

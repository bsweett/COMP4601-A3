There's drama in the movie, just not very involving such as when Jake G goes nuts and almost shoots a fellow Marine, or when one of Jake's buddy's goes nuts when he is not allowed to fire a sniper shot at a distant Iraqi. I felt nothing during those scenes. This is a combo of old-fashioned Marine boot camp cliches and a somewhat updated take on what it was like to be a GI in the first Gulf War. It made me realize the U.S. has been wasting its time over there for almost 20 years now.</p></body></html>

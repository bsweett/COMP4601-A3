<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing!!"></head><body><p>First of all, I absolutely love Jodie Foster. I think she is one of the best actresses of all time with movies like.. "The Accused", "Silence of the Lambs", "Panic Room" and "FlightPlan". Secondly, I think this movie wasn't up to par with Jodie's talent because I know she's capable of so much more, so yes, I would have to say that Jodi deserved so much better. I know she did the best she could do with the story that she was given, but this was just not what I expected from her, and it's my opinion that this movie was better suited for a B-list actress. Actresses like Jodie, Hillary, Meryl and Halle don't have to accept just anything because after the way they have established themselves film after film they have nothing left to prove. Third, after the initial turning point of the movie (Erica and her boyfriend get attacked while walking their dog) I found this movie to be slow and boring for extended periods of time. I mean, there are moments when I found myself dozing off just waiting for it to be over so I could see the ending that everyone was talking about. Needless to say, I was less than impressed by what I saw, but I won't spoil it for others. Fourth, I hate the fact that this movie keeps being compared to "Death Wish" when in actuality I saw where this film paid homage to several different fims, and that goes double for the unrealistic ending that everyone keeps raving about. Fifth, I don't know if "Erica Bain" can be considered a "Brave One" because she went totally off the deep end, and went on a full fledged killing spree after what happened to her. Granted, all of the attackers in her case deserved what they got, so I guess that's where the fine line between vigilante and murderer come into play. Sixth, and lastly, Terrence Howard is another actor that didn't have to play this part. After films like.. "Hustle and Flow" "Four Brothers" and "Crash", I think Terrence could've done much better too. However, he did the best he could do with what he was given the same as Jodie. I just expected a whole lot more from him as well. At any rate, my recommendation for this fim is that you wait for video because it's worth watching at least once. Please, don't pay any money to see it though because it's not worth the price of admission. JUST MY OPINION FOLKS!!!</p></body></html>

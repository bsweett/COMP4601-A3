So bad, that it might give The Happening a second life as a cult film (so bad, it's good). I couldn't believe the Amazon blurb above, that said Shyamalan is a genuis with dialogue. Shyamalan's camera work is, as always, good, and he was able to stock the movie with good actors -- but you have to give those actors something remotely believable to say!  I think I read somewhere that Shyamalan said this was meant to be a B movie, only the best ever done. In his Legend-in-his-own-mind dreams!  I'll take a bad John Carpenter effort any day over this limp stuff. This guy has a serious ego problem, and needs to give up script writing and start looking for outside material.</p></body></html>

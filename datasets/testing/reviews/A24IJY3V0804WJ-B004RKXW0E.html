<meta name="summary" content="Goodbye Andy and toys"></head><body><p>Extremely well made, that is the least I can say. This is the last in the trilogy which takes Woody to the daycare to save his friends. I think this was the best in the series and I can safely say that the most hardened should would find it hard not to tear up when Andy says good bye to his toy friends at the end of the movie, passing the torch to a new caretaker.

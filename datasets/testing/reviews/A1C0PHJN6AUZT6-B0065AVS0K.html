<meta name="summary" content="Much to my surprise....totally loved it!!!!"></head><body><p>I just saw this movie last night. I know, how much of a loser am I? I was just positive that I wouldn't "get" it because I hadn't read the graphic novels, and didn't really know much about them. When I put it in, I was shocked. It is an awesome movie!! I can see how some people didn't like it, but I wasn't one of them. The sweet digital backgrounds, the casts, the characters, the colors (and lack of)made me love this movie. It's definitly going on my wish list. Just give it a chance, you might love it like I do.</p></body></html>

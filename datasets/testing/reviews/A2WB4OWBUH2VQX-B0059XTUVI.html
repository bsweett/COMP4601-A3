She shows why in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in "The Iron Lady". However, an honest look at this film shows that there is a severe political bent on the way the story is told and this diminishes the fine acting that takes place. Heavily-laden phrases like "You must be crazy to suggest spending cuts during a recession" seem such an obvious political statement on today's politics. When the film portrays Thatcher as an agressive, mean-spirited woman who willingly abandons her family for her career (the scene when her kids run after her down the street as she leaves for parliment is quite ridiculous),it becomes obvious that the filmmakers want to cast a negative light on her achievements. I was really surprised to see that the film implies that Thatcher "heard voices" well before she resigned as the prime minister, implying that all of her political decisions were influenced by the voices in her head. Possible message: anyone who doesn't think like a liberal must be hearing crazy voices in their heads. It's ironic that liberal filmmakers who pretend to be rabid feminists so willingly undermine achievements made by women who don't represent their own agendas. You can't help but notice this selective feminism while watching the film, despite the great acting. The film comes across as an unbalanced and mean-spirited portrayal of Thatcher, which cannot be the whole truth of her story.</p></body></html>

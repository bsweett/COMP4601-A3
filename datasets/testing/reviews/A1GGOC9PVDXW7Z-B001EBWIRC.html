<meta name="summary" content=""Huh?""></head><body><p>This 1984 VHS tape is pre-HiFi. If your VCR isn't connected to a stereo amp or stereo TV via a double-wired audio cable, you won't hear any difference between this and a newer HiFi tape.<br /><br />"Huh?" answers the trivia question: "What is the last line in the 1941 film, THE MALTESE FALCON?"<br /><br />John Huston's adaptation was actually the third Hollywood take on Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade novel. The first "Falcon" (1931) got renamed DANGEROUS FEMALE in the early TV era. In many respects this one's truer to the book, is nicely atmospheric and has a rousing climax, but it suffers from a weaker cast. The 1936 Bette Davis film, SATAN MET A LADY strays farthest from Hammett's storyline and is decidedly unpopular.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS for John Huston's "Falcon":<br />Mysterious Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Astor) hires the private eye firm of Spade and Archer to tail Floyd Thursby, a man she claims has captured the affections of her kid sister. Miles Archer (Cowan) volunteers for the job. When both Thursby and Archer are found shot to death, the police suspect Sam Spade (Bogart).<br /><br />The plot thickens when gardenia-scented Joel Cairo (Lorre) visits Sam's office and offers him 5K to locate a small statue of a black bird. Sam quickly learns that Brigid also seeks the "dingus," as does the elegantly beefy Kasper Gutman (Greenstreet), who's willing to pay a much larger reward. Gutman's heavily-armed young bodyguard Wilmer (Cook Jr.) shadows Spade everywhere, while detectives Polhaus (Bond) and Dundy (MacLane) show up on his doorstep at all hours of the day and night, looking to solve the murders. Brigid is terrified of Cairo and the Fat Man; Sam doesn't know which of the three to believe or trust.<br /><br />Huston's dierctorial debut is an absolute masterpiece. A nicely honed script, skillful photography and in particular, solid acting from all players makes THE MALTESE FALCON a film one never grows tired of. Very highest recommendation!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.4) The Maltese Falcon (1941) - Humphrey Bogart/Mary Astor/Gladys George/Peter Lorre/Sydney Greenstreet/Lee Patrick/Ward Bond/Barton MacLane/Jerome Cowan/Elisha Cook Jr./John Hamilton (uncredited: Walter Huston/William Hopper)</p></body></html>

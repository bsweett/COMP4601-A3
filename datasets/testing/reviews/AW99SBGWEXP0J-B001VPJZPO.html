<meta name="summary" content="The Skeleton Key"></head><body><p>Caroline Ellis (Hudson) is in New Orleans for school.  For money, she takes a job as a live-in caregiver for stroke victim Ben Devereaux (Hurt).  Dealing with Ben is no problem, but dealing with his old fashioned wife is quite a task.  Violet Devereaux (Rowlands) does not like having Caroline in her house, but realizes its necessity.  The Devereaux house is far enough out of the way that the three of them are essentially cut off from the real world.  The only visitor is Violet's lawyer, Luke (Sarsgaard).  And when Caroline begins to see things in the attic, Luke is her confidant.<br /><br />All is not what it seems, and Violet may be up to no good.  Caroline begins to try to figure out what is going on, especially after she senses that Ben is asking for help.  The clues are all there, and an astute viewer may figure out the mystery before the big reveal at the end.<br /><br />Kate Hudson is branching out into the suspense genre, and does a credible job as the city girl who wants to get to the bottom of this back woods mystery.  Rowlands brings an air of mystery to Violet, and is down right nasty when need be.  "The Skeleton Key" is a solid suspense movie that does indeed hold up after all is explained.  I recommend "The Skeleton Key" to all who like a good mystery.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Christmas classic"></head><body><p>This movie is one of these rare stories that you don't get tired of watching. Every Christmas, they play this on a marathon on cable, and it is so much better than other Christmas movies like 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'<br /><br />Created 25 years ago, and set in 25 years before THAT, this story features a cute, bespectacled boy named Ralphie and his desire for a BB gun for Christmas. Mind you, the 50's was a time where people didn't have to be as worried about guns, and these times are bygone. No Internet, no TV, chalkboards with real chalk instead of dry-erase boards, and so on and so forth...<br /><br />This movie is entertaining because of its well-written story, but it's also awesome for nostalgia.</p></body></html>

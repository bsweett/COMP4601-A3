Which is probably the only excuse anyone could come up with to not like this show. It's a poor excuse too. Sure re-runs are frustrating when you're hooked on a show and want new episodes. However I remember times when Buffy or Smallville were on re-runs for weeks and weeks. I've even seen 1 star reviews here for that reason and it's just dumb. Every show has a big ammount of re-run breaks after a certain time. If you're hating on this show for that reason and then you're a baby and this show is too good for you lol.<br /><br />  Lost offers engaging stories, a fine cast, interesting plot twists and some of the best acting I've seen on tv in years. A plane crashes on an island and 40 people survive. There's only 14 of them that we really get to know though. Matthew Foxx plays a doctor named Jack who takes charge of the situation. Whenever there's a problem people come to him. Whether someone needs to be attended to or if they're out of bottled water, he's the man they complain to. Since he always does the right thing, he's not a bad guy to have in charge. There's also Kate (Evangeline Lilly) who's a misunderstood women on the run. She and Jack  strike a friendship right away with some friendly flirtation. They'll probably get together sooner or later. But she also has Sawyer (Josh Holloway) as an option . He's a slick wiseass who's also misunderstood and fighting inner-demons as well. Both can have trouble getting people to trust them too.<br /><br />  Although Jack, Kate and Sawyer have their love triangle going on. This isn't no mushy soup opera. It's about people who were lost before they even got on the island.  Because they were lost almost mentally and  find themselves again on that island. We get flashbacks showing how their lives weren't exactly great before the island. Plus the show is brilliant how it handles prejudice and humanity. How people get things done quicker if they learn to get along.<br /><br />  It also has it's supernatural side with something lurking in the jungle ripping survivors of the crash to shreds. Plus with a crippled survivor finding he can walk after the crash  on the island. A pregnant women who gets told by a Psychic that only she can raise her baby and that it's special. Also polar bears  are on the island causing havoc and no one knows how they got there. They also have to contend with dangerous mysterious people that weren't even on the plane.<br /><br />  Lost is the most daring and unpredictable show to land on tv in a long long time. This review doesn't even give the show justice to how good it is. There's so much to cover but it's better to just let you see for yourself if you haven't already. If you gave up on this show because of re-runs then you should get this dvd to see how much of a mistake you made.</p></body></html>

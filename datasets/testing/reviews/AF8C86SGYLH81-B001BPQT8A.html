<meta name="summary" content="Give it a "SE7EN""></head><body><p>I had to catch my breath...step away from the movie<br /><br />screen...and totally regroup.  It was that kind of<br /><br />film.  I've just finished watching what critics<br /><br />deemed one of the most frightening and disturbing<br /><br />homicidal maniac films of all time --- Se7en.  And no,<br /><br />that is not a typo...just a clever marketing tool to<br /><br />emphasize the meaning of the number and the word -<br /><br />Se7en.<br /><br />I don't know where to begin.<br /><br />I don't want to give away a thing.<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat for two hours.<br /><br />And why not?  Take a look at the cast.  Morgan<br /><br />Freeman, Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow.  How can you lose?  I can't give away the murderer...it would detract from the horror<br /><br />of this totally insane film of 1995.  I've had it on<br /><br />my shelf for over a year and never got around to<br /><br />watching it until tonight.<br /><br />Without giving away a single storyline, if you enjoyed<br /><br />(quivered and shivered) during "Silence of the Lambs"<br /><br />or "Manhunter", this one is for you.  It builds a plot<br /><br />like building a 3,000 piece Lego masterpiece.  What<br /><br />an ending!  To me, it wasn't predicatble...probably<br /><br />because I am naive when it comes to psychotic<br /><br />killers...I don't know that many - LOL!<br /><br />Anyway, let me share a couple of things with you.<br /><br />First, I won't give away the meaning of the title<br /><br />"Se7en".  You will discover that very shortly into the<br /><br />film.<br /><br />But let me quote a couple of the lines from the film:<br /><br />"About the only thing we know about that guy right now<br /><br />is that he is independently wealthy, well educated,<br /><br />and TOTALLY INSANE."<br /><br />"...because he's John Doe by choice."<br /><br />The maniac in this film is "completing his<br /><br />masterpiece."<br /><br />"The Lord works in mysterious ways."<br /><br />With that, "Se7en" gets a resounding 6 on a scale of<br /><br />1-5 (5 being the highest) in the psycho thriller<br /><br />genre.  I purchased the New Line Platinum Series with<br /><br />a second DVD with supplemental material.  It contains<br /><br />alternate endings which I haven't watched yet...but<br /><br />I'm sure they'll be a treat.<br /><br />As Halloween approaches, it's the time of year to<br /><br />watch "Se7en."  You'll never read Chaucer with the<br /><br />same understanding ever again.  Brad Pitt and Morgan<br /><br />Freeman (the rookie meets the seasoned veteran) are well cast as determined and crafty detectives.  Don't miss<br /><br />it.<br /><br />Count to "Se7en" and buy this DVD.  You'll watch it more than once.  It is a blood-curdling masterpiece.</p></body></html>

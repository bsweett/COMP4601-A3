Thus the stage is set for the fourth installment, cleverly entitled LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD.  Here we find a very middle-aged John McClane (yet the years have been kind to Bruce Willis) on his way to serve a routine warrant on a cyber hacker (Justin Long, who needs to calm down) wanted by the FBI for questioning.

But again, this is the age of mind-boggling special effects, so there's no end to the death-defying predicaments the filmmakers gleefully subject their protagonist to.  Not even Superman would survive this kind of punishment.<br /><br />Willis is delightfully cranky, cantankerous, and curmudgeonly; Long needs to calm down (I think I have mentioned this); and cyber villain Timothy Olyphant definitely lacks the cold, calculated evil of his villainous predecessors.

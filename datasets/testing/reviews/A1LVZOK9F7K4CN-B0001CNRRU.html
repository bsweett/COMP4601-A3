Well this movie outdoes it a hundred-fold.  Pulp Fiction was divided up into chapters so that the audience never REALLY got lost.  I'm curious to see what the shooting script for this film was like - if it was written this way or if the effect was completely created in the editing room.  EVERY SCENE takes place at a different point in the story and almost NO TWO SCENES follow consecutively.  It's fascinating to watch the movie unfold.  True, it is a gimmick, but it is a gimmick that works.  As we see bits of the end and bits of the beginning, we strain to put all the pieces together and understand what is happening.  This process may be vexatious for the occasional movie-goer - he will become lost and bored with a plot that doesn't unfold in a straightforward manner.  However, for film buffs, it is sure to fascinate.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a turbocharged Transporter, make a big splash in Miami . . ."></head><body><p>Jason Statham returns as Frank Martin, in the high-octane action thriller, The Transporter 2 (2005).  Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita), and Mark Robert Kamen, who co-wrote The Transporter (2002), also penned the screenplay for the sequel, and Louis Leterrier returns as solo director.<br /><br />Martin has left France, and is now is Miami, behind the wheel of an Audi, hired by Audrey Billings (Amber Valletta), to chauffer her young son Jack.  An unscrupulous gang, led by gentlemanly terrorist Gianni Chellini (Alessandro Gassman), plans to use the young boy in a grand scheme, to infect the attendees at a law enforcement conference.  On a routine trip to the doctor, an attempt is made to kidnap Jack.  Frank manages to save the boy, surviving an encounter with hitchick Lola (Kate Naulta), and her twin machine pistols.<br /><br />The respite is only temporary, as Lola catches up with them, and with the police in pursuit, Frank gets a chance to demonstrate his mad driving skills, even flying from building to building.  Chellini does get his hands on Jack, and infected with a 'recombinant retro-immune double-polymorphing efferent', returns him to his family, to spread the virus to his father Jeff (Matthew Modine), successfully executing his deadly plan.<br /><br />The police, led by investigator Stappleton (Keith David), naturally believe they are dealing with a simple kidnapping.  French Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand), has arrived in Miami for a vacation, but finds himself arrested.  While in custody, he prepares some food, and also provides vital information that helps Frank discover what is really happening, setting the stage for the grand finale.<br /><br />For what it aims to be, The Transporter 2 is quite well written, zipping along briskly, with the little pieces fitting together quite nicely, with few loose ends.  Like CSI Miami, everyone seems to have an orange skin tone, even Tarconi, who unfortunately, does not get much of a chance to work on his tan, while on vacation.  With Cory Yuen choreographing, the fight scenes have his stylized look, and quick cut editing.  One featuring a fire hose, and another on a drydocked boat stand out, but the final battle with Chellini is a little anticlimactic.  The Transporter 2 has the same kind of spectacular vehicular stunt work as the first film, but pushes things to a higher, and more absurd levels.  With some totally outrageous stunts, and an over the top villain like Lola, the film has a flavor similar to a James Bond adventure, minus the romance.<br /><br />The DVD release is a little short in the extras department.  There are some deleted and extended scenes, and a short featurette, but no commentary track, or really substantial goodies.  Fans of action films, or Jason Statham, should not be disappointed by this effort, which is more intense, and flows more smoothly than the original Transporter.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="it's ok, not as good as the critics sponsored"></head><body><p>a light weight screenplay with weak storylines. okay performance. the whole sports magazine company looked pretty staged and fake, full of cardboard one-dimensional supporting figures garbaged in, garbaged out, then garbaged in again. a lukewarm comedy like a half baked potato, half ediable, half got to be thrown away. the ending even sucks more and bigger. before completely took off, suddenly lost headwind and got to glide down with no-big-deal crash landing. a so-so directed job, only survived by dennis quaid's die-hard endevor.</p></body></html>

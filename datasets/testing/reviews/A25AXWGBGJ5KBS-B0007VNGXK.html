<meta name="summary" content="Man...I STILL can't get over how much I dug this film...!"></head><body><p>I loved this movie; what a complete and total surprise!<br /><br />I am a comic book fan of the highest order: I still get them every Wednesday...I have over 13,000...I defend the artform to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />But somehow, I never "got into" Hellboy." I knew it was highly regarded. The visuals appeared interesting. But I never took the dive.<br /><br />I bought the DVD, never watched it. I bought the "Special Edition"; never watched it. I have that disease. Gotta get them just in case they sell out and you can find them anymore...y'know?<br /><br />I just got my Blu-Ray player, and for some strange reason, I picked up "Hellboy" in my initial batch of a dozen discs.<br /><br />It ended up being the first movie I put in my player. It sort of "called" to me.<br /><br />Wow. I was hooked from the opening sequence to the bold credits. And not just because the images were razor-sharp and the sound was goose-bump-making perfect.<br /><br />It's because Hellboy, and his dad, and the fish guy, and Jeffrey Tambor and freakin' Guillermo Del Toro all conspired to suck me into this world that I bought hook, line and giant rocky right hand.<br /><br />The action is outstanding, the humor delicious, the special effects supreme. The plot is a tad muddled, but you won't care.<br /><br />The characterizations...the dialogue...just sparkles. I was reminded of those old-fashioned movies...ones where what the characters were saying is just as important as what they are doing.<br /><br />Yes, even if that character is a big, red demon-like dude who saws off his horns.<br /><br />Not only can't I wait to watch this again, but now I'm going to make every effort to check out the sequel in a few weeks, and see it on the REALLY big screen...<br /><br />Man...I STILL can't get over how much I dug this film...!</p></body></html>

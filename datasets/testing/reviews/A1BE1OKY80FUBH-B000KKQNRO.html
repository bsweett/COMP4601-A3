One of course has to consider that the movie was competing with a extremelly successful book that everyone (despite if someone like it or not) had read it or had knowledge of it.  Thus the director, the script writer and the actors had a mountain to climb.<br /><br />The script deviates from the book in several aspects and pays little attention to the thinking of the players on solving the puzzle- although any film would compete rather poorly with a book in this aspect.  Having said that Ron Howard directed this film very well but I think that Tom Hanks was miscast for the leading role.  He is a great actor but he is not really the professor that Dan Brown described.  The rest of the cast perfomed quite well.<br /><br />All in all if you watch this movie without attempting to compare it to the book you could actually enjoy it.</p></body></html>

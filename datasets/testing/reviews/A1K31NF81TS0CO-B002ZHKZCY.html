<meta name="summary" content="Stiff and Uninteresting"></head><body><p>I was thoroughly disappointed with this one.  I expected better. I saw the original movie, with Matt Damon as Bourne.  I remember it being much more interesting.  But this movie is so choppy and lacking in explanation.  I couldn't follow the story for the life of me.  The interaction and tension was a little high, and good, but mainly droll and boring at most times.<br /><br />I honestly didn't have a problem with the camera work.  I know that it helped me to believe that the characters were moving quickly.  And this was the effect that the director and special effects team wanted. It worked for me.<br /><br />I had a problem with the dialogue, and the interaction between the characters.  That was my main problem.<br /><br />I give this three stars as it wasn't the worst I've seen.  It was a'iiight.<br /><br />MC White said:  Just a'iiight!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rather Predictable Action Movie"></head><body><p>The fact that it's predictable doesn't necessarily mean it's bad or boring, just sort of lacking in surprises. Angelina Jolie plays the part of Evelyn Salt, a very remarkable super spy who's superior training enables her to either beat up or just outsmart every other spy most specifically including guys half again her size.<br /><br />If you're OK with that then you may be in for a rather fun action adventure featuring this remarkable woman. The theatrical version starts with a bang and the pace keeps going at a rapid clip for the rest of the movie. The movie appears to end with a sequel in mind; a sequel is under consideration by Sony but the jury is still out on Jolie's participation as I understand it.<br /><br />On balance the movie is entertaining but not great; if you're a fan of Jolie's you may want to add this one to your collection. If not, then watch it first to make a determination of whether or not you should own it. If you are a Jolie fan then the preferred version may be the Blu-ray Delux Unrated Edition.</p></body></html>

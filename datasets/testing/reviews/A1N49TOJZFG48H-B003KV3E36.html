<meta name="summary" content="FAVORITE of THE series"></head><body><p>i was really surprised . between the stock news reel footage , the engaging story and characters and the graphic brutality depicted onscreen , i was really pleased and gratified with RAMBO . stallone did an excellent job . i enjoyed his last ROCKY picture almost as much . SLY knows what the people want . the critics (by and large) missed the launch on this one . it's a BLAST . at 60 , the man's delivering what most of the action/adventure directors , writers and producers are green with . ENVY . out-damn-standing .</p></body></html>

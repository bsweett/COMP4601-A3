I believe the absolute pinnacle of filmmaking and talent with an ensemble cast that brings cohesion and belivability, makes a five star film. Fanboys and fanatical followers who follow their fav actors or directors around like lemmings and unfairly give their work five stars is sophmoric. I believe films like Empire of the Sun, Europe Europa, Remains of the Day, Schindler's List, E.T., Dead Poet's Society, Zeff's Romeo and Juliet, even Saw, are five star films. I finally have room to garner another film five stars, thus is 'Million Dollar Baby'.<br /><br />Million dollar baby gave me an upper cut in which I still have not regained consciousness from. A mind numbing extasy of emotion, surrounded by a cornucopia of unpredictability, that I wanted to lather in its warmth and tenderness long after the rolling credits whited out an otherwise black screen. All I can simply find the need to say now is 'WOW'. Without a doubt this emotional masterpiece of finely honed craft, is without question, and rarely do I ever say this, one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I had given the idea to seeing this some thought several times, but loathing anything Clint Eastwood and my inate disdain to boxing, simply left my tongue dry with any thought of watering it. I was very surprised by my addiction to it from jumpstreet. During many moments I was grilled to the tv, so close I could hear my mother as a child telling me I would go blind because I was sitting so close to it. Actually routing her on from time to time, like we all did in Rocky, it made me smile and cheer and cry and think; it told me in a fashion that few films do, to move with your heart, think that you will acheive greatness, despite everyone around you saying you can't and despite obstacles, and the film spoke to me, in its own personal way, telling me not to take anything for granted.<br /><br />I like the fact that a film can be an uplifting experience that stays with you days after you view it. Sure nothing wrong with a Harrison Ford flick once and again, but nothing beats the feeling of walking out of something tangible, that you can feel a part of.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby, full of stucco bravado and yearning contempt towards status quo and mainstream, its message is a strong and important one, a redefining look at the underdog in its capacity to have others pay attention, stagggeringly detailed in its tempo, it marvels in a way that makes me want to quit my every day job or night job I have, collect all the bills in the mattress and head out and be a filmmaker. Damn I dont know about you, but if I made a film, and someone, anyone, said that about my film, it would fill me with tears and a joy in which I know, wholeheartedly, would be the reason why film is made.<br /><br />A way past prime female boxer, gets a chance from a worldclass trainer, in his own right, bitter with his ways, to train her to be the best in the world, and thus both finding solace through each other, which grows as each one learns more about the others world and where they came from. It's tender and tragic and seems to find its way from every nuance and turn in a fine display of cinematography and acting, that is uncompromisable.<br /><br />The only moments that made the film stretch a bit, which really bothered me, as it was THAT good, was boy with serious issues that looked like he had turrets was very annoying, and not needed in any fashion and his return was pointless (save sticking with a dream) and unncessary.</p></body></html>

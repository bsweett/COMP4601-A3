<meta name="summary" content="I say, Sean Connery for King"></head><body><p>When compared to a "serious" spy film, e.g. the BBC's excellent adaptations of John le Carre's TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE (both starring the late Sir Alec Guiness), GOLDFINGER is positively silly. But it works, mostly because of the presence of Sean Connery.<p>Here, Comdr. Bond foils an attempt by Auric Goldfinger to destroy the value of the bullion held in Fort Knox. Gadgets and girls abound. The best of the former is a laser that causes even the redoubtable Commander to wince at the prospect of losing the family jewels. And then there's Ms. P. Galore (Honor Blackman). How is it that modern-day Bond Babes don't have such, um, promising monikers? And the rock-like Oddjob (Harold Sakata) with his lethal hat is one of the most engaging thugs ever to toss 007 into a heap.<p>Sean Connery will go down in movie history as the essence of Bond. Next to him, all others pale - even runner-up Pierce Brosnan. Imagine Connery, a Scot, in a tux jacket and kilt. Then picture PB in the same costume. See what I mean? Connery has the voice, physical stature, and rakish glint in his eyes to pull it off. Sean should be acclaimed King in Westminster Abbey.<p>I'm giving GOLDFINGER 5 stars not because it's a great film, but because it's perhaps the best of several with Connery as Bond, and the one that could well immortalize Sean to human history in that role.</p></body></html>

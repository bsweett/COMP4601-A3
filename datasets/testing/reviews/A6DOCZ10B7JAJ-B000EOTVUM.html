<meta name="summary" content="Way too disturbing for the sissified viewer"></head><body><p>This 2005 Australian tale is one of the most horrifying films ever made.<br /><br />So disturbing, many critics just can't hang.  Roger Ebert gave this a rare 0 stars, stating how he desperately wanted to walk out.<br />Other whiny critics cry about the excessively brutal torture scenes aimed toward women.<br />Still others moan about the extended buildup of the story.  They're used to horror movies showing ample nudity and some grotesque murders in the opening credits of the film.<br /><br />Whatever, go watch a lame remake of a classic Japanese ghost story then.  This is pretty close to perfect for the real horror fanatics.<br /><br />Loosely inspired by the Backpack Murders in the 90's.  We are shown actual footage of Wolfe Creek, the large crater caused by a meteorite crash.  A trio of hikers explore this site, and upon returning their car will not start.  Crikey!<br /><br />Little do these tourists know, the real fear is about to begin.  Mick, a brash but jovial Aussie bushman just happens to be strolling by, and he offers some help.  With little options, the group accepts the tow back to his place.  They wait by the campfire while he works on the car.  But they make one more costly mistake--they shouldn't have drank the water...<br /><br />The handheld camera gives a very raw feel to the sadistic torture scenes.  There is plenty of blood and gore as the madman does his deeds.  This film avoids nearly all stupid cliches of the genre to make for a truly unsettling experience.  The acting is outstanding, plus it has one of the most alarming villains ever!<br /><br />One interesting note, Mick's little lair appears to be at an abandoned mining site called NAVITALIM.  Flip that around a bit and you have the real killer's name--Ivan Milat.<br /><br />Ignore the bad reviews, this is one of the best horror films in the past 30 years, without a doubt.</p></body></html>

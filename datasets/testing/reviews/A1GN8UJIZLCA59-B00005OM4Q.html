<meta name="summary" content="Crowe's Life"></head><body><p>The main character in Almost Famous is a 15 year old rock journalist named William Miller. He gets the chance to write an article for Rolling Stone magazine about an up and coming rock band, Stillwater. He goes out on tour with the band and what starts out as a simple assignment, turns into a life altering experience for all involved. The character of William is director and writer Cameron Crowe's on screen alter ego. Mr. Crowe was a 15 year old who wrote for Rolling Stone and the story is based on his life. The film also involves William's overprotective and aggressive mother (played by Frances McDormand) and the battles she waged with his sister. They are based on Mr. Crowe's own family's struggles and the fact that he was willing to air his family's problems in public adds a touch of humanity and reality to the film. Stillwater is led by Jeff Bebe and Russell Hammond who bicker at one another about the band's future and possible fame. Billy Crudup plays Russell the lead guitarist and Jason Lee is Jeff the lead singer. They have a natural fear of the press and refer to William as the enemy. In fact, William struggles to get an one on one interview with Russell throughout the film. The band is followed on tour by a bunch of groupies who refer to themselves as Band-Aids. Their leader is Penny Lane played wonderfully by Kate Hudson. She is in love with Russell, but it is William whom she confides in. The tender relationship between Penny &amp; William is one of the film's great strengths. Throughout the film, William seeks and gets advice from legendary rock critic Lester Bangs. Mr. Bangs is played amazingly by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman provides the film's conscious and his brief time on the screen is electric. All the performances in the film are first-rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self-righteous and Ms. McDormand is a fierce presence. But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William. Mr. Fugit had never appeared in a movie before and had minimal acting experience, but he is the emotional center of the film, the link between al the characters. He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture. Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's. His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time. Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script. Almost Famous is Mr. Crowe's love letter to his youth and the 70's. The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.  This is an expanded three disk DVD that has everything one could want regarding the film including a disk of Stillwater's live performance that was filmed for the movie and vintage Cameron Crowe Rolling Stone work.  The DVD is as expansive as any released and worth the few extra bucks.</p></body></html>

I'm just reviewing this for anyone looking to see a good film. Mel Gibson is no doubt good at what he does and Apocolypto is very well done also. There will be mixed feelings towards this movie I'm sure as there were towards 'The Passion of the Christ" but this is a good movie. Apocalypto shows a young mans amazing and heart pounding experience during the decline of the Mayan Civilization. The movie starts with young Jaguar Paw and his father Flint Sky hunting in the jungle with some other men from their tribe. While teasing a fellow tribe-member for the group is startled by something. As the viewer you can barely see what has caught the men off guard because it is hiding so well in the jungle. It turns out to be a large number of people from another village.<br /><br />They do not say much just that they want to cross the village and want no trouble. A man crossing looks deep into Jaguar Paw's eyes and the man passes him a feeling without even saying anything, the feeling was fear. Back at the village Jaguar Paw knew that something was coming and he was right. Early in the morning while the fires still smoking and the people asleep men appear from nowhere. The men attack the village trying not to kill but injuring many. Overtaking this village will not be easy for them as everyone is fighting to protect their families. Who has not been killed is being tied up and taken except for children. After traveling a far distance from their village Jaguar Paw and his people are then taken to a city with a huge temple and from here is where the movie really and I mean really gets exciting. Jaguar Paw must find a way to get back to his village and save his wife and child who he hid in a dry well before it fills up from rain. I don't want to give away anything but lets say that Jaguar Paw makes one of the most courageous and exciting stands ever.<br /><br />I saw Apocalypto and as I was watching all the things most movie previews promise came true in this film. All the "Heart Pounding", "Jaw Dropping", "Nonstop Action", and "You'll be on the Edge of Your Seat" promises came true. This movie has such a realistic feel to it as well as these actors. You can feel it all from the fear to the determination and courage of Jaguar Paw. There is no way that you could watch this film and not feel anything. This films action and suspense truly never stops and I mean that literally. The acting is so good that you forget that they're actors and believe that they're really the characters they're portraying.<br /><br />Mel Gibson did an amazing job in making these settings and people look so real. Jaguar Paws story is out of this world, had it been done in some modern day culture, a man trying to retrieve his family would not be this good. Because the elements of Jaguar Paw being very outnumbered it makes a high demand of physical and mental endurance to survive in a jungle and this movie becomes more interesting. He truly has no weapons except the jungle he grew up in and knows like the back of his hand but still exhaustion and time are not on his side. His journey becomes all the more impossible and this makes the movie that more intriguing cause you want him to succeed. This film is definitely not for the squeamish type, there's nothing in it you wouldn't find in most scary flicks today but it is still very violent. Apocalypto is an amazing movie that I would recommend to many but be ready to sit on the edge of your seat cause you'll be there for most of the film.</p></body></html>

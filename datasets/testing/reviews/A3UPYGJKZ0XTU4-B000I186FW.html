A single avenger (Hugo Weaving), calling himself "V" and wearing a smirking Guy Fawkes mask, plans to shake the population out of complacency and exact revenge on those who tortured him years ago. On the 5th of November, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes' 1605 Gunpowder Plot, V blows The Old Bailey sky high. And he warns that next year it will be the Houses of Parliament. Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) is charged with finding V and his supposed accomplice, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) whom V saved from arrest when she was out after curfew. When he is not rabble-rousing, V is leaving a trail of murder victims, whom Finch traces to a detention center that housed top secret biological research years ago. But Finch's investigation attracts the displeasure of the Chancellor (John Hurt) and secret police chief Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith).<br /><br />Although it is ostensibly an action movie, I found "V for Vendetta" mostly tedious and generally bland. "V" could as easily stand for "verbose" as "vendetta". V's wordy, philosophical oration would put the populace to sleep, not move them to arms. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue stilted, as you might expect of a graphic novel. The depth should be found in the story's ideas, but "V for Vendetta" comes up short in that department. Alan Moore, who wrote the comic, has criticized the American writers and director James McTeigue for transforming his conflict between anarchism and fascism in Britain into a critique of neo-conservatism in the United States. I have not read the graphic novel, so I must judge the film alone, which is an awkward mix of all of those ideas. There is a message about the politics of fear, as the fascist regime exploited fear of violence and disease to increase its domain in the name of national security. Citizens traded freedom for security, or the illusion of security, whether they really wanted to or not. This would be an interesting theme if it came across strongly, but unfortunately, the politics of fear is peripheral in the film.<br /><br />Much has been made of the idea that "V for Vendetta" casts a "terrorist" in heroic light. In fact, the film avoids the issue of terrorism almost entirely. V isn't much of a terrorist, and he's hardly heroic. He's an amoral, manipulative ideologue who treats his friends as badly as his enemies. His vendetta is one of personal vengeance. He blows up government buildings with no one in them. V doesn't kill civilians. His explosions are theater, complete with musical scores and fireworks. As terrorism is violence intended to leverage a political cause by creating fear, it would not be an effective tool against a regime whose power is rooted in the fact that everyone is afraid of the world around them. The government is the exploiter of fear, not V. So "V for Vendetta" is uniquely unsuited to comment on terrorism. V's violence is intended to be emblematic. It's vandalism, not terrorism. He's an anarchist. He targets institutions, not people. If you want to see a movie about revolutionary politics and terrorism, see "The Battle of Algiers", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of political cinema that has the added benefit of being true. "V for Vendetta" is the sum of shallow characters and nonsensical plot wrapped up in bland politics, and it's casual view of torture is indefensible.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006 single disc edition): The single bonus feature is "Freedom! Freedom! Making V for Vendetta" (16 min), which consists mainly of interviews with producer Joel Silver, director James McTeigue, production designer Owen Paterson, and much of the cast, including Natalie Portman, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and Hugo Weaving. They discuss the film's themes and some aspects of adapting the movie from the graphic novel. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French (Canadian).</p></body></html>

This is the soul and essence of Harvey Milk, and of the times he lived in San Francisco. I lived there then. I remember it all so well. This is a fitting memorial to a courageous man.<br /><br />Sean Penn IS Harvey Milk, and Josh Brolin does a good job of depicting Dan White, he of the sugar neurosis/psychosis. The Twinkies Defense. Only Victor Garber does not look like Mayor Moscone. Sort of sounds like him, and does a credible job in the role for anyone who did not live in those times. Rather violent times, they were.<br /><br />The story opens with Harvey preparing to celebrate his 40th birthday. He's living in New York, selling insurance I believe it was, and thoroughly closeted. A handsome young man gives him a close brush in the subway stairway, and they strike up a conversation. It is clear that this encounter is one which functions as a signal for closeted gays, as they neither one have any doubts of the others intentions. Scott, the young man, helps Harvey celebrate his 40th birthday, and then decides to go with him to San Francisco to escape from his closet. (Apparently Scott never had been in one.)<br /><br />San Francisco, 1970. Homosexuality was still illegal, but a tolerance was traditional, and the Halloween night parade on Polk Street was famous for its flaming queens -- the only day of the year it was legal to wear drag in public. But Harvey rented a small store in the Castro, and helped the Castro neighborhood emerge as a gay haven. He ran a camera shop, but it was also a hang-out and eventually got deeply involved in Harvey's political campaigns.<br /><br />Harvey's politics were liberal, of course, as they would necessarily be. But that does not mean he had the backing of the Democratic Party, or even that portion of the party that was known to be gay. The editor of the Advocate, a gay rights newspaper, was not exactly closeted, but he down-played his gay life. Wore classy business suits and hob-nobbed with the Democratic Party elite. They couldn't handle Harvey's up-front, out-of-the-closet style.<br /><br />Harvey believed that gays should come out of the closet in order for people who thought that queers were some sort of dreadful monsters to learn that those who they worked with, the members of their families, churches, neighborhoods, included gays. One line he used all the time which was not much used in the movie was "We Are Everywhere," although the idea certainly was.<br /><br />He ran for city supervisor two or three times before the city changed to district voting for supervisors instead of the prior city-wide elections, where the top eight vote-getters throughout the city became supervisors. Harvey and his supporters also worked very hard on the campaign to change to district voting. That was the first I had heard of him. I lived near Polk Street, the older gay neighborhood, and was not very political. But when district voting began, we were all startled to find that the Castro was already well organized and had their candidate in place. And he won.<br /><br />The big fight at that time was the Briggs Initiative, Proposition 6, as I recall. Or perhaps 9. Anyway, the idea was to allow school boards to fire anyone who was gay OR anyone who supported a gay in the school faculty. Briggs was heavily backed by Anita Bryant, who was making a name for herself nationwide in her anti-gay campaign. We didn't know it at the time, but her husband had left her because he came out gay.<br /><br />Harvey organized the No on 6 campaign, and challenged Briggs to public debates. He was well informed, charming, amusing, and unflappable. Briggs was a stuffed shirt prude. His understanding of the gay community was much what was popular at the time: that since gays don't reproduce [oh, really?], they have to recruit. In one famous scene, Milk points out that he was raised by heterosexual parents, taught by heterosexual teachers, and lived in a straight world. How then did he become gay? He explained that if children really emulated their teachers that much, there would be a heck of a lot more nuns in the country!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dan White became the mayor of the middle-class Catholic neighborhood just to the south of the Castro. He was not only conservative, he was pretty religious, and an ex-fireman and ex-cop. He was also in over his head in accepting the position of supervisor, intellectually, emotionally and economically. He hated Harvey and everything he stood for. He asked Harvey to support an ordinance to raise the salaries of the supervisors, but would not trade a vote in favor of anything of importance to Harvey. Harvey thought the salary increase would be a bad idea, because they would be up for re-election and people would feel they were too greedy.<br /><br />Finally, when Dan White's ordinance for a pay increase was defeated, he resigned. Just after he handed in his resignation, the Police Union had a conference with him. After that, he asked Mayor Moscone to re-appoint him to the seat on the board he had just vacated, effectively rescinding his resignation. When Moscone refused to do so, White crawled in a window in the maintenance area of City Hall with a gun in his pocket. The rest you know; it was in all the news.<br /><br />The movie is based around a set of audio tapes that Milk had left with his effects, marked to be opened if he was assassinated. He knew he was a target, and frankly, may even have known that White was that unstable. He had gotten threats so many times during his political career that he simply accepted the idea that his was a risky position. He was right.<br /><br />This is a five-star movie, not only for its authenticity, but for its heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Would've done better as a TV mini series"></head><body><p>The Hunt for Red October came the closest to being like one of Tom Clancy's novels, none of the others since have done as well. The Sum of All Fears is an example of this with the studio taking the title and some of the characters from the story and throwing away most of the plot.<br />I will say that I think maybe Ben Affleck, say what you will about him, is at least a little better cast than Harrison Ford was. He is at least more in line with being the correct age for the character Clancy wrote about (and I think Clancy approved of him as well). The movie is all right for light entertainment (?) but if you will read a 6 or 700 page book you should really spend your money there instead as all of the Clancy stories visually would work better as TV miniseries.</p></body></html>

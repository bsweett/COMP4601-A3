<meta name="summary" content="Nicholas Cage is Chilling"></head><body><p>This is a movie about con men...but also tries to teach us why they are the way they are.  The story follows Cage's character, who actually ends up getting conned by a teenager.  We see the human side of the charlatan and the very ugliest sides as well.<br /><br />Worth watching.<br /><br />Main message...CRIME DOESN'T PAY</p></body></html>

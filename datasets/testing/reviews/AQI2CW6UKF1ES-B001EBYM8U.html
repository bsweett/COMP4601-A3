In this movie, a curropted cop gets a rookie, and tries to get him mixed in with his problems.  These are the main characters.<p>Alanzo Harris:Denzel won his first best actor's award ever(He won best supporting actor in Glory), and I see why, good acting, with using a lot of good metaphors and stuff.  He may seem like a good narcotics officer, but his actions will get him killed, unless he can pay off his debts.  But before he does that, he needs a pawn in his game.<p>Jake:Ethan Hawke played good in this movie too as a rookie cop.  He gets his chance at being a narcotics officer, thanks to Alanzo.  He has to show what he can prove in 24 hours, but a lot of bumps are up the road, and it prooves he's scared to find out the shocking truth.<p>The movie got off to a great start, and had very good twists, but when it rolled towards the end, it started to fall apart, and I was a pretty dissapointed how the movie ended, but Denzel stayed true to his acting roots all throughout the movie.  If you like to see Denzel at one of his finest, go pick this up, if you like a good ol' cop movie, then this will be interesting.  And remember, It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.</p></body></html>

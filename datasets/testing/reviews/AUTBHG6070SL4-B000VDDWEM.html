<meta name="summary" content="Just your basic zombie-virus movie"></head><body><p>You know, "Night of the Living Dead," "Resident Evil," and too many more to count, including this one's prequel (which I didn't see). It's been done so many times, with pretty much interchangeable plots, that any new one had better be something different.<br /><br />This one is. The "Rage" virus has depopulated England, down to the last howling bloodsucker - as far as the authorities can tell. So, once it looks like all's clear, they start shipping planeloads of tasty expatriots back into the most undefendable, unsecurable part of the UK: downtown London. You can pretty much guess the rest.<br /><br />Given that everything else in this movie is recycled, novel (or at least well-done) effects distinguish this one. There's a fair bit of red spatter, if that's the kind of thing you like. There are also some great CGI scenes of the military trying their military solutions throughout London - some of the coolest since that big ending scene in "V for Vendetta". And, since this flick is really just there to manipulate your nerves, it does a great job with flashing lights, blinding glare, and bouncy camera stuff. One other thing worked pretty well - it looks as if the current generation of cameras has shutter speeds so high that motion blur essentially doesn't exist. Instead, action scenes have a jaggedness that grates on the eye in a way completely suited to the jagged mood.<br /><br />So that's about it. A plain old contagious-zombie movie with above average effects. I give it four stars for staying loyally true to its genre, not trying to be anything else. If you have an evening to kill, these virus-driven maniacs will take care of it for you.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

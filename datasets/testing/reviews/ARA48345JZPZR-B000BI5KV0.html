<meta name="summary" content="Defying All Probabilities............."></head><body><p>Take your mind off of a world full of troubles and spend some time with these wonderful creatures, defying all probabilities as they survive and raise a new generation in one of the harshest and least forgiving environments on earth, as they have done so for a million years.<br /><br />Also defying all probabilities, this film found an audience. I knew it had an avid following, but I had no idea the full reason why.  It is astonishing.  That would have been my title for this review, but someone else has already used it.<br /><br />The stark beauty of Antarctica in its various seasons is unforgettably photographed here, and if these intrepid little birds withstanding everything nature can throw at them from 100 mile winds at 80 below zero temperatures, vulnerable to many predators, stubbornly sharing their travails with their mates and their fellows, doesn't move you, well more is the pity for you.<br /><br />Eighty minutes long, narrated by Morgan Freeman (who could enthrall me reading Federal regulations), I have no puzzlement at all why this movie, and these stalwart little birds, found an audience that could be enchanted by the story of their life cycle. The Emperor Penguin's struggle speaks to us. Something to do with the precarious wonder of life, and the shared burdens of this little community amid so much severity.  Kudos to all involved.</p></body></html>

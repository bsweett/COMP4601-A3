<meta name="summary" content="A terrific film that I enjoyed far more than I expected to"></head><body><p>Frankly, I did not appreciate Bobby Darin when he was alive.  I was too young and didn't quite get what he was about.  I had just started paying attention to him when he died in 1973.  It is about time someone told his story.  By all accounts, Kevin Spacey is a Bobby Darin devotee and it shows in this wonderful and fascinating movie.<br /><br />First of all, I loved the way the story is told.  It is not a narrative, although it talks about the singer's life.  It is all about the music and how it came out of his strange youth and how his illness forced him to focus in on what mattered most to him because he never expected to live all that long.  Rheumatic Fever as a child had damaged his heart.  Of course, the smoking, drinking, and pills along they way didn't help him and he died at 37 after heart surgery.<br /><br />The movie points out the structure of his life, his early show business inspiration, the rough beginnings, his successes, meeting, wooing, and marrying Sandra Dee.  The movie is able to point out the problems in the marriage without becoming dark or making anyone into the bad guy.  Again, the emphasis is on the music and the strains that puts on the human side of being human.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is clearly too old to play Bobby Darin, but so what?  Who else is going to do it?  He sure does a great job singing the songs and pulling off the spirit of the guy.  To give you an idea of how the story is told, the opening scene has Darin and some guys walking through the kitchen of a club to the stage.  Before he gets there some reporter says to Darin that he is too old to be playing himself.  Darin then goes through the curtains as the announcer introduces him.  Spacey begins singing a great version of "Mack the Knife".<br /><br />However, somewhere in the middle of the song, when everything is going strong, he sees a little boy (obviously the young Bobby Darin) looking out through the curtains.  Darin stops singing and it becomes apparent that this isn't a club, but a movie set for an autobiographical picture of Darin.  You can see all the layers and perspectives being set up here.  All of them continue to be used with a few more added throughout the film.  Do not expect a simple narrative or a single voice being used in the film.  There is a lot going on to tell this story and I loved the richness of the thing.  For me, telling it this way gets to the truth of the man a lot more than a simple left to right telling of his life.  Aren't most of us a lot of things trying to be something else again?  Yet, there is a theme to each of us that all those perspectives enrich.<br /><br />Great job.  I enjoyed this far more than I expected to.  A real treat.</p></body></html>

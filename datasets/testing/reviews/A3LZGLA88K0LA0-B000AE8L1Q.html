<meta name="summary" content="WELL ACTED BUT ULTIMATELY POINTLESS MOVIE"></head><body><p>Somewhere in this well produced and marvelously acted movie, there might have been a script that was coherent and pertinent.  However, director Mike Binder's movie ultimately becomes rather pointless, particularly in its out of nowhere ending and resolution.  Joan Allen is as always marvelous as Terry, a middle-aged wife whose husband vanishes from their life, apparently running off to Sweden with his assistant.  He leaves Allen with four attractive daughters who have their own personal demons:  Erika Christensen as a spritely young girl who eschews college to seek a job as a production assistant for a smarmy radio producer (director Mike Binder in an engaging performance); Keri Russell as a dancing hopeful who lets stress and dieting almost end her chances; Alicia Witt as a strong-willed daughter who finds herself married and pregnant upon her college graduation; and fifteen year old Evan Rachel Wood who falls for a [...] guy and is doing her own documentary on violence and anger.  In a career rejuvenating role, Kevin Costner is great as a baseball star who integrates his way into Allen and her daughters lives.  All this is well and good, but the movie doesn't offer any information as to the disintegration of Allen's marriage and Allen actually isn't a very likeable mother or character.  While the movie's performances are entertaining, the end result is less than ingratiating.</p></body></html>

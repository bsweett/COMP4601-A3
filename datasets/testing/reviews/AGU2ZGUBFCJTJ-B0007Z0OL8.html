<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - 'Team America', (...) Yeah!"></head><body><p>Any film that has the White House publicly denouncing it has to be big, doesn't it? Leave it up to Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the consistently irrelevant South Park series on Comedy Central, to set off not only the radical politically-oriented activists of Hollywood, specifically Sean Penn who wrote an op-ed basically saying "f--- you" the film's creators, but the current administration at well. Though one has to agree with the White House's statement that the current war on terrorism is far from what one would call a comical matter, perhaps they were more irked about the look-alike of Bush in the film's poster. Whether they like to admit or not, many view President Bush this way, whether it be his supporter or detractors, and with Election Day less then three weeks away, perhaps its best if we all take some time off, relax, and divert our minds away from the current political climate if only for two hours.<br /><br />The story for Team America: World Police is a comical take on the current war on terrorism and how both sides of the political spectrum have viewed it since September 11th. Team America, the governing police force of the planet dedicated to bringing terrorists to justice any which way possible, learns, thanks to their computer network known as I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., that a group of Middle-Eastern terrorists, under the control of communist dictator Kim Jong Il unbeknownst to the crime force, has gotten their hands on weapons of mass destruction, which they plan to use to bring chaos to the world. In order to stop them before they enact their devilish plan, Team America recruits a rising Broadway actor Gary Johnson, quite possibly the best in the business (with the exception of his hero, Alec Baldwin), to disguise himself as a Middle-Eastern terrorist and infiltrate the secret organization to unlock their plans. It's a race against time to stop the power hungry Kim Jong Il and bring an end to his fiendish plot before every country on the planet is brought into what he calls "the perfect balance". The story for Team America: World Police fails to exist, or at least longer then first thirty minutes of the feature, but, as was case with South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the audience its intended for doesn't care that much as long as the film makes them laugh, which its sure to do, in one sick twisted way or another. Though Trey Parker and Matt Stone do take their jabs at the "arrogant" jerks of the world's police force, their true black vendetta seems to be squarely with the radical liberal activists in Hollywood. If you hate any one of these hippies, or you just enjoy seeing puppets blown up, this is definitely a must-see film, for the last twenty minutes at least. Here's one question to ponder though: What the Hell did Matt Damon do to piss these guys off? Michael Moore is understandable (besides being a socialist whiner, he apparently placed a cartoon in Bowling for Columbine that was made to look like it was done by the South Park guys, which it wasn't) but Matt Damon? How about them apples?!<br /><br />Another conventional concept Team America lacks is a generalized cast make-up - there may be a specific cast list on IMDB but considering it's a lengthy roster of individuals who few, if any in the general populous, know anything about, it isn't worth wasting ink over. But ditching cinematic canon isn't a new development for the South Park creators, so it isn't surprising for them to make their project work in spite of that clear fact. Gary Johnston, one of the best actors in the world, one who hides a dark secret he has kept since childhood, is the landmark hero of Team America and lampoons the basic "Ben Affleck-esque" heroes presented in the Bruckheimer extravaganzas such as Pearl Harbor (a film so bad the film dedicates a song to it) and Armageddon. There was one particular scene, more actually but in an effort to not give away too much we'll narrow it down to one, will have many people wrenching. At the beginning of the movie, Gary is discovered by the head of Team America in a Broadway stage show known as "Lease". "Lease", a take on the Broadway musical "Rent", features the song "Everybody has AIDs", and while it was intended as off the cuff humoristic take on the homosexuality of Broadway actors, it bordered on the line of  complete insensitivity and wasn't necessary. Sarah, whose finance is killed by a Middle-Eastern terrorist while on a mission in Paris, France, is the foxy team member that falls head over strings for Gary, though she desperately tries to fight it early on. The scene that will be talked about the most, whether it be at the water cooler or the high school lunch room, is the one that was under the most scrutiny when it was presented to the MPAA for the film's rating decision. There's no simple way to describe it other then to say it will either have you rolling on the floor laughing or racked with disgust. Just be forewarned, if you don't enjoy seeing puppets, or the more politically correct term would be the mechanically impaired, bang each other every which way for what seems like the longest twenty seconds in cinematic history, once you hear the words "I promise you I will never die" come from Gary's mouth, better cover your eyes quickly before being scarred for life. Chris, a no nonsense martial-arts expert, gives Team America the seriously needed attitude adjustment it deserves ("Let's make this interesting ... You lose!") and kicks major marionette butt in the process. Kim Jong Il, the vicious North Korean communist dictator, works extremely well when he's on screen, almost all of his scenes are gut-busters (both literally and figuratively), but he does have his fair share of problems. Specifically, the main problem is that he doesn't get as nearly enough screen time as he should. He's quite possibly the funniest character in the entire film, possibly because he sounds so much like Cartman from the South Park series, but only makes appearances sporadically throughout the feature. Granted this film is suppose to be about the heroes of Team America but with a villain as incomprehensible as Kim Jong Il, why not focus on him more? One can only hope more will appear in the unrated edition of the film's DVD release six months from now.<br /><br />Overall, Team America won't persuade anyone to vote for a particular candidate this November, which, if you're from a swing state, you're pretty much sick of both by now, but whether you're a "right-wing nut job" or a liberal "wiener", you'll find something to laugh at in this film, one side more then other. On the last episode of 60 Minutes, you know - the program that faked the Bush National Guard memos, Andy Rooney, for what seems like the first time in years, actually made sense when he stated that those who haven't decided who they are going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election by now are idiots. Though that may seem harsh, in essence, he's right and an impertinent comedy such as Team America: World Police should have no profound effect on anybody's political affiliation. As Trey Parker and Matt Stone themselves said upon releasing this film, if anyone comes out of this film, or a Michael Moore documentary, basing their political decisions on what they have just seen, they shouldn't be voting. This film is for pure entertainment purposes only and should not be taken seriously by anyone with a brain, let alone some decent common sense. Let's be frank - Team America: World Police is in no way shape or form a feature that should ever be viewed by children under the age of fifteen even with the consent of parents. There's enough foul language, vomit, excessive violence, and puppet sex to make the most immature high school flunky blush. The film, as irrelevantly hilarious as it may be at times, has its share of problems that make it far from being one of the best films of the year, let alone one of the top-rated comedies of the season. Team America seems to be betting too much on a one-trick pony - whether it be blowing everything up in site with as many big explosions as possible or doing stupid things, such as martial-art fighting, involving marionettes. What seems humorous at first eventually becomes amusing then cute ultimately falling into the area of just flat-out annoying and this is only after about forty minutes. Though it does work out in the end, this film should never have made into theaters and would have been bettered suited to a special presentation on either Comedy Central or HBO, and perhaps cut down by about thirty minutes. The parody of modern musicals may have worked brilliantly for South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut but it doesn't here almost at all. Though some of the songs are worth a few chuckles here and there, namely Kim Jong Il's "I'm so Lonely" (the online R-rated clip version was way better), they don't do anything for the film and really drag the film down. Bottom-line, if enjoy seeing mind-less peace-harping losers such as Michael Moore, Martin Sheen, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover, Helen Hunt, Matt Damon ("Matt Damon!"), and others getting smashed, bashed, and blown-up in anyway possible then this is the worth the price of at least matinee performance alone. With only three more weeks until four more years, take some time off from back-breaking political labor to relieve pressure from those infuriating fanatic left-wing activists.</p></body></html>

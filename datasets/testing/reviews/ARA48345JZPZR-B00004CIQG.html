<meta name="summary" content="One of our Generals.....well, he went a little funny...."></head><body><p>It is so easy to review great movies. All I have to say is see one of the best movies ever made. It influenced an entire generation of filmgoers and film-makers.<p>If you think this material is dated, just think &quot;missle defense shield&quot; and remember that several thousand nuclear warheads are still targeted on us and they are in the control of a country that seems, at times, on the verge of being out-of-control. We are still in the grip of the madness of nuclear weapons and the fraility of human beings who create and control them.<p>That such a serious topic could ever be the basis for one of the funniest movies ever made is still staggeringly ironic. This directorial tour-de-force, by itself, insures Kubrick's name will always be in the pantheon of world-class artists. It is so brilliantly photographed and composed, and it is so economical! It tells a big story deftly and surely, without a missed note.<p>Peter Sellers is superb in 3 roles. Absolutely on the mark as President Muffley, Group Captain Mandrake, and, of course, the title's namesake, the misbegotten Dr.Strangelove with the unrepentant Nazi arm with a mind of its own. The other great performance is Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, followed closely by Slim Pickens as Col. &quot;King&quot; Kong. I don't believe time has been as kind to George C. Scott's Gen. Buck Turgidson. I love Scott as an actor, and it is a good comic performance, but it borders too much on slapstick and edges awfully close to over-the-top. When you compare it to Seller's economy and precision (yes, even as Strangelove...it's a controlled performance) and Hayden's dead-on, deadpan delivery I think Scott's performance is revealed as more mannered &amp; superficial. But, a minor digression from a wonderful cast and film, and a matter of taste.<p>One of the all-time great comedies about the end of the world! What more is there to say? Just see it! And, if you have already seen it, see it again. It is a timeless Classic!<p>And by all means, let's make sure there is never a mineshaft gap!</p></body></html>

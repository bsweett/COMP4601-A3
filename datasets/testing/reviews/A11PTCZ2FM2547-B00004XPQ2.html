<meta name="summary" content="Timeless Entertainment"></head><body><p>I have to confess, this is not my first review of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI.  Way back (and I mean waaaay back) in college, my freshman English Composition teacher informed her students for extra credit she would welcome a critique of this movie, which was showing over the weekend on one of the local TV channels.  I had heard of the film (which had been theatrically released some twenty years before), but had never seen it.  "You will be pleasantly surprised," my instructor advised.<br /><br />And I was.  After viewing this David Lean epic, I eagerly wrote a two-page critique (which I still have, somewhere).  I don't remember what kind of a grade I got. . .I only remember how impressed I was with this sweeping, grand tale of honor, duty, grit, and madness.  And having just seen this movie again, I continue to be impressed.  This Oscar winner is as timeless in its entertainment value today as it was three decades ago, or five decades ago.  Like the bridge itself, Lean patiently builds this story to a remarkable climax, an absolute showstopper.<br /><br />No need to summarize the plot; it's been thoroughly and impressively presented on the product page.  What bears repeating is this is a hauntingly beautiful film where antagonists suddenly find themselves completely and irrevocably interdependent:  the Japanese need the British POWs to build a railroad bridge over the River Kwai; the Brits need this project, this bridge to aid their enemy, to stay busy, focused, and boost their morale.  And yet, so ironically, a special forces team has been dispatched to destroy this interdependency; all these components explode (pardon the pun) when brought together, when hard decisions have to be made in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Alec Guinness is absolutely sensational as the stubborn, by-the-book leader of the POWs; I've seen this great actor in several movies, yet this will forever remain his signature role.  Jack Hawkins, William Holden, and Sessue Hayakawa are exceptional, too.  David Lean (who, curiously enough, was not even the studio's first, second, or even third choice for director) has achieved cinematic immortality with THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, a masterpiece that fluidly transcends the generations.<br />--D.

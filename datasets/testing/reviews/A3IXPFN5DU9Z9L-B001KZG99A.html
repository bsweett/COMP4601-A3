<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man Will Rock Your Socks Off"></head><body><p>Iron Man is witty, well-paced, superbly crafted, finely acted and packed with satisfying action sequences.<br /><br />I must admit, I was only dimly aware of the existence of Iron Man before this movie was released. Now I think he's the coolest super-hero ever, which is a testament to just how great this movie is.<br /><br />The supporting cast is solid, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr. His Tony Stark is simply perfect -  he's an affable, arrogant womanizer, confident to a fault. As heir to a fortune made from arms sales he has no difficulties performing the mental acrobatics necessary to rationalize his role in facilitating fatalities. Downey is simply fun to watch - he makes the so called 'slow' segments, where he is maturing into his superhero role while building the suit, snappy and exiting.<br /><br />The single disc edition include some extended scenes but you'll have to put down a few dollars more to get the full set of extras on the 2 disc ultimate edition. Either way, you might as well take your socks off before you press 'play'. Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

But I will do my best to tell you how this movie has affected me. Every one of you has seen this film. The whole world has seen this film. There is nothing I can say to those millions of you who have seen this All I can do, is give you my review.<br /><br />I will not go into detail. You already know every scene, every line. I just really wanted to have my say posted by Amazon.<br /><br />The obligatory `cliff note' is Tom Hanks plays the part of a mentally challenged man whose life interacts unwittingly with persons of fame and politics.  He has no ides of the impact he has in people's lives. and simply sees the world `as it is', and yearns for the love of his life, his Jenny. In fact, everything he does, is driven by his love for Jenny.<br /><br />You will never EVER see a better performance by Gary Sinese, as the physically and severely soul wounded Lt. Dan. EVERYTHING he has done since this movie, is compared to this role. Robin Wright Penn will never have a role as perfect as she had as Jenny, the woman he has loved since childhood, but shuns him repeatedly, in search of her own life. And as to Tom Hanks? Well, he is one of the premier actors of the modern era, and his performance in Forest Gump eclipses even his role in `The Green Mile' (my other favorite film). Hanks so `under-plays' his simple-minded Gump character, to the point of diamond brilliance. In the end, he finally get's his life's desire, and hears the words he waited for his whole life, from Jenny..."I love you". And then, she is sadly gone. But we get a glimpse of a whole new beginning in his life, with his son (played by Haley Joel Osment).<br /><br />Yeah, I know there is nothing new in this review that really describes the film. My point was, is, watch this movie on DVD as often as you can. Not only will it enthrall you, it may just make you a better person. The emotion in this film is so tangible, if it does not make you weep at the human condition, than you have no heart.</p></body></html>

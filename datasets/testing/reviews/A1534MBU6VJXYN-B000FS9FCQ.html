<meta name="summary" content="An Incredible, Thought Provoking Movie And A Watershed Moment In The Comic Book Genre."></head><body><p>Anyone who views comic book movies as merely an excuse to see some lame excuse for a hero traipse around tights and a cape for two hours with an array over the top gadgets while fighting ridiculously conceived villains has obviously never seen "V For Vendetta".<br /><br />Based on the popular graphic novel by Allan Moore, "V For Vendetta" offers a bone chilling view of futuristic London set in the year 2084, created by The Wachowski Brothers, the creative wizards behind "The Matrix".<br /><br />In the year 2084, the world is at great odds. War, disease, discrimination and violence are at an all time high, especially in the U.K., which is under the control of the sadistic Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) and his secret police. Citizens of London have no basic freedoms. They are oppressed by their totalitarian government, almost brainwashed to a degree. Little do they know, one man is out to change all that.<br /><br />That man is a masked agent going by the name of V (played magnificently by Hugo Weaving). Inspired by the legendary Guy Fawkes, V is thought of a terrorist by many, as his tactics often involve endangering lives and going to great extremes to achieve liberation. When V saves the life of working class girl Evey Hammond (the always captivating Miss Natalie Portman), V offers her a chance to join him on his crusade for complete freedom. Evey, despite her odd attraction to this masked avenger with a great taste in the arts, is reluctant. She is not sure whether to view him as a hero or to share the viewpoint of those who view him as the villain. But when Evey realizes just how much the government has brought suffering to her fellow citizens (not to mention the memories of the loss of her family), Evey realizes V is the only symbol of freedom left in the world. She joins V, even after he manipulates, tricks and tortures her, because she knows no matter what, his methods are the last chance the world has got.<br /><br />Backed by an excellent supporting cast, "V For Vendetta" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general. The storyline, the acting, the direction, and special effects are all top notch, and make "V For Vendetta" one of the first great cinematic triumphs of 21st century cinema.<br /><br />This two disc special edition is loaded with a stunning array of drool-worthy extras, including several documentaries as well as secret access to Natalie's uproarious gangsta-rap from "Saturday Night Live". All these as well as the masterpiece that is the film itself make "V For Vendetta" a must have for anybody's dvd collection.</p></body></html>

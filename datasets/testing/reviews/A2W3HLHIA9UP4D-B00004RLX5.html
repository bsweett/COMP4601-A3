<meta name="summary" content="2.5 Stars: Good humor, but  with dumb plot"></head><body><p>I can understand what the writers of Star Trek IV were trying to do: Make a film more lighter and yet create an epic adventure. In theory, this sounds good, but with a plot like this one, I can't say I'm happy with the overall result. Now, don't get me wrong, back in the day, there were pretty crazy plots in the original Star Trek series. Need I mention Season 3's "Spock's Brain"? I'll spare re-telling the whole story of this film, undoubtly, you already know it from other reviews, but in a nutshell, the crew has to go back in time to get extinct humpback whales or the future Planet earth is destroyed. If you think that's funny, note that all of this is determined by the crew by themselves in oh...about a minute and half!!!! Basically, this plot just seems so over-the-top dumb, espeically for a major motion picture that includes a bigger audience rather than just the die hard Star Trek fans who would probably enjoy the movie if the story was about the crew having a slumber party. I can't believe that many fans are calling this film the best in the series. The saving grace of this film is the humor. There are some great scenes with Kirk and Spock, as well as Scotty, in then present-day San Fran. doing their best "fish out of water" routines. Really good humor, I must admit. But maybe someone should have spent a little more time on the overall STORY of the film rather than just adding humor. It's almost like they wrote the story specifically for humor, rather than just writing a good story and injecting humor in it. Hey, if you want to add humor, add some humor. If you want time travel, go for it, I'm all for time travel..but whales?? Give me a break....to quote the movie, I think someone took "too much LDS" when they were writing the script!</p></body></html>

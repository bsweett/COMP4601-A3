<meta name="summary" content="A bizarre yet delightful love story"></head><body><p>I watched this movie recently per a friend's recommendation, when it actually came out I did not have any interest as I am not a big Jim Carrey fan. When I was told Carrey's performance was as good as in `Truman Show' I decided to watch it.<br /><br />The movie basically tells the story of  Joel and Clementine, they had a relationship that did not end well, luckily for both, there is a doctor (Tom Wilkinson) who offers an alternative to suffering from heart breaking: erase all the memories related to a person. While the premise sounds a little too weird (written by Charlie Kauffman who previously gave us `Being John Malkovich'), it establishes a very interesting possibility, what if you could do this? (There is a funny moment in which we get to see an old lady waiting for the memories of her dead puppy to be erased.. if you have suffered the loss of a dog you'll understand). The director makes you think about it for a while; yes, we do all have memories we would wish to go away, but would we do it? Is it better to forget than to face and learn from the experience? The `memory deleting' situation is definitely one of the best moments of the film.<br /><br />And it is because in Joel's `memory deleting' process (which takes the most part of the film), we get to see all their memories together... tender moments that make you realize what a wonderful relationship they had. It is in this moment in which Joel faces the fact that he may not want to delete Clementine from his head. There are other subplots related to the characters who perform the `memory deleting' which are ok but do not add anything of value to the central story of Joel and Clementine.<br /><br />While it has some funny moments the movie is not a comedy, actually Carrey's acting is superb in his character of quiet and indecisive Joel, Kate Winslet performs great as supporting Clementine in Joel's brain while his memories are being deleted.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the premise of the film, it is a very serious movie about relationships and what we learn from them. Directed by Michel Gondry (who has in his resume some of Bjork's best music videos) you can expect not only a good film but also a very interesting visual experience.</p></body></html>

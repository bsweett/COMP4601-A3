I've been excited about seeing "The Da Vinci Code" on the big screen ever since I read Dan Brown's novel. As soon as I saw the first trailer for the film, I knew it would be good...and I was right!<br /><br />In case you're one of the few people in the world who still hasn't read the book, let me give you a brief rundown of the plot: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard University professor who is in Paris for a lecture. One night he is mysteriously summoned to the Louvre by an inspector (Jean Reno) who is investigating the murder of the elderly curator, which has taken place inside the museum. The murder victim left a series of symbolic codes at the crime scene before his death, and at first Robert believes that the police have asked for his help because of his work as a symbologist. However, French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) arrives on the scene and manages to inform Robert that he is actually a suspect in the case and is in grave danger. Robert and Sophie manage to escape and work together to decipher the mysterious codes that the curator left specifically for them to find. Soon they find themselves in the middle of a mystery that dates back thousands of years and revolves around a secret society known as the Priory of Sion. As they race around Paris and London and enlist in the help of Robert's eccentric former colleague (Ian McKellen), they find themselves targets of Opus Dei, an organization sanctioned by the Vatican that is intent on preserving the biggest secret of the Catholic church, which if revealed has the potential to forever alter Christianity and much of history in general.<br /><br />I was extremely impressed with the way director Ron Howard brought Brown's novel to life. The use of flashback sequences and three-dimensional graphics to help the audience decipher the code along with Robert and Sophie was an excellent choice. The film was exciting and suspenseful from beginning to end, just like the book. The actors were perfectly cast in their roles. Hanks, Tautou, Reno, and McKellen all had great chemistry together and stayed very true to Brown's characters. Everything in the movie looked exactly the way I pictured it when I was reading the book. It was great to see so many famous European buildings and landmarks on the screen. I also thought that the film's score was wonderful and really enhanced the suspenseful moments of the movie.<br /><br />Any film that is adapted from a book is bound to omit some details and there were a few tiny things missing from the movie, but overall I think almost everything (and certainly everything important) was left intact. Howard chose to tone down a few things that he felt might offend the religious community the most. For example, I think the Bishop's role in the movie was limited slightly in the film compared to the book, and the religious officials didn't seem quite as evil onscreen as they do in print. Sophie's flashback of the "ritual" she witnessed at her grandfather's home as a child was also toned down a lot. I also noticed a few details from the film that seemed to be changed for no reason at all...in Brown's novel, Jacques Sauniere really IS Sophie's biological grandfather, but the movie explains things a bit differently. Also, why did the filmmakers choose to omit the appearance of Sophie's brother at the end of the movie? I guess it didn't really take away from the film as a whole, but the guy who is supposed to be Sophie's brother in the book was actually IN the movie...they just never mentioned the fact that he was her brother! That struck me as being kind of pointless and odd. Finally, Robert and Sophie didn't share a kiss at the end of the movie. Brown always led his readers to believe that those two characters hook up in the end...a kiss on the forehead just doesn't cut it!<br /><br />Brown's novel, while incredibly entertaining, is very poorly written in places and also lacks cohesiveness throughout. In a lot of ways, I think Howard's movie is better organized than the book...the transitions are a lot smoother and the story isn't as "all over the place" as the novel sometimes is. I still think the book is great and I encourage people to read it before heading to the theatre to see the film. There is a lot more detail in the book that couldn't possibly be included in the movie, and since there is so much going on in the film, the story might be easier for people to follow if they've read the book.<br /><br />A lot of controversy has surrounded the book "The Da Vinci Code" and now surrounds the film. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. This is just a story...fiction. There are so many theories about Jesus and Mary Magdalene and Christianity in general. Just because a person chooses to read "The Da Vinci Code" or see the movie doesn't mean they are in any way forsaking the church. It's entertainment! I think the church and its leaders just make things worse for themselves when they throw fits about things like this.<br /><br />Overall, I loved "The Da Vinci Code!" This movie couldn't really have been any better. Everyone should go see it in the theatre...it's fun, exciting, suspenseful, and it will give you a lot to think about!</p></body></html>

Tim Burton directed this film, but it is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace.  Those who are disappointed by this film probably feel so because the ending does not reach the lyrical height of &quot;Edward Scissorshand&quot; and the powerful idea of why it snows sometime in that suburban town.  I was actually thinking along those lines, wondering what wonder Burton would pull out of his hat this time, when it dawned on that this was not that sort of a movie.<p>&quot;Big Fish&quot; twists time between the present, in which old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying, and the mythical past, in which the young Ed Bloom (Ewen McGregor) has the adventures that he is always telling everybody about.  Ed has been telling stories all of his life, to the complete enjoyment and captivation of everybody who hears them, except for his son, Will (Billy Crudup).  After a flare up at his wedding, where he thinks the day should finally be about him rather than his father, Will goes off to Paris with his wife to work as a wire service reporter and stops talking with his father.  But then the old man's health takes a final turn for the worse, William comes home and finally demands that his father finally tell him something about his life that is real before he dies.  Ed is not worried because when he was young he looked into the glass eye of a witch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and he knows how he dies and this is not it...yet.  <p>What I picked up early in this movie is that Will is wrong.  Ed is not a blowhard.  Forget what Billy says and listen to him tell a story.  Look at the faces of his wife, Sandra (Jessica Lange), his daughter-in-law Josephine (Marion Cotillard), and the people in the audience when Ed tells his story.  Even when they let Ed know that they already know the story, such as the one about the car and the maple tree, these women have such love for Ed on their faces.  Only Will misses the point, and apparently he takes some of the audience members with him.  But when Burton gives cinematic vision to Ed's stories we can see the magic as well as hear it.  <p>So we get to see the stories about Ed meeting Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), the circus run by Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito), his meeting Ping (Ada Tai) and Jin (Arlene Tai) during the war, and his wooing of the beautiful young Sandra (a postively glowing Alison Lohman).  Because this is Tim Burton these sequences are as fantastical as you would expect.  However, ironically, there is a moment in &quot;Big Fish&quot; where Burton goes too far and gives Will a brief glimpse of the fantasy world of which his father spins his tales.  However, that moment is a mistake, because it sets up the idea the film's final payoff might be along those lines and is at odds with both the conclusion and the overall film. <p>The trap in this film is quite clear to me now.  Audience members think they are supposed to identify with Will rather than Old Ed.  The truth is that we are supposed to identify with young Ed.  How can we not?  It is young Ed who hits the long homerun, who wins the girl, and who saves the town of Spectre.  But do not feel sorry for old Ed, because his wife is perfectly willing to climb into the bathtub with him, even when they are both dressed.  Will is the one that his been missing the magic and who realizes an ephihany when he proves himself to be his father's son.</p></body></html>

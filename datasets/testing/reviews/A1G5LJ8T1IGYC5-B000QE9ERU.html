INSTEAD, A RUTHLESS CRIME BOSS [JOHN TRAVOLTA] DECIDES TO KILL FRANK AND HIS FAMILY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DEATH OF HIS SON AT THE HANDS OF AN FBI BUST. FRANK SURVIVES AND DECIDES TO GET VENGEANCE AGAINST ALL OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS FAMILY'S MURDERS. UNLIKE THE 1990 VERSION THAT STARRED DOLPH LUNDGREN, THIS ONE HAD SOME THINGS GOING FOR IT: A MUCH BETTER LEADING MAN, BETTER VILLAINS, BETTER PLOT TWISTS, AND A BETTER SCRIPT. WHILE IT HAS ALL OF THESE THINGS, ONE THING THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE PUNISHER COMIC BOOKS REMAINS MISSING THROUGHOUT MOST OF THIS FILM, SOME GOOD QUALITY ACTION! BUT OH WELL, STILL A PRETTY DECENT FILM. THE FILM GETS A LITTLE LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE, BUT THE FILM GETS BACK ON TRACK BY THE TIME ITS READY TO END. TOM JANE, SUPRISINGLY, IS ABLE TO HOLD HIS OWN AGAINST JOHN TRAVOLTA IN THIS MOVIE. THE BOTH OF THESE GUYS TOOK THE FILM BY STORM. IF YOU NEED SOMETHING TO LOOK AT, GO TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEOSTORE AND RENT THIS FILM.</p></body></html>

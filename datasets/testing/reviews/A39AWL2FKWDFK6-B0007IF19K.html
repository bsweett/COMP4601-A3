So powerful was his performance that is overshadowed some excellent acting performances.  Kerry Washington and Regina King playing respectively Charles' wife Della Bea and his girlfriend Margie were wonderful in their roles.  Clifton Powell playing his personal handler Jeff was excellent in a supporting role.<br /><br />Taylor Hackford used a good combination of story telling and flashbacks to give us insight into the tumultuous life that Charles lead.  His hardscabble early life was engineered by his hard working and concerned single mom Aretha, played terrifically by newcomer Sharon Warren.  My only criticism of the plot was the blaming of his later life personal demons on the tragic drowning death of his younger brother George.<br /><br />Charles overcame glaucoma related blindness at the age of 7.  At the urging of his mom, learned music and life skills at a school for the blind.  Taken advantage of due to his disability, his talent ultimately propelled him to musical stardom.  His music, touring on the road and bad peer influence lead him into a life of heroin addiction and promiscuity.  He eventually overcame his dependence on drugs and philandering ways.  With the help of his steadfast and loving wife Della Bea, he re-established a solid family life.<br /><br />This powerful flick was a honest look into the celebrated life of a musical phenom complete with warts.  Charles himself approved of his portrayal having seen the film shortly prior to his death.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bad Idea"></head><body><p>Normally in a disaster movie theres a half-hour to an hour where we meet the characters and get to know all about them.  It is necessary for the disaster scenario to have its full effect on the audiences.  But the clever writer for Poseidon had the great idea to meet the characters for about 5 or 10 minutes than have the big wave come.  Bad idea.  I did not even care about any of the characters.  By the end of the movie you don't really care anymore.  The special effects are stunning, but I expected a lot more from Wolfgang Peterson(Air Force One, Troy).  Don't pay to see this, rent it when it comes out.  If you want a good summer movie go see Mission Impossible 3.</p></body></html>

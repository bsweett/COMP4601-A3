<meta name="summary" content="This film adaptation is quite smart..."></head><body><p>I remember when I was a kid watching reruns of `Get Smart' all the time.  It was seriously one of my favorite shows.  Granted, I haven't seen the show in years, but the memories I have are still very fond, and so when this little remake was released I was all sorts of excited.<br /><br />It was worth getting excited over.<br /><br />Steve Carell steps into the telephone/shoes of Maxwell Smart, an agent for CONTROL who is just waiting for his chance to work in the field.  When their secret facility is destroyed by members of KAOS Smart is sent into the field alongside the beautiful Agent 99 in order to stop this evil organization.  Agent 99 is rather reluctant, since this would be Smart's first mission and he is a bit of a klutz, but she has no choice.<br /><br />What follows, is awesome.<br /><br />I can't even count how many times I laughed throughout this hilarious romp, for just about every joke lands and just about every thrill actually thrills.  Carell is just superb as Smart, giving him this charming quality that I didn't think he could pull off.  I am not the biggest fan of Carell's, but my friends love him.  I just never got his humor.  This changed my mind about him.  Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson is actually really funny here.  I've been impressed with his acting since first seeing him in `The Rundown'.  Sure, he hasn't chosen remarkable films to make, but he is a far better actor than a lot of those `rapper turned actors' we have floating around almost every movie.  Alan Arkin is memorable as the Chief.  His quick wit and sharp delivery elevate his scenes.<br /><br />The film belongs to Anne Hathaway though.  She is funny and charming and seductive and luminous as Agent 99.<br /><br />This girl is just having the best year ever, seriously.  A few years ago she was taking a backseat to everyone she filmed with, and now she is outshining her co-stars and raking up some impressive awards (for her performance in `Rachel Getting Married', a film I am so anxious to see).  I have been a fan of hers since `The Princess Diaries' (yes, I saw that) and thought she was stellar in both her Oscar contending films (`Brokeback Mountain' and `The Devil Wears Prada') so I am thrilled to finally see her getting the honorable mentions instead of everyone around her.<br /><br />`Get Smart' is very funny and very entertaining.  My one complaint is that it does feel about twenty minutes too long.  The ending could have been trimmed a tad (this is a family comedy, not a baity drama...short and sweet is the name of the game) but that isn't to say that the last twenty minutes isn't enjoyable.  It is still funny and action packed, and it adds to the story (twists, oh there have to be twists) but it does feel as though it is dragging a bit.<br /><br />That is my only complaint though, and the film still gets a very excitable B+, maybe even an A-.  It is fun for everyone and a film I wholeheartedly recommend.</p></body></html>

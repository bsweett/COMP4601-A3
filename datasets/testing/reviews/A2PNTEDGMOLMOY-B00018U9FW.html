<meta name="summary" content="Predictable Yet Hilarious Jack Black Flick"></head><body><p>Whether you agree with any given review of "School of Rock" is determined entirely by whether you are a fan of Jack Black or if you think he is the most annoying actor working today.  Full disclosure -- I love his work, just as I generally can't stand the films of Adam Sandler or David Spade.  (You realize that you really, really need to get a life when you realize you have just participated in a raging debate over the respective merits and flaws of "Joe Dirt," "Happy Gilmore," and "School of Rock.")<br /><br />In a role that Jack Black could play in his sleep, Black plays Dewey Finn, a slacker whose dream is to be a God of Rock.  (As a child of the 70s, I knew a few guys liks this -- the kind of guy who can't study for a history final but has memorized all the liner notes for every Metallica album.)  A talented guitarist who is too in love with the music, Finn is booted out of his band after too many 20-minute solos and unsuccesful stage dives.  And all just before a Battle of the Bands is scheduled, with a hefty purse.  In the life of Dewey Finn, this rises to the level of tragedy.<br /><br />To make matters worse, his best buddy's girlfriend has shrewishly demanded that Finn be kicked out of their apartment for the mere fact that Finn does not pay his share of the rent. Wonder of wonders, Finn intercepts a phone call meant for his buddy (a substitute teacher, whom Finn hilariously keeps referring to as "temping") from the uptight principal (Joan Cusack) of the most exclusive school in town.  Thinking quickly, Finn is soon on board as the substitute in his friend's place -- at least he can get the paycheck and keep his corner of the apartment.<br /><br />As can be expected, the class is a bunch of wonderfully cute, very talented kids who have all creativity stifled by the school and their uptight parents.  But in a fit of inspiration, Finn concocts a scheme to have these kids be his band (he will of course sing lead vocals and play lead guitar) so he can enter the Battle of the Bands.<br /><br />Here is where the movie takes off.  The kids all ring true, and Finn exercises a lot of creativity to make sure that all 20-odd kids have roles in the band, even if they can't play an instrument.  And the kids who can play an instrument or sing are pretty darn good.  In perhaps the movie's most touching component, Finn realizes that while he can teach these kids a lot about music ("Rock History," "Rock Appreciation and Theory," etc.), he can learn a lot from them, too.  And he doesn't learn sappy "lessons about life" -- he learns that these kids are gifted musicians who can teach him more about music, as well.<br /><br />As charming as the kids are, this is Jack Black's picture from start to finish.  His inherent mania for rock music is apparent in every scene, and Black may have the most devious set of eyes in film today.  Contrary to W.C. Fields, who said that no actor should ever work with kids or animals, Black is also very comfortable working with the kids, treating them with a nice balance of respect and disdain that seems very true to his character.  The delightful Joan Cusack gets some nice moments as the repressed principal with a Stevie Nicks fetish, but this isn't her meatiest role.<br /><br />A genuinely funny movie that has a conventional plot (is there any wonder whether these kids will get to play in the Battle of the Bands?), "School of Rock" is a fun entertainment.  Surprisingly kid-friendly (I expected more profanity) without being mawkish, this movie offers a good balance of cliche and originality that makes it worthy of the film library.</p></body></html>

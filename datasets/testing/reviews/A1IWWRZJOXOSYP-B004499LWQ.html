<meta name="summary" content="Sweeter"></head><body><p>"Closer" is a heavyweight breathtaking drama that rivets the viewer's attention.  The characters are not entirely likable, although each is eminently watchable.  Director Mike Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director for "The Graduate" in 1967 and has been nominated 3 other times for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1966), "Silkwood" (1983), & "Working Girl" (1988).  Along with films like "Primary Colors" and the TV mini-series "Angels in America," he has an unparalleled ear for dialogue.  No, it's not particularly pleasant.  No, these are not the people your pastor hopes you will be.  But each of these characters represent needs and desires that are shared by most people and are as confused by them as are many.  Patrick Marber's screenplay adaptation of his stage drama is heart-wrenchingly truthful.<br /><br />Of the four strong performances here, the most revelatory for me was Julia Roberts' portrayal of American photographer Anna living in London.  She is selfish but has a conscience.  She takes what she wants, but tries not to admit to it.  In the scene with Larry where she breaks up her marriage, it is some of the best screen time of her career.  When Larry grills her on the details of her sexual relationship with Dan, her zinger about the taste of his semen, "It's like yours only sweeter" is like a bullet shot from a gun.  It recalls the Elizabeth Taylor line in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," "You can take it; you married me for it."  It is utterly fearless and brilliant.  What a raw amazing performance!<br /><br />As Dan, Jude Law turns is an edgy self-effacing performance that adds to his reputation as one of the great young actors.  His scenes with Natalie Portman are enhanced by their similar pairing in "Cold Mountain."  On camera, Law is magnetic.  As Dan, the writer of the newspaper obituary column, he turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.<br /><br />Clive Owen is amazing as the strong less-than-sensitive type.  His internet sex dialogues with Jude Law's Dan posing as Anna on the computer are as intense as they are manipulated.  When he sits in the aquarium with Anna and with tremendous embarrassment learns the truth, he admits, "He certainly can write!"  In the scene with Julia Roberts he bellows "I'm a caveman."  It seems to typify the heart of "Closer," investigating these very primal sexual urges we have and how they interweave with the emotional attachments we call "love."  Owen was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role and won the Golden Globe Award.<br /><br />As Alice, Natalie Portman turns in an amazing performance.  Her character seems somewhat beyond reach, but she works the territory masterfully, exploring each need and nuance as if it were a beautiful discovery.  Portman was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar and also won the Golden Globe Award.<br /><br />Damien Rice's song "The Blower's Daughter" is an interesting DVD extra with that riveting chorus, "Can't take my eyes off of you."  It's the perfect love song for this film, part pure love and part compulsive addiction.  Mike Nichols has worked with an excellent cast and polished this dialogue to perfection.  The rhythms build and twist and the lovers attract, repel, trust and betray.  It does not so much build to an inevitable conclusion so much as it feels like we've followed the characters through a very intense period of life.  This is a film that will be watched and discussed for decades.  Bravo!</p></body></html>

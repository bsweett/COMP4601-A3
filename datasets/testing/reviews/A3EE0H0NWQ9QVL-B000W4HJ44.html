This exuberant remake of the John Waters' musical is funny, fast, and fabulous. Adam Shankman's direction is appropriately lilting in the right measure, but balanced with social commentary highlights.  Unlike 'Dreamgirls,' there are no Oscar worthy performances, but the production is so fun there doesn't have to be.  The entertainment is winning on every level, and, as for the songs, it never goes limp.<br /><br />Once again we are transported to the early sixties in Baltimore, where flannel is uniform, Blacks and Whites are segregated, and beehives are in fashion.  The plot is fairly simple:  Overweight teen Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) wants to break the mold on her favorite TV program "The Corny Collins Show" (an "American Bandstand"-like feature) while discovering a more urgent need to end segregation on a show that only sometimes features "Negro Night".  She gets her big break when teen singing sensation, Link Larkin (Zac Efron) makes advances that bring her to the stage floor.  In the meantime, her success is challenged by the show's program manager, (played with overbearing skill by Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter,  Amber, the show's reigning "Miss Teenage Hairspray," a nasty nemesis .  Joining forces with her Afro-American friends, especially Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) and dancer Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), she works for equal time on the dance floor.<br /><br />`Hairspray' is set as perfect entertainment.  John Travolta provides likable loopiness as Nikki's mother while he dances and cross-dresses his way into our hearts.  The villains are nasty enough, and the sweetness pervades even amongst important demonstrations on key social issues.  When it all comes down to balance, 'Hairspray' fills the bill.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Second best superhero sequel...Spiderman 2 is the best."></head><body><p>With the success of the first X-Men, and the Spider-Man movie, it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made.<br /><br />In a spectacular action sequence that opens the movie, the President is attacked and threatened by a mutant.  Professor Xavier sends is Senior pupils to track him down. When they do, they find that there is something very wrong about the whole situation.  Soon after, the school is attacked and the mutants get split up and venture across the country.  Magento, still imprisoned in a plastic cell, finds a way to escape and join up with Xavier's group.<br /><br />Everyone returns from the first movie and some other mutants from the long running comic series are introduced.  Colossus crashes into the story line, but is all too quickly shoved aside, a shame considering his popularity in the comic.  A young but brash Pyro comes on the scene with an obvious pre-disposition of becoming evil.  But the most impressive is Nightcrawler, played with complete bravada and emotion by Alan Cumming.  Brian Cox plays William Stryker, the Government scientist bent on destroying the mutants through his resources in the military.  He plays a bad guy so well you love to hate him.<br /><br />The story and characters are solid and riveting.  All returning actors play their roles with comfort and stride.  All are given plenty to do.  Along the way story lines weave in and out of one another.  The attraction between Jean Grey and Logan heats up, as well as with Rogue and Bobby (Iceman).  Storm and Nightcrawler form an obvious bond as she reassures him that he can belong in society while he sparks her desire to have faith in God.<br /><br />The action scenes are fantastic and brutal in some places, especially with Wolverine in full fighting mode, he doesn't care if he kills anyone.  The movie works it's way into a tragic ending that leaves the story open for another chapter, one that fans of the comic are well aware of and are most likely hoping will be continued.</p></body></html>

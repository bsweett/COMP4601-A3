The film is purely Hitchcock and the quintessential Hitchcock picture. Nothing ranks a greater thrill, suspense, or paradox of a film noir than Psycho. Understandably, Psycho scared a lot of people. It's best to see Psycho with another person, if you can. The prime difference between Psycho and The Exorcist is breeding from technique for suspense. While The Exorcist may seem slightly overdone and macabre, Psycho is rather done much subtly with care in a restrained way. That is what makes Psycho so scary, not too abaxial when compared to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Easily ranks Hitchcock's best, Psycho is one of the handful best films and one of the most important in cinema history. It's hard to think of Hitchcock without thinking of Psycho. I am gravely disappointed that the Academy Award failed to nominate Anthony Perkins for the Best Actor, let alone a win. Anthony Perkins will forever be known as Norman Bates. Oh man, Anthony Perkins was flawless in his performance....truly a tour de force. He was simply the catalyst of Psycho. The movie worked because of him. It also worked because of Alfred Hitchcock. How could he not win the award for Best Director? After forty-six years, Psycho ranks probably top two scariest films, top five most thrilling films, top fifteen best movies, and top ten film noir made. Psycho is all Hitchcock and all brilliance. There are too many beautiful shots and several landmark scenes. Without question, Psycho is a phenomenal film.<br /><br />5/11: Alfred Hitchcock gets pissed off when he loses the title Master of Suspense to Henri-Georges Clouzot after Les Diaboliques gets made, so what does he do? Go on and make a film that would become world-wide famous. Of course, fifty-one years later, Psycho is a timeless horror classic. Anyone can see it and be still frightened by the results. It's not so gruesome as it appears, but rather it is adroitly filmed enough to produce shock waves. That's why the film becomes so good for it. And that's why Alfred Hitchcock is regarded as one of the most brilliantly technical directors ever. Once again, and very shocking, Anthony Perkins never won the Oscar for his masterpiece of acting. All in all, Psycho is the film to see and best to be done so in the dark.</p></body></html>

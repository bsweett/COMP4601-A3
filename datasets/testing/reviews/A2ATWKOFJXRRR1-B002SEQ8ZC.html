I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esque rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...<br /><br />Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC3W">The Happening</a>) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKLW">Crash</a>) adds to this sense.<br /><br />Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTFFO0">The Dead Girl</a>) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why?<br /><br />The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.<br /><br />This isn't <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWF8">Wall-E</a> or some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUP4">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> and you'll be closer, but not quite there.<br /><br />The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.<br /><br />The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.<br /><br />This is something to watch and ponder. But not with the kiddies. This is a thought-provoking animated film for adults and teens.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>Matt Damon is back as the highly trained assassin Jason Bourne. He tried to retire, he really did, but when his dear Marie gets killed as a result of a breathtaking chase through the streets of an Indian town, he is back to trying to find out what he had done in the past, and for whom. He finds out.<br /><br />A neat twist is that the supervisor in charge of the project of "resolving" Jason Bourne is a woman, one of those super-bitches who walk all over everyone to prove she's at least as tough as any man. Yeah, right. However, it does make it all the easier to root for Bourne to show her up. He does, of course. The scene I liked most was when he called her to tell her his terms for coming in out of the cold. He said to send Nicki, the operative who had run things in Paris. She says, "Suppose I can't find Nicki?" "You shouldn't have any trouble," he counters from his perch on the next building, "She's standing right next to you." The way the blond bitch suddenly turns to the window, genuine shock registering on her face, is terrific. Imagine a big-time CIA boss who stands in front of open windows!<br /><br />The pace is unrelenting. Seldom is there a scene that runs in human real-time, allowing the audience to know what the heck is going on. An amazing fight scene between Bourne and another of these highly specialized killers is extended to the point where frankly, it is pretty literally unbelievable. No one could survive and keep fighting the way these two do.<br /><br />So who do each of these people work for, and what are they up to? I suppose the point is that in CIA operations, you don't always know. But it's a little too much for me. Again, one of those you are going to have to play more than once to figure out what it is all about.<br /><br />If you love amazing chases and fights, if you want your action pretty literally non-stop, then this is the movie for you. Not for me.</p></body></html>

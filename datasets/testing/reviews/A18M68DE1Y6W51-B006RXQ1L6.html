<meta name="summary" content="Renee and Catherine Roar!"></head><body><p>Bob Fosse was such a larger-than-life talent, and this exuberant adaptation of his Seventies stage production shows it. The story of two murdering femme fatales (Renne Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both belting out songs and dancing their hearts out) in Prohibition-era Chicago is cynical, jaded, beyond belief--and just right as a vehicle to showcase the stars' considerable talents in an area where we did not expect to see them.<p>Picture Richard Gere, a hotshot lawyer who represents both ladies, singing and dancing while keeping his cynical persona intact, and you have an idea of just what a romp this movie really is. Catherine Zeta-Jones, showstopping gorgeous as a Theda Bera-style vamp, is nothing less than wonderful. So is Queen Latifah, who steals the show as the bribe-taking, seen-it-all matron of the women's prison. I'd see the movie all over again just to see the Queen give it all she's got in full twenties regalia--including a feather boa.<p>It's Renee Zellweger, in my opinion, who ultimately makes the movie, even though the entire ensemble cast is fabulous, right down to the bit players. She does a bravura job as Roxie, the sweet little murderess who, after plugging her no-good lover with a chest full of bullets shot at point-blank range, manages to convey a frightened innocence that makes one want to hug her. Slimmed down entirely from her zaftig "Bridget Jones" days, Renee gives it all she's got, and shows that she coulda been a contender--a torch singer par excellence.<p>Wild, big, bold, with 20s-style sets and 21st-century over-the-top editing, "Chicago" is a wonderful treat, well worth seeing more than once.</p></body></html>

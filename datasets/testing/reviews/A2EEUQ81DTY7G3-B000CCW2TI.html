She's just been to her grandmother's funeral in Texas and now she's returning home to Miami, back to her job as a luxury hotel manager. While she talks her flustered assistant manager (Jayma Mays) through a minor crisis on her cell phone, she also finds time to talk with her father (Brian Cox), whom she loves dearly and constantly worries about; she can't wait to reconnect with him once she's home.<br /><br />Lisa's a solitary kind of girl, coolly professional, impeccably focused, and fiercely resolute. She's constantly living by the mantra that the customer is always right. Meanwhile, at the airport, it's dark and stormy, so the red eye flight has been delayed. Whilst Lisa waits in line at the check-in counter, she strikes up a conversation with a charming fellow passenger, Jackson (Cillian Murphy). They meet later for drinks in the airport bar and again on the plane when they discover they are seated in the same row.<br /><br />Yet there is something in the steely stare of his pale blue eyes and his overly calm manner that unnerves Lisa, although she just can't quite put her finger on it. Her hesitations are proved accurate, because it doesn't take long, right after the bumpy takeoff, for Jackson to drop his affable nice-guy pose and reveal his true colours.  In reality, Jackson is part of a terrorist cell that is planning assassinate the deputy secretary of homeland security, who will check into Lisa's hotel the next morning.<br /><br />Lisa must do exactly as Jackson instructs or a killer standing by at the Miami home of her father will murder her dad. Jackson calmly demonstrates to Lisa that summoning help from any of the airline staff or passengers will not be helpful, and will unequivocally endanger her father.  For now, she is trapped in her seat, an unwilling accomplice of this strangely Machiavellian man, who has so wickedly deceived her.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Red Eye reeks of B-grade sensibilities, more suitable to late night cable television, something perhaps on Lifetime, a sort of TV movie, rather than a fully-fledged feature film. Viewers will also have to suspend disbelief as the various machinations of the plot are played out.<br /><br />The logic of the film seems just to stretched and out of place, but luckily director Wes Craven keeps the proceedings appropriately fast-moving thanks to his expert sense of pacing and attention to detail. Red Eye gets the feeling of plane travel right, from the quiet that often descends upon takeoff to the harried flight attendants who fight to keep smiling even when annoyed, and the scenes in the aircraft have a real feeling of Hitchcockian claustrophobia.<br /><br />The acting is generally good, the standout being the lovely Rachel McAdams who makes a terrific heroine for this story, and imbues her character with just the right mix of the vulnerable and the gusty. Lisa possesses a mysterious past that Jackson manages to exploit, but she also has a fierce determination to foil Jackson's plot. Murphy is pure malevolence, using his unusual face and physical presence to suggest all sorts of nasty surprises.<br /><br />Red Eye perhaps lacks the polish and star wattage of the Jodie Foster film Flightplan, which also used airline interiors to create suspense, but this film has a slick energy and it definitely does a much better job at keeping up the suspense throughout. Red Eye is strictly B-grade fare, but it has a mischievous intelligence and enough genuine tension to make it well worth a look. Mike Leonard January 06.</p></body></html>

Not as good as the book but one fine movie!<br /><br />STORY: Jack Torrance is a person working at a hotel soon to be closed down. He and his wife and son Danny are going to take care of the hotel while closed down. But this hotel is haunted... Danny is being haunted by visions. Now, Jack has gone mad!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: Scary! I saw this when I was a kid and I got scared! THe best part is the blood coming out of the elevator!<br /><br />OVERALL: Go buy it!</p></body></html>

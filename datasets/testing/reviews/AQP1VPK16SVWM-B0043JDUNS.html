<meta name="summary" content="A good sequel that doesn't quite live up to its predecessor although the last act action makes up for dramatic shortcomings"></head><body><p>How do you follow up a highly praised popcorn flick? You add more drama, more peril and a nastier bad guy. Sometimes that mix works and sometimes it doesn't ("Batman & Robin")in the case of "Iron Man 2" the results are a bit mixed.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) the son of one of Howard Stark's collaborators on the arc reactor project uses his own father's designs for his own weapon--whip-like repulsors that can slice things in two. When Venko loses in a conflict with Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Stark's rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)breaks Vanko out of jail with the agreement that Vanko will help Hammer develop his own army of iron men to win back his military contract. Meanwhile Stark's friend Col. Rhodes (Don Cheadle)finds himself pressured by his superiors to obtain one of Stark's Iron Man suits for their own purposes.<br /><br />Stark discovers that the arc reactor that is powering his suit and keepin ghim alive is slowly killing him. He also butts heads with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who has secretly assigned one of his operatives Black Widow (Scarlet Johanssen)to keep watch on Stark and find out if he is worthy to join the Avengers initiative. Vanko has his own agenda and manipulates Hammer to give him the resources to build his own army to take out Stark.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Although "Iron Man 2" isn't quite as strong as the first film, it has more than its fair share of strong action sequences and witty one-liners. The main flaw with the film is the amount of characters and subplots stuffed into the film. Still, director Jon Favreau working from a script by Justin Theroux ("Tropic Thunder")manages to keep us interested with some truly innovative looking action sequences.<br /><br />Special features include a commentary by director Jon Favreau, animatics/illustrations of key scenes playing in picture-in-picture mode with illustrations by animation director Gennedy Tarovsky ("Dexter's Lab"), interactive "Shield Mode" that allows you to see trivia about the hardware and weaponry (as well as monitor the toxicity levels of Stark's blood) throughout the film, a documentary and a number of fine featurettes.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" may not be quite as strong as the first film but it manages to be diverting, entertaining and the strong performances from the cast make up for some of the shortcomings of the script.</p></body></html>

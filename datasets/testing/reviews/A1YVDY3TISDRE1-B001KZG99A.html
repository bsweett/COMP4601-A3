<meta name="summary" content="best action film of summer '08 (besides Batman)"></head><body><p>next to the Batman film (Dark Knight), Iron Man was by far the most enjoyable action film of summer '08.  Great cast, great script, interesting CGI, well-acted and directed.  I actually had FUN watching this in the theater.  The action scenes with Iron Man in flight were awesome.<br /><br />Downey Jr. adds just the right touch of humor/anger in the role, and Paltrow has never looked more beautiful.<br /><br />I've heard the sequel comes out May 2010....I'll be the first one in line.</p></body></html>

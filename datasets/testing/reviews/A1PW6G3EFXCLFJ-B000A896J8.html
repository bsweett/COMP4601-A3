<meta name="summary" content="A REALISTIC RIDLEY SCOTT SAND AND SWORD EPIC"></head><body><p>KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, which takes place at the time of the Crusades in Jerusalem, is a strangely low-key film considering the dramatic conflict of cultures going on during the time of the story. But somehow (and refreshingly) that seems to make it more realistic to me because dramatic and intense scenes are often more to advance the plot and are thus more artificial than representative of how people behave in real life. The movie's greatest strength is perhaps Ridley Scott's direction. The battle scenes are excellent, from the forest fight in the beginning, that reminds this viewer of the opening battle in GLADIATOR, to the siege of Jerusalem with siege towers and catapults and casts of thousands. The costumes and the sets are very realistic. For a history buff like me, it is a joy to have such versimiltude. In one scene I recall seeing a beat-up looking shield with several dents in it. That is great attention to detail. It was a nice touch in this subdued movie to have our near-mute hero Balian of Ibelin's lady love interest come riding wildly into a scene in bright clothes and then lower her veil to expose a exotically beautiful and intellgent face. Too bad the writers didn't put more of her sassiness and exotic color into KINGDOM OF HEAVEN; it could use a little perking-up. Another interesting device was the use of The Leper King of Jerusalem wearing a gold mask and being wrapped up in bandages to hide his disease. As for conflict, the Christian order of Templars, with large red crosses on their white tunics, are made the villians of the piece for wanting to fight muslims. There is a debate scene among the Christian lords where the Templars argue for war and the feeling is the Templars are blood-thirsty, evil thugs trying to stir up trouble. A few of them are even hanged for attacking muslims. On the other side, there is only a brief scene where a character approaches Saladin, the great muslim general, and reminds him of his promise to take Jerusalem. So, by weight of material, we have the muslims as basically nice fellows and some Christians as the bad guys, the implication seemingly being that they could all get along if it wasn't for warlike elements from the West. Imagine that! Well, this is Hollywood. Of course, the film doesn't tell you that the muslims had conquered Spain and had driven into France, threatening Europe with slaughter and slavery before they were stopped. But that is just a minor detail to be ignored by leftist film writers trying to get out their message and brainwash the movie-going public. The worst kind of historical fiction, whether book or film, is to wash a story about the past in the dirty water of today's politics. It is the writer's real task to tell it like it was in the past and, my friends, there are two sides to this story. Maybe, after seeing KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, which by the way I do recommend as an entertaining film and award three and a half swords out of five, you will go to the library or a bookstore and research the real story of the Templars and the struggle between Christian and muslim cultures, going on now since 700 AD.</p></body></html>

After having seen interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos in Life and Death of a Serial Killer ( a film based on personal interviews with the real "Monster" ), I realize what an Outstanding performance Charlize Theron gave. Also, heads up to the make up artists for transforming beautiful Charlize into looking strikenly like Aileen. Charlize well deserves the award she won for her performance in this true story. What a perfect pick! I have to say also that the character of Selby ( played by Christina Ricci ) was well played. As everyone must know by now, this film is a true story about America's first female serial killer. Although the movie does not go back into Aileen's ( Lee ) childhood, the viewers can sense that this woman must have had a rough life. The movie starts where she meets Selby in a bar and they soon become lovers. What Selby doesn't know is that Lee is a killer.... at least not until later in the movie. Lee spent most of her time as a highway prostitute in Florida. After being picked up and raped by a John, she murdered him and stole his vehicle. This soon became a pattern for Lee and she had to kill over and over to get both cash and a new vehicle...... for she would get rid of the other vehicles soon after she took them so she wouldn't get caught in them. After wrecking a car with eyewitnesses at the scene, a sketch of Lee and Selby were put all over the news stations and Selby began to run scared. Lee got enough money for Selby to get on a bus and leave, while Lee remained there in Florida. The police eventually caught up with her and she was apprehended at her favorite local bar. Aileen was sentenced to death for the murder of 7 men. She was executed by lethal injection. If you like true stories and don't mind violence, I strongly recommend renting and buying this movie. I've seen alot of true stories made into movies but this one has to be one of the very best ever made. Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

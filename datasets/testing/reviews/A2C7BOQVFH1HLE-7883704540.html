<meta name="summary" content="The Best Pixar Movie I've Ever Seen Now In Blu!"></head><body><p>I remember first watching this on the plane and I was blown away by it and so the moment it was released in Bluray I decided I had to get it.  I am one of those who dislikes having to pay for both a standard and bluray version when I just want one version and so it is great to get a package like this one where they don't force you to get both.  In fact, it is this reason that stops me from upgrading "Beauty and the Beast" for example among other Disney classics until I can get them on the one Bluray disc alone.  As far as this bluray release goes there is nothing not to like about it.  The picture quality in 1080p is stunning and the sound quality in uncompressed 5.1 surround sound is also excellent.  The bonus feature documentaries are great as well making this a great addition to the Pixar section of your video library.<br /><br />This great tale against discrimination and bigotry and about daring to rise beyond artificially constructed social barriers to achieve your dreams is timeless and makes this bluray watchable over and over again.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

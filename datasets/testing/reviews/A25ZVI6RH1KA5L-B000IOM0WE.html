<meta name="summary" content=""I had a family once, I had a life. Now all I have is a mission.""></head><body><p>I have vague recollections about back in the day (the early to mid 1990s I believe) when Aeon Flux, created by Peter Chung, appeared on MTV as a segment within the series `Liquid Television'...while my memory's a bit fuzzy, two aspects about the Aeon Flux segments have stayed with me over the years, the first being how stylish they appeared and the second being how confusing they seemed...(perhaps had I seen all the episodes in their respective order it'd be different).  Fast forward some ten odd years later to the 2005 release of a live action adaptation written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, both of whom worked on The Tuxedo (2002), directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight), and starring Academy Award winner Charlize Theron (The Astronaut's Wife, Reindeer Games, Monster).  Also appearing is Marton Csokas (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, xXx), Jonny Lee Miller (Mindhunters), Sophie Okonedo (Hotel Rwanda), Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects), and Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (Darkman, Fargo)...I'm curious how much MTV, who produced the film, had to shell out for two Academy Award winning actresses to appear in this feature...<br /><br />As the film, set sometime in the 25th century, begins, we learn how a virus wiped out most of the world's population some four hundred years earlier before a scientist named Goodchild finally found a cure.  Now it seems the descendants of those who survived live in a walled city under the thumb of the Goodchild Dynasty, which has ruled since the catastrophic event.  As with any society there is a group of malcontents, known here as the Monicans, whose main goal appears to be in toppling the Goodchild regime...why?  As near as I can figure they're upset with the fact that it's not unusual for people to just up and disappear, never to be heard from again, something the Monicans think the gooberment is directly responsible for (and they'd be right)...anyway, in furthering their cause, the Monicans utilize secretive, highly deadly operatives, the most skilled being Aeon Flux (Theron).  After successfully completing her current assignment, she's given the one she's been waiting been waiting for, the elimination of Trevor Goodchild (Csokas), the current leader of the Goodchild regime.  While infiltrating the gooberment facility where Goodchild resides, things turn sour and Aeon begins to question those things she originally believed, which ends up leading to an unlikely alliance.  Turns out there is something seriously wrong with the population, the answers lying within a funky zeppelin known as the Relical, which continually circles above the city.  As a power struggle within the gooberment ensues, Aeon finds herself stuck in the middle as both the Establishment, who see her as a threat, and the Monicans, who see her as a traitor, want her dead, resulting in a struggle for survival that may ultimately decide the fate of mankind...<br /><br />Overall I thought this film entertaining, but it does have some flaws.  I thought the production values excellent especially in terms of the futuristic settings and such (the `stylish' element I spoke of earlier in terms of the original series seems to have made it into the film).  I also really liked all the nifty little high tech gadgets and implants utilized mainly by Theron's character, although I thought it interesting how, by the end, everyone fell back to using what appeared to be fairly standard projectile based weaponry (I guess some things never change).  As far as Theron herself, she displayed quite a bit of athleticism, some of which I'm sure was probably helped along by the special effects department, while looking fairly sweet in her numerous, skintight outfits (actually, with her Der Fuhrer-esque hairstyle and black clothing, she sort of came off as the ultimate Emo chick, but whatever).  I think the biggest issue I had with the film was the performances seemed somewhat flat, but I'm unsure if it was a result of the actors, the director, or the material (some of the cast is just plain wasted, like Frances McDormand...what was the deal with her character and that ridiculous red hair?).  Also, Theron didn't really come off as the ultimate assassin, at least when comparing her to the character presented in the original animated series, despite a good effort.  I learned quite a few things from this film including the following...<br /><br />1. Charlize Theron can catch flies with her eyelashes, which is kinda cool but also kinda gross.<br /><br />2. In the future the predominant hairstyle for men is the greasy bed head look.<br /><br />3. In the future secret messages are passed amongst people by French kissing.<br /><br />4. Charlize Theron can kill with her thighs (which wouldn't be too bad of a way to go, if you ask me).<br /><br />5. People in the future are stuck with really weird names like Oren, Una, Sithandra, and Aeon.<br /><br />6. In the future you can actually get your feet replaced with hands, which looks as creepy as it sounds.<br /><br />7. The Future is so Goth.<br /><br />8. In the future authorities are armed with highly advanced weaponry and have no problems using said weaponry to mow down innocent bystanders to get to two criminals.<br /><br />9. In the future when you get a phone call, your ears flash (no foolin').<br /><br />10. In the future when they say `keep off the grass' they ain't kidding.<br /><br />11. Despite a dumb hairdo Charlize Theron can still look hot, which isn't so much the case with Frances McDormand.<br /><br />12. Fluidic ball bearings can not only be trained to come on command but also to assemble in patterns and explode.<br /><br />13. Recycling is taken to a whole new level in the 25th century.<br /><br />14. Politicians in the future are just as skeevy and conniving as they are now.<br /><br />One aspect of the story that kind of bothered me was how the Monicans seemed to have a technological edge over the established gooberment.  They were able to infiltrate various facilities with relative ease (razor grass sounds like an effective security measure, that is until you get someone who comes along with platform shoes), keep things hidden on their person while in custody, and just generally outfox the authorities at nearly every turn.  The film does have lots of action, slick production values, a decent catfight, and I had little difficulty in following the story (what of it there was), but I couldn't say how closely this finished product resembled the original material.<br /><br />The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks very sharp and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and Dolby Surround 2.0 comes across well.  Extras include two feature length commentary tracks, one with star Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, the second with co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, five featurettes involving production of the movie, a theatrical trailer, a couple of previews, and English and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, it appears the animated series is available on DVD, so if you're interested in seeing from where the film originated, you might want to check it out.</p></body></html>

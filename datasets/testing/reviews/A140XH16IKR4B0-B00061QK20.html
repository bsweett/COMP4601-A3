Or is he hiding other motives? Are the assassins ruthless, cold murders? Or metaphysical poets of calligraphy and swordplay? A second viewing is required to absorb the subtleties of the portrayals.<br /><br />The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Each scene is saturated in a particular hue -- crimson, emerald, gold -- requiring an artist's palette to keep track of the color changes. The Chinese scenery is almost mythical in its beauty. The acting is alternately taut -- with movement kept to an absolute minimum -- and expansive, as in the many fight scenes.<br /><br />"Hero" is a movie of visual poetry, martial valor and physical tension. Though the use of wires in martial arts movies is now familiar to the point of clich&eacute;, their use in this film was astoundingly complex. The locations are extraordinary -- from a miraculously still lake to an autumn whirlwind of golden falling leaves. Thought the plot is rather spare, "Hero" is beautiful to watch.</p></body></html>

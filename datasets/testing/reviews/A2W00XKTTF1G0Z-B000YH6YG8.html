If you live in a city it makes wonder what motivates people to do what they do and how they could perform such acts of violence. If you live in rural America you wonder the same thing but are glad you don't have neighborhood rival gangs around your home. Directed by Tony Kaye - the only film I know he has done to date - there is a sense of satisfaction with the completely sad ending of this film.<p>Edward Norton does a phenomenal job as playing a kid, Derrick Vinyad growing up against all odds being thrown at him and going through the judicial system - and failing. Failing his family. After growing up in gangs and violence Edward's character goes to prison and threw several reform programs only to learn that his childhood was never a childhood. The help of Avery Brooks', Dr. Bob Sweeney, and the two travel a road down LA streets that would scare even the most indignant criminals.<p>The photography is cleverly don the best part about the film is the kid playing Edwards brother, played by Edward Furlong, gives an incredible performance right until the end. The ending is shocking and almost disgusting - but the emotional impact is very real.<p>There are not many DVD extra's on this one. There is no commentary which I would have liked to have heard from the director because apparently what I had heard is that he didn't like the studio cut of the film and filled a law suite to New Line in 1998 about not letting him use his pseudonym "Humpty Humpty" because he didn't like the final version of his film that New Line cut for him. Either way - this is a good film, but certainly not for kids under high school age - however, I think High School freshmen, should watch this for their own safety.</p></body></html>

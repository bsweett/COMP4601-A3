<meta name="summary" content="Semi-fantastic"></head><body><p>Among the first comic books I ever bought, nearly 30 years ago, was a Fantastic Four, somewhere around issue 180.  Since then, I have read the comic book off and on for years at a stretch and seen both highs and lows in the series.  In other words, I'm a long-time fan, and when before I saw this movie, I had mixed expectations.  Marvel adaptations have been all over the quality map, from the great Spiderman and X-Men movies, through the so-so Punisher and Hulk, to the wholly forgettable Elektra.<br /><br />This film falls squarely in the middle of this spectrum.  For those unfamiliar with the story, it deals with four people - scientist Reed Richards, his buddy Ben Grimm, Reed's ex-girlfriend Sue Storm and her brother Johnny - who are exposed to cosmic rays and get super powers.  As Mr. Fantastic, Reed can reshape and stretch his body as if it were rubber; Sue becomes the Invisible Girl, who also can create force fields; Johnny is the Human Torch, a living man of flame; and Ben, in a way tragically, becomes the monstrous but superstrong Thing.  Together, they are the Fantastic Four, and unlike most superheroes, they have no secret identities but instead are all well-known to the public.<br /><br />Opposing them is Victor von Doom, who sadly is one of the principal flaws in the movie.  In the comics, Dr. Doom is one of the best all-time villains (probably only behind Lex Luthor and the Joker in comic book villaindom), a genius who uses technology and a touch of the supernatural to commit his crimes.  Dr. Doom was probably a partial inspiration for that great screen villain, Darth Vader.  In this movie, he is superpowered and actually a rather routine villain, a technocrat who seems little more than a retread of the Green Goblin from Spiderman.<br /><br />Michael Chiklis, as always, does a good acting job.  Jessica Alba looks pretty but like most of the rest of the cast, is not all that great at acting.  While reasonably faithful to the comic book concepts of the characters (for example, Reed's intellectualism or Johnny's rashness), the story itself is just so-so.  I suppose a good deal of the problem is so much time is spent on the origin of the FF that we don't get much of the four acting as an actual team.  Perhaps a sequel would work better, as often happens in other comic adaptations; without wasting so much time on the origin story, we can get a better plot.<br /><br />But things aren't all bad.  The effects are good and there are some reasonably amusing or touching moments.  I credit Chiklis with a lot of these, as he makes the Thing the most interesting character (and sometimes the only one) in the movie.  If I seem harsh on this film, I guess it's because I've seen how good the comic could be and see a lot of wasted potential in the movie.  If you're unfamiliar with the comic book, this will probably be a likeable movie, but fans of the comic may be disappointed.</p></body></html>

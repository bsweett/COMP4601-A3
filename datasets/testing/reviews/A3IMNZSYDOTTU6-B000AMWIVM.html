<meta name="summary" content="'Saw' A Suprisingly Smart Horror Yarn...Uncut Even Better"></head><body><p>SAW is one of those movies it will take you repeated viewings to dissect certain parts and understand the plot and the importance of the characters, and boy are you in for one hell of a surprise ending when you see it for the first time. This is one of the best suspense horror movies in recent years, and hopefully SAW II will be no different.<br /><br />SAW tells the tale of a serial murderer known as the "jigsaw killer" who decides to kidnap two men, one is a doctor who is married to a beautiful wife and has children with her, while the other man seems very insignificant to us, not bearing any importance or meaning to us in the movie, except that he committed some kind of heinous act according to the the killer. Both of these men are put in dank room with dirty white walls and a mysterious body lying in the middle of the room (and we're to believe that it's dead). The doctor (played by Cary Elwes) is handcuffed by the ankle to a fixture, and the other man is handcuffed by his wrist, and this ultimately becomes the precursor of an evergrowing race to break free and stop the killer himself. The jigsaw killer is committing a series of grisly killings, all the while tormenting the two men he has trapped. The movie's tension builds and paramounts into a shocking and grisly climax that ultimately descends into the movie's surprise ending...you will never see this coming, trust me. It worked quite well to jolt my chill factor. And this new UNCUT edition of the movie is even more grisly. You are going to be even more repulsed by this smart horror film.<br /><br />SAW spins a web of suspense, scares, and brains into a complex and jolting thriller that most certainly will prepare you for what's to come with it's follower, SAW II. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

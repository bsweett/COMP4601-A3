<meta name="summary" content="NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!"></head><body><p>To be honest, the movie bored me.  Sure, there is "action" in nearly every other scene, but it's all incredibly predictable from beginning to end.  On top of that, Johnny Depp's mannerisms as Capt. Jack Sparrow have grown old, and Penelope Cruz is not a suitable replacement for Keira Knightley.  Not by a long shot.  Aside from Cruz, the usually cast is there: Geoffrey Rush as Barbarossa, Ian McShane as Blackbeard, the monkey as the monkey.<br /><br />Did I mention this film is roughly 43 hours long?  Well, maybe not that long, but that's how long it feels.  Honestly, how many sword fights, ridiculously complex escape plans, and identical score accompaniment can there be?  It's a revolving door of POTC, with only minor additions - some of which are subtraction by addition.  For instance, there is a mannequin missionary portrayed with concrete-settling zeal by Sam Claflin, and let's not forget Oscar Jaenada as "The Spaniard," a character so stiff it made Barbarossa's wooden run (hop) a mile.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Sparrow and an imposter Sparrow, who is rounding up a crew, meeting up and butting heads while mutually racing, along with the Spaniards, for the legendary Fountain of Youth.  The aforementioned paths' also cross with a British ship captained by a semi-reformed Barbarossa, and Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by Blackbeard and Sparrow's former lover Angelica - who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter.<br /><br />Long title, long film.  Nothing terribly new for the series, and only fans will like it a lot.  Fans of the purely aesthetic will appreciate the filming.  Some very majestic scenes on open water.  Fans of the series will probably love it.  Pirate fans will hang the movie posters in their spare rooms.  If you're not in those groups, however, it will feel recycled no matter how much misdirection and subplot is involved.<br /><br />(Note: Review title is a nod to the classic Monty Python skit and relates to this movie in a semi-specific manner.)</p></body></html>

With the Devil's Rejects he's managed to improve on some of the things that went wrong with "House".  "House" was a nice throwback to 70s horror and it took place in the late 70s as well.  The problem was if Rob wanted a retro feel, he certainly screwed it up by using that annoying rock video type editing and using his metal-industrial crap on the soundtrack.  Rejects uses tunes from the 70s, and rightfully so if that's the tone your going for.  Plus, he learned how to keep his camera still this time.  Plotwise, Rejects is still a bit of a ripoff of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but I'll certainly take a ripoff over a remake anyday.  It's easy to accept the "borrowed" plot points considering Rob's love of the genre.  It comes across more as an homage and an all around labor of love rather than just a way to line his pockets.  The same can't be said for a schmuck like Michael Bay.  In Rejects, all supernatural elements from the previous film are gone, and the focus is strictly on our main characters and the man in pursuit.  Yes, it's certainly brutal and unpleasant.  The average filmgoer might be repulsed, but genre fans will probably just have a good time with the onscreen carnage.  Horror fans will also enjoy a few cameos including Ken Foree, PJ Soles and Michael Berryman.  The true highlights of this film are Sid Haig, who like in the first film is the real scene stealer.  William Forsythe as the crazy cop is also a big highlight.  I admire Rob's use of character actors for the leads.  You can be sure that if some big studio were doing this film, we'd see Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom or some other schmuck in the lead.  Bill Moseley's character isn't as crazy this time around.  In "House" he ranted and raved and seemed more uncontrollable.  Here he's still a loon, but a bit more sane.  In the end, Tobe Hooper is still the one who got the best performance out of Moseley.  Mrs. Zombie's character is still rather annoying and I personally could have done without her.  Zombie seems obsessed with showing her buttcrack to the world.  Apparently he wants the world to see it as much as he must see it at home.  I guess he figures he's doing us all a favor.  I think it's rather pointless myself.  After seeing the buttcrack for about the fifth time, you get the urge to slide a piece of toast down there.  The end sequence is played out in slo-mo to the Skynard song, "Freebird".  I'm disappointed that Rob Zombie would be so cliche.  Come on now, this is the most overplayed classic rock song, and I certainly don't need to have it invading the films I watch.  Heaven knows I have a hard enough time dodging it in my day to day life.  These are only a few piddly complaints.  All in all this was a fun movie.  Much better than any PG-13 "horror" film currently playing in theaters now.  Though I wouldn't call this film a horror film, it's demented enough to appeal to fans of horror.  When I say "horror" I'm referring to actual horror films and not rock video movies with ghostly little girls or remakes.  Give it a shot, why doncha?  There are worse things on the video shelves.</p></body></html>

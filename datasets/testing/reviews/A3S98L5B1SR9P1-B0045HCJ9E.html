Roger Thornhill is no more a secret-agent than he is a brain-surgeon and yet he gets so believably swept into this suspenseful drama that you might think that you have missed something early on! The superb direction of Alfred Hitchcock combines perfectly with the Academy Award nominated screenplay of Ernest Lehman. The performances of Cary Grant,Eve Marie Saint,and James Mason are equally superb!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fun, heartwarming and charming... the 2004 romantic comedy looks great on Blu-ray.  Check it out!"></head><body><p>When this film came out back in 2004, I felt it was a fantastic romantic comedy. Romantic, charming and enjoyable.<br /><br />With two great performances by Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, there were many things that made this film so enjoyable.  From the beautiful locations the film was shot in New York, a funny but touching storyline but also that 80's style, may it be the clothing or the music of that time and with one of the most memorable dance scenes in a film with everyone jamming to Michael Jackson's "Thriller", "13 going on 30' is all out fun!<br /><br />Here we are five years later and with two DVD releases, the popular romantic comedy will now be released on Blu-ray.  So, I'm sure many of you who owned a previous version of the film on DVD maybe wondering, if this Blu-ray release is worth it?  Read on!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"13 going on 30' is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Video quality is clean and the film looks very good.  But picture quality is not super colorful  in terms of eye popping visuals but overall, this film looks even greater on Blu-ray.  Personally, I think this is the test transfer we will probably see of this film for years to come.  Also, with so much outdoor shots featuring both Garner and Ruffalo with their characters in different parts of New York City, Blu-ray definitely enhances the city compared to the DVD version.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby TrueHD for English, French and Portuguese and 5.1 Dolby Digital for the other language tracks.  The film is primarily dialogue and I don't recall hearing any uses of the rear channels for any outdoor ambiance for audio.  The music definitely comes out clear and pronounced and livens up the room.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"13 going on 30' is literally packed with special features.  Many of these were featured on the "Fun & Flirty Version" DVD but one featurette is exclusive to Blu-ray:<br /># Director's Commentary - This commentary features Director Gary Winick.  Winick is one of those director's that you would love to hear his commentary because he expresses his true emotion of his feelings of the film, which parts of the film he would love to have reshot and really, getting good insight on the film.  Especially the "Thriller" dance scene to the final ending.<br /># Producers Commentary - This commentary features Susan Arnold, Donna Arkoff Roth and Gina Matthews.  Each of these three women giving their tidbits of the film, working with Director Gary Winick and working with the talent.<br /># Alternate Beginning and Alternate Ending - This was surprising because the characters that played Jenna and Matt were different actors and I am so glad this beginning and ending was not used in the final cut of the film.<br /># Deleted Scenes - A total of 18 deleted scenes featured.<br /># Blooper Reel - This is a fun blooper reel of the whole cast.<br /># The Making of a Teen Dream - This was the original featurette featured on the DVD versions.  This was all about the making of the film and interviews with the director, producers and cast.<br /># Making of a Teen Dream: Another Take - This is exclusive to the Blu-ray and features more content such as Jennifer Garner actually having to do a slumber party with the 13-year-olds  as part of her research for her character.<br /># I Was a Teenage Geek Featurette - This interview features the main actors and actresses of the film talking about their high school life with high school photos and all.<br /># 1980s "Fashion Flashback" Featurette - This is more or less a fashion flashback photoshoot and dressing up people with 80's fashion.<br /># Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield" Music Video<br /># Rick Springfield's "Jessie's Girl" Music Video<br /># Video Gallery - A photo montage from scenes in the film<br /><br />The disc is also BD Live Enabled.<br /><br />"13 going on 30' is just  a fun romantic comedy that I have enjoyed countless times.  Not because I'm a child of the 80's but I really enjoyed the charming performances by Garner and Ruffalo, the overall story, the music and the awesome shots of New York City.  Everything came together for this film.<br /><br />Although considered as a "date film' or a "Girl's Night Out" type of film, as a guy who enjoyed the film, you can't help be touched because of Ruffalo's portrayal of Matt.  Guys get dumped or rejected by girls.  That close bond you have with a female friend in high school or friends period, not always last through adulthood.  And for Matty, you can literally sense the pain this guy goes through of having the girl he cared for (and eventually hurt him and abandoned him) in high school coming back to his life (especially when he's about to get married).  So, there are many aspects that a guy can relate to in this film.<br /><br />But was this film perfect?  Not really.  For music, by 1987, Michael Jackson's "Thriller", Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield", the Go-Go's "Head over Heels" and even Rick Springfield's "Jessie's Girl" were old news and were released way before 1987.  Music by that time was all about Bon Jovi, the Beastie Boys, Prince, The Jets and LL Cool J.  But of course, people who didn't grow up during that time period probably wouldn't know that, so I guess it's not really important.<br /><br />If you own the DVD, is it worth owning on Blu-ray?  Of course, the Blu-ray version is featured in 1080p and the audio is featured in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This is probably the best video and audio quality we will ever see of this film.  But are there considerable difference from the DVD version.  Not really.  You're only getting one extra special feature on the Blu-ray versus the "Fun & Flirty version" on DVD.  But if you don't own this film on DVD or if you have only the first version of the DVD, then this Blu-ray release is definitely worth it, especially if you enjoyed the film.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this film a lot.  I enjoyed it back in 2004 and continue to enjoy it now even after watching it several times.  "13 going on 30' is a romantic comedy that can be watched and enjoyed for many years to come.  Definitely check it out!</p></body></html>

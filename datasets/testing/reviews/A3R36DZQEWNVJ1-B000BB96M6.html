<meta name="summary" content="Depp and Burton are at it again...this time it's Charlie and The Chocolate Factory"></head><body><p>5 lucky kids get a chance of a lifetime. They get to go inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory by trying to find 5 golden tickets in Wonka Bars. They enter the big gate, escorted each by a parent as they walk closely to the huge factory, the voice on the speaker tells them to come to the big front doors. The door slides open and a cheerful song with dolls and stuff blows into flames...then beside them they hear clapping...they turn as they see Willy Wonka standing there clapping, cheering. Anyway, after this ordeal, he brings them into the factory. He leads them around his crazy chocolate factory where the kids see things...wonderful and strange things. Only Tim Burton can pull this off and who better then to be Willy Wonka then have Johnny Depp (Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Blow) in the drivers seat. It's hard to compare Depp's with Gene Wilder's performance in the 70's because Depp doesnt even touch Wilder's performance, he makes his own and might I say his performance is demented, dimwitted and fun. Some of the OopaLoompa songs get kinda annoying and their really tiny then the 70s version and their all played by the same guy. I think this movie put in things what the original didnt, like how did Willy Wonka come upon the OopaLoompa world and it even flashes back to his childhood where he has a strick Dentist father played by none other then the legendary Christopher Lee (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). The cast includes Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket, Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) and Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish, Fight Club) as his parents, David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) as Grampa Joe and Missi Pyle and Violet's Mother. I grew up with the 70's version but I like this one too..I cant choose which one I like so I'll just decide on liking them both equally.</p></body></html>

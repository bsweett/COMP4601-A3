<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood's best movie"></head><body><p>On paper, Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' doesn't sound like anything special. The tale of a tough girl from a white-trash background who persuades a reluctant trainer to teach her the ropes and rises from nobody to champion in double-quick time. You might think this is just another triumph-against-the-odds movie to file alongside the likes of 'Rocky', but you'd be wrong. Thanks to a strong screenplay, subtle direction and a trio of flawless performances, 'Million Dollar Baby' is much more than just another boxing film. In fact, it's one of the most impressive and emotionally involving films that Eastwood has yet made.<br /><br />Eastwood himself takes the role of Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck former boxing manager who now trains fighters a small, ramshackle gym. Frankie's right-hand man is Scrap(Morgan Freeman), who used to be a boxer before he lost an eye in the ring. One night, as Frankie is heading home from a match, he is approached by a young woman named Maggie(Hilary Swank). She believes she has what it takes to be a boxer despite her inexperience and the fact that she's already 31 years old. Frankie doesn't train girls, and he ignores her requests, but she's soon turning up at the gym every day and he can see that she's got something special. He agrees to be her trainer and it's not long before she's knocking out a series of opponents in the first round.<br /><br />A championship bout is on the horizon for Maggie, and the film seems set for a predictable climax. But after remarkable turn of events, we are hurled into a totally different movie, a much darker and more complex film than we've been watching for the past 90 minutes.<br /><br />Superbly adapted by Paul Haggis from FX O'Toole's short story collection 'Rope Burns', 'Million Dollar Baby' is a film that, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, may have slipped into melodrama or mawkish sentimentality. No chance of that here, with Eastwood's intelligent, sparse direction focused on character and story above all else. Eastwood shrouds the film in shadows and drains it of colour, until it's almost like watching a black-and-white film; Eastwood is using light and dark as an expression of the human condition and sometimes it's hard to see the actor's faces which makes the words they say take on extra resonance. Morgan Freeman's narration gives events the feel of a fable and it's impossible not to be drawn into the story and to care deeply about the characters involved.<br /><br />The three main cast members all turn in first-rate performances too. Hilary Swank, who has dropped off the radar since 'Boys Don't Cry', returns with an even better display than the one which won her an Academy Award. She takes a character who could amount to little more than a bunch of clich&eacute;s and invests her with so much heart and determination that most audience members will be rooting for her to make it. It's a gutsy, brave performance and her efforts are complemented by he co-stars. Morgan Freeman's part is hardly a stretch for him, the kind of wise compassionate character he's played numerous times before, but he is typically superb in the role.<br /><br />However, the real surprise is Eastwood himself who gives the best performance of his career. Frankie is a great character, a rugged, tough exterior disguising his big heart and humanity, and Eastwood is heartbreakingly powerful in the role. His developing bond with Maggie is convincing and never overplayed, likewise his enjoyable repartee with Freeman, and these three characters form the heart and soul of the movie.<br /><br />But if there is a flaw in 'Million Dollar Baby', it's the fact the the same care and attention hasn't been spent on the supporting characters. In particular, Maggie's monstrous trailer-trash family are all so one-dimensional that they stick out like sore thumbs when held against the subtle characterisations of the leading trio. The supporting cast elsewhere are also underdeveloped, and it's a misjudgment to have Jay Baruchel provide the gym's 'comic relief' as incompetent boxer Danger.<br /><br />However, it's easy to ignore minor flaws because this is such a wonderful film. Eastwood has proved himself as one of the finest American filmmakers and, in his 75th year, shows no signs of slowing down. 'Million Dollar Baby' is a haunting love story, a deceptively simple character study and a serious analysis of faith and redemption all at once. If you don't see it because you think it's 'just another sports film' then you'll be missing out on one of the most beautifully crafted and deeply moving dramas of the year.</p></body></html>

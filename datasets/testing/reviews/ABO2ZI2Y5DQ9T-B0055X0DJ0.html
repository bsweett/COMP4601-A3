<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 STARS) Lots of Actions, No Characters"></head><body><p>Michael Bay's "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is, in a nutshell, a special effects extravaganza without any discernible story. You get more transforming robots, but no character(s) you can relate to. There are lots of actions and battles between the good and evil, but you just can't tell which is which, watching the hectic movements of the CG-created transformers that would make you dizzy.<br /><br />The fierce fight with the Decepticon forces continues in "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen." This time the evil robots are planning something much more damaging to the Earth, and humans and autobots, or good robots, must stop them before it is too late. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox reprise their roles as Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes. Sam is going to college, leaving his gorgeous girlfriend in his hometown, but soon Sam learns that he has accidentally got a secret that the evil Decepticon leader really needs.<br /><br />Well, this is only the introduction. "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" runs about 150 minutes and the story defies easy summary simply because the story is actually non-existent. Like the two "Pirates of the Caribbean" sequels, the film takes up the story that should have ended in the original. Instead, the filmmakers have added new characters (humans and transformers), new locations and long, extended action sequences that are bigger and louder than before.<br /><br />Actually, this is not a bad thing. After all Michael Bay films (such as "Pearl Harbor" "Armageddon" "The Rock" and two "Bad Boys") have been known for actions and most of us are aware of that. To his credit, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" provides tons of actions with first-rate visual effects though I prefer less shaky camerawork.<br /><br />Sadly Michael Bay (and producer Steven Spielberg) has forgotten one important thing. Transformers are characters with their own personalities, not just machines. In the original "Transformer" the director tried to present them as characters and succeeded to some extent, in some of the scenes like comical interaction between Bumblebee (as a Camaro) and a human friend, Sam. In fact Shia LaBeouf's Sam was a pretty interesting character in the first "Transformer," but here he just sleepwalks or overacts.<br /><br />In the sequel two new smaller Autobots appear as comic relief, but they sound more like two Jar Jar Binks. More irritating is Sam's parents, especially his mom, who goes berserk in the campus. Michael Bay (and Spielberg) was never good at doing comedy and he overreaches himself when he tries to make us laugh.<br /><br />Still the film's actions and visuals are amazing and for that alone, my 2.5 stars.</p></body></html>

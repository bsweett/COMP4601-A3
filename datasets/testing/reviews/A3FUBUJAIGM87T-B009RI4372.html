<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good, but a bit overrated.  A solid three stars nonetheless."></head><body><p>Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead" is a pretty good horror movie and overall, I enjoyed watching it, but to say that this movie is above criticism simply isn't plausible.<br /><br />The movie is about five young people, probably in their mid to late 20's, who decide to venture off to this remote cabin deep in the woods somewhere.  The viewer is immediately introduced to some kind of evil phenomena as he/she watches from the evil entity's vantage point moving from place to place...I like that about the movie as I think it creates a atmosphere of pure and unalduterated evil which is stalking its unsuspecting prey.  As the movie proceeds, the audience begins to see that these five youngsters are indeed not alone and when one girl named Shelly is literally raped by the woods, strange things begin to happen.  Ultimately, Ash is confronted with a situation that involves all four of his friends (including his girlfriend whom he seemed to love) being killed and turning into some evil kind of zombie like being.  The special effects in this movie are pretty good and this provides some good but somewhat overdone extreme gore scenes.  Ash must either kill these zombies who were his friends, or he risks becoming one of the Evil Dead himself.<br /><br />Now, as I was reading the Amazon.com reviews about this movie, I was so excited about seeing "The Evil Dead" and receiving my DVD copy.  Being a strict horror movie purist and having little patience for nonsensical and corny comedy in horror movies, I probably should have been a bit more skeptical before viewing this movie.<br /><br />There is some cheap and stupid comedy in this flick, but the horror outweighs the bad considerably and I walked away after viewing this movie with a satisfied feeling that I had watched a worthwhile and entertaining horror movie.  That being said, I do not think this movie warrants the raving reviews that it has received...people that believe this is a 5 star movie cannot possibly be 100% pure horror movie fans.<br /><br />I think the overall plot is quite good, but could have been developed better.  There are some pretty good scares and gore scenes in this movie.  The acting is average and the directing is pretty good.  Nevertheless, I give this movie a 3 STAR rating and recommend it to horror movie fans, but I cannot honestly say that this movie is a horror movie classic...it is good, but it is NOT great or a classic by any means.  However, that being said, a 3 STAR rating from me is quite good because I am a rather tough horror movie critic.  I want "scary" or "horrifying" folks, not funny.  While "The Evil Dead" has some scares, it is also innundated with comedy as well.  That's just not good enough to be an all-time horror classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The love story of John and June."></head><body><p>Walk the line by Director James Mangold (I love all his movies) is a gorgeous tale of the love affair between Johnny Cash and June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are well-suited in their roles here. The film focuses mainly on how John and June met and toured together through the years and the start of their affair while he was still married to his first wife. Also talks about Johnny's addiction to pills and his unhealthy relationship with his father. Witherspoon received an oscar for her role, a much-derserved award for this talented actress. Phoenix is wonderful as well, he sure has Cash's mannerisms down to a T. John and June would eventually get married and spend 35 years in wedded bliss til their deaths took form. Walk the Line has solid writing, terrific acting, and a positive message that anyone know matter rich or poor can overcome old demons and survive. Beautiful love story, buy this film.</p></body></html>

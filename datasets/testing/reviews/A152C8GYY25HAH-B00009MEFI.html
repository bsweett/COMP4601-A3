<meta name="summary" content="Impausibe but taunt and entertaining thriller"></head><body><p>"Phone Booth" is a taunt, scary little psychological thriller. It suffers from too many lapses in logic; in fact, it is not at all plausible and depends primarily on style over substance. Still, it a fine piece of filmmaking that stands head and shoulders above recent high profile thrillers such as "Panic Room". Its best assets are a superlative performance by Colin Farrell, brilliant cinematography, and a fast pace that never once meanders into superfluous territory. <p>The story is simple: A sleazy publicist named Stu [Farrell] is walking with his assistant around midtown Manhattan one afternoon. Both are on cell phones wheeling and dealing. Dismissing his assistant, Stu makes his way to a phone booth, one of the few left in that part of New York. As usual, he is there to call the girl he wants to sleep with. By using a pay phone, he can avoid his wife's seeing the phone number when the cell phone bill arrives. After he hangs up, the pay phone rings. He answers, and a man's voice informs him that Stu better do everything the man tells him to do because the caller has a high powered rifle aimed at him. At first Stu thinks it's a bad joke. It isn't, and what follows is an intense and clever cat and mouse game. <p>Farrell is able to give the unsavory main character enough humanity to make us care about what happens to him. Kiefer Sutherland does well in an interesting role. Playing the Caller, he is not seen until the end of the movie, and then only for a few seconds. <p>Those who expect a thriller worthy of Hitchcock will be disappointed. Those expecting a merely entertaining thriller will be pleased.</p></body></html>

This film basically chronicles a year in the life of the Emperor penguins, which the majority of the year is spent on mating and caring for the egg.<br /><br />The film opens with a waddle of penguins coming up from water onto land.  They go on a 70-mile journey til they reach an area that's surrounded by thick ice walls and ice is thickest underneath.  (That means they're cut off from food sources.)  From there, the penguins court and mate.  The pair will be monagamous for that one particular year.<br /><br />An egg is produced, which the mother keeps warm under her on her feet.  However, after a certain amount of time has passed, she carefully passes the egg to the father.  (Some transfers will not be successful, thus the chick dies within.)  After losing a third of her weight, she goes back on the 70-mile journey back to sea to eat.<br /><br />The male penguins are the ones that have to face the harsh winter storms, while protecting the egg.  Being docile, due to lack of food and the harsh winter, they huddle together for warmth.<br /><br />The best part of the whole film is seeing the chicks hatch.  Despite not eating for a long time and losing half his weight, the father has a special food reserve only for the chick until the mother returns.  When the mother returns, there is this cute reunion of the family.  Pretty soon, the males take off to sea.  However, the journey is much shorter since the ice have melted.<br /><br />The bond between the mother and her chick is just absolutely adorable.  The chicks playing with each other is gonna make you go "awww!"  It's just cuteness overload!<br /><br />Before you know it, the mothers leave their chicks behind and take off for the sea.  However, the fathers have returned with food.  Then, they take off for the sea, leaving behind the chicks.  The chicks are on their own for a time before they take their first plunge into the sea.  These chicks will not return to land until 4 years later.<br /><br />The sceneries are just really beautiful, despite the surrounding whiteness and the harsh winter.  I love the angles on the penguins, showing you that the penguins indeed do have emotions and cognition.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman does an excellent job, providing appropriate information at the appropriate time.<br /><br />This film comes highly recommended!</p></body></html>

It's not there to really engage us emotionally or mentally as much as visually, and in that visual sense `The Day After Tomorrow' soars.  Now director Roland Emmerich is no stranger to the science fiction disaster film, and not unlike his previously successful entries, this one also sports some amazing special effects.  From twirling twisters to tidal waves and that slowly creeping icy air, `The Day After Tomorrow' sports an amazing lineup of natural disasters.  Watching the multiple tornadoes rip through the California city is impressive, and watching gallon upon gallon of water drown New York City is nothing short of breathtaking.  So, it's safe to say that what `The Day After Tomorrow' lacks in brains it makes up for in cool CGI effects.<br /><br />So, what of this plot?  Well, it appears that weather patterns are showing an alarming possibility that soon, within the next hundred or so years, we could undergo yet another ice-age.  That's where Jack Hall comes in, a climatologist who discovers the evidence to support this.  Of course no one will pay attention to Hall and his discovery will prove true, except not even Hall expected it to happen so soon.  The real story though involves Jack's son Sam who has traveled to New York with some class mates and ends up in the middle on a flood that destroys the city.  Jack then has to race to his rescue before he freezes to death.<br /><br />As you can see, the plot is plenty far fetched, but the action more than makes up for it.  As Sam and his friends try to survive they must find food and medical supplies while fighting the increasing cold, the rising waters and a pack of temperamental wolves who happen to escape confinement during the flood.  The wolf pack has been met with mixed reviews, as in some loved it an others found it ridiculous and unnecessary.  I loved it.  It was an interesting and intense inclusion, even if it wasn't the slightest bit realistic.  When the movie as a whole is completely unbelievable and, yes, unrealistic, then there's nothing wrong with adding even more layers of complete and utter fiction as long as it looks good.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, it's all decent.  Your standard action film acting if you so desire to label it.  Dennis Quaid is one of those actors who I've always enjoyed yet felt he never really tapped into his potential, save except his performance in 2002's `Far From Heaven', and here he delivers but again it's nothing beyond acceptable.  Jake Gyllenhaal is an actor with a future, that's for sure, and his performances are always believable and effortless.  Here he does a great job juggling emotions amid a hole-riddled plot.  Emmy Rossum should really stick to singing, as her grandest performance was in `The Phantom of the Opera' but at least here she delivers a stronger performance than her `Poseidon' disaster.  The strongest performance here though came from the actress with the least screen time, Sela Ward.  She is just the definition of class and she manages to instill emotion in a rather emotionless film.<br /><br />So, in the end `The Day After Tomorrow' delivers some extraordinary eye candy and is worthy of any science fiction action movie buffs library.  No, it's not smart, but it doesn't need to be; and to answer the question of some in regards to the movie's title, it refers to the day `AFTER' the calamity, when everything is not what it once was.  Come on people; is it really that hard to figure out?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good, but the series may be exhausting its potential"></head><body><p>This is a better than average action film, but compared to earlier 3, it has little emotional pitch and the themes - of fate, heroism, and evolution - are not advanced at all - you get no idea that time lines are converging in spite of tampering with time travel devices and actions, the characters are rather set and do nothing unexpected, and Conor is, well, just kind of superhuman as the robots bounces him off walls, etc.  Still, it is fun and the images are quite good at times.  The acting is very strong with Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington.  Oddly, Conor's wife, who Danes so superlatively acted in T3, is a peripheral character in this film and poorly done.<br /><br />Interestingly, I bought this as blu-ray, and I can't say that the picture, with the exception of a few images, is more than marginally better.  There is no unmistakable, quantum improvement over dvds.<br /><br />REcommended. It is worth owning if you like to dissect the nuances of the series.  I'd give this 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

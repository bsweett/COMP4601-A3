<meta name="summary" content=""United 93" Will Take Your Breath Away .... A Phenomenal Motion Picture"></head><body><p>When I sat down to watch the DVD of "United 93" I knew it was going to be a very good movie (based on other reviews I'd heard about the film and hearing people talking about it) -- but I was somewhat unprepared for the large emotional impact it was going to make. (And a physical impact as well; I was practically sweating bullets by the end of this movie.)<br /><br />"United 93", written and directed with flawlessly-executed craftsmanship by Paul Greengrass, is easily the most powerful, the most riveting, and the most gut-wrenching film I have ever watched in my lifetime. And I cannot imagine it being topped in those categories for quite some time (if ever).<br /><br />In what seems very nearly a literal way, Director Greengrass has succeeded in placing every member of the audience on board that San Francisco-bound United Airlines Boeing 757-200 (N591UA), which represented Flight #93 on the sunny morning of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Every single frame of film that went through Mr. Greengrass' camera while photographing this motion picture has a "genuine" feel to it. It is so eerily realistic, it's almost impossible not to have your hands shaking while watching this entire movie. I felt like I was among the passengers who were trying desperately to crash into that cockpit and overtake the terrorist hijackers.<br /><br />The actors that the producers hired to portray the 40 passengers and crew members are each to be applauded separately (and collectively), in my personal opinion, for their realistic and spot-on performances in this movie. It's really hard to describe how good this whole cast is. All of the performances from the men and women who share this cast roster will move you to tears. The terror on board that aircraft is so real during this movie, it's nothing short of awe-inspiring.<br /><br />I'm finding it difficult typing this review, after just now having watched the film for the very first time, and having been transfixed by the impeccable way that Mr. Greengrass has brought this horrifying true story to the big screen in a thoroughly respectful, non-exaggerated, and non-exploitative manner.<br /><br />This movie is hard to watch, that is for sure. Knowing that the brutal things we're seeing unfold on the screen actually (and incredibly) did take place above the eastern United States on 9/11/01 is enough to make your head swim, and to literally take your breath away at times too. I found myself having to breathe deeply many times just to make it through the intense scenes of stark terror.<br /><br />It's difficult to watch, yes....but it's also impossible NOT to keep watching this remarkable motion picture once you've taken a look at just the first few minutes.<br /><br />And as far as being technically well-made....this film is probably second to none as far as the subject of "aviation" is concerned. I've seen quite a few movies centering on the subject of airplanes and aviation, but "United 93" is by far the most "technically accurate" movie I have ever seen from the standpoint of realistic airplane footage.<br /><br />In the many scenes that take place aboard the plane which represents the Boeing 757 twin-jet airliner that plunged into a Pennsylvania field at more than 500 MPH at 10:03 AM on September 11th, I felt as if I was watching a real-life hijacking unfold inside the cabin and flight deck of a 757 in flight. The way the plane moves, the way the sky looks outside the cabin windows, the view from the cockpit....everything was absolutely perfect....and extremely realistic-looking. It's as if Mr. Greengrass was somehow able to actually film the hijacking in progress on 9/11. Just incredible.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />In addition to providing a sparkling Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) print of "United 93", the 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD set from Universal Studios offers up some nice bonus supplements too, including......<br /><br />1.) A director's Audio Commentary track with Paul Greengrass.<br /><br />2.) "Chasing Planes: Witnesses To 9/11" -- A 48-minute documentary/featurette (only available on the Limited Edition DVD). This is a program focusing on the military and the air-traffic controllers and their response to the national emergency on 9/11.<br /><br />Ben Sliney of the National Air Traffic Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, is featured prominently throughout this well-done bonus documentary. Sliney, who was the National Operations Manager for the FAA on 9/11, plays himself in "United 93" (in what is a fairly big part), and he's excellent in the film too.<br /><br />Incredibly, September 11, 2001, was Mr. Sliney's very first day on the job as the FAA's National Operations Manager. He was the man who initially gave the order to halt all U.S. air traffic at approximately 9:45 A.M. (ET) on 9/11, just a few minutes after American Airlines Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.<br /><br />"Chasing Planes" also features a unique high-angle video clip of United Flight 175 approaching and hitting the south tower of the World Trade Center. It's footage of that horrible moment in history that was taken from an angle that I had previously never seen before.<br /><br />By the way, the "Chasing Planes" documentary on Disc #2 of the "LE" DVD is shown in Anamorphic Widescreen, even though the packaging incorrectly indicates "Full Frame 1.33:1".<br /><br />3.) "United 93: The Families And The Film" -- A very good 60-minute documentary centering on the families of several of the victims of Flight 93. (Anamorphic Widescreen; approx. 1.85:1.)<br /><br />4.) Memorial Pages (text biographies for all 40 victims of Flight 93).<br /><br />5.) A two-minute trailer for the 2003 short film "Twin Towers".<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />"United 93" is a movie that every American should take time out to watch. It's a slice of an American tragedy that will never be forgotten; and Mr. Paul Greengrass has made a truly phenomenal motion picture here. This film gets the highest possible recommendation from this writer. Experience it for yourself and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />In memory of the brave passengers and crew members of United Airlines Flight 93 -- heroes one and all.......<br /><br />THE CREW:<br /><br />Jason Dahl<br />LeRoy Homer<br />Lorraine Bay<br />Sandra Bradshaw<br />CeeCee Lyles<br />Wanda Green<br />Deborah Welsh<br /><br />THE PASSENGERS (the four hijackers excluded):<br /><br />Christian Adams<br />Todd Beamer<br />Alan Beaven<br />Mark Bingham<br />Deora Bodley<br />Marion Britton<br />Thomas Burnett<br />William Cashman<br />Georgine Corrigan<br />Patricia Cushing<br />Joseph DeLuca<br />Patrick Driscoll<br />Edward Felt<br />Jane Folger<br />Colleen Fraser<br />Andrew Garcia<br />Jeremy Glick<br />Lauren Grandcolas<br />Donald Greene<br />Linda Gronlund<br />Richard Guadagno<br />Toshiya Kuge<br />Hilda Marcin<br />Waleska Martinez<br />Nicole Miller<br />Louis Nacke<br />Donald Peterson<br />Jean Peterson<br />Mark Rothenberg<br />Christine Snyder<br />John Talignani<br />Honor Wainio<br />Kristin White</p></body></html>

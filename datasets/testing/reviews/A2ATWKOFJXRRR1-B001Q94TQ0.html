<meta name="summary" content="Disturbingly, Drugs Might Set Some People Free"></head><body><p>Maria Alvarez works in a flower factory in Columbia, de-thorning roses for a living at the brusque age of seventeen. Her hands ache and bleed, her boss is verbally abusive, and her family (as most seventeen year olds think) don't understand that she wants more out of life. Then one day she meets a young boy who introduces her to a drug runner who hires "mules" (women who carry drugs in their stomachs and into the United States) and Maria's life changes drastically.<br /><br />But is it all for the worst?<br /><br />That's tough to say. Although we all know the terrible things that happen to these young girls (rapes, the pellets leaking in their stomachs and killing them, being arrested by border agents, etc.), the viewer has kind of a dark sympathy for Maria and her fellow mules. The amount of money they can make in one trip ($5,000) is a simple treasure to them.<br /><br />It took me a while to review this film simply because it IS so disturbing. The drug trade is a terrible thing that kills people all the time, but in this film we get to see how it benefits one individual ...but at what cost? Emotionally she's nearly torn apart (she has to watch another mule slowly, painfully, die after a drug pellet leaks in her stomach), but it also makes her a stronger person. She has means (via cash) to support herself and, come to find out, her unborn child.<br /><br />Will Maria remain in America, or return to her family in Columbia and raise her child there while continuing to be a mule? You'll have to watch it and find out.<br /><br />A simple film with a powerful message; a message that isn't as easy to swallow as a pouch full of heroin.</p></body></html>

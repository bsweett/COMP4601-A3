<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful, exhilarating, but not terribly satisfying."></head><body><p>"Hero" is absolutely one of most beautifully filmed movies of ANY genre...EVER.  For that reason alone it is worth seeing, whether you are a fan of martial arts movies or not.<br /><br />The use of colors as themes, indeed practically as supporting actors in their own right is absolutely awe-inspiring.  The movie becomes impressionist art brought to life, and a particularly dazzling life at that.  The action sequences are sublime (the highlight for me was perhaps too early in the movie when Jet Li and Donnie Yen squared off at the "chess" club during a rainstorm.  These are two professionals of unquestioned pedigree and ability that are always a joy to watch in any fight sequence; they have clearly outdone themselves in "Hero"), and the wirework -while admittedly not to everyone's taste- is likewise inspired.<br /><br />Comparisons to the Japanese classic "Rashomon" are justified, even though "Rashomon" is essentially multiple perceptions of the same act and "Hero", also told mainly in a series of flashbacks, is more similar to the ending of the home video version of "Clue" (most immediate example that comes to mind; obviously "Hero" is a far moe serious film than "Clue"!).<br /><br />My only problem is that the ending completely betrays the direction in which film was heading from the very beginning.  Without giving away the ending, it is simply not believable to me that someone who has dedicated so much of his life toward accomplishing a specific task would allow the certainty of his commitment to be questioned or even remotely compromised so easily.  I have noticed a rash of pacifism in mainstream martial arts films over the past few years (perhaps starting with Li Mu Bai's decision to hang up the Green Destiny sword in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and running through Hanbei Mizoguchi's pleas for non-violence in "Samurai Fiction"), and frankly I find it rather unbecoming for the genre.  The title of "Hero" somewhat belies the decision of the protagonist, in my opinion.<br /><br />"Hero" shares some of the tragic Shakespearean elements of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"...and as a result both films are somewhat "deeper" in content than most martial arts movies, perhaps in an attempt to appeal beyond the typical cult audience and toward manistream moviegoers.  I'm not a class warrior or a movie snob enough to recoil in horror at the notion, but the soul of what makes these movies so enjoyable is somewhat compromised and that is somewhat disappointing if you have spent years watching the movies and developing your appreciation based on traditional martial arts film values.  Regardless of the action and effects and choreography that drop the jaw to the floor, the plot should have a resolution that is met with satisfaction within the viewer's soul.  And for THIS viewer, "Hero", though undeniably beautiful and almost certain to find a place on my shelf for its aesthetics alone, does not pass that test.  How unfortunate.</p></body></html>

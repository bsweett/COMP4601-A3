<meta name="summary" content=""Gonna Buy Five Copies For My Mother"...."></head><body><p>This review refers to the Dreamworks March 2001 Widescreen release of the "Almost Famous" DVD..........<br /><br />Watching this film is like being in Rock and Roll Heaven! It is filled with young bright shining stars, under the superb direction of Cameron Crowe(Jerry Maguire). The music is like a trip down memory lane, and is very much a part of this great ensemble.<br /><br />This semi-autobiographical coming of age story, takes a young journalist on the journey of a lifetime. Based on actual events from Cameron Crowe's life, 15 year old William Miller lands a job with "Rolling Stone" magazine. He must go on the road with rockers "Stillwater"(a group actually put together by the filmakers and stars),and write their story. He hangs out everywhere with them, hotels, backstage, rides with them on their bus(this poor guy, a rotten job.. but somebody had to...)and eventually becomes very close with them and the "Band-Aids"(not groupies!) that are their entourage.All this to the constant worry of his over-protective mother, who besides rock and roll is another huge influence on his life.<br /><br />Follow William, the band, and the girls on a tour of a lifetime, in this deliciously funny and sometimes poignant story of learning what's important in life.All filmed beautifully, with those great outfits of the 60's and 70's and of course one killer soundtrack. All the great rock legends of this era are heard throughout the film, including Elton John, The Who, and Peter Frampton whose instruction in music makes "Stillwater" great!The film also includes original music written especially for "Stillwater" that is fabulous as well.<br /><br />The casting is impeccable...William is played by newcomer Patrick Fugit with an intuitiveness that is uncanny. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are the leads for the band and totaly have that rocker image down pat. Kate Hudson is irresistable as "Penny Lane" and the other "Band-Aids", including Anna Paquin and Fairza Balk also contribute greatly. Two outstanding performances are Frances McDormand as William's mother and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as his mentor.<br /><br />This outstanding film is put together in an outstanding package. The DVD(although no the more expensive one) is a beautiful transfer in every way. The picture is in Widescreen(anamorphic 1.85:1). It's clear, colors are vivid, and shows off the great film work. Lots of choices on the sound(depending on your set up). There's DTS, Dolby 5.1 or 2.0 Surround. The dialouge and music both coming through brillantly. Tons of special features for you to peruse. There's a music video of "Stillwater" doing their song "Fever Dog' from the film, A "making of" featurette, blurbs on the "Rolling Stone" articles done by Cameron Crowe, and cast and crew bios to mention a few.It also comes with a booklet of some production notes, and it is captioned if needed.There is also another edition, a directors cut with some "never before seen footage" and other extras(see buying info) if your looking for even more. This edition though, is also top quality and costs a little less. Whichever edition you choose, if you've seen this film and love it, the DVD is a must have. If you haven't seen it, it's just a MUST!<br /><br />A film to be enjoyed by anyone who loves good movies and good music!  so enjoy.....Laurie<br /><br />also available in this two-pack:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009IB45">Almost Famous/American Beauty</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nobody knows the criminal mind like Michael Mann"></head><body><p>Michael Mann proves again, with this film, that he comprehends the minds and machinations of criminals better than just about anyone else.  He gives these characters depth, complexity, and crackling dialogue as he takes us deep into their world and their way of thinking and behaving.<br />Tom Cruise is so good in the role of the criminal Vincent that after a few minutes, you will forget who it is you're watching.  Jamie Foxx is also expertly cast as the unlucky cab driver, Max, who is forced to go along on a dangerous, all-night ride through the streets of L.A. as Vincent forces him to drive him from one "hit" to another.<br />Jada Pinkett Smith also performs well as an earlier fare who ends up embroiled in the mess and nearly loses her life.<br />Mann lovingly photographs the city and adds the usual perfectly chosen songs to fill out the story.<br />Highly recommended and probably underrated.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Aniston's BEST  -  But pretty good."></head><body><p>O.K. - I like Jennifer Aniston, but that isn't why I give it 4 stars. :)<br />I really thought this movie was pretty good. It's not as good as Derailed, but I still stayed very interested throughout.<br />From the beginning, I was convinced that they were a couple totally in love, and I really came to care for these characters.<br /><br />What happens is, she breaks up with him, he reacts harshly, and although they really still are in love, they continue this ongoing fight out of pride...(neither person wants to be the one to swallow thier pride.)<br />May I add that through all of this, they continue to live together in the condo they purchased together...neither can afford to live on thier own, so they continue living together...and fighting together.<br />  *SPOILER*<br />Vince Vaughn appears to be the uncaring one, and when his buddy points this out to him, he honestly tries to make a change, then Jennifer Aniston....turns him away !!! THIS upset me, I really thought they were going to get back together, and was very dissapointed that they didn't.<br /><br />At the ending however, we ARE left thinking that maybe they will reunite<br />afterall.<br />I really did like the acting, and as I said, I like Jennifer Aniston, so maybe I was a little less critical toward the movie.<br />I really honestly thought it was entertaining.</p></body></html>

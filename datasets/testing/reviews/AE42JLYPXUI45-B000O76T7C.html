<meta name="summary" content="Alien (1979)"></head><body><p>In 1979, Ridley Scott had given us a film that is considered to be the scariest film in Science Fiction history. That film is entitled, ALIEN. ALIEN has been a favorite with so many people around the world. It is the film that set the stage for three sequels that are worthy to this original film. The film also features a Sigourney Weaver in her first starring role.<br /><br />On their way back to Earth, a crew of seven people aboard the space craft, The Nostromo, are ready to fight for their lives against a creature that is perfectly evolved to clearly wipe out mankind. In this crew, there is CAPTAIN DALLAS (played by Tom Skerritt), LT. RIPLEY (played by Sigourney Weaver), LAMBERT (played by Veronica Cartwright), BRETT (played by Harry Dean Stanton), KANE (played by John Hurt), ASH (played by Ian Holm), & PARKER (played by Yaphet Kotto). As they learn that they are half-way back to Earth, they receive a signal from a nearby planet called LV-426. They mistake the signal for an S.O.S. They land on LV-426, but crashing the ship just a bit. The ship can easily be repaired. Dallas, Kane, and Lambert are set to investigate what is on this planet. Kane finds dozens of eggs lying around. One particular egg hatches, but Kan does not have a chance to look at what is inside, for some sort of organism, known as the face-hugger, jumps out and attaches itself to Kane's face. Back on board, Ash and Dallas get Kane out of his space suit and helmet. They are shocked to see the face-hugger. They try taking the face-hugger off, but the face-hugger bleeds concentrated acid. They decide that it may kill Kane if they try prying it off, so they leave it alone. About an hour or two later, Dallas, Ripley, and Ash find that the face-hugger is off of Kane's face. The face-hugger has died, and Kane has now awaken. They all sit down to have dinner, but Kane never gets a chance to eat, for a little creature bursts through Kane's chest. The little creature is an alien that will soon grow into a gigantic killing machine.<br /><br />Parker, Brett, and Ripley head out to find the little alien. Instead, they find Ripley's frightened cat, Jones. Brett goes after Jones, but finds that the alien has shed his skin and is now a gigantic killing machine. He finds Jones, but even before he can grab him, Brett turns around to find the alien that was once a small little creature standing behind in front of him. Brett sees the end of his life. Dallas has a plan to get rid of it, but he dies in the process. One by one, every crew member is slain, until Ripley is left. She sets a self-destruct bomb on the ship, grabs Jones, and gets safely in the shuttle. As the shuttle pulls away from The Nostromo, Ripley watches The Nostromo blow into nothing with the alien inside. As Ripley prepares to go into hypersleep, she finds the alien aboard the shuttle with her. She blows the alien out of the airlock, finally killing it. She finally gets into hypersleep, while waiting for the network to find her in the next six weeks.<br /><br />ALIEN is definitely the best film in all of Science Fiction history. It is an award-winning film that set the stage for its three stunning sequels that were well on their way. If you have not seen ALIEN, well, now's your chance. So buy a copy for yourselves, sit back, and enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There aren't enough stars for this one!"></head><body><p>If I could give this more stars I would.  Tombstone was brilliant.  Let me say right off the bat though, the love story part of the film really slowed things down for me.  This film focuses not only on the feud but also on the friendship between these men.<br /><br />Kurt Russell (as Wyatt Earp) gave a fine performance.  Val Kilmer who portrays Doc Holliday was robbed of an Oscar.  What he did with the role was nothing short of amazing. He actually stole the show in some scenes.  The costuming was very good as well.<br /><br />I don't even like westerns and I don't remember how I came to view Tombstone in the first place.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp is just a waste of time.  You need not  bother with that thing.<br /><br />Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Robert Burke, Sam Elliot, Stephan Lang, Bill Paxton, Billy Zane, Terry O' Quinn were all very well cast for this film.  There are also  suprise cameo appearances by Charlton Heston and Billy Bob Thorton (a bit heavier then).  Sly Stallone's  brother also has a small role.<br /><br />Just a note for those that may not understand what happens in the Doc Holliday death scene.  Near the beginning of the film, one of the Wyatts brothers mentions that he read an article that said when some people die they see a bright light leading them to heaven.  Just before his death, Doc asks Wyatt to leave his bedside because he knows the end is near and he doesn't want his friend to see him die.  After Wyatt leaves, Doc looks down at his body and says, "This is funny."  In other words, he sees the light of heaven.  It is reported by some historians that Doc did indeed say "This is funny" just seconds before he died.  Some say that the reason he said it is because he always thought that he would die in the heat of a gun battle, not sick in bed.<br /><br />Point of interest:  When Wyatt's brother dies however, he sees no such light.<br /><br />If you love the western genre, this film should have an honored place in your collection.<br /><br />Parental Advisory:  I advise a viewing age of at least 13.</p></body></html>

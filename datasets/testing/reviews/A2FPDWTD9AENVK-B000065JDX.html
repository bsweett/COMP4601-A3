Once they are all safely across the border, a quick stop at a local strip joint turns into a night of terror when the bar becomes a haven for vampires after dark! FROM DUSK TIL DAWN has two distinct personalities, the first being a brilliantly scripted crime drama with signature Tarentino exchanges and a shrewd dark humor, while the other becomes a gratuitous and mindless actioner. Most of the comments below are in regards to the first half, which is easily the strongest part of the film. Each of the cast members deliver memorable roles, with Tarentino, Clooney, and Keitel offering some of the best performances of their careers. The Geko brothers are perfectly written and played in direct juxtaposition of one another, and they are far more interesting than the one-sided vampires that replace them as the central villains in the second half. DAWN also boasts excellent cameos from Horror icons like Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Greg Nicotero, and others. KNB is sure to deliver more gooey gore FX, however their make-up for the serpentine vampires range from unique to downright goofy. Rodriguez brings the same frenetic energy to the high-powered gunfights in the end as he had in DESPERADO or EL MARIACHI, but once the action starts rolling there is an immediate shift in tone that feels quite uneven. The crossover into Mexico marks a dividing line where the plot becomes all boobs, blood, and bad CG. Despite the dramatic change the film undergoes, the lightning pace never lets up and fills every moment with laughs and blood even if it is entirely without scares. This match-up between Tarentino and Rodriguez was a sure-fire hit with most fans, and the film remains a staple 90s Horror entry that is clearly above average.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></body></html>

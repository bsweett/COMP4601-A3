<meta name="summary" content="Unrelenting violence and complex characters.  I loved it!"></head><body><p>I loved Kill Bill Vol 1 and was one of the first in line to see the DVD of Kill Bill Vol 2.  I sure wasn't disappointed.  And I think that Quentin Tarantino is a genius, especially in the way the two films work together. Vol 1 was all action and not much story.  All the audience knew was that "the bride", played by Uma Thurman, who also was Tarantino's co-writer, was after revenge.  There was a lot of fighting and huge scenes where this lone woman battled hoards of assassins.  It was complete in and of itself.  And it seemed that the back-story didn't matter.<br /><br />But the back-story DID matter.  And that is what Vol 2 is about.  The audience has already gotten to know the characters and is also prepared for some incredibly horrific fighting that goes way over the top in violence.  I expected more of the same.  But that was not to be.  Instead, I was treated to a slow unfolding of a story.  The fighting was equally vile and wild, of course.  And there is one fight scene between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah that is guaranteed to make you wince.  But there were indeed fewer casualties in Vol 1 and some very tender moments too.  The characters grew in complexity, especially Bill, played by an aging David Carradine.  In this role he's the embodiment of evil, and yet his appeal is understandable.  Uma Thurman must have had to train round-the-clock to learn all the martial arts moves that this film required.  But there are some scenes in the film in which she has to use all her acting talent and show some real emotion in some incredible situations.  Her performance shines.<br /><br />If you're looking for a kind and gentle film, this is not the film for you.  But if you're looking for innovative filmmaking, unrelenting violence and complexity, you'll LOVE Kill Bill 2.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

There are differences of scale. As Yuri Orlov notes toward the end of the movie, right before the credits begin to roll, the president of the United States sells more weapons in one day than he (Yuri) does in a full year. Then there's the issue of legality. Since it's the governments who decide what's legal and what's not, small fish like Orlov are known as 'gun runners' and they are to be viewed as evil or irresponsible. Unlike governments who usually 'spread freedom', provide 'aid' or help the nicer dictators, autocrats and internationally recognized oppressors fight 'extremism' or 'anarchy'. Unless the governments want to 'help' certain extremely vile states or 'movements', in which case they covertly use the little gun runners to funnel their support. 'Lord of War' ends with an interesting observation - nothing new or unexpected, a fact known to most of us but, somehow, hidden almost out of existence someplace rarely visited inside our mind: world's largest arms dealers are the 5, armed to the teeth,  permanent members of the Security Council: the United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, China.<br /><br />'Lord of War' is the story of Yuri Orlov, a small fish, private gun runner who makes a living for himself and his family by doing, illegally, a little bit of what legitimate governments do officially. People die while Yuri, most convincingly portrayed by Nicolas Cage, gets rich. And, while they are killing each other, it's worth noting that some of the weapons used by one side or sometimes both sides were provided by Yuri, often at great personal risk. Being small and a private individual, Yuri is constantly chased and harassed by agent Valentine of the Interpol and his life is a constant, dangerous and risky struggle of surviving his business dealings usually involving bloody dictators or drug dealers, keeping his marriage from falling apart and keeping Vitaly, his kid brother, from completely destroying himself by means of mass quantities of drugs consumption.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage acting is superb and so is Jared Leto's as Vitaly Orlov, Yuri's brother. All others are playing their parts well but this is mainly the story of Yuri and both the part and the actor easily eclipse the rest into 'supporting' parts. Besides Cage's acting, the effort to provide authenticity is remarkable - 100 tanks that Yuri is about to buy were real, not props, and they were indeed for sale and so are some of the behaviors attributed to some of the characters such as the Liberian president.<br /><br />'Lord of War' is a commendable effort at providing an inside view into the world of weapons commerce but, in the end, it misses the mark and even the movie's makers seem to be aware of it. Yes, it's true that private arms dealers sell arms but it's also true that their contribution to global mayhem is small to insignificant when compared to what the real market leaders, the world's big 'powers' can provide. It just may be that the problem is not that, as Yuri observes, one in twelve people owns a gun but that eleven out of twelve don't and they are often at the mercy of those who do. Far from being a lord of war, Yuri's character fulfills a need and, human nature being what it is, it's quite likely that someone else would step in the moment Yuri turned pacifist and, as history teaches us, people are quite capable of killing each other by the millions, with or without fire arms. Watching 'Lord of War' was not time wasted. The movie does have its moments but the impression it leaves is that... maybe movie makers wished they aimed a little higher or closer to the root causes of state instigated or state inflicted violence.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;</p></body></html>

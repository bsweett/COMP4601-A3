<meta name="summary" content="$Zooey$"></head><body><p>"Failure to Launch," despite recieving negative reviews and mixed audience reception, is actually one of the best romantic comedies of the year. Not just because of the witty script, but also because of the charm of Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, Zooey Deschanel, Justin Bartha, Terry Bradshaw, and Kathy Bates. The movie does have the typical romantic comedy formula, but that's OK. McConaughey ('Sahara') plays Tripp, a 35 year old man who still lives with is parents (Bates and Bradshaw). As his parents, Al and Sue, look around they notice that it's time for Tripp to move out of the house. Problem is, they don't want to tell him. So they hire a woman named Paula (Parker, 'Sex and the City') who deals with convincing men to move out of their parent's house. Problem is, she's never had a case like this. While most of these men are overweight with no social skills; Tripp is charming, funny, and attractive. In the romantic comedy sub-plot, Tripp's friend Ace (Bartha, 'National Treasure') falls in love with Paula's roommate<br /><br />Kit (Deschanel, 'All the Real Girls'), who harbors a hatred for an annoying mockingbird that lives outside her window. One critic (Richard Roeper) complained that the movie was unrealistic, because of the presence of McConaughey. He said McConaughey was the kind of guy who moves out of his parent's house at 15 because he's dating his teacher...Technically, he's right. But that's the point of this movie. They didn't want to cast a person like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role. They need a good looking, charismatic lead. Roger Ebert complained that you didn't really like the characters because they're all deceitful. The writers of this movie admit that the characters aren't particularly likeable, but I didn't mind them. All the actors are perfectly cast, but in my opinion it's the Deschanel-Bartha part of the movie that really makes it interesting. First of all, Zooey Deschanel is not only a very talented actress (see "All the Real Girls" or "Winter Passing") but she's also capable of being funny. In this movie, she's in top comic form. Her character, Kit, is very funny. She's quite literally the highlight of this movie. Anyway, if you don't like silly romantic comedies like "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" or "Just Friends" you probably won't like this. Otherwise, see it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

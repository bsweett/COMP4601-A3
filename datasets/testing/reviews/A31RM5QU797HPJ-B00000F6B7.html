<meta name="summary" content=""KHAAAAAANN!""></head><body><p>Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a big disappoint for me. I found the story boring and slow.  But, this isn't about the first Star Trek movie.  This is about the improved sequel, The Wrath of Khan.  And so begins the curse of the Star Trek movies.  The Curse--as everybody knows--is that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are good ones.<br /><br />  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan shows no signs of the previous movie.  It has colorful uniforms and a good villain.  And it has William Shantner's "KHAAAANN!" yell.<br /><br />  It's the 23rd century, and Kirk is now an Admiral.  An old enemy of his comes back for revenge.  Khan, a superhuman from the 1990's, is angry with Kirk for leaving him on a planet.  Of course, Kirk defeats Khan, but Spock dies at the end...or does he?</p></body></html>

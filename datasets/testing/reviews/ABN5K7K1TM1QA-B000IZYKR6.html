Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />***BEWARE SPOILERS***<br />***If you read this before seeing the movie, the movie will not be as interesting***<br /><br />This is a taunt drama of the man bites dog sort in which a precocious 14-year-old girl Hayley (Ellen Page, who was so delightful in Juno (2007)) has her way with photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) a 32-year-old sickie who specializes in under aged girls.  And her way is...well, way extreme.  But apparently she has cause.<br /><br />The vibrant tension that glues us to our seats can only be resolved by finding out if she is right in her accusations or if he is an innocent victim.  She is certain.  But director David Slade (using a diabolical script from Brian Nelson) keeps us guessing.  Hayley seems not merely precocious intellectually, but emotionally more like a grown woman than a 14-year-old.  Jeff appears to be a sweet, clever guy any girl would love to love.  But she has anything but love in mind.  Her scheme of vengeance is well thought out and very well executed.  Everything is a twist on the Internet chat room stalker scenario.  Instead of the older dude seducing, drugging and taking advantage of the young girl, the young girl turns the tables on him in a horrifying way.  What is it that should happen to guys who take advantage of under-aged girls? They should have their ...s cut off.  That is exactly what Hayley has in mind.<br /><br />Or so it seems.  Actually, although she says at one point that death is too good for him, she finally settles on getting him to commit suicide.  But will he?<br /><br />I was hoping that Nelson and Slade would have the nerve to really turn the tables and make Hayley the villain and Jeff the innocent victim, and it seems for perhaps three-quarters of the film that this is still possible.  We learn that he does have a thing for under aged girls and that is not good, but it isn't enough to justify what he is going through and will go through.  And Hayley seems to be some kind of monster with a sick desire of her own.  But this all washes out when we discover that no he didn't actually kill the girl.  No, he only--as he confesses--FILMED the killing.  (Nice touch, that.)  And no Hayley does not go through with her Third Reich surgery (although she has brought along a blue surgeon's gown for the operation and has donned it).  That would make her just too, too unsavory.  Instead she uses her wiles and her physical and psychological control to get him to jump off a roof with a rope around his neck.  (Yes, I warned you about spoilers.)<br /><br />I mention all these essential details because I want to make a point.  This is a seduction of the audience film and a kind of black comedy that isn't funny until perhaps you see it for the second or third time--which I am not planning to do.  It is absurd in the slasher/horror film manner in which gross human behavior is depicted for the titillation of the audience while maintaining a politically correct stance.  A politically incorrect stance would have been to end the film with Jeff innocent and Hayley the sickie.  I suspect this film would have met with boycotts from women's groups had Slade done that.<br /><br />Still the violence is mostly imagined or alluded to.  Slade eschews any blood splattering or outright torture.  The balls in the garbage disposal are, after all, only in our imagination.  And Jeff really does deserve his fate.  However there is no getting around the fact that Hayley is not your everyday 14-year-old.  I don't think any future suitor would feel comfortable with her knowing what she did to Jeff, evil as he is.  In other words, her brand of vigilante justice could only come from somebody who was a bit sick herself.<br /><br />I think what mesmerized me most about this exercise in fantasy revenge wish fulfillment was the performance of Ellen Page.  I thought she was a bit creepy but very effective.  She actually could have passed for a 14-year-old (she was 18 when the film was released) yet the words put in her mouth and the actions she performed were well beyond the reach of the vast majority of fourteen year olds.  The intense close ups of her face and that of her co-star Patrick Wilson helped to make the characters larger than life, which is one of the things that film can do so very well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The magic continues"></head><body><p>Suspected of being responsible for the attempted murders of several Hogwarts students, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) spend their second year unraveling a dangerous mystery that threatens the very existence of the academy.  This is a wonderful film that introduces several great new characters, such as the conceited and comical Guilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branaugh) and the evil Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), as well as boasting terrific visual effects and costume design.  I am so gratified that director Chris Columbus and writer Steve Kloves have been granted the long running time of over two hours to do full justice to author JK Rowling's magical world.  The respect paid to the source material really shows on the screen.<br /><br />The death of Richard Harris, who played Albus Dumbledore, heralds what may become a problem with this series as it plays out over the next five projected films.  It is unlikely that all of the actors who portray the large cast of main and supporting characters will be able or willing to devote so much of their time over the course of the next five years to the production and promotion of a single film franchise.  The producers might lessen this problem by spreading out film production rather than trying to release one every year, but then they run the risk of having their principle actors age out of their roles.  Fans should be prepared to see more roles recast with other actors before this series reaches its end./</p></body></html>

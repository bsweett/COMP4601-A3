<meta name="summary" content="Monster Movie as Allegorical Farce."></head><body><p>"The Host" is an unusual, farcical monster movie that became the highest-grossing South Korean film ever. Inspired by the recent SARS panic and an incident of improper disposal of chemicals on a U.S. military base in South Korea, director and co-writer Joon-ho Bong has created an anti-authoritarian polemic exploring the implications of paranoia and regimentation in a free society, with a lovable dysfunctional family at its heart. "The Host" doesn't confine its parody to the bad guys. It skewers every stereotype it introduces, most obviously action movie heroes and the Korean model of order and efficiency.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to the citizens of Seoul, toxic chemicals dumped by an American scientist has spawned a strange creature in the Han River. It emerges from the water one day to terrorize and consume picnickers on the river bank. Gang-du Park (Kang-ho Song), the slacker, narcoleptic son of a snack food vendor, loses track of his daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko) in the hysteria, and she is carried off by the monster. Grieving families of victims are quarantined for fear they have acquired some contagion from the monster. After a phone call from Hyun-soe claims that she is trapped in a sewer, Gang-du, grandpa Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon), disillusioned drunkard uncle Nam-il (Hae-il Park), and archery medalist aunt Nam-joo (Du-na Bae) break out of quarantine and to rescue Hyun-soe.<br /><br />Unlike most monster movies, "The Host" shows us the monster up front. It's an ugly beast, but its grace and acrobatics make it very watchable. "The Host" doesn't try to be menacing or suspenseful, and it rejects many predictable monster movie cliches. It tends more toward allegorical farce than action. The family is searching for Hyun-seo; the authorities are looking for the fugitive family; and everyone is hunting the monster. Yet the bigger menace is misinformation wielded by fear-mongering bureaucrats to restrict the lives of the citizenry. Some scenes overstay their welcome, and "The Host" runs too long, but its funny and entertaining if you like farce and don't mind camp. In Korean with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2007 single disc): Bonus features are deleted scenes, deleted news clips, one featurette and an audio commentary. "Director Bong Joon-Ho's Reflections" (5 1/2 min) is, oddly, a series of apologies by the director to the actors whose scenes were cut, who were unrecognizable, who suffered discomfort, etc. There is an audio commentary by writer-director Joon-ho Bong and English friend Tony Raines. The commentary is in English, in interview format, with Raines asking Bong questions about the film. This works well and produces a constant commentary. They discuss actors, settings, characters, themes, the monster, plot points, and more. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in English.</p></body></html>

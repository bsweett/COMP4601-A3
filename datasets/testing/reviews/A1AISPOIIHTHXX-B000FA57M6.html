<meta name="summary" content="2.5; A big pile of dumb fun"></head><body><p>For every one videogame-to-film adaptation that's decent, there's at least 3 that absolutely suck. They're not even worth the celluloid they're on basically. So where does Doom fit? Well, it's not awesome that's for sure. But then again, it's not really terrible. And that's quite surprising, you would think that it would obviously be stupid but then you find yourself enjoying all the gory mayhem and go "huh, look at that, this film ain't so bad."<br /><br />A distress signal is sent from a research facility on Mars so a special squad is sent in to retrieve any survivors and neutralize any threat. Shall I go on? Cause that's pretty much it. Soldiers are sent in, they find weirdness, weirdness happens to have teeth and claws, soldiers die and they have to make it out alive.<br /><br />The first 2 Doom games had massive amounts of enemies coming at you so essentially it was a more fast paced game. Doom3 in many ways was like a Resident Evil on Mars. More slower, atmosphere and eerie, the game in a way toned down the "soldier sent to kick Hell in the balls" angle to the quiet angle. Well the film follows that route. It's darkly lit, and things go bump in the night suddenly then take off. So in a way it's not the game but it's no Doom3 either.<br /><br />Where is it Doom though? Of course the First-Person shooter scene where a Marine kicks a bunch of demon *** for around 4-5 minutes. This scene was more fun than probably the entirety of the film. It was quite funny at times too such as bringing out the sniper scope, a chainsaw and grenades. It's odd in the special features where they say the DVD can put in the full scene and they show the scene, yet it's the exact same thing that's in the movie. Huh?<br /><br />What can you expect from the rest of the film? Gore, slight nakedness, bad lines, overdone performances, weak character development and really dark hallways. You know, just like many of the recent "horror" films. Granted Doom3 was really poorly lit too but at least it helped the game. Here it's like "I can't see a thing, where's the lighting guy?"<br /><br />The only time I played Doom was playing Doom 2 many years ago, cheat codes on and blazing infinite ammo all over the place. It was fun but at the same time taking on demons wasn't my thing. Zelda, Final Fantasy and Metal Gear Solid however...here's hoping they don't do a MGS movie though, games are movie-like enough. Doom on the other hand is not quite horrible but we wouldn't have made a stink if they didn't make it.</p></body></html>

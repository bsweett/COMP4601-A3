In this film, though, he really shows a wide range of acting. The story pulls you in and twists you up. It is not a generic copy of any other films, although it could be a mix of a bunch of them (think &quot;Dreamscape&quot;, &quot;Flatliners&quot;, &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Sliders&quot; and even &quot;Blair Witch&quot;). It may not be a horror film, but it is suspenseful enough to almost be that way (kinda like &quot;Seven&quot;).</p></body></html>

Although the leading roles are entertaining and effective, the movie is stolen by the quartet of penguins and the gallery of lemurs.  These guys are what really makes the movie so enjoyable.  The animation is brilliant, and there is some clever in jokes parodying CHARIOTS OF FIRE, PLANET OF THE APES and other movies.  There are some delightful tunes as well.  The main voices are supplied by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith and David Schwimmer, but its those hilarious penguins and lemurs that make the most lasting impression.  The four penguins are like undercover covert operators and the lemurs are just whacky and whimsical.  Little Mort (voiced by Andy Richter) is as Gloria the hippo says, "Cute enough to dunk in my coffee."  The movie has a slow start in the zoo setting but once the guys get to Madagascar, its a real hoot.  Children should enjoy the movie; its innuendos and off color humor will more than likely fly fight over their heads, but adults will enjoy this gem as much as the kiddies..I did!!  A marvelous extra is the short film PENGUINS CHRISTMAS CAPER which is a real gas too!</p></body></html>

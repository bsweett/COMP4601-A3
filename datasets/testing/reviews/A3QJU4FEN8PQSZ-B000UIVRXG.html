Moments of understated humor throughout, nothing side-splitting; more overt in the second half. The main character spoofs action movie staples and lines. The main plot point, though, the reason for all the killings, when finally revealed, *is* hilarious indeed, one of the funniest concepts ever, almost worth watching the whole movie.<br /><br />Some quite grisly denouements, one or two of which are guaranteed to make you wince. The explosive ending is completely unnecessary. Timothy Dalton is wonderfully greasy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Meeting of Giants"></head><body><p>Forget for a moment the acting, direction,plot and script,Heat is a film that has managed to pair two of the greatest actors of all time, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. No matter where you go around the globe, ask any person from any culture who his/her favorite actors are and two names will invariably always come up, Pacino and De Niro. To cast these two 'giants of method acting' in one film is a great achievement in itself, and makes Heat a film to be reckoned with.Surely Pacino and De Niro have been in the same movie before, Godfather 2, but as they played the young dad Don Corleone and the old son Michael Corleone, they never actually shared a scene in real time before Heat.<br />Now forget about Pacino and De Niro for a moment, and let us look at the film itself.<br />Heat is the best gangster movie I have seen since the two Godfathers, and this is despite the somehow over the top and sentimental ending which was slightly uneven compared to  everything that happened before in terms of style, plot and tone of the picture.<br />What works so well in favour of the film is a fine direction and script by Michael Mann, and great acting from all involved, Val Kilmer,Tom Sizemore, Ashely Judd, Jon Voight, Ted Levine and Amy Brenneman.<br />It has one of the best bank heist/street battle scene I have ever seen.<br />The plot offers much more than your average cat and mouse chase between cops and robbers: it is evenly focused on the thefts as much as on the drama,and the domestic life/problems of its characters. The characters in Heat have a three dimensional and deep personalities, so much so that you come to know the principle players so well, and whether they are good or bad, you can't not help but feel sympathy and concern for them.<br />The film is quite visual too and we get to see lingering and beautiful shots of LA, especially at night.<br />The bond that eventually ties cop and robber is very well written, two similar men but at the opposite sides of the law develop an understanding and respect for each other, and this adds so much to the film.<br />All these elemets make Heat a movie that should not be missed..one that will entertain you,involve you and delight you with its excellent direction, script and the meeting of two giants.</p></body></html>

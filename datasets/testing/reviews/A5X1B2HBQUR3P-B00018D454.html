The movie is crticized for sadistic gore, but its unfair to judge the movie as a censor or non approver of the genre. To rate a movie you must first enjoy the genre. You see sick horror is not everyone's cup of tea and for the people who do enjoy it, it is not a reflection of a freak sadistic nature of theirs. Its just that such movies peek our human curiosities. Its just a dare thing. Can we stand through this sick blood fest. It's also to explore the sick depravity of human nature. Such movies just tap into our curious voyeuristic tendencies to see to what extent evil intents can hurt and kill others. In that we are just trying to do a reality check and want to get offended and turn away from the sick gore but then again we turn back and complete the movie and only to test our limits. All the gore elements are present and the gore is very realistically portrayed. A remake of the cult classic, leather face and his abnoxious family. Normal formula - 5 guys, of which 2 couples and 1 single guy, on successful pot purchase trip from Mexico land themselves in a middle of nowhere rural area of texas where they invite them selves to trouble and do all the cliched wrong things that you are not supposed to do in a horror movie and land up going deeper into their own torturous deathly ends. You know its a cliche film but hey if you want to watch this movie you are already a  fan of the original and you are watching it to revisit old terrain and for just getting the kicks. So go enjoy and have a bloody good time. It does not pretend to be anything its not. Its not an academy award movie. But having said that all the actors do a pretty good job of making us believe that they are getting ripped apart my chainsaws with their shrieks and ghostly freaked out frightened actin. And as a bonus the lead female character is damn attractive with a good gym body and through the movie we are given a good indication of her ample and healthy figure. Great bloody slasher fest.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OK entertainment; could have been much better"></head><body><p>I wanted to like "Captain America" but the movie's faults made this a one-off--good enough to watch once, but probably not one of those that the viewer will watch over and over again over the years.  The characters had potential but did not live up to this potential.  Steve Rogers and Peggy Clark have a chaste little attraction going, but it never matures into anything of note in the film.  Steve Rogers himself lacks depth, and the film could have developed him, and his friend "Bucky" much more.  The same is true of the villains--they are one-dimensional bad guys and that is pretty much the end of it.<br /><br />The special effects are good, and I applaud that the movie is pretty much true to the original "Captain America" story.  I just think that this one could have been done better.  RJB.</p></body></html>

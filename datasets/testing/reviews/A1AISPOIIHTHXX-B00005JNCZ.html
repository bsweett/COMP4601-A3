While his last name is mentioned a couple times and Che, not once did it occur to me that it meaning him. In reflecting on the film, it had a different resonance. Instead of being a road trip movie about things that change your life, it ended up becoming a look into a life who had enough with things and wanted change. Sure we can disagree with the methods but it's quite a look into a famous leader's backstory.<br /><br />2 friends living in Argentina, Alberto and Ernesto, decide to do what they had been planning for awhile: a big motorcycle trip around South America and ending in a leper colony for volunteer work. Several minor mishaps happen such as a storm or constant motorcycle problems but they gradually get introduced to the problems facing many people which starts to affect Ernesto in a big way.<br /><br />First off, the film is anchored with 2 great performances, especially by Gael Garcia Bernal as Ernesto who manages to say a lot just simply by his expression or his gestures. Second, the cinematography is great with picturesque shots of the countryside including an ancient Mayan civilization. The film never gets preachy, showing that after-school special "we are the world" stuff a lot of these films have. One minor complaint is that the film just feels long at times. And poor Mia Maestro, the only worthwhile character in Poseidon and they write her off and she doesn't last long on Alias. Here, she's in a few scenes at the beginning than she disappears for the entire film. Not to mention the end credits don't mention what became of her.<br /><br />Now for the Che Guevera aspect: watching him do very daring things in the film, particularly involving the leper colony he volunteered at makes you appreciate the social awareness he was starting to now see, as well as trying to promote. Some would describe the man as a hero, others see him as merely a revolutionary who wanted change by any means necessary which of course brings up the ends vs means question. Like many popular figures, he ended up becoming one of the more well-known and influential people even if certain things were questionable.<br /><br />It's certainly a watchable film although I probably wouldn't watch it twice. It's a great character study where your eyes get opened to everything beyond your comfort zone and I think we can all relate.</p></body></html>

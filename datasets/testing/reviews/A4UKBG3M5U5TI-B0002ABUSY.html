However, it's a surprisingly good modern horror flick.  Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter, Go) stars as a young Wisconsin nurse who awakes one morning to an unexplained zombie invasion.  As she flees, she meets other survivors, including Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer.  They hole up in a mall, hoping to escape the fast-moving zombies.<br /><br />First time director Zack Snyder has crafted a first-rate thriller, and the movie really shines in the Director's Cut.  Despite the overabundance of zombie flicks in recent years, "Dawn of the Dead" is surprisingly fresh.  The excellent cast helps make the situations credible; it's a little jarring at first seeing indie queen Sarah Polley in a horror movie, but she more than holds her own.  The action starts right away and never lets up, and the movie includes healthy doses of humor - listen to the muzak playing in the mall as a good example of the twisted humor.  Finally, the makeup and the overall conception of the zombies are outstanding.  The movie clicks on all fronts, managing to be scary and engrossing.  Make sure you watch through the credits - the action doesn't stop!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />DVD Extras: The DVD is loaded with behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and a director's commentary.  Particularly enjoyable are the docs that show how they designed the zombies.</p></body></html>

Mr. Hanks shows why he is the Jimmy Stewart of his generation as just like Mr. Stewart, Mr. Hanks has the ability to play the everyman.  No matter what role he undertakes, we find Mr. Hanks believable and we can all relate to him.  He portrays Capt. Lovell with understated grace and charm and we really feel for him when he comes to the realization that he will never get his chance to walk on the moon.  In addition to Mr. Hanks the film boasts excellent performances by Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife, Bill Paxson as Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon as Jack Swigert the other Apollo 13 crew members, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly an original crew member left out due to possible illness and Ed Harris as Eugene Krantz the head of the mission in Houston.  Ms. Quinlan adds the right amount of fear and worry to her character without becoming shrill and Mr. Sinise overcomes his initial bitterness to becoming an integral part of the crew's survival.  Above all, Mr. Harris gives the performance of his career.  He is commanding and powerful as he vows that the ship will not be lost on his watch.  Ron Howard had the always difficult task of directing a movie based on real life events. Everyone already knows what happens to the ship, but Mr. Howard expertly guides us through to the end.  He supplies the film with enough tension and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The filming of the space launch and scenes in space are amazing.  In one of the grossest oversights in Oscar history, Mr. Howard was not nominated for Best Director despite his film being so.  In fact Mr. Howard won the prestigious Director's Guild Award making the Oscar snub even more glaring.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="my feet were not happy"></head><body><p>I was surprisingly disappointed with *Happy Feet*.  Previous animated films had just kept getting better and better but *Happy Feet* was totally opposite.<br /><br />First of all, Mumble, the star of this film, is just cute, cute, cute!  He's a tap dancer which something that his fellow emperor penguins are not happy about because they're supposed to have a graceful heartsong.  Alas, Mumble cannot sing but he sure can dance.<br /><br />And then, that was just about it!  The rest of the story didn't make sense.  First of all, too many songs!  Seriously, *The Sound of Music*, which I'm not quite fond of, is something I'd rather watch than to go through this again.  At least, TSOM didn't overkill with songs.<br /><br />Then, I get the subtle message about the environment and fishing but it was not effective here.  However, the part where Mumble summons up the courage to go after the ship from diving off a high mountain but somehow ended up in captivity just didn't make sense.  Worse, it continued to be  senseless til the end of the movie.<br /><br />Despite its lousy plot, the animation was good.  In fact, too good that it might be a little too scary for young kids.  The leopard seal and orcas are menacing that they'll give your kids nightmares.<br /><br />However, I'd still wouldn't watch this movie again.</p></body></html>

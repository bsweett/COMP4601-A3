One of the most despised genres in my book!<br />Ok, it is more horror than romance, and the romance is of a very tender age of 12 years, and stays appropriate to the age. No Lolita vampirism here, no precocious liberties either. More holding hands and shy smiles. And the young lady shows her horror mettle in a sufficiently creepy way to keep you interested.<br />Very good remake of a Swedish hit movie after a novel called Let the Right One In.<br />Recommendable if you appreciate the occasional better horror.</p></body></html>

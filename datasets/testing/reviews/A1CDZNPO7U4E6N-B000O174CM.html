<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Hudson..1st movie..I couldn't tell!"></head><body><p>I only have 2 names that come to mind when I think of this movie...Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, or should I say, "Effie White" and "Jimmy Early". Those 2 made this movie. Let me just start by saying that Beyonce' who plays "Deena Jones" may as well have played her real life story. A story about a woman with less talent and better looks being placed as lead singer in a group where the talent is in the back where the looks aren't as important. Not to say that Beyonce' isn't talented, but Destiny's Child fans know what I mean. Anyways, that's another review though. Really, this movie is really about achieving your dreams no matter the cost. It chronicles the rise and fall of a female group of friends from stardom to their downfall when appearances seem to matter much more than real talent does. My girl Jennifer Hudson proves that she not only has the vocal talent, but the girl can act too. An Oscar for her would be well deserved, as well as Eddie Murphy who makes you laugh one minute, and feel incredibly sorry for him the next. Needless to say, I loved everything about this movie, and if I could give it 10 I would.</p></body></html>

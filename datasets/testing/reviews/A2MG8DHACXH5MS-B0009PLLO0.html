Many Greeks I knew were annoyed at the historical inaccuracies. Nonetheless, Alexander was an icon in his time, and strategist supreme whose ability to win battles leading armies at a tender age were legend. It was as if the Greek God of War, Ares himself, had designated Alexander for a life of military glory. Much has been written on the Greek warrior and Stone does a decent job bringing a legend to life. Colin Farrell kind of pulls it off because he is close to Alexander's age during the time period of his best battles. Only Farrell, with his utter lack of discipline in real life, can't quite step into Alexander's shoes. Angelina Jolie is a riveting mother who seems to succeed only in fostering some subtle Oedipal complex in her son. And as for Alexander's father, he was never blind.<br /><br />There must be something to the age 26. Eva Peron likened herself to Alexander, and became the most powerful women in patriarchal Argentina at 26 only to also die at 33. A life lived like a fast fire who burned out rather than faded away.</p></body></html>

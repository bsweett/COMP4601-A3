<meta name="summary" content="Very good film"></head><body><p>Is really a 4.5  Very nice to see a movie about a real person<br /><br />that was a hero to so many in New Jersey. Brought to you by<br /><br />Ron Howard, you know its not gonna be boring.  Kudo to russell<br /><br />Crow for a good believable performance...Rene who portrait  his<br /><br />wife is good but not as believable...she seems too pretty, always<br /><br />clean...no wrinkles caused by the depression and hard time of<br /><br />bringing up family...but i could be wrong...<br /><br />Anyway good movie for the holidays....and it has quality and<br /><br />can be watched by the whole family.....and no rap music...great.</p></body></html>

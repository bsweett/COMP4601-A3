<meta name="summary" content="The Centerpiece to the Blu-Ray Collection of the Planet of the Apes"></head><body><p>Fox Finally did something right.<br /><br />The case opens up to a detailed timeline of Ape events.<br /><br />The case opens further, providing a 200 page full colour, glossy imaged retrospective worthy of any collection.<br /><br />The presentation of each film is beyond reproach. It is still this reviewer's opinion that anything being released on this scale on BD should be released in 7.1 digital sound. Each film presents its own harsh review of humanity and some on the purported truths thereabout.<br /><br />The BDs themselves are mounted on hard board backs by what amounts to pegs of gorilla glue (natch). These discs come away with a twist of a turn, not the man-handling we mere humans are accustomed to.<br /><br />It's too pretty (and too big) to fit with my present collection of BDs, but it doesn't belong with them per say. This is a collection treated dearly and presented as it should be: a milestone in cinema, sociology, and dystopic science-fact.<br /><br />These movies should be required viewing for all whom claim civility. This set deserves centre seat in any BD collection</p></body></html>

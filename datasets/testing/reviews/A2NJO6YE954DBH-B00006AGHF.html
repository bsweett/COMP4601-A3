<meta name="summary" content="A thoughtful film about two guys not thinking straight"></head><body><p>Any thoughts that &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; would be a predictable film should have gone out the window as soon as you saw Samuel L. Jackson was involved.  The story is about two men who do not have time for a freeway fender bender.  Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer who has some important papers to file to prove an ailing millionaire signed over control of his foundation to Banek's law firm.  Doyle Gipson (Jackson), also has to get to court so he can show he got approved for a loan to buy a house so that his wife will not move with his two sons to Oregon.  The accident itself is really nobody's fault, but everything that happens after words in this escalating war of words and deeds can be laid at the feet of Gavin and Doyle, who dive off into the deep end.<p>The movie ads proclaimed &quot;One wrong turn deserves another,&quot; and it helps set the audience up for the carnage these two reap on each other's lives as their frustrations give way to anger.  They have good reason to be frustrated: Doyle gets to court too late and his last chance to keep his family together is gone; Gavin arrives at court only to discover he has left the most important document behind.  It turns out that this document is so important that not having it can put him and the bosses at his firm, including his father-in-law, in prison.  These are two men whose lives have come to major crossroads.  This is news to Gavin, but the impact is not less than it is on Doyle.<p>The trailer for &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; emphasizes the horrible things these two men manage to do to each other during the course of what is clearly the worst days of their lives.  Gavin uses a computer wizard to destroy Doyle's credit rating.  Doyle loosen the bolts on the wheel of Gavin's car.  If somebody does not end up dead by the end of this film, then we are all going to be very much surprised.  But that is what makes this film worth watching is that it is surprising, as when Gavin and Doyle both discover the true value of the lives they have been trying to lead are found in the women they have married (Amanda Peet and Kim Stauton respectively).  <p>Ultimately, it is the ability of the script by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin to surprises us and lifts &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; above the standard Hollywood tale of urban violence.  These two men could be cartoonish figures, but they become fully developed characters; not because of what they do to each other, but because of what they articulate about their lives in talking to others.  Gavin confesses to his former mistress (Toni Collette) while Doyle bare his soul to his AA sponsor (William Hurt).  In their initial conversation after the accident Gavin and Doyle are too worried about where they should be to have a civil conversation.  Their next words are insults that they shout (and fax).  But the film holds the promise that once these two men hit rock bottom that they might final turn on one another and talk.</p></body></html>

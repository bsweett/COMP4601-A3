<meta name="summary" content="This Version... EVEN BETTER!!"></head><body><p>Only a few deleted scenes have been added to this classic movie, but they truly improve upon the original!<br /><br />the "spider-walk" will give you goose-bumps.<br /><br />The added dialogue scenes are also essential. Reagan's doctor appointment depicts her initial change as subtle... from a sweet girl to a foul mouthed brat. Father Merrin gives his opinion and how... or why... God allows such horrors as demon possession. And the new conclusion featuring Father Dyer and Kinderman is more comforting than the "lone man looking down the stairs" ending.<br /><br />The version you've never seen captures the spirit of Blatty's novel, and seems less ambiguous than Freidkin's original. When one watches the original, one can't help but get the impression that Freidkin celebrates the triumph of evil over good. The subtle changes in this film let us realize that evil can occasionally win the battle, but will never win the war.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

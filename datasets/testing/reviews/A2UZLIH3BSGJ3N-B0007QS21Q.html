<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Re-Make"></head><body><p>If memory serves,this is a remake of a very old "The Outer Limits" t.v series episode.It was also re-done a good 10-15yrs. ago when HBO(or Showtime?)picked up the series.Although it has been completely overhauled,it still maintains the basic plot&ideas.This film was very well done.The special effects of course were stunning&flawless,and the nice thing about this movie was that the cgi effects did'nt overwhelm the film,which could have easily been done.Many times the special effects of films become so daunting,that they either distract your from the film,or are just there to make you go "wow",or they are a distraction to keep you from paying attention to a badly written&directed film,that wouldn't even be produced into a movie of the week.<br /><br /> Good examples of films that are just too much&you should stay away from at all costs are: Star Wars The Phantom Menace,Star Wars The Attack of the Clones,Twister,The Hulk,The Day After Tommorrow,Godzilla(1998)...the list is ever growing of supposed "Block Busters" that really turn out to be insulting to the viewer,or fan if anything.Now that I'm done with my rant,I have nothing but good things to say about this film.Will Smith is great to see on screen,but the real catcher of this film are the characters,particularly the robot(s) and the story.It is a great,updated "who done it" story.It also(breifly&lightly)touches the subject of artificial life,as well as the morals?ics of creating such life.Do humans have the right "to play god" and what might be the reprocussions of doing so?All in all...this film was very slick,and it's one that can be viewed multiple times without growing tired of it.</p></body></html>

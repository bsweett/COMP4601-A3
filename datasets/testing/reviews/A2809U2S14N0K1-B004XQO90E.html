<meta name="summary" content="An interesting plot"></head><body><p>I found the story interesting. A guy has eight minutes repeatedly, in a train that some loony is blowing up. Looking at the plot I kept thinking what if some evil guy got hold of this machine, what could he do with it?<br /><br />I found the characters fascinating without being over the top. I did very much like the acting by Vera Farmiga, in particular.  I also liked Jake Gyllenhaal too.<br /><br />I confess, I did not like the ending. I did not make sense with the story and I think it would have been better not to have a typical Hollywood happy ending.</p></body></html>

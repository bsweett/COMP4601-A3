<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching"></head><body><p>A wonderful animated film, Ratatouille, brings to the screen the story of a rat that loves cooking and a young man that is hopeless at it. When the two meet they will team up and take the world of refined cuisine by surprise...<br />All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come alive)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all excellent!<br />In short, Ratatouille is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc., and Over the Hedge. 4.5 Stars</p></body></html>

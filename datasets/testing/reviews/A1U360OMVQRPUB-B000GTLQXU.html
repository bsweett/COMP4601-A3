This is only the third movie to bear the name and be based (loosely) on Paul Gallico's novel, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  There was also a sequel to the original diaster film made by Irwin Allen that starred Ernest Borgnine and Shelly Winters and a ton of others that went on to be major stars.<br /><br />This version offers Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, and Andre Braugher.  Unfortunately, it only features the actors and actresses in roles that you can understand at a glance.  There are no real characters here, no sense of history.<br /><br />What you do get is a knuckle-buster of an adrenaline-soaked movie.  After POSEIDON was overturned by the rogue wave about eighteen minutes into the film, I didn't draw a breath till the final frames rolled through.  Was the plot predictable?  Sure.  Could I figure out who was going to live and who was going to die?  I was right more times than I was wrong.<br /><br />POSEIDON was shot on 53 sound stages, some of them several stories tall.  The special effects were amazing and the digital work is unsurpassed.  The ship felt real even though it wasn't.<br /><br />In this HD-DVD version, the video portions are beautiful and really show off the cinematography and sets.  But the audio is where POSEIDON soars.  Captured in Dolby TrueHD, one of the best lossless codec on the market today.  A surround sound system totally enhances the viewing experience, and this is one of the movies you can show off your system on.<br /><br />The viewing can be gut-wrenching and the intensity is definitely pumped up, so young viewers probably aren't a good idea.  But for someone who's looking for a high-end action movie that doesn't slow down during a 90-minute presentation, POSEIDON is great entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This fog rolls in and bores you to the point of distraction (if you are lucky)"></head><body><p>I never thought that much of John Carpenter's original version of "The Fog," but I have to admit that I think better of it now that I have endured this 2005 remake by Rupert Wainwright ("Stigmata").  At least with that one there are fond memories of John Houseman as an old sea dog with a story to tell and Adrienne Barbeau as the DJ in the lighthouse.  Now we have Tom Welling from "Smallville" with a three days growth of beard as fisherman Nick Castle and Maggie Grace from "Lost" as his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams who gets back in town just in time for the fun with the fog.  At first she is the requisite damsel in distress, but then that part takes a twist.  Anyhow, they are the ones that things happen to outside the lighthouse as people are dying in horrible ways while Selma Blair as Stevie Wayne is doing her DJ thing while the fog rolls in and frets about what can happen to her son on a night like this.<br /><br />One complaint I want to make right away is that the fog in "The Fog" rolls in too quickly, which seems a strange comment to make for a film that seems overlong at 103 minutes (including three that makes this the "unrated edition," a label whose cache value is next to nil given what has been foisted on us to date).  Slower would be more ominous, but apparently that is not what Wainwright wanted in this movie, even in the parts that demand some ominosity (or would it be "ominousness"?).  Here the fog comes in fast and it comes in against the wind, so it cannot be a good thing.  But if the titular weather condition is not as creepy as you can imagine it being, that is not a good sign, whatever the instrument readings might be.<br /><br />This is one of those films where once upon a time, a long time ago, some people did something bad and now years later the people living there are going to have to pay for what those other people did.  We get a taste of what the founders of Antonio Bay did at the start of the movie, but you have to wait for the climax to get the rest of the story and understand, so to speak, what is now happening.  But I was sort of distracted by the idea of who was the catalyst for all this nonsense since it seemed such a chance occurrence to set everything in motion even with Cooper Layne's screenplay helping things along.<br /><br />I was bored to the point of distraction for most of this film, even as the body count climbed.  When we got to the twist at the end it barely registered (usually I would be thinking of how it could have worked better, but I just did not care).  I would be worried for Welling's film career but I saw the 100th episode of "Smallville" last night and "Reckoning" will certainly stand out on his resume more than this film.  If everybody else forgets about it, then he can too.  Final thought: This version of "The Fog" also made me think more highly of "La Noche del terror ciego" and the rest of Amando de Ossorio's "Blind Dead" movies.  At least they understood the idea of horror as something slow and creeping. Oh oh.  Now it strikes me that "Pirates of the Caribbean" was a better horror film than this version of "The Fog."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better Than Big, Jennifer Garner is a Comedy Genious."></head><body><p>This is definately better than the film that sparked it.  This film moves much faster and it is more bright and fun.  Jennifer Garner is a great actress and she truely shows it in this film.  She is laugh out loud funny, but she can bring you back down and be dramatic and pitiful.  Hopefully she will follow in Tom Hanks footsteps.  Mark Ruffalo did a good job, and for all you fans of reality TV, he bears odd resemblence to Survivor: All Star's Boston Rob.?  The film also had a great soundtrack.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves to have a great time at the movies.  This is definately the best comedy of 2004.</p></body></html>

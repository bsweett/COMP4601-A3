<meta name="summary" content="A fine thriller despite terribly misguided direction"></head><body><p>The Bourne Supremacy is one of those films where the cast and the plotting are strong enough to survive some extremely bad direction from Paul Greengrass. Former documentarian Greengrass might be overcompensating for what is in essence a pretty commonplace revenge story, but it seems far more likely that he's inadvertently done his best to sabotage his own movie by over-rationalizing each scene without realising that when they're all put together his mixture of shakeycam incomprehensibility (often in scenes where there is no emotional or narrative need for it), redundant shifts of focus, overediting and overly dark photography just makes him come across as an unimaginative Michael Bay wannabe hack rather than creating an illusion of reality or placing the audience in his amnesiac hero's confused shoes. Indeed, he's giving the audience even LESS information and frequently obscuring the action because he's forgotten that just because HE knows what's going on doesn't mean the audience will. On the plus side, this is much less of a problem on the small screen than the big screen, where motion sickness and whiplash were real possibilities, but it's still disappointing considering that one of the great joys of the original was Doug Liman's old-school direction - it was genuinely refreshing to see action scenes where the director was showing you the scene instead of drawing attention to himself after so many years of MTV incomprehensibility. After the problems on the first film, there was no possibility of Liman returning. It's just a shame they couldn't hire a competent director<br /><br />With such a handicap, it's surprising that it works so very well - especially since there are few narrative surprises (you can guess the villain long before a trusting sacrificial lamb gives him a crucial piece of information at the cost of his life simply by scanning out the cast list and looking for the first likely typecast suspect to jump out at you). But then the fun of the first film wasn't what it did, but how it did it, particularly the practical ways Bourne evades and eludes his pursuers: the first car chase exists in a credible milieu, constantly thwarted by traffic jams and crowds. The film even manages to find an environment where Joan Allen's eternal humorlessness actually seems appropriate, and it's a genuine surprise that the film's climax is an emotional scene that effectively damns its hero even as he tries to unburden himself of guilt. Impressive stuff despite the problems.</p></body></html>

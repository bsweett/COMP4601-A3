<meta name="summary" content="Loved it"></head><body><p>As far as monster movies go, I enjoyed this more than Cloverfield which I just saw last night and I watched this tonight. This, I felt, had a stronger storyline and the characters were more flushed out. You got to know the people and root for them to make it. In Cloverfield, I really didn't care if the people lived or not. They were all kind of annoying.<br /><br />Inside the store, it was like it was right out a Twilight Zone episode. Brilliantly done. The CGI on the monsters was...umm...bad. But if you overlook that, this is just a perfect suspenseful horror movie.</p></body></html>

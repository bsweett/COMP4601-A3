<meta name="summary" content="Daddys and Daughters"></head><body><p>My favorite Clint Eastwood line from all of his movies was from the film "Absolute Power" when he says "when you went after my little girl, well that was completely unacceptable"  Every daddy of a daughter, I think can relate that there is nothing that would be off limits in getting your daughter out of similar circumstances as portrayed in the film. Most of us would lack the skills and resources to pull off the heroics, but not the resolve.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is  still a great action hero, my wife and I have loved him since we first watched "Rob Roy" many years ago, and he is flawless here as a retired agent who wants nothing as bad as having a relationship with his daughter before it's too late.<br /><br />"I was a preventer."<br />"What what did you prevent?"<br />"I prevented bad things from happening"<br /><br />This is a great action movie!</p></body></html>

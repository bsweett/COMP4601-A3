<meta name="summary" content=""If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball""></head><body><p>So, here is a silly and vulgar piece of fluff that has some moments that are quite funny.  Vince Vaughn is the broke and nearly ruined Peter Le Fleur, owner of Average Joes Gym, and Ben Stiller is the beyond creepy White Goodman, maniac owner of the successful Globo Gym which is right across the street from the failing Average Joes.  White has taken advantage of Peter's defaulting on his second mortgage to get his paws on Average Joes Gym to tear it down to expand his parking.  Of course, Peter has 30 days to come up with the fifty grand to stay the foreclosure and death of his moribund gym.<br /><br />Steven Root plays Gordon, one of the loveable losers whose non-life revolves around Average Joes.  Gordon reads Obscure Sports Monthly.  It happens they can win the $50,000 if they can win a dodgeball tournament in Vegas.  Never mind the expense or taxes, the amount has to match exactly what is needed because it doesn't really matter at all.  It is just a plot device for the silliness which ensues.<br /><br />Rip Torn plays the wheelchair bound Patches O'Houlihan, the minor deity of the sport of dodgeball.  He takes on the loveable losers and trains them to win the tournament.  He offers the classic line of the movie, "If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball."<br /><br />Don't expect more than goofey and rough humor and you will have a good time.</p></body></html>

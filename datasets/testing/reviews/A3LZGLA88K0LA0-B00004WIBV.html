<meta name="summary" content="A STUNNING INTERPRETATION OF A GREAT CLASSIC"></head><body><p>Tim Burton has proven you can take a classic story, give it new twists, and still maintain the flavor of the original.  This is a wonderfully filmed and acted spook and laugh fest!  Johnny Depp is perfect as Ichabod Crane, and the supporting cast is outstanding all the way around.  Even Caspier van Dien shows a little finesse (which is unusual for him!).  The British actors, especially Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Richard Griffiths, not to mention horror veteran Michael Gough, are all outstanding and lend the most effective creepiness to this lushly filmed epic.  The casting of Christopher Walken as the Horsemen was inspired; did anyone catch an unbilled Martin Landau as the first victim?<p>A wonderful movie, we highly recommend.</p></body></html>

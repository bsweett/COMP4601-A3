He is celebrating his engagement to Julia (played by Michelle Monaghan) when he is asked to help rescue one of his former students.  From there on out things go downhill as the mission goes awry and his new enemy Owen Davian<br /><br />(Philip Seymour Hoffman) thwarts him at every turn.  There is plenty of action, high-tech hijinks, narrow escapes, and romance to keep everyone happy in this slick new addition to the Mission Impossible series.  In this one, Cruise's IMF buddies try to convince him that he cannot have a career and a serious relationship too.  He is determined to prove them wrong.</p></body></html>

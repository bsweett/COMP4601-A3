As his writer friend Holly Martin (Joseph Cotton) discovers when he arrives in Vienna to meet up with his old friend and college chum Harry became quite a different person than he was earlier in their friendship. He's also either dead or simply vanished and Holly decides he must find out what happened to Lime and who he truly was.<br /><br />Carol Reed's brilliant film of Graham Greene's post-War novel quickly turns into an existential noir mystery capturing the creepy look and feel of post WWII Vienna which has become a black cauldron of pararnoia as the Americans, British and Russians occupy the city each trying to outwit the other.<br /><br />This reissue from StudioCanal/Lion's Gate is inferior looking to the superb brief release by Criterion (before their license was up). That transfer was crisp looking with considerable repair work done in the digital realm to the film while the transfer itself was sharper with solid blacks, great fine detail considering the age of the film and grain management wasn't over-the-top. This edition features the over use of digital noise reduction often smoothing out the noir look of the film by robbing it of its atmospheric grain resulting in the images looking a bit softered and smeared.<br /><br />The audio isn't as clear or as consistent as the Criterion release; you can hear the pops and imperfections from the original analog soundtrack here whereas Criterion smoothed those out removing them and also did some leveling so that the dialogue and music is consistent throughout in terms of volume neither of which is the case with this new edition of the film.<br /><br />That isn't to say that the StudioCanal/Lion's Gate version is horrible; "The Third Man" looks decent although there's evident damage to the print that hasn't been repaired that crops up throughout the movie. Compared to the Criterion edition from 2008, the StudioCanal/Lion's Gate version is inferior in every way but not a bad presentation of the film by any means and is worth the upgrade if you are a hugh fan of the film.<br /><br />The extras here are different than the Criterion edition. The Criterion had among other things a 90 minute excellent doucmentary that "shadowed" the making of this terrific film as well as the original treatment by Greene, a radio episode of Welles' excellent series "The Lives of Harry Lime", two exceptional audio commentaries for the film and press booklet materials and an hour program on writer Graham Greene.<br /><br />THIS edition has an excellent commentary track featuring Welles biographer and actor Simon Callow along with assistant director Guy Hamilton and script supervisor Angela Allen. It's a fairly lively and entertaining commentary track that covers everything from Greene's original script, issues they had shooting on location to working with Welles and Cotton (and disspelling some myths about Welles "directing" his own scenes). It's the best special feature here and kudos to StudioCanal/Lion's Gate for assembling it. I do wish more thought had gone into the other special features however.<br /><br />We get an interactive tour of post WWII Vienna, interviews with Joseph Cotton (from 1987) and Graham Greene as well as a 1951 episode of "The Lives of Harry Lime" entitled "A Ticket to Tangiers". The Lux radio adaptation of "The Third Man" and a featurette on the zither played by Cornelia Mayer who played the instrument in the film. We also get the alternate opening narration, stills and other minor extras.<br /><br />If you missed the chance to pick up the Criterion on Blu-ray, this edition is a good second choice. Although the film doesn't look quite as good in its presentation and while some of the extras are very similar we are missing the excellent 90 minute documentary on the making of the film as well as the other two audio commentary tracks from the Criterion, a 60 minute program on Greene and a 30 minute documentary from down under. Unlike the recent "The Stranger" on Blu-ray that was a public domain print, this edition of "The Third Man" is from similar elements (and perhaps the same print)as that provided to Criterion with just the clean up work and restoration that Criterion did missing here.<br /><br />Still recommended but if you have the Criterion--keep it.</p></body></html>

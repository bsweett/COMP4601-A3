<meta name="summary" content="Whoa Whoa Scary"></head><body><p>I can 't believe this came out of hollywood a clean horror imagine that . It's scary also this a gem of film a throw back to the horror films of yester year the way horror should be.<br /><br />Warning: to who it may concern this film is very dark& scary would'nt recommend taking young kids to it . The reason for it being PG-13 is it's very tense . why i'm giving it 4 stars is I was bugged by anti-reglion tone part in the film besides that i'd go again to get scared out of my head. Nicole Kidman is superb in this role , watch the kids they amazed me & the casting was great.</p></body></html>

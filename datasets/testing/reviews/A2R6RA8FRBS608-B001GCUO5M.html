The acting is very convincing; Leonardo DiCaprio in particular gives one of his very best performances. The casting was thoughtfully done and this makes the film even more powerful; and the cinematography combined with the choreography pack quite a punch. The script was well written, too.<br /><br />When the film starts we meet US federal marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) who are on their way by ferry to an eerie island off the Massachusetts coast where Ashcliff hospital for the dangerously criminally insane is located. One of the patients has escaped from her locked room; and the staff, including Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) simply have no clue as to how she escaped and where she could be on this remote and foreboding island with its rocky cliffs--and no transportation to and from the mainland except for a single, highly guarded ferry boat. Unfortunately, however, Teddy and his partner Chuck are thwarted by Dr. Cawley, who refuses to make staff records available to them.<br /><br />There's so much more that I can tell you without giving too much away. Right from the very beginning we can see how Teddy can't handle the water; his seasickness on the ferry boat to Shutter Island is just the beginning of what will prove to be a series of unpleasant and even horrifying things that happen to him. Moreover, Teddy's new partner doesn't know the real reason Teddy wanted this assignment. Teddy found out that the man who started a fire that killed his wife and daughter, Laeddis (Elias Koteas), is in the hospital there and Teddy wants revenge. Teddy also wants to "blow the lid off" what he thinks is the hospital's ability to secretly experiment on the mind using lobotomies and other questionable surgical procedures. In addition, slowly but surely we begin to see how Shutter Island resembles a concentration camp from World War Two that Teddy helped to liberate.<br /><br />There's still so much more, but suffice it to say that gradually Teddy's flashbacks and other visions become more and more frequent and unsettling. His partner Chuck goes missing; will Teddy be able to find him? How does Teddy's World War Two experience factor into this? Will Teddy and his partner ever find the missing patient; or will they have to retreat and experience the embarrassment that they failed in their mission to locate the missing patient and, for Teddy, to get even with Laeddis?<br /><br />It may well appear that I've given it all away; but there are still so many surprises and unexpected plot twists that I assure you I haven't. Indeed, the final fifteen to twenty minutes of the film provide such a, unexpected, shocking conclusion that it will haunt you for quite some while to come. Look also for good performances by Jackie Earle Haley as George Noyce and Patricia Clarkson as "Rachel 2." Michelle Williams is exceptionally good at playing Teddy's late wife, Dolores.<br /><br />The DVD doesn't come with any extras; I would have loved a commentary with Scorsese, DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo or even all three; but we just don't get it.<br /><br />Shutter Island may not be for the faint of heart; but for those of us who choose to watch and own this movie on DVD will not be disappointed. There's so much suspense in this psychological thriller that it's truly remarkable; this will have a lasting impact on you. I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

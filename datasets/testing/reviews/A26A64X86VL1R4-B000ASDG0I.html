Be careful not to switch your brain on because the writing/editing of this film is a little uneven.<br /><br />However, the performances and filming of Jolie and Pitt are great--it makes you wish for a little more thought into the plot.  The action scenes are too long and the endless repartee between Jolie and Pitt regarding what they don't know about one another would be tiresome if, again, Pitt and Jolie weren't so charming and good at what they do.</p></body></html>

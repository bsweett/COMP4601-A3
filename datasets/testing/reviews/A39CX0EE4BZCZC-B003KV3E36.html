I've never seen so many heads blown off, limbs blasted away with blood spurting out and holes blasted in the middle of chests and stomachs in one movie in my life.....and it's only 81 minutes long! (The last dozen minutes are ending credits.) Man, this is almost non-stop action and suspense/ Yeah, a bunch of it is overdone but overall, it still was an entertaining movie.<br /><br />After an absence of 20 years, Sylvester Stallone's "John Rambo" comes back to the screen. Rambo is the kind of guy you don't want on your college debate team but he's a number one draft choice on the field of battle. He's a man of few words and a lot of testosterone. With veins popping out of his arms like a 25-year-old bodybuilder, old man Sylvester Stallone looks more juiced than Barry Bonds but at least it makes him look the part, even if he does have bags under his eyes.<br /><br />Despite the mayhem, there actually was a small story with a decent message about making your life stand for something. "Rambo Gets A Conscience" could be another title to this movie.  Nothing wrong with that!<br /><br />One last thing:  this was nicely filmed, with fantastic jungle scenery. Kudos for cinematographer Glen MacPherson and director Stallone for some incredible shots. I cannot imagine how good this must look on a high-definition Blu-Ray disc.</p></body></html>

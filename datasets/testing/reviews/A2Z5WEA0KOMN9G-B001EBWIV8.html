It had a fairly interesting plot and okay acting (except for Keanu).  They should have kept it at one Matrix and not make anymore.  But cash cows being what they are this movie was made.<br />Anyways, the action scenes in this movie were okay for the most part but can we come up with something other than the slow motion animation that is now so prevelant?  It was relatively fresh in the first one, now it is getting stale.  Another thing, why the scene with the infinite Agent Smiths?  I thought it was cool at first but dragged on too long.  And then the dialogue, gah.  I don't like Star Trek because of all the meaningless Technobabble and this stuff made Star Trek look exciting.  About the only scene I really liked was the restaurant.<br />However the thing that bugged me most was the abrupt "ending".  I realize this was because they were releasing Revolutions in November (or so they same).  It seems more like like they can make double the revenue if they release it as two movies instead of one.  So now that they've got this precedent, more movies will be released like this.  But then again, this was a 90 minute movie that seemed like 900 minutes, so I don't think I could take the full 3 hours worth of movie.</p></body></html>

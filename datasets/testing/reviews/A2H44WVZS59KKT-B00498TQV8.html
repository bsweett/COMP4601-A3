<meta name="summary" content="One of best book to movie adaptations I have ever seen"></head><body><p>I was leery about seeing this movie, even though I had read and heard rave reviews about it, because I had enjoyed the book so much.  And, needless to say, you hardly ever find a movie adaptation of a book that lives up to your expectations.  Well, in this case, the movie far bypassed my expectations and I would be hard-pressed to decide which I liked more - novel or movie.<br /><br />Casting is superb in the movie.  Setting is very true-to-life.  This is not an easy or fun movie to watch - the subject matter is too hard.  But if you want to see an authentic movie about the lives of hardscrabble people, most of whom are living on the fringes of the meth cooking, distributing and using subculture, this is a movie to watch.  It is also a movie about rising above your circumstances and shining, which Ree Dolly does, even though she has terrible obstacles placed in front of her.  So even though this is a very dark movie, it is not a hopeless movie.<br /><br />NOTE:  Marideth Sisco provides much of the music for the soundtrack of the movie.  If you like bluegrass music at all or just shining, clear vocals check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041TM590">Winter's Bone Soundtrack</a>.<br /><br />Caution:  drug references, drug use, strong language, violent images<br /><br />Edited on December 23, 2010:<br />People magazine chose this movie as one of their top 10 movies for 2010 in their December 27th issue.  Well deserved!</p></body></html>

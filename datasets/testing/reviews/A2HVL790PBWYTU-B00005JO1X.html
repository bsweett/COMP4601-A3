<meta name="summary" content="...HEY, I REMEMBER NARNIA..."></head><body><p>This seven-book effort by C.S. Lewis was the third children's series which I've read and thoroughly enjoyed as a child (the first being L. Frank Baum's Oz books, the second Lloyd Alexander's five novels of Prydain). I'm in my 30s so it's a bit hard to hearken back to that sense of wonder and delight elicited by Mr. Lewis and his creation. What remains is a whiff of nostalgia and a certain recognition that yes, once upon a time, Narnia was a huge, essential piece of my formative childhood.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent film adaptation of the novel and nicely sets up the series. This opener tells the tale of the four Pevensie children - Peter, the oldest of the quartet; Susan, the maternal, practical older sister; the stubborn, angry Edmund; and the youngest, Lucy. To escape the bombings of WW2 London, the children are sent by their mother to the safety of a professor's rural household. There, involved in a hide & seek game, they go thru a wardrobe and happen upon Narnia, a magical land cursed with a Hundred-Year Winter and inhabited by fauns, centaurs, talking beasts and the seemingly immortal evil White Witch. And inhabited also by Aslan, the wonderful lion and deux-ex-machina of the series. So there -  the stage is set, the personalities introduced, the conflict layed out, and any more details would just be giving the story away.<br /><br />The kid actors are obviously instrumental to the success of the film. William Mosely as Peter and Anna Popplewell as Susan are serviceable. Peter is bland and at times looks awkward as the older Son of Adam; Susan just doesn't have enough to do here, but even in the book, her character is the least filled out. It is the two younger siblings, Lucy and Edmund, as portrayed by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes, who shine in the spotlight. Children in the viewing audience will doubtless be seeing the film thru Lucy's eyes, more so than thru any of the other characters' herein. Georgie as Lucy carries that burden exceedingly well, emoting with a natural skill more suited for older thespians. She has several scenes with Aslan that were key to the forwarding of the movie, as well as the lending of empathy towards Aslan, and she convincingly pulls them off.  Skalar is an even more mature actor and provides the early conflict in the movie and does it with such ease, I found myself disliking him from the get-go. The grown-ups do a credible job, especially James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus and Jim Broadbent as the benevolent professor. Tilda Swinton could've been more demonstrative in her role as the Witch but her under-the-top acting - her intense stillness, if you will - is explained in great detail in the extra features (the kids' commentary, to be exact).<br /><br />The special effects are very good, which is to be expected, given our current technological state. Aslan, the beavers, and the rest of the talking beasts and fairy tale creatures are realized convincingly. The big battle at the finale is a tad reminiscent of the battles in the Lord of the Rings in terms of the combatants involved, but *shrug* given the make-up of these fantastical movies, what else can you expect but to see orcs, giants and sundry magical uglies? The fight scenes are nothing exceptional, but do remember that these are mostly kids in lead roles and they remain somewhat realistic in their military prowess (I did cringe when Peter cheesily pointed his sword at the Witch, when she entered Aslan's camp and demanded Edmund be given to her). There is a fair amount of violence here: swordplays, arrows hitting their mark, the Witch callously turning Narnians to stone and a grim scene with Aslan on the stone table, being brutalized by the Witch's minions and then, finally, by the Witch herself. All acts aren't overly gory (this film is rated PG) and are depicted with the targeted children in mind and they also happen to be necessary to be true to the books, especially the last scene mentioned.<br /><br />There's been incessant talk (to ad nauseam, I feel) of Lewis's insertions of religious overtones in the film (Aslan, whose father is the Emperor Over the Sea, is obviously meant to be Narnia's version of Jesus; in A Magician's Nephew, a later Narnia installment, there is even a blatant scene involving a forbidden apple). Here's my take:  reading the Narnia Chronicles as a kid, I was quite oblivious to all the religious connotations, references to sons of Adam and daughters of Eve notwithstanding; but I don't for one second believe missing out on the Christian themes herein harmed or benefited me in any way.  Listen,  I endorse everyone's personal right to believe in and follow his/her own God. If parents wish to point out these theological aspects to their kids, that is, of course, totally within their purview.  Lewis's religious references do provide gentle guides to the ways of Christianity. However,  I feel that this offering by C.S. Lewis shouldn't be used as a polarizing tool for Christians and non-Christians and should above all be enjoyed as an excellent adventure book/film for children and adults alike.<br /><br />So, overall, four stars for this dvd. There is an abundance of extra features, which are informative and entertaining. There are so-so outtakes; one filmmaker/adult commentary, another commentary by the kids and director Andrew Adamson; an in-depth "making of" documentary, various diaries...all in all, they validate the price of this 2-disc dvd. Why not give it five stars, you ask? Because, in direct comparison with the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, this film falls a slight notch below. But, having said that, I still cannot wait for the sequel and subsequent films. Go Lucy and Aslan!</p></body></html>

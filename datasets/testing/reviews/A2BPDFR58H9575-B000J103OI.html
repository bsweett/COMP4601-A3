<meta name="summary" content="The Devil Wears Prada And Looks Great in It"></head><body><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />A sweet, clever but fashion challenged girl Andy (Anne Hathaway) who dreams of becoming a writer suddenly finds a job, "million girls would kill for", as a second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the draconian demanding editor of the most prestigious fashion Runway magazine in New York City. The job description - to be available for her boss 365/24/7 and to be ready for the labors that even the legendary Hercules would not be able to accomplish.<br /><br />The movie about fashion industry is always fun to watch and "The Devil Wears Prada" is not an exception. I loved the look, the clothes, the shoes (OMG!!), the bags, the clips from the fashion shows. Stanley Tucchi is memorable in the supporting role - this guy is seriously underrated. Anne Hathaway is very likable and she's got beautiful eyes and lips. But THE main reason to see the movie is Meryl Streep who reigns and over-towers everything in it as the Uber-[...] Miranda Priestly. She should play the roles like that more often. Big thumbs up! She looked very sexy too. What I did not like - in the film her Miranda comes up somehow sympathetic. In the book she was totally heartless, self-obsessed and manipulating. There are some changes in the script comparing to the book that make Andy's final decision rather unconvincing. What happened in the book made it much more believable. When it comes to the story and the reasons for Andy's feeling guilt, the movie gets weak. I did not see any betrayal or losing the integrity or selling the soul there. Quoting a friend, "She did NOT manipulate or back stab or undermine her co-worker. She did a better job. And was rewarded. That is NOT betrayal." And one more thing - why did her friend make such a big deal out of Andy's rather innocent conversation with Christian Thompson at the Art show? With all these "serious" conflicts, the movie should be called "Much Ado About Nothing". Once again, bravo to Meryl Streep for her fantastic performance.</p></body></html>

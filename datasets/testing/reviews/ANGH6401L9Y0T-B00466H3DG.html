Kate Winslet plays Clementine Kruczynski, a free spirit who dyes her hair all sorts of unnatural colors as whim takes her. She works in Barnes & Noble so Joel knows where to find her. So imagine his surprise after a night of falling in love he goes to B&N to see her and finds that she's talking to a much younger man (Elijah Wood, who plays Patrick, a technician) and acts like she doesn't even know Joel.<br /><br />It turns out she has gone to a doctor who is able to selectively erase memories of any particular person from one's mind, and has had Joel erased. Joel is sufficiently insulted and distressed that he arranges for the procedure to have her erased. But things do not go quite according to plan.<br /><br />The various interlocking stories are told in flashbacks which are effectively the memories as they are being erased, in which both Joel and Clementine keep wanting to resist the erasure and remember one another. It's a very trippy, surrealistic movie, but it's wonderful.<br /><br />We all better hope Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) never becomes real. Apparently we are all better off with our memories intact, even of the painful bits.</p></body></html>

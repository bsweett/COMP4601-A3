<meta name="summary" content="Well made, but predictable"></head><body><p>Given the very poor overall quality of sci-fi movies released every year, maybe I don't have the right to complain about Equilibrium. After all, it's a well-made, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi movie in the finest tradition of the `highest' prototype of the genre, with some great design ideas and highly impressive action scenes. And, to tell the truth. I quite enjoyed it. It sure was better than the Matrix Revolutions. It strikes me as peculiar, though, that with so many great sci-fi novels lying around just waiting to be adapted, this movie ever needed to be made. The plot of Equilibrium is so incredibly trite and predictable, I can practically spot which novel each aspect of it was taken from. Most of all it owes incredible amounts to 1984, while the fight scenes are inspired directly by The Matrix. The plot twists are predictable, and the ending immensely disappointing. There were more than a few 1984 rip-offs made before; check out Terry Gilliam's Brazil for one that managed to stay fresh and original. Equilibrium, on the other hand, makes no new statement and thus fails to justify its existence.<p>A few words of praise, though, should go to the lead actors. Christian Bale is great in the main part, but I was more impressed with supporting actors Emily Watson and Sean Bean - Sean delivered a short performance, but nevertheless it was the best part of the movie. It can be safely said the story becomes more boring and more predictable as the story goes on, the deterioration beginning with the death of Bean's character, and hitting rock bottom with that of Watson's. The ending in particular is rushed, unconvincing and unimpressive. Matthew Harbour as Bale's son is especially wasted, as are all the lead villain characters. The final showdown is far too short and the happy ending too strained; it almost seems as if the last twenty minutes were glued on, like the fabricated happy ending Brazil got in its US version. Still, good acting, good photography, good pace (for the first hour and a half) and terrific fighting choreography make Equilibrium a nice watch. If you're a fan of the genre it's worth renting, but don't expect too much of it.</p></body></html>

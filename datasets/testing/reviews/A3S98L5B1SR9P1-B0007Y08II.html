<meta name="summary" content="Team America"></head><body><p>If you haven't been keeping up on current world issues or have lived under a rock for the last 10 years, this movie is not for you. If you thought of bringing your kids along, because it has puppets, don't. If you have an open mind, and are not offended by crude humor, puppet sexuality and violence, and severe stereotypes, this movie is brilliant.<br /><br />If you are a fan of South Park you will feel right at home. This movie delivers the same one liners you come to expect in an episode of South Park. The movie pulls no punches and takes jabs at celebrities big and small.<br /><br />The music deserves its own review. The music in this movie made me laugh harder than I ever have before in my life. Seriously. The Team America theme song is pure genius.<br /><br />If you are sensitive about the current situation with terrorism and the way we tend to handle it with our current situation, this movie may not be up your alley. If you can see the humor in all of it and feel like a good laugh, run, swim, fly, do whatever possible to go see this movie.</p></body></html>

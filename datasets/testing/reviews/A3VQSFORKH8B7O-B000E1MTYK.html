<meta name="summary" content="A DARKER AND SADDER "POTTER!""></head><body><p>My biggest complaint about the first three "Harry Potter" movies is that the films (along with the books) have been kinda dark and edgy for the kids who've been reading them. With this film, the fourth entry in the "Potter" film franchise, that doesn't change, even though the MPAA has finally given a PG-13 rating to one of the films (Which they should've been doing since the first one).<br /><br />The film itself is actually pretty good. The cast and crew do a commendable job of transferring a 700+ page book into a two-and-a-half hour film. The acting is good, including a sinister turn by Ralph Fiennes as the resurrected Lord Voltemort that even had me terrified. The visual effects are top notch, and the storytelling is good for the most part. But the film's darker edge, as well as a few moments of sheer tragedy, make it unsuitable for younger viewers, even those who are ardent "Potter" fans. But there's some good to be found here, so I recommend the film for those older fans.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Waitress is the alternative romantic comedy"></head><body><p>The success of this film comes from the great acting, strong characters, and small scale of the plot.  Briefly, the film details a series of small-town happenings surrounding the waitresses of a pie shop, with a particular close-up on a newly pregnant waitress, Jenna (played by Keri Russell).  The people who surround her at first come off as Deep South cartoons, but the audience comes to sympathize with them fairly quickly, and that sympathy is sustained throughout the picture.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with Andy Griffith's gruff comic performance as Old Joe.  As I was watching the film, I wondered why he hadn't made different career choices.  He has the same wisdom of character as Henry Fonda, yet Griffith has too often played country-fried characters.  Certainly, Old Joe is deep-fried, but he knows it and is reflective.  He knows that he has made poor decisions, and he knows how he could have lived differently.<br /><br />Jeremy Sisto's portrayal of Earl, Jenna's husband, is reminiscent of his work on Six Feet Under.  Sisto has perfected the neurotic, desperate, man-boy performance.  As on Six Feet Under, he is exhausting to watch for a long time, because he demands so much attention, much like a child.  I credit Sisto for making the audience sympathize (if only briefly) with Earl's ignorance of what it means to be a man and a husband.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion's performance of Dr. Pomatter is similar to Sisto's Earl.  They are both weird, bad husbands and confused men.  While Earl seems dangerous, Dr. Pomatter comes off as sweet.  The proximity of sweetness and jealousy is rather eerie, now that I think about it.<br /><br />Keri Russell is the film's protagonist, the great pie-making waitress.  She is the mold that girls-next-door are made from.  She's poor, pregnant, has a new doctor, the same manic husband, and all she wants to do is escape all of them.  The film is her story, her adventure.  She moves through a weird world as gracefully as she can.<br /><br />It might be worth pointing out the morality of this film, what Old Joe calls "indiscretions."  I think the movie is more amoral than it is moral or immoral.  The point of the plot isn't to expose a woman who strays from the path only to find her way to righteousness, nor is the film about taking joy in infidelity and disloyalty.  All of those things are thrown up in the air and allowed to settle where they may, with Jenna standing before them, offering us a good old fashioned pie and a different twist to a familiar tale.</p></body></html>

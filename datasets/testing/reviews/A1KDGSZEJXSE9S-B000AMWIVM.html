<meta name="summary" content="Just taken from other movies"></head><body><p>It's become very clear that hollywood has ran into a monster<br /><br />creative wall. This movie is just trying to take advange of<br /><br />another little "horror" era that probably started with The<br /><br />Ring a few years ago. This is a rather predictable movie as<br /><br />even my moronic brother in law seen who the "killer" was just<br /><br />shortly after he appeared in the film.<br /><br />The main focus on the movie is two guys with one being a<br /><br />doctor and the other guy gets paid to snoop and take<br /><br />pictures of other peoples business. The movie for the most<br /><br />part goes for shock value. Not that I mind, but it's just<br /><br />that the movie isn't as deep/dark and scary as it wants to<br /><br />be. There are a few original ideas like "the head vice" but<br /><br />for the most part the movie just takes bits and pieces from<br /><br />other movies of the genre and puts them together.<br /><br />I'd have to say the acting is the worst. Cary Elwes is just<br /><br />an aweful actor in this film. How could the director  allow<br /><br />such pathetic work? Did Cary just come THAT cheap? Even<br /><br />Danny Glover was bad in this one! It is sad because even<br /><br />though it steals from other movies it could have been alot<br /><br />better. The acting and bits in pieces seem abit to rushed.<br /><br />And we can't forget the car scene. What's up with that?<br /><br />As somebody said, why not just have a few cut scenes? It's<br /><br />much easier and less annoying.<br /><br />However, even with the bad acting and unoriginal ideas<br /><br />even a poor mans Se7en is better than alot of movies in<br /><br />this genre nowdays. You would probably be better off to<br /><br />wait until this comes in HBO though. It simply isn't<br /><br />worth the money. It will will help out a spoof movie in<br /><br />the future though.</p></body></html>

The appeal toward the original Die Hard was that it did seem more real than your typical action flick but at this point in the series, a third sequel has no business being anything other than a $100 million quasi-self-parody. The film doesn't hide this and it really struggles to pull off even a partially real moment. However, holding it up to serious movies is not giving Live Free or Die Hard a fair shake, but then again its intentions do weigh in on my less then perfect rating.<br /><br />As a pure action movie and nothing more, Live Free or Die Hard is nearly perfect. My only complaint is it tried a little too hard to convince me on the computer hacking technology. Given the scene where Bruce Willis surfs on top of an F-35 Lightning II, it didn't need to dig too deeply into the technology jargon or convince me what was happening was real in any way. Too much time was spent on that stuff. I knew after about two minutes into the movie exactly what I wanted out of it; and that was some kung-fu, shooting, crashing cars and explosions. I just so happen to get some Jet surfing, collapsing bridges, elevators falling and utter urban chaos to spice things up even further.<br /><br />Anyway, the federal government is in big trouble as the FBI systems are breached by computer hackers who are basically contracted to do this from a terrorist group lead by a former federal big wig out for revenge after some political embarrassment (Timothy Olyphant in a very effective villain performance). The hackers are not really going to get paid though as they are systematically assassinated by these terrorists one by one after they've served their purposes. Enter Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is told by a superior to pick up a hacker suspect (Justin Long). Great action scene as John rescues this guy from his assassination. John has to get this hacker to DC for questioning. Meanwhile, the traffic systems are collapsing and the stock market crashes. What is happening is an all out systems attack on vital networks of the government and the economy. Records are destroyed, transportation is ruined, utilities like water and gas are being manipulated, the media is taken over and fear propaganda is spread etc. You get the picture; the country is being driven into anarchy. That really just sets the stage. As things unfold the action just gets more and more exciting and ridiculous.<br /><br />I guess it is easier to do a pure action like this when we are already sold on the hero. If you've seen the prior films then character development for you is just not a necessity, at least for the protagonist. But Live Free or Die Hard does effectively present new characters for the most part. Maggie Q as a little kung-fu using sidekick and love interest to Olyphant's primary villain character is great, but on the other hand Mary Elizabeth Winstead is kind of annoying as Lucy McClane, John's teenage daughter. It is hit more than miss as far as that goes but that really shouldn't be the lens in which you approach a film like this anyway. Just sit back and enjoy. If you find yourself laughing and throwing up your arms at the level to which Live Free or Die Hard expects you to suspend disbelief, you are certainly not alone.</p></body></html>

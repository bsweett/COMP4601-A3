It is even harder when production delays and on-set tragedies push the release of that sequel from two years to four years after the original.  Faced with the pressure of expectations that are only exceeded by those that the "Star Wars" prequels endured, "The Matrix: Reloaded" more or less is successful in continuing the momentum of its predecessor.  While the awe of discovery and imagination is not present here (and couldn't be after the first movie), "Reloaded" still manages to pack eye-popping actions scenes with mind-bending philosophy, without getting too hampered by the incompleteness that plagues most `middle' films.<br /><br />"The Matrix: Reloaded" takes place at an unspecified time after the events of the first movie.  Emboldened by Neo's (Keanu Reaves) victory against the agents in the first film, the first of any kind for the humans against the machines, the emancipated humans have been stepping up there actions against the machines, freeing more enslaved humans and creating a definite perceived threat to the existence of the machines.  Striking from the home base of Zion, near the center of the Earth, the humans have faith, thanks to Neo's presence and exploits, that the war is theirs to win.  Of course, the machines, sensing that they must make a final strike to eradicate the human threat, have sent a huge arsenal of sentinels boring towards Zion with the single missions of extermination.  Will Neo be able to save humanity from this threat?  That question will not answered here (it is saved for the third part of the trilogy, "The Matrix: Revolutions"), but the actions that will set in motion that climax are presented in "Reloaded" and are quite compelling.<br /><br />In "The Matrix: Reloaded", almost all of the characters who survived the first movie have returned.  Neo, of course, is back, as well as his lover, Trinity, along with Morpheus.  The absence of Tank (who did survive the original), however, is both jarring and barely explained.  As the Matrix was introduced to audiences in the first film, so is the city of Zion and its inhabitants introduced to all in this film.  There are many new characters added to the mix, which are too numerous to list here.  Some of the new characters are very entertaining, although almost none of them qualify as `good guys'.  The two twins who do battle with Neo in the Matrix provide some skilled martial arts action.  The always-gorgeous Monica Bellucci glows in an all-too-short cameo as Persephone.  The true enigmatic addition is that of the double-talking Frenchman, Merovingian.  It's not quite clear what he is or where his loyalties, but his rapid fire verbiage dripping with a thick French accent is both maddening and amusing.  It should be noted that even Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) returns, although somewhat `changed'.<br /><br />Much like the original film, "The Matrix: Reloaded" excels when it comes to action sequences.  An early where Neo battles more than 100 Agent Smiths provides a visual martial arts treat for the audience.  A later battle, which takes place at high speeds on a crowded highway, is one of the most suspenseful, white-knuckle action scenes to hit the screen in years.  Watching Morpheus leap from vehicle to vehicle while battling agents (and those twins) in an attempt to protect a vital entity known as the `keymaker' keeps the audience on the edge of its collective seat for the duration.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some negative aspects to this film, too.  Aside from the incomplete feeling, of which it is merely the victim of the `middle film syndrome', "Reloaded" doesn't blend the action and philosophy in nearly as seamless a manner as the original.  While amusing, the discussions between the heroes and Merovingian, are confounding and, when examined more closely, reveal nothing.  The same can be said of a later encounter between Neo and a man called `The Architect' (whose purpose will not be revealed here).  The Architect's clipped, harsh delivery and double-talk is particularly aggravating.  The human scenes also don't resonate quite the same way the did in the original.  There is one particular scene where Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is giving what is supposed to be a rousing speech to the masses gathered on a night to celebrate their recent successes.  The speech is so grandiose and so over the top that the message Morpheus is trying to convey is lost in the posturing.<br /><br />Fans of the original "Matrix" will come out of this film without the same sense of wonder that accompanied the first film.  Perhaps, they will even have a sense of disappointment due to some of the factors mentioned above.  However, "The Matrix: Reloaded" still strongly holds its own as a worthy sequel to "The Matrix".  The table has been set and the pressure is on for "The Matrix: Revolutions" to satisfactorily conclude this saga.</p></body></html>

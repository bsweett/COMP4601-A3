Night is the master of mood - think of Signs, and the incredible use of music, camera angles, etc. to create an impending sense of doom.  Or the same in The Village when the red robed human/monsters are coming.  He's typically absolutely brilliant in doing this.  And he does it very well in this movie as well, but its with absolutely no follow through.  In Signs, you get the sense of doom, then something significant happens - i.e., you see an alien leg disappear into corn...not so here.  The doom sense comes, then people just whammo die.  blah blah blah.  This is garbage, and, sadly, his movies have become progressively worse on each release.  He used to be a no questions asked opening weekend must see; now I might not even consider renting his future works.</p></body></html>

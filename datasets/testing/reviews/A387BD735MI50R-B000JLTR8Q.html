However, it is that bad - and worse. I'm not sure how Shyamalan could have come up with such a soggy mess.<br /><br />In his DVD commentary, he tells us that the plot was taken from a fairytale that his children enjoyed hearing him tell over and over. Either something got lost in the translation to a screenplay, or else Shyamalan's children have very strange taste in fairytales. Because really, there is no tale here at all - except maybe a fish tail. It's a hodgepodge of mismatched elements.<br /><br />The Queen of the Sea pops up out of a swimming pool - languishes in a faint in Paul Giamatti's apartment - while some great clawed beasts lurk on land acting as (what is it?) sentries or predators - and some great clawed birds in the air wait to carry the Queen back to the Sea. All these clumps of plotline snarl together like matted seaweed. There's only one elderly Asian woman in the apartment complex who knows the whole truth of this Oriental myth, and she metes out incoherent pieces of it to Giamatti when she feels in the mood.<br /><br />Even the setting of this movie is vexing. The courtyard apartment building where Giamatti works as manager/maintenance man is an uneasy combination of the stage set for "Rear Window" and an open-back doll's house.<br /><br />The only thing that was done right here was to cast Bryce Howard as the sea maiden. She has the requisite watery look. But having a look isn't enough to carry the picture. Believe the critics and deep six this one.</p></body></html>

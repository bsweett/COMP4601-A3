<meta name="summary" content="Alexander The Gay!"></head><body><p>It was making me nauseous, seeing so many men with eye makeup on!  These guys were probably wearing pink thongs under their mini skirts too!  I love this type of movie, but I just found this one to be uninteresting.  Even most of the battle scenes weren't that great.  (Three hours) of a movie that's not that good, is definitely way too long!  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's extremely far from great!  Whoever decided to use Colin Farrell to play Alexander, should be shot!  He looks ridiculous with blond hair too.  See Gladiator or Troy instead, they're great!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="2-disc BD review only..."></head><body><p>A fun film that has entertained both my family and customers of all ages passing through my store. The Disney BD did not disappoint on quality and value for the price, albeit several features are worth skipping.<br /><br />The picture quality is as expected - virtually flawless and very colorful. The 7.1 DTS is great, though most of the outer channel usage was with Maximus and the dam breaking, still worthwhile to have the extra two speakers going though. The supplements are a mixed bag and include:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes, 3 @ 12:36 minutes. Directors intro for each, all still in the sketch mode. Nothing worth watching unless you like the rough draft edits.<br />* Original Storybook Openings, 2 versions @ 8 minutes. Both with intros, and both providing only a couple tidbits of additional details.<br />* 50th Feature Countdown, 2 minutes. Way too fast as they show a brief clip from each film accompanied by a number but no titles. Even pausing each one for customers to guess was not enough - too quick and not enough info.<br />* Extended Song Sequences, 2 @ 7:48 minutes. The "Life Begin" and "Mother Knows Best" songs, mixed in with sketch and CGI animation to show the extensions, glad they were cut down.<br />* Untangled, making of, 12:27 minutes. Hosted by Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. Shows some decent background on the production process mixed in with trivia and lots of cheese by those two as they try to provide some painful laughs. Not sure what the target audience was as I liked some of the information (that might bore kids) but their comedy attempts were horrible.<br />* Tangled Teasers, 9 totaling 10 minutes. Each is an animated minute of almost South Park-themed skits. One was an obvious take on a certain prescription medication that helps men. Wish I could say why these were even included...kids will miss some of the humor.<br />* The Disney 3D intro with the Lion King critters - old.<br />* The Disney intro to Digital Copy.<br />* Info: The pointless paragraph about commentaries.<br />* Disc 2 is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G600A4">Tangled</a> DVD.<br /><br />French and Spanish soundtracks with English 2.0 Descriptive Service and subs in same. I enjoyed the movie and BD quality, but the extras are almost bizarre in both production and/or why they were included. Still have to give it a 5-star review for overall worth with the DVD and Solid BD specs. Region coded A/B/C.<br /><br />EDIT: Forgot to mention that the opening of the BD has a VERY small menu along the bottom that you have only a few seconds to select that allows you to bypass the hideous amounts of Disney material/trailers/promos. It goes by fast but it is sooooo worth it - I was giving this a 5-star before even seeing the rest just for that. The catch is you have to scroll through several options to get to PLAY MOVIE and it goes to the trailers if you have not hit enter before it transitions.</p></body></html>

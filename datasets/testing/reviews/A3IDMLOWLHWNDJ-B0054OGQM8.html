<meta name="summary" content="Its About Time..."></head><body><p>The third most requested DVD title, the "Back To The Future" trilogy, finally made its DVD debut in the fall of 2002 (for the curious, "Indiana Jones" was number two & the original "Star Wars" trilogy was number one).<br /><br />I give the "Back To The Future" trilogy an overall rating of four stars (I reviewed each film seperately. check my reviews for more details) & its great to finally have them in the DVD collection, but, the DVD set is technically a mixed bag.<br /><br />When "Universal" first starting releasing their films in the DVD format, their home video division had originally slated "Back To The Future" as their first big DVD title release, dating all the way back to 1998, but, kept holding back the release date for unspecified reasons.<br /><br />The "Back To The Future" trilogy set is a decent release, with all three films "remastered" (I use the term loosely) with DVD special features on each disc for each film, including deleted scenes, documetaries on the making of each film, & trailers w/ applicable music videos (The Power Of Love & Doubleback). The audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital w/ optional commentary from writer Bob Gale.<br /><br />What makes owning the set is the special features. Bob Gale lends a lot of insight into the making of all three films from the outline stage all the way to how he is still amazed at the popularity of the films after all these years. The deleted scenes & outakes are what fans have been screaming for and are all here in the set (although there is no raw footage of Eric Stoltz from the original "Back To The Future").<br /><br />Since its from "Universal" the set is marred with a few setbacks (I don't consider the films to be remastered at all & should be THX certified in future releases. I doubt that will happen).<br /><br />One setback is there is some considerable grain & dirt in the first film. The other problem is the audio to the original "Back To The Future". The other two films are fine, but, with the first film, I found some audio noise in certain scenes. A great example is the scene near the end of the film when Marty wakes up, just back from the past, & heads into the living room to see his brother & sister sitting at the dinner table eating breakfast. I have a 700 hundred watt Yamaha Dolby Digital reciever & I could hear the background hiss so much that it was too noticable & distracting (it seems that all films that are pre-Dolby Digital era have this noise, to a certain extent). I thought it might be the disc itself, but, it was actually the film.<br /><br />The other problem is with the second & third films. This has to do with the notorious discovery that these films were pressed on DVD with the films presented slightly out of frame. This is piss poor studio production at its finest and continues with "Universal" to this day (another example is the new "Jaws" DVD release). I'm not to sure if the studio is still swapping the defective discs for the correct ones, but, you should inquire with the studio before any attempt is made. With "Universal" replacing the old defective sets with new ones its pretty much a crap shoot on which version you'll wind up with. Its been said you can tell the difference if you look on the barcode on the package back. It should say "V2" underneath the barcode. Don't hold your breath, though. I have still yet to see the corrected versions.<br /><br />The "Back To The Future" saga is the best time-travel trilogy in modernday film, sadly the way this DVD release has been handled "Universal" doesn't think so. With this set currently discontinued, I hope "Universal" will get the kinks out of "Future's" future releases. Only time will tell.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AWESOME & INSPIRING."></head><body><p>recently watched this filmed again- it has likely been at least 25 years since the last viewing (I was young then, not so young now).<br /><br />What I really like was the "tone" of the film.  What I mean is the emotional depth that the audience has in connecting with the characters.  For that, credit goes to director Richard Donner.  The film is mostly a drama, with light comedic touches.  It has a real nostalgic feel to it.<br /><br />brief plot:  Superman loses his parents in a far distant apocolyptic world, more advanced than Earth.  Thanks to a recording device imbedded in his satellite, Superman learns about his origin and his future purpose.  Once on Earth as he grows physically, he faces alienation as he tries to cope with "fitting in" with his peers- all the while harboring the secrets of his super powers.<br /><br />By becoming his super alter-ego, he can use his powers for good, and feel validated in ways that his Clark Kent persona cannot.  Thus, psychologically, Superman provides Clark Kent with ego balance, making him a whole and complete person.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of the film is the casting.  We've got Marlon Brando (Oscar winner), Gene Hackman (Oscar winner), then new-comer Christopher Reeve, and Margot Kidder as the main players.  The casting was just perfect.  I can't imagine Superman being anyone else than Chris Reeve.  I can't imagine Lex Luthor being anyone else than Gene Hackman, and I can't imagine Lois Lane being anyone else than Margot Kidder.<br /><br />The other great piece of the film is the script.  Intelligent, inspiring, touching, adventurous, and most of all, believable.  Everyone has some "good lines" in this film, memorable lines, which to me is a sign of a good script.<br /><br />*highly recommended*</p></body></html>

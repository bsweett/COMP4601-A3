That being said, I equally appreciate John Carpenters remake of The Thing. Carpenter has since lost his touch, but we can all dig into the past and see his brilliance especially in this film. With Special effects galore, free from CGI gremlins, and a perfect cast, free from feminine distraction, we get an honest to goodness monster/alien movie that still resonates to this day as creepy, disgusting at times, and brilliant. It's great to see Wilford Brimley sans mustache and not beating "diabetes" into our brains, and Kurt Russell with his piercing eyes and sweet beard giving one of the best performances of their careers in my opinion. The plot is straightforward, fast moving, and it doesn't presume its audience is a bunch of dummies. We have no romance, no women at the outpost, we don't have any long stupid speeches about humanity, we don't have some alien spouting domination plans, and we don't have the same old "hunter and hunted" script that most horror movies fall into. It's all over the place, paranoia, conspiracy, anger, suspicion, and horror. The special effects are bloody, visceral, oozing, your eyes deceive you then you want to cringe. These are the creatures that make you afraid of the dark, that whisper into your ear to never go into the dark alone, and the thought of becoming one of them is unfathomable. The sounds, the sights, the "man-fest" is worth watching over and over again, especially if you were like me and watched through your fingers.</p></body></html>

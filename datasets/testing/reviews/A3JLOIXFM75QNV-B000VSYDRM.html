It had an interesting premise and I love Alan Rickman so I really wanted to see this. I had read that some people really dug it and some couldn't stand it. Well, now I know why. It gets very bizaar at the end where I sort of looked at my husband and we had equal looks of 'what the heck is going on here'. It was all just very odd in a disturbing and ridiculous way. I think that ruined the film for me. I mean, it had a few things going for it, but then what happens hits you like a ton a bricks and it all feels like a wasted effort.</p></body></html>

The filming locations in China were breathtaking providing for intense visual eye candy.  The panoramic cinematography was exquisite.  The beautifully crafted story was woven around masterfully choreographed martial arts and sword fighting sequences.<br /><br />Jet Li playing the character Nameless, is an unquestioned nonpareil of martial arts skills.  He is the hero named in the movie title.  Before the creation of what we now know as China, the land was a conglomeration of 7 warring provinces.  The most powerful of which was called Qin.  The king of Qin possessed a vision of the unification of these provinces.  Of course this dream was not shared by all.<br /><br />Li, born in the rival province of Zhao, was orphaned and adopted into a family in Qin.  Ten years of rigorous training honed him into the finest swordsman in all of the Qin province.  He had vanquished three of the most deadly assassins who had been plaguing the king of Qin, in order to gain his confidence.  His ultimate aspiration was to assassinate the king himself.  The three assassins known as Sky, Broken Sword and Snow, also martial arts experts helped structure Li's resolve to attain his goal.<br /><br />This Quentin Tarantino sponsored martial arts masterpiece, expertly directed by Yimou Zhang, was both a powerful and sensually appealing cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

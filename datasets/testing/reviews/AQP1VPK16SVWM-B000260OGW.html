<meta name="summary" content="Strong contemporary western from Costner"></head><body><p>Stories of redemption and revenge have always been at the core of westerns. Kevin Costner's Open Range recalls both Dances with Wolves with its languid pacing and intensive eye for the fine detail living in the 19th century. The well drawn characters and performances that seem as if they could have been drawn from the frontier give life to Costner's film. Open Range's subject matter was drawn from a conflict in real life; free range cattle were driven from land that wasn't owned by anybody by cattle barons intend on controlling their market and everything that surrounded them. Costner's elegiac western touches all the right buttons to make it a classic American western. If it fails to meet the expectations of the genre's best, perhaps its because the genre seems at a creative dead end much as it was before Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood helped reinvent the genre. Costner's own Dances with Wolves went a long way to try and reinvent the Western in the mythic style of John Ford and with Open Range he is at least partially successful.<p>Charlie (Costner), Boss (Robert Duvall), Mose(Abraham Benrubi from E.R.) and Button (Diego Luna)  are driving their cattle across the country to market. Even though Charlie and Boss have been riding together 10 years, they know next to nothing about each other's past; There's a darkness that haunts Charlie and Boss that they've never spoken of to each other. Their ghosts will soon rear their ugly heads. They've chosen a life without any roots and, as such, they literally have become their own family. Their cattle survive by eating in the open ranges across the west. Unfortunately, open ranges are disappearing as if there's a fire sale going on as rancher's fence up the surrounding countryside even when it doesn't belong to them. <p>When Mose is attacked and injured in a fight with goons working for a nasty cattle baron named Baxter (Michael Gabon in a significantly oily and evil performance), Charlie and Boss must get him out of jail. When they have his injuries attended to by the local doctor, Charlie meets the down-to-earth Sue (Annette Benning). There's an instant attraction between them. He keeps his distance believing her to be married to the doctor. When Baxter's men attack their wagon and killing and injuring their friends, the two men return to the town seeking justice and revenge.<p>Beautifully shot by cinematographer James Muro and well written by Craig Storper there are elements of Open Range that recall Unforgiven; that's no surprise as Costner had tried to purchase, star and direct that film before Clint Eastwood made off with it. There elements no doubt attracted Costner to the project but there's also a feeling of hopefulness that's missing from the much darker and brooding Unforgiven. Open Range isn't a perfect western but it is a very good attention to the genre. At 139 minutes the film is a tad too long but clearly Costner attempt to capture the lifestyle of the free range cowboy was very important to him. These details make the film and performances more believable. <p>The picture quality is outstanding. The sound mix sounded a tad flat and was difficult to hear in stereo but was just fine in 5.1 DTS. The extras include audio commentary by Kevin Costner (disc one) and a handful of very good featurettes on disc two including &quot;America's Open Range&quot; a look at the history of the real open range with Costner providing narration, &quot;Beyond Open Range&quot; a fascinating glimpse at the creative decisions Costner had to make to produce the film, deleted scenes with optional commentary and storyboard sequences. There's also a nicely put together Music Video Montage featuring the late Michael Kamen's beautifully evocative score.</p></body></html>

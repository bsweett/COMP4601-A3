It is a masterpiece that continues to motivate heated discussion on its many themes, specifically its inferred representation of male dominance, mysogyny and obsession.<p>Freudian notions run rampant in ~Vertigo~: the woman as sexual object and the eternal 'dark continent' that Freud himself, because he couldn't make fit in his theories, abandoned - the female psyche that is...however, these critical interpretations have turned a bit stale over the years. But this is a very complex film, and the fact that it can be interpreted on many levels, studied and analysed endlessly by professionals and academics in various fields, really is a testimony that ~Vertigo~ is in a class by itself.<p>The popular interpretation of the film posits the central protagonist, Scotty, (Jimmy Stewart) as an obsessed misogynist, a pathological stalker, chasing the object of his sexual desire through the streets of San Francisco. He loses the object, Madeline, (Kim Novak) because of her apparent suicide. The poor man then slides into a deep melancholia, (the character doesn't speak for a year) to surface again to discover Madeline's doppelganger on the city street. It is at this point in the film that the reader's sympathies begin the shift. Scotty doesn't act like a victim anymore, and intentionally manipulates the 'new' sexual object into the image of the old one. He goes to extremes - down to what she can wear and her hair color. There is no denying it - the character becomes an oppressive chauvinist, and when his wish for the perfect image of his desire does not eventuate, he inadvertently destroys the object, casting her over the edge of the tower to her death: man as oppressor, woman as victim.<p>After watching the film again, a new thought came to mind: it is possible that the male protagonist is the true victim of manipulation throughout, led by the woman, unconsciously, into the murky world of obsession. When the protagonist discovers that his love and the object of his love has all been a sham, a product of clever manipulation, he simply feels betrayed and retaliates. Scotty is the true victim in the relationship, not the woman. Because of guilt for betraying the man she loves, Madeline destroys herself, which can be seen in the last scene. Perhaps.<p>It is well known that Hitchcock was a autocratic director, instructing his actors, male and female, to move and speak exactly to his specifications, giving the actors no creative room at all. This interestingly manifests in ~Vertigo~ in a variety of ways, symbolically and otherwise.<p>The million dollars spent by Universal to restore this incredible film was well worth the money: Hitchcock's creative and dynamic use of color can now be viewed in its original glory. This is the type of film that will never get old or become cheesy over time. ~Vertigo~ continues to maintain its depth, originality and beauty. And will undoubtedly continue to do so in another fifty years.</p></body></html>

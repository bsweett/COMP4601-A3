<meta name="summary" content="Where's Stephanie Zimbalist When You Need Her...?"></head><body><p>...Halle Berry fans are gonna hate me for saying this, but this movie was like "Halle Berry has a cameo in a James Bond film? Ke-ull!" Period. Yeah, she looked great. But what James bond movie doesn't hame good looking ladies in it I askya?<p>And to her credit, she kicked a lil butt, too.  <p>But like many of today's action films the emphasis is on *action* not chemistry between the majors, not character development. The banter between Halle and Brosnan was too corny for even James Bond standards. And the chemistry? They had as much chemistry with each other as two lovers the morning after a one night stand and the daylight is showing a bit more than needed. (Hey, wait a minute. Lemme rethink this analogy.) (Forget it.) Anyhoo, we know she can do the witty repartee thing 'cause we saw it in Boomerang and later on in The Flintstones. And Pierce? Banter was his middle name on the television series Remington Steele. We want to see that Je ne sais Qua between our majors. What happened here?<p>Well, for one thing, there was over sixty minutes of non-stop action...groovy ice capades, fun and games in Korea, clowning and cloning and makeovers in Cuba and sparring with two ladies called M. <p>Plus, I daresay Pierce would prefer to be seen nowadays as a Serious Auct-torah as he moves into the Sean Connery graduation stage of his career. Maybe next he'll do a remake of Zardoz, who knows?<p>But for non-stop fun where the hero kills all the bad guys, destroys the massive headquarters of the villians, again saves the world form certain annihilation and then has time to bury the female lead with loads of jewels in a love nest, you cannot beat this...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A John Hughes Masterpiece..."></head><body><p>On a Saturday morning somewhere in America, five high school students report for detention in a school library. The group includes a jock, a geek, a freak, a princess, and a metalhead loser, with seemingly nothing in common other than the opportunity to be bullied by a hard-nosed assistant principal.<br /><br />In John Hughes' 1985 classic "The Breakfast Club", actors Emilio Estevez (the jock), Anthony Michael Hall (the geek), Ally Sheedy (the freak), Molly Ringwald (the princess), and Judd Nelson (the metalhead loser) will participate in an eight-hour ad hoc encounter session, discover a great deal about themselves and each other, and come out a little older and wiser.  Although the way, the audience will be treated to some well-done moments of comedy, drama, and honest teenage angst.<br /><br />Hughes keeps his young and talented cast busy and his dialogue real while respecting his on-screen characters.  They may be stereotypes, but they tap a vein for practically anyone who endured high school in the late 20th century.  The movie features an exceptional soundtrack.  "The Breakfast Club" is very highly recommended to John Hughes fans of any age.</p></body></html>

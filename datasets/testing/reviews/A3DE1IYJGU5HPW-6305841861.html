<meta name="summary" content="Limited Edition is of limited appeal"></head><body><p>This review refers to the Limited Edition, the version that comes in the overlarge collector's tin that is too big to fit in any normal DVD case.<p>Anyone considering purchasing the LE ought to know what they are getting into.<p>Evil Dead 2: DBD is a wonderful send-up of the slasher/moster horror genre.  The film's virtues could take up all 1000 words of the review, so suffice to say that Raimi and Campbell made a wonderful piece of work here, especially considering how it was shot and the budget on which it was created.<p>Now, for the dirt on the LE DVD.<p>The metal tin, although cool, is huge.  About three inches taller than a normal DVD case, and about two inches thick, it won't fit in a holder, and will look really out of place next to your other discs.  The cover art is awesome (it was used for the British version of the movie poster, which is re-created on a mini-poster inside, a &quot;poster&quot; roughly the size of a postcard).  The movie and sound transfers are not great, but considering what they had to work with, I think they did the best they could.  The final complaint about the packaging is that the disc itself is in a cheap jewel-case you place in a little niche in the tin.  Sorry, but they could have found a more aesthetically pleasing way to package such an expensive disc.<p>The &quot;Gore the Merrier&quot; feature will appeal mainly to fans interested in how the many creature and blood effects were made.  It runs about a half-hour, and is educational, but more of a &quot;sneak-preview showcase&quot; of making monsters than an actual &quot;how-to class.&quot;<p>The video game preview is a joke; it doesn't show anything you can't download off the web anyway, and the quality is so bad, you feel the urge to squint because it is so fuzzy at times.  Thankfully, game previews usually look nothing like the final products, so there is some hope for this (groovy-looking) Alone-In-The-Dark, Resident Evil clone.<p>The gem of this DVD is the commentary track.  Raimi and Campbell have never disappointed in their commentary on other discs, and they follow up nicely here as well.  I wonder why there wasn't two tracks, as there was on the Army of Darkness LE and the Evil Dead Special Edition, but I'm not going to complain too loudly, as the commentary here is almost worth what they are charging for this disc. (Everything's alright now!)<p>All in all, casual fans might want to stick with the regular edition.  The Limited Edition is pretty much only for collectors.  If you want a copy of this DVD, though, better act quickly, because once they are gone, the price-gougers on eBay will start their work.</p></body></html>

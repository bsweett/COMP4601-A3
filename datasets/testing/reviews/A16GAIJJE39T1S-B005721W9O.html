<meta name="summary" content="Blast first, realize that you've enraged a galactic terror later!"></head><body><p>Galaxy Quest provides a look into the Star Trek TV and movie and genre that is both amusing and illuminating.  To think of the hapless aliens who mistake the televised adventures of the crew of U.S.S. Protector for actual deeds still makes me smile!  Tim Allen gives an inspired performance as the shoot-from-the-hip Kirk-like commander who mistakes the enemy they must face for a character in a fictitious scenario presented by fans of their canceled TV show.  Sigourney Weaver is charming as the sexy but operationally superfluous female officer.  Allen Rickman is hilarious as a British Shakespearian actor chafing under his ridiculous role as the obligatory (and latex-crowned) alien member of the crew.  An amusing minor character is the high school kid sci-fi geek who ultimately provides them with the essential details for their starship needed to triumph over their galactic enemies.  Don't miss the crash landing of their starship at a Sci-Fi convention--or Sigourney Weaver's new, improved, and cleavage-enhancing uniform!</p></body></html>

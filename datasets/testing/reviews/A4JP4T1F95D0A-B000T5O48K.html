<meta name="summary" content="Downer"></head><body><p>This is a pretty dark and disturbing movie.  It is basically one man's descent into paranoid madness and how he brings a woman into his crazy world.  This movie based on a strange stage play often times comes across as a play.  Most of the movie takes place in the woman's hotel room.  The actors are good with the parts.  Harry Connick is very creepy as the sleazy ex-con.  His best bad guy role since Copycat.  I was really hoping for a big twist at the end to make the hour and a half of watching two people go crazy worth the view.  Sadly it didn't happen and I feel a bit cheated.  It is a well made film with good acting, it just left me a bit cold.</p></body></html>

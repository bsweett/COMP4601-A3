<meta name="summary" content="Too much "Gotcha""></head><body><p>This is a movie about revenge.  Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are two magicians who work together.  When one of them loses a loved one during a performance, the other pursues a lifetime of vengeance.  Back and forth it goes, with the only suspense being who is going to get the last word (or revenge) and destroy the other.  This unrelenting process takes up most of the movie and is really overdone in my estimation.  The  movie is dark, (both the theme and the cinematography) and is pretty despresssing.  My husband and I both enjoyed "The Illusionist" much more that this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Grim, cartoonish, and why is Daniel Day-Lewis doing a vocal impression of John Huston?"></head><body><p>I do not regard this as a great film.  Nor do I understand why Daniel Day-Lewis, a fine actor, won the Academy Award for impersonating John Huston's performance diction flawlessly.  But there you go.  People rave about this film and Day-Lewis won the Oscar(tm).  If you look back over the history of these awards you will find a lot of head scratchers that must have made a lot more sense in their time than they do today.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview who is a monster.  In retrospect, the world this character inhabited would have been much better off if he had simply died in the pit we see him working in at the beginning of the movie.  Plainview is a man driven by a soul emptying hatred of everything and everyone which must arise from the same regard for himself.  He is a solitary man whose only appetite is to build his business and make money so, as he later says, he can get away from everything.  We see him make no friends, he has not a single woman in his life (nor are there many female roles in the movie).  He acquires his son when a hand dies in a pit.  Rather than send the kid to relatives, he takes him on as a prop so when he tells farmers and investors that he is a family man with family feelings he has some evidence.<br /><br />How he treats the boy, H. W. he is called, shows how conflicted Daniel is.  He shows genuine delight in teaching the boy his trade and demonstrating his prowess in front of him.  But when the boy is made deaf in an explosion at a well, Daniel sends him off in a very cruel fashion because his value as a prop is diminished.  However, I think it is also because a deaf son can't fully share his world.  It is interesting that they never try to communicate by writing to each other.  Was the boy not taught to read or write?  An indication of this comes when someone claiming to be Daniel's half-brother shows up.  H.W. looks at pictures in the man's diary but holds the book so the writing is upside down and he never looks at it or turns it around to read it.<br /><br />The central conflict in the movie is Daniel's lifelong conflict with Eli Sunday, a religious zealot whose entire ambition centers on building his Church of the Third Revelation.  Daniel came to the Sunday land because Eli's twin brother Paul told him about the easy oil there.  Daniel paid him and then found a way to pay Eli's father, Abel Sunday (significance in the name? The innocent victim?), quail money (as Daniel told H.W.) instead of oil money.  You see, Daniel came to the land with H.W. posing as a man interesting in quail hunting rather than admitting he was looking for oil.  Daniel demonstrates his ability to make bitter enemies needlessly when Eli tries to strong arm his way to bless the new well.  Instead, Daniel introduces Eli's sister and blesses the well himself.  Later, Eli finds a way to humiliate Daniel (to be fair, he uses the same method to humiliate each convert).  At the end of the movie, Daniel returns the insult.<br /><br />But the grimness of the movie and Daniel's inability to allow anyone to exist outside of his own universe of dominance is a horror.  He commits tremendous emotional and/or physical violence against anyone who fails to stay within the bounds he has determined for them in his own warped mind and empty soul.  The problem is that this is a character who is so sick in the soul that he is mostly useless in telling anything but a singular horror story.  Do the writers suppose that all oil men or business men are possessed of this sickness?  I can't believe they would buy into such a childish notion.  Nearly every business person I know enjoys their success, using their work to improve the lives of others, and has great friendships.  Yes, there are exceptions, but not to the cartoonish extremes of Plainview.<br /><br />The film also wears its artiness on its sleeve.  Like a lot of middle-brow movies pretending to be high-brow art, they are clever with some interesting elements that invite a level of thought that the viewer can congratulate himself (or herself) for formulating.  However, the movie is just too ham fisted and unrealistic to be high art.  Since there are long stretches without dialog and the images during those stretches don't really do much, the musical score provides us with strong and loud cues telling us when to be disoriented, anxious, and so forth.  It isn't that the music selected isn't interestingly done, but that it doesn't form a unity and is far too obvious in its intention to be an artistic achievement.  It is more like advertising or melodrama in purpose even if the music itself is drawn from actual musical artworks.  One doesn't congratulate a commercial for using Beethoven by calling it art.<br /><br />Daniel finally gets his riches and builds a huge empty mansion that is more prison than palace.  He has all the trappings of luxury, but no appetite to enjoy them (he uses one main hall and his artifacts for target practice) and no friends to share them with.  When the adult and married H.W. wants to strike out on his own, Daniel responds with hatred, cruelty, and demonstrates how his emptiness of soul creates a world destroying vacuum for everyone unfortunate enough to come in contact with him.  At the end the conflict between Eli and Daniel becomes ridiculously horrible and the movie simply ends rather than show us Daniel either facing the consequences of his brutality or escaping them.<br /><br />For me, this was a grim film that was so unpleasant that I never want to see it again and recommend that you don't even bother with it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></body></html>

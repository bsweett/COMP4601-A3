It's a buddy movie, and I was remotely reminded of "Pulp Fiction", where the language was second nature. Certainly, there's a lot of mindless profanity, but a clever DVD extra shows just how silly it all is. The camaraderie between Farrell and Brendan Gleeson is well established; the ARE an odd couple, but there's a fondness that develops that is special. This is largely the achievement of writer-director Martin McDonagh, keeping creepiness, sad memories, and an unusual sense of humor that prevails throughout. Then there's the later appearance of Ralph Fiennes, the most clueless of mean persons. Without blabbing anything away, they all create an enigmatic trio. I enjoyed Jordan Prentice a lot, a confident actor with some delightfully bitter dialogue; I recall that Peter Dinklage (The Station Agent) was as bitter and suspicious.  Certainly, the little people have been given few chances to shine. He was a real character, and delightful. The only Oscar nomination is for Screenplay, and if you can see beyond the profanity, it's insightful, clever and touching. Indeed, Colin Farrell's best performance. I enjoyed it a lot. And Bruges is, indeed, a character unto itself. Stunning photography as required; another fine DVD extra is a boat trip through the canals. Quite instructive.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Artistic triumph for director Vadim Perelman"></head><body><p>You can read elsewhere on this page about the great acting jobs turned in by Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly.  Both are outstanding here.  I had just seen Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast' so the constrast was stunning.  And Connelly is better here - forced to plumb greater depths - than she was in her Oscar-winning turn in "A Beautiful Mind."  (Why no Oscar nomination here if Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo got them?  Seems an obvious oversight.)<p>The real revelations here are co-star Aghdashloo and director Vadim Perelman.  Aghdashloo was justly rewarded with an Independent Spirit award and that Oscar nod.  Great to see the Academy go a little wider afield in their recognition.  <p>With Aghdashloo and Whale Rider's Keisha Castle-Hughes, it's obvious there's a sea change coming.  Aghdashloo deserves that nomination.  She's the stitching that pulls together each of the film's different threads.  Plus, holding your own in scene after scene with Sir Ben Kingsley is quite a feat.<p>Perelman's personal story is inspiring.  What a trip for this Ukrainian imigrant who was known up until this point as a director of commercials.  He formed a bond with writer Andre Dubus III because he saw that "House" was a bleak, uncompromising story - he made a promise to Dubus not to mess with that tone...no contrived, uplifting ending here.  Far from it.  This is one of the more savage, stunning ends to a film you'll ever see.<p>Perelman's next project is 'The Talisman' (based on a Stephen King story), with Executive Producer Steven Spielberg (due out in 2005).  It's obvious that Perelman's debut effort turned some heads in Hollywood.</p></body></html>

The premise, a man accused of a crime he didn't commit, was used in The 39 Steps, Strangers on a Train, To Catch a Thief and The Wrong Man, to name a few. Eva Marie Saint, not known as a glamour girl, was remade by Hitchcock to mimic Grace Kelly's cool, blonde beauty. Cary Grant's escape in the auction scene recalls Robert Donat's similar scene in The 39 Steps. The climax on Mount Rushmore recalls the fight on The Statue of Liberty in Saboteur. Even Cary Grant is, in a way, a "retread," having appeared in Suspicion, Notorious and To Catch a Thief. As one film critic put it, North By Northwest is a summation of Hitchcock's work.<p>However, to simply dismiss North By Northwest as a retread would be like calling Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band just another Beatles album. EVERYTHING works perfectly in this movie with memorable scene after memorable scene (Grant's drunk driving escape, the murder at the U.N., the cropduster attack, Mount Rushmore, etc., etc., etc.). Robert Burks' terrific photography greatly enhances the actors and the locations. George Tomasini's editing maintains a crisp pace. Bernard Herrmann's score is a standout, even when compared to his large body of great work (that's really saying something considering his great scores for Citizen Kane, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, Psycho and Taxi Driver, among others). And Ernest Lehman's script is one of the wittiest and most entertaining screenplays in film history. Add to that the great locations like New York City, Chicago and Mount Rushmore and you've got the elements of a classic.<p>However, the film's greatest strength lies in its casting and performances, especially by Grant. Grant, Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll, Martin Landau and Jessie Royce Landis form a terrific ensemble. Grant's performance, in particular, is wonderful. Present in almost every scene, Grant is the glue that holds the film together. With a weaker actor in the role, the film would have fallen apart. Like Hitchcock himself, Cary Grant wasn't truly appreciated during his career and was more than the one-dimensional charmer many people took him for. Grant perfectly conveys the situation of a confident Madison Avenue ad man who quickly loses control over his life. He has to express confidence, bewilderment, sadness, panic, lust, betrayal and triumph and does so magnificently. It's a shining moment in Grant's great career.<p>The DVD is terrific, the best feature of which is a great documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. (Among other facts revealed, the original title of the film was "The Man in Lincoln's Nose). It's a fitting presentation for a great film. Along with Vertigo and Psycho, North By Northwest marks the absolute best of Alfred Hitchcock's work. It doesn't get any better than this just about perfect film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Dark Comedy about ... Nuclear War?!?!  Yup!!"></head><body><p>There are few scenes in cinematic history that are more indelibly etched into the publics imagination like the image of Slim Pickens rodeo-riding a nuclear bomb on its way to oblivion.  While this is one of the final scenes in "Dr. Strangelove... Or, How I learned to Stop Worry and Love the Bomb", it showcases that strangely dark comedic tone that immerses the entire movie.  At the time the movie was released (1964, scheduled for late 1963, but postponed because of Kennedy's assassination), panic over the prospect of mutually assured destruction as a result of a nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union overwhelmed the American public.  1962's Cuban Missile Crisis did little to assuage those fears.  That same year, a writer named Peter George wrote a novel called "Red Alert" where the premise was the occurrence of accidental nuclear war.  It was made into a movie called "Fail Safe" that had a very somber tone focusing on the horror of that occurrence.  At the same time, odd-ball director Stanley Kubrick decided to take the premise of "Red Alert" of make his own movie based on it.  However, during the course of scripting it for the screen, Kubrick realized that several of the scenes could be and were actually quite funny.  So, he decided to change the tone from a serious war movie to a black comedy.  The result was a truly landmark film. <p>The audience gets an early hint of its off-beat nature with the first of many 'unique' names.  Deranged General Jack D. Ripper (played with commanding menace by Sterling Hayden) decides to close off Burpelson Air Force Base to the outside world and send commands to his bombers holding at their fail-safe points to proceed to bombing targets in the Soviet Union.  Ripper's rationale is that the Soviets have invaded America in the most gruesome way possible: infiltrating their bodily fluids with fluoride(!!!).  The almost hapless administration of President Merkin Muffley convenes in an underground war room to figure out what went wrong and how to undo it.  The president's main military advisor is General Buck Turgidson; a psychotic old warhorse who thinks this accidental launch is a blessing in a disguise and that America should launch all their weapons on the Russians and destroy them while suffering 'only' 20-30 million casualties, tops(!).  <p>Turgidson's view is what the U.S. may have realized had General Patton had his way at the end of World War II.  It should come as no surprise that the roles of General Turgidson in this movie and General Patton is his biopic 7 years later were both played by actor George C. Scott.  Those who loved "Patton" will see the seeds of the performance beginning to sprout in "Dr. Strangelove..".  <p>President Muffley enlists the services of one Dr. Strangelove, an exiled German scientist, to help figure out how to resolve this predicament (avoiding the attack which will trigger the Russians 'Doomsday' bomb).  Dr. Strangelove worked on the A-Bomb project for the Nazis and seems to have a difficult time controlling the actions of his right hand.<p>There are too many well-realized characters to address each one individually and still do them justice.  The true star is the way in which Kubrick satirizes the nuclear policies of the time and the overall nuclear fears.  Prevalent at the time were the concerns over the 'bomb gap', the difference between the number of bombs the U.S. had versus the number the Russians had.  When the Turgidson and company become aware of the Russian "Doomsday' device, they complain about the 'Doomsday Gap'.  When it becomes obvious that there is no way to stop the iminent nuclear attack, the president and his advisors begin discussing ways to preserve the American way of life through the use of mine shafts for people to live in until it is safe, they argue about avoiding a 'mine shaft gap' with the Russians.  It seems to be Kubrick's intention to illuminate the absurdity of the real-life debates with the extreme concerns in this movie.  He does so expertly.  Of course, there is the one truly memorable line uttered by President Muffley when Turgidson and the Russian ambassador get into a scuffle, "Gentleman! You can't fight here!  This is the War Room!".<p>Beyond the tone of the movie, there are several other unique aspects to "Dr. Strangelove..." that also help elevate to one of the top movies in history.  Legendary British actor Peter Sellers played not one, but three (!), roles in this movie.  He is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF (who tries to talk General Ripper out of his mad plan), President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove.  He was rumored to be slated to play Major T.J. "King" Kong, but he suffered a leg injury and the role was given to Slim Pickens.  It's just as well, because one would find it hard to imagine even an actor as gifted as Sellers performing the southern hick pilot role nearly as well as Pickens did.  It is also notable that this is the very first movie that James Earl Jones appeared in.<p>The final scenes show a series of nuclear explosions, but not in a manner that depicts horror or destruction.  It is almost poetic how the explosions flash in tune with Vera Lynn's light "We'll Meet Again" song.  Deft satirical directing like that is what enables "Dr. Strangelove" to be as popular today as it was almost 40 years ago.</p></body></html>

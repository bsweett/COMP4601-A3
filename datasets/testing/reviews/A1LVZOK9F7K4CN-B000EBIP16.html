<meta name="summary" content="A Good Movie..."></head><body><p>I LIKED this movie, but I didn't love it.  Perhaps that is because the book upon which it is based is so short.  C. S. Lewis got to the point quickly with his story - there was no time for dilly-dally.  Also, he wrote it with a sense of wit by making wry comments on the action in his authorial voice.  As such, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was definitely a children's book - although it can be read and enjoyed by adults.  However, the movie comes out after The Lord of The Rings, and so tries to invoke that feeling.  The result is sort of a mixed bag - stuff for kids mixed with violent battle scenes.  There is also a lot of traveling time, which slows down the action.<br /><br />However, the special effects are done very well.  The sight of realistic talking animals could have destroyed the film, but it manages to pull it off.  Tilda Swinton is attractively evil as the White Which and Aslan is a wonderful mix of CGI and a performance by Liam Neeson.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE:  There has been some harsh criticism of this film as Christian propaganda.  The only way for that argument to be made is to point out that a central character dies, and then is resurrected.  In the first place, that is not enough.  Second, so what?  Just because C. S. Lewis was Catholic, does that make him a bad guy?  Are we not only suppose to suppress religious literature, but EVERYTHING that was ever written by people who believed in God?  Can the book burnings be far behind?</p></body></html>

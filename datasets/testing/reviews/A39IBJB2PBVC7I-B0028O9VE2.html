While it is clearly aimed at the adult, female, box of tissues, slumber party set - I cherish the notion that these individuals are far too smart and with it to be taken in by such twaddle.  With the exception of Adam Sandler, (who couldn't act his age, much less act in a movie), the cast is excellent - so what's the problem?  Primarily it's that Spanglish never settles in on an approach, a pitch, a point of view.  At times it attempts, and misses, comedy.  At other moments it seems to want to be taken seriously as social commentary, which is laughable.  It comes closest to finding its heart in the relationship between mother and daughter, but frequently these scenes are glib and manipulative.  In a case like this, the blame must be laid at the director's feet, and the author of the abominable screenplay.<br /><br />These characters are not drawn; they're cut out of paper.  Deborah, in particular, played brilliantly by Tea Leoni, is so shrill and extreme that she quickly becomes a caricature, severely undermining the picture's chances of success.  John, played by Sandler, is certainly the most low key chef in the universe, he is so passive and uninteresting that one wonders how he could make milk toast, much less gourmet meals.  Cloris Leachman is brilliant as always - but it's never a good sign when a minor character threatens to walk away with a movie.  Compounding these egregious flaws, Spanglish is yet another SoCal film where folks in the picture biz examine their own neighborhoods and lifestyle - are these guys really so lazy - or narcissistic - that they won't leave the state?  An excellent performance by Sarah Steeles helps, as does an absolute star turn by Shelbie Bruce, but not enough to make sense of this hodgepodge.<br /><br />What saves Spanglish from the dustbin of cinema is an Oscar-caliber performance by the enchanting Paz Vega, who first won me over in 10 Items or Less.  Vega does more with reaction takes and other forms of non-verbal communication than all the other actors put together.  Besides being crazy beautiful, she has that ability to express a broad range of emotions easily, casually.  I'm told that when they made this film Vega did not even speak English, and learned her lines phonetically.  If true, her achievement is even more remarkable.  As a showcase for Paz Vega, Spanglish is worth your time; she is nothing short of brilliant.  Beyond that, it's just another grab bag of shopworn SoCal clich&eacute;s, two-dimensional stereotypes, and cheesy attempts to tug on your heartstrings without earning the right.</p></body></html>

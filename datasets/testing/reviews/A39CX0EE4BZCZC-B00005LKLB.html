<meta name="summary" content="Very Entertaining - A Modern-Day Classic"></head><body><p>This remains one of the modern-day "classic" movies that was so popular that is spawned several sequels. It was just great entertainment value.  The sequels, by the way, never topped this film.<br /><br />The story was ludicrous: one man beating an entire group of terrorists with outrageous, almost-impossible feats - another "Rambo" mentality flick - but it worked. The action scenes are memorable; Bruce Willis is good as the macho hero and David Warner is excellent as the villain.<br /><br />I do wish filmmakers would stop the bias against law enforcement. In this film, they show the acting police chief and all the FBI agents to be arrogant, stupid and crude....just what Hollywood always does to anyone in authority.<br /><br />But the film gets away with its flaws because it grabs you early on and never lets you go.....a very involving story.</p></body></html>

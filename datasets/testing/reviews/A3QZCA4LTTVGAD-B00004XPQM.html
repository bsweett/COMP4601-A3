<meta name="summary" content="Uneven but intriguing horror tale"></head><body><p>"Final Destination," directed by James Wong, has an intriguing concept and a strong start. High school student Alex (played by Devon Sawa) has a horrific premonition which is ultimately instrumental in saving the lives of himself and a number of others. But have they cheated death? Or is there an even more horrible fate in store for each of them?<p>I found "Final Destination" to be an oddly uneven film. Director Wong helps create a genuinely creepy atmosphere; I especially liked the way ordinary household items and actions are invested with an ominous weight. But some aspects of the film struck me as inappropriately humorous, leading me to wonder if I was watching an intentional spoof or if the filmmakers were just slipping up in moments of ineptitude.<p>I found the tone of the film inconsistent. Were they trying to create a serious psychological drama in which the viewer is meant to care about the characters, or rather should the viewer view Alex and the others as mere fodder for yet another "slasher"-style horror pic? I was also disappointed by the ending.<p>One of the best aspects of "Final Destination" is the strong work by its ensemble cast, which includes Kerr Smith and Kristen Cloke. Sawa in particular makes a sympathetic leading man. His solid performance carries much of the film; he is definitely a young actor worth following. Give "Destination" a try.</p></body></html>

Still, I was hoping for some serious enlightment about the ways of bears. I was disappointed. There's precious little enlightenment to be had in this documentary. Aside from one sequence showing two male bears violently clashing over territory/mating rights - you won't see much about bear behavior at all. You will mostly see Treadwell making a spectacle of himself, prancing his way to his ultimate tragedy, strewing self-aggrandizement, goofy bear names, and irrelevant asides as he goes.<br /><br />I was prepared to place almost all the blame for this on Treadwell himself. But then I read additional material about him that said he really did videotape thousands of hours of telling bear behavior and took thousands of pictures during his thirteen years in Alaska among the grizzlies. So the fact that there is so little substance in this film may be largely the fault of producer Werner Herzog.<br /><br />Herzog makes grand claims of significance for this movie, as he does for most of his projects. But he is being his usual pompous, pretentious self, and betrays Treadwell and the bears in the process.<br /><br />The only worthwhile part of this DVD is in the bonus material. Herzog is shown here helping coach the orchestra in composing and performing the sound track for the film. The resulting music is haunting and beautiful, with a feel for wild, wide-open spaces. They produce a musical theme worthy of Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />But otherwise, don't waste your money on this movie. If you want insights into bear behavior, you'd do better to check out the Discovery Channel film made about Treadwell. Or better yet, read a book such as Nick Jans' recently published The Grizzly Maze. Treadwell is there, in all his goofiness and ardor. But so are the bears.</p></body></html>

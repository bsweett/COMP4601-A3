<meta name="summary" content="A movie with so many messages"></head><body><p>I purchased the movie because the reviews were intriguing and the Blu-ray version was on sale at Amazon for less than $10.  The used prices on the movie were as much or more than the new price so I figure if I hated it I could sell it and get my money back. I won't be selling it, ever.<br /><br />I do not believe you can watch Magnolia once and understand what is happening. It becomes clearer on subsequent views because the movie plants very clear clues throughout but in a non-linear fashion.  The metaphysical side of the movie is extremely subtle but always present.  The spiritual transparency reminds me of an old quote "Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous."  I thoroughly enjoyed the whispy nature of the metaphysical side of the film.<br /><br />On the first viewing you'll probably connect with one or more of the story lines but may still be confused about the movie's point, especially by the ending.<br /><br />On the second viewing you begin to understand better that Earl Partridge is the patriarch of all the interconnected stories.  All the stories deal with Love in its many, many forms, and quite a few are presented in Magnolia. Besides connecting with one or more story lines you begin connecting with the expressions, reactions, and resolutions we all make about Love in our lives.<br /><br />The third viewing is just fun to try to find all the references to Exodus 8:2, like a Where's Waldo on a moving screen.  This exercise is actually more enjoyable to do with more than one person.  My wife caught references I missed and visa versa.  I seriously doubt we found them all after three viewings.<br /><br />By the second or third viewing you'll begin to understand the major message of the movie, besides Love, is "you may be through with the past but the past ain't through with you."  It is this point that will keep you thinking or talking about Magnolia long after the credits fade.  My wife and I talked for hours, connecting circumstances in our resolved and unresolved pasts with the experiences of the characters in the film.  We both said "how'd they put our lives in that movie?"  It is this point that is key; as human beings we all have similar patterns in our lives and Magnolia brilliantly displays some of the most familiar.<br /><br />If you have an analytical nature; if you enjoy thinking deeply about the messages of films, buy Magnolia.  If you just want to be entertained, Magnolia ain't the flick for you.</p></body></html>

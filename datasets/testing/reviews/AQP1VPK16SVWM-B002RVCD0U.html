While I was initially disappointed with the film and the major gaps of logic/storytelling that dogs the film, there are a number of scenes that suggest a much better movie was steamrolled by studio interference, budget cuts and last minute rewriting. T4 had potential buried in it which makes the film all the more disappointing. Still of you set your brain on cruise control and just enjoy the ride it's a mindless diversion although hardly in the same category as T1 or T2 much less the enjoyable but inferior T3.<br /><br />SPOILERS IN MY PLOT SYNPOSIS:<br />Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington in a terrific performance that seemed destined for a better film)decides to donate his body to a Cyberdyne researcher (Helena Bonham Carter in an interesting cameo) after he is executed for murder. He wakes up not in Hell but subjected to hell on Earth in the year 2018. John Connor leads resistence fighters and discovers a weapon that they can use to destroy the machines and is given an order to test it. Wright encounters Connor's father Kyle Reese. When he's captured by Connor (Christian Bale), Marcus discovers he's a cyborg designed to trick find Reese and trick Connor. Marcus convinces Connor to reluctantly agree to partner up with him in rescuing Reese before he's killed.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and sounds pretty darn stunning.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc includes both the original theatrical cut and the first "Director's Cut" (more accurately called the "R" Rated Cut) that McG submitted when the film was to be rated "R" (Warner had McG trim 3 minutes from the film for a much more friendly PG-13 to attract more viewers). Why Warner couldn't have just had a seamless branched version of BOTH films I'm not sure. It would have been far more valuble to allow McG to integrate the 40 minutes of cut footage into the film fleshing out some of the characters. I suspect we'll see that with some sort of "ultimate" edition later down the line. There are some clever tips of the hat to the first two movies, Cameron's "Aliens" and other science fiction films. To me it appeared that this clearly was a labor of love enough if the finished film does not quite measure up.<br /><br />Also has a number of extras including the Maximum Movie Mode which allows McG to appear on screen in a visual commentary track that gives us behind-the-scenes footage, drawings and concepts for the film. We also get a number of brief featurettes that show us how the Rototerminators were created, how Arnie made his "cameo" (it's actually quite clever)and the creation of the post-apocalpytic future we see.<br /><br />A mindless bit of entertainment that fails to live up to the potential of the first two films, TS has promise but fails to deliver on it due to last minute rewrites and studio interference. Still, the film has a strong cast, a number of memorable scenes and visual effects that hint at a much better film that was terminated prior to shooting/release.</p></body></html>

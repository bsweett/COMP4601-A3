They're too busy with their work and the wife is busy with committments.  Their daughter is diabetic and has to do dialysis.<br /><br />Lucinda has a daughter, whom she adores.  Her husband does international travels so they only see each other on special occasions.<br /><br />Charles and Lucinda meets by happenstance on a train on a rainy day.  They meet up again for lunch.  They call their spouses to lie about working late.  They go to a hotel to have an affair.<br /><br />However, the affair is interrupted.  Charles gets beaten to unconsciousness.  Lucinda gets raped.  Afterwards, they go on their separate ways.  However, the thief/rapist doesn't go away.  He calls and demands money or else members of their families will get hurt.  Their savings are depleted and they become desperate to meet the demands.<br /><br />Lucinda seems to be pliant as long as it keeps the police out of it.  Charles wants to report it to the police.  However, without Lucinda's cooperation, Charles feels he needs to take matters into his own hands to stop the man.  This is when things start to get interesting.<br /><br />I'm used to seeing Jennifer Aniston in romantic comedies.  It was different seeing her in a thriller.  I have to say that she does a good job.<br /><br />Overall, it's a movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

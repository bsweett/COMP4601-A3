<meta name="summary" content="Very Enjoyable Movie"></head><body><p>Two great comedy actors Kevin James and Will Smith together in one movie, I doubt this movie can be THAT bad. And as I thought, its not bad at all. Kevin James is so adorable, but I guess his character, not to mention the actor himself, helps bring it out even more. Will Smith was just great, but I didn't expect anything less.<br /><br />An enjoyable and refreshingly charming and funny movie. I'm just completely tired of movies that are requires the people in there to act totally stupid in order to make the audience laugh. There's good laughing and then there's just... "what the hell?" kind of laughing.<br /><br />They could have made the ending better, end it with a big bang, but I guess they didn't but oh well. Watch this movie, its worth it.</p></body></html>

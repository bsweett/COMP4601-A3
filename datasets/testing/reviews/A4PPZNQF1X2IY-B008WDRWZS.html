<meta name="summary" content="Overrated.  Invasion of privacy."></head><body><p>I turned off the movie with about 20 minutes left.  Herzog uses<br />private material from Mr. Treadwell to do a layman's psychological<br />profile of him.  This is an invasion of privacy and overall is deplorable.  It's also twisted how he focuses a lot of time on the gruesome death and details, including the audio tape.  If done with respect, this could have been an interesting, although more pedestrian documentary.  Herzog goes for shock value and thru hype and violations of privacy exploits this unique individual.</p></body></html>

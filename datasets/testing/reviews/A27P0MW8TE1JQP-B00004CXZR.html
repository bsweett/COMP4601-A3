It is important because it was a reuniting of the TV cast (in fact the picture almost starts like the Magnificent Seven collecting bridge crew vets), and the Big budget take on the show was worth the effort... It may take it self too seriously at times, especially in the extended cut, and the beauty passes of the Enterprise seem endless as do the V'Ger clould/ sphincter shots, and the story is sort of a recycled script (Changling)...  but I fondly remember seeing this in the theater.</p></body></html>

At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984, back when the theatre was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.<br /><br />This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.<br /><br />The director's cut adds some additional scenes that flesh out the motivations for the characters, and you would think that this adds to the film, but actually it detracts from it. I rather liked imagining what went on between the characters and having some of the sexual situations and conflicts insinuated and largely left up to the imagination of the viewer. This is all stripped away with the director's cut. Also, as unsavory a character as Salieri was, the extra scenes make him even more unlikable, and in a way that I thought was even beneath of what he was capable. I would elaborate, but I would give away key plot points.<br /><br />The commentary is the same as what was on the previous director's cut standard DVD, and to tell you the truth, the pair doing the commentary did not take the film seriously at all, which surprised me since one of the commenters is director Milos Forman. The comments were often completely distracting from the film's atmosphere, although they were well informed in their narrative. The other major extra, the "Making Of" documentary was quite enjoyable, and was also previously available on the standard DVD release of the director's cut.<br /><br />The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness,  and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. I highly recommend the film, and if you never saw the theatrical cut I doubt you will be bothered by the added material of the director's cut.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Having Him Back..."></head><body><p>After all the "Smallville" and other stuff, having the Man of Steel back on the big screen (like he really should be) was quite a treat last summer.  And now, the DVD let's you see it all on your big Plasma, hi-def screen at home.<br /><br />Much of what's written below compares, inevitably, Brandon Routh to Chrisopher Reeve.  Well, let's face it:  if you want Christopher Reeve badly enough, nobody is going to satisfy.  I thought Brandon did a wonderful job with the role.<br /><br />And I was, if anything, disappointed with Lex.  The guy playing him has been around, and has been celebrated as a great actor.  Here, he seems to sleepwalk through the role.  Kevin, you're not going to maintain your reputation this way...<br /><br />Finally, though, the true Achilles heel of this version is the writing, not the acting or even directing.  It should have been four stars, but the writers felt like they had to go for the shock value somehow.  I did not like that, and felt that it compromised the whole effort.<br /><br />Overall, though, it was one of the best movies of 2006, for sheer watchability if nothing else.</p></body></html>

It was an immensely popular film upon its release, (1970) and continues to be one of the best biographical films of all time. There wasn't much to do in our small town on the weekends, so we just went to the movies. I must have seen this film over ten times during its long run, and I never grew tired of it. Years later, watching it again on video, reminded me how adept Franklin Schaffner was at making the Epic, which seemed to be the fashionable genre during the 60's and 70's. The list of his achievements includes, "The Boy's from Brazil", "Papillon" and "Nicholas and Alexandra". All great pictures, all great stories, which have that particular Schaffner style: epic-like, professional, and memorable with a lot of class. <p>It is common knowledge that George C. Scott won the Oscar that year for best actor and declined the accolade for political and artistic reasons. This proved to be a significant turning point in his career; in fact his career seemed to go down hill after that, and he never fully recovered. This was unfortunate because Scott's performance in Patton is a work of pure genius, and he deserved to go on to do more high profile parts. For a lot of us, when we think of the historical character, General George Patton, we think of the actor, George C. Scott. The film and Scott's performance have become our historical reference point for the time and the man. When I think of the Seventh and Third armies during WW2, I visualize the actor in the Schaffner film standing in his jeep barking orders and inspiring his men to carry on against impossible odds. And that's the beauty of this film; it is accurate both historically and biographically. Of course, artistic license is taken occasionally, but for the most part, according to most WW2 historians, the film is true to the mark. <p>This is not so much a war film but a story about a leader whom despite insurmountable obstacles, inspired men to great heights, achieving the near unattainable. Patton was an educated man from a distinguished military family, who viewed the world from an historical perspective - `old blood and guts' believed he was part of world history, an immortal soul that fought against the Romans, and later, was part of Napoleon's army that forged into Moscow in the early 19th century. Patton was a believer in reincarnation- the theory that knowledge can be `remembered', because the soul or mind has passed through a previous series of bodied and disembodied states. Whether this notion is true or not, Patton believed he had the accumulative knowledge from past lives and used this knowledge during his command in WW2. At the end of the film, one of the German characters comments that Patton was an anachronism, the romantic warrior of times passed, whom without a war to fight, would perish. This was certainly true. George Patton knew his purpose and destiny, and that was to lead men into battle. <p>Everything about this film is first rate.</p></body></html>

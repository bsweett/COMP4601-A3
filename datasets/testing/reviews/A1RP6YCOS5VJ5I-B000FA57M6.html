<meta name="summary" content="The Best video game to movie ever!"></head><body><p>First of all, to like this film, you have to get past the idea of video game movies being Oscar awards winners and then I think you will enjoy video game movies more. Out of all of the movies based on video games that has ever come out, this is the best, especially in it's genre. I loved this film in theaters so I had to buy the DVD, and I have to tell ya, this movie wasn't any less exciting. I love it.<br /><br />Urban and the Rock do an excellent job in this film. The plot of the film has been somewhat changed, the biggest change being that the monsters aren't from Hell in the film, but overall an interesting story that makes sense. The special effects are done perfectly and the scenery really does set the mood.<br /><br />No this movie isn't going to win any huge awards, but why would you think a movie based on a video game would? I have been a fan of the DOOM video game series since it's first release, and I can speak from a fans perspective that fans will definitely love the game. If I could sum it up in one word, I would say that this movie is fun.</p></body></html>

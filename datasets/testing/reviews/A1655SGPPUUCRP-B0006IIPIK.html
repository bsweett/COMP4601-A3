I was stunned by the lush visuals, gorgeous lighting, period costumes, rich colors and overall style of the film.  Whoever said style over substance was a bad thing?<br /><br />"Sky Captain" is riddled with references to films of the 30's and 40's and old adventure comic books.  This nostalgia is what gives "Sky Captain" its own unique persona that has so amazed critics and audiences worldwide.  In the troubled world we live in today, many yearn for simpler times, and the best way to revisit the past is, of course, through film.  In "Sky Captain", I fond comfort in the simplistic beauty of times past.<br /><br />From the opening moments, as snow falls on a Gotham-like a scene, Director Kerry Conran sets the mood and style as he docks the massive airship Hindenburg III to the top of the Empire State Building in a sequence so astounding and breathtakingly real; so of the moment, that it fills audiences with an awe and wonder.  Conran takes a palpable joy in his filmmaking, an enthusiasm that sweeps you off your feet.  The visuals in "Sky Captain" are, simply put, are among the most astounding I have ever seen in a film.  No wonder Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi were all scrambling to be a part of this soon-to-be classic film!<br /><br />The story is by no means bad, as it has been suggested by many, but rather it is much more basic than most action flicks nowadays.  Frankly, I loved the simplicity of the story, which once again reminded me of Old Hollywood.  There were no annoying, pointless subplots that so confused me that I found myself frustrated with the film as I left the theater.  The fun, witty script kept me entertained and I found that I had a large, goofy grin on my face practically the entire film.  The whole thing was just so darn fun and lovable that I couldn't help it!  By far the year's best film.</p></body></html>

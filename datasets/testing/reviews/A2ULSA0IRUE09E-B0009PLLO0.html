Colin Farrell deserved an Oscar for those last few moments alone, on his deathbed. As much as a non-fan as I am of Colin, even I had to admit that this is perhaps his best performance on screen, even better than his one in "A Home at the Center of the World".<br /><br />One thing that might turn off viewers is the stunning Angelina Jolie with an accent you will either love or hate. Its hard to be neutral to this accent. Its pretty much the same accent she had on in both "Beowulf" AND "A Mighty Heart" which leads me to believe that this woman is wretched at putting on a specific accent for a film. Whether its Eastern European, Greek, Mixed-Race, or Black, Jolie sounds exactly the same - a weird Mediterranean meets Shakira accent that I couldn't quite get into. I think this was the films' only negative.<br /><br />The superb direction inevitably made me want to compare this to "Kingdom of Heaven", a movie that this shares many similarities with. However, I must say that this is not a classic as that film is, though it does have its' moments. Yes, I too had problems accepting a bleach-blond Colin Farrell in the beginning, and the tedious narration by Anthony Hopkins is almost hilarious, but it strangely works.<br /><br />Also, Alexanders' two major love stories - one with Hephastion, his male friends, and the other with what is seemingly his jungle-queen wife - are treated with respect, but also with caution. There is an unnecessary scene of heterosexual copulation that bordered on the absurd, and I only wish they had deleted this from the final cut of the film. As expected, the same-sex angle is conveniently relegated to second side-show, with the two men occasionally hugging and patting each other on the back as if they were long lost brothers. Many viewers found this a little too 'safe', and so did I.<br /><br />Doubtless, the many flaws this film has only make it more enjoyable. It IS long, but it has its share of cheesy moments, scenes of grandeur, and a script that comes alive at the most unexpected places. For all its cliches and horrible accents, this is a film that is awash in color and brightness, and Colin Farrell's single-minded devotion to his childhood sweetheart is only revealed to us during the films' climax, which was to me far more affecting than other historical films of this genre.<br /><br />Four Stars. You might laugh at it, cringe at it, but you still can't help loving it. A Cult Film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just different... I still prefer the original more"></head><body><p>If you grew up watching "Willie Wonka", you may not enjoy this one as much: not as "musical" (at least not as romantic and human, so to speak -no "Imagination" or "Golden Ticket" songs, for example) and certainly not as deep of a message as the one you may take away with the original with Wilder.<br /><br />However, it has its own merits: the kid that plays Charlie is perfect, the movie as a whole comes across as pretty funny, indeed funnier than the original (Depp is able to pull of more laughs, as he was with "Pirates...") and also the effects, as expected, are WAY better! Last, there were some parts of the story that were developed a little more than in the original.<br /><br />As for those who have read about a comparison with Michael Jackson, yes: there's definitely something there. :D<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</p></body></html>

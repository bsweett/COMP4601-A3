<meta name="summary" content="The Dude just wanted his rug back!  It really tied the living room together."></head><body><p>Trying to describe this movie is impossible.  When you get down to the core of it, it is about an unemployed stoner and bowling league member, The Dude, who gets mistaken for a millionaire philanthropist and has his crappy rug damaged by some bad guys.  The Dude's main position in the movie is trying to obtain restitution for his rug, and this leads to him getting caught up in the kidnapping of the millionaire's wife.  All of this plot is a little weak, and that's the beauty of the movie.  The movie is truly a collection of unforgettable characters and scenes in which the slacker criminals go up against the big guys.  We have a stolen car, a missing briefcase full of money, a severed toe, some neo-nihilist European criminals, a naked feminist artist, a porn king, and a lot of White Russians.  Jeff Bridges is brilliant as The Dude, but equally impressive is John Goodman's bitter Vietnam vet with a very clear sense of justice (even if it gets them in more trouble every time).  This is a ingenious recipe for a black comedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ozymandias Treatment for Maggie"></head><body><p>In Phyllida Lloyd's 2011 film, "The Iron Lady," the ever-accomplished Academy Award winning actress Meryl Streep adds another accent to her repertoire of outstanding characters with distinctive speech patterns that mark their identity.  However, it is not the duplication of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's voice cadence that wins her her third Oscar, it is her ability to play a woman in angst with multi-faceted nuance.  As Thatcher, Streep ripples and reels with the passing of time--for most of the film we see her as an aged oldster missing her now deceased husband with not much to check off on the daily to-do list other than seeing doctors, packing off her hubby's clothing and battling hallucinations.  Why Phyllida Lloyd decides to use Thatcher as a case-in-point for the ephemeral nature of success and the poster child for a modern-day Ozymandias lesson in the inevitable decline of any human, great or small, along with whatever empires they build, seems understandable on the surface, but results in a dreary portrait of "The Iron Lady" and her myriad of accomplishments within the United Kingdom.<br /><br />Of course, Streep portrays Thatcher in her dotage with a befuddled excellence that entitles her to be thought of as one of today's most brilliant actresses.  As the older Thatcher, she becomes visually disturbing as her mind meanders, chasing after dreams of yesterday as epitomized by the appearance of her deceased husband (played with panache by Jim Broadbent) who reminds and coaxes her to maintain control of whatever is left of her life.  Seeing Thatcher depicted in this way is almost embarrassing and decidedly irreverent.  Should not the woman who was prime minister of the UK longer than anyone else in its history be allowed the perseverance of her private dignity?<br /><br />If writer Abi Morgan's motivation for depicting Thatcher from this vantage point is to garner support for dementia-awareness with unsolicited cooperation from the former prime minister in order to show that it can happen to anyone despite one's former glory, this reviewer supposes that both Morgan and director Lloyd accomplish in projecting this theme.  However, the life of any woman would have done just as well to make this point.  Sadly, anyone expecting to understand the climate and politics of her time at the helm of the British nation will see montages of events like the IRA bombings, her battle with the unions and her mission to reclaim the Falkland Islands but will be ultimately disappointed when attempting to discern her contribution with regard to advancements for women and the British world.<br /><br />Instead of a strong woman who leads an important world nation for over 15 years, the audience sees a woman struggling for her sanity because her physical body is failing.  But what of Thatcher's quick mind?  What of her accomplishments?  Should she not be applauded for her tenacity and ability to stand up to others?  The filmmakers give us a glimpse of this, but focus on Thatcher's deterioration instead of her crested glory.  The resultant film wears thin in the mind of the viewer--the lows are underscored too brutally while the highs are barely explained.<br /><br />Even though Alexandra Roach bristles as the young Margaret Thatcher--she is all about quenching her thirst for change and getting done what she thinks must get done--this reviewer does not get a sense of who Margaret Thatcher really is.  Instead, the image of Streep as the old woman in a world that has passed her by remains steadfast--a cautionary tale almost Buddhist in its leanings towards the insignificance of the world of politics and materialism.  Why bother to strive when what awaits you is forgetfulness, a body that betrays and death?<br /><br />Bottom line?  Phyllida Lloyd's depiction of Margaret Thatcher does not contain enough data about this longest serving British prime minister to consider it a biopic.  Instead, the film, sadly, depicts the trials and tribulations of the aged as dementia and other dehabilitating diseases set in.  This "make hay when the sun shines" mentality depresses rather than instills ambition or rallies motivation towards world progress in any positive manner.  Streep excels as the aging Maggie, missing her husband, her son and underling the importance of having some purpose to even the longest days.  Recommended only for those who want to see Streep's award-winning performance and realize this is not an upbeat biographic film bullet-pointing Thatcher's actions during her ministry.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

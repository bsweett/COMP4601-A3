<meta name="summary" content="Love it when a movie is this controversial..."></head><body><p>read the customer reviews and you will see a deep split between those who loved the film and those who wish it had never been made!  <p>I saw Crouching Tiger in the theater and actually sat through two performances in a row.  I just could not take the whole experience in in one sitting - it left me visually stunned.  Because I was outvoted at home, the first time I viewed the DVD, we used the English version, and although I still found the film to be exciting, it wasn't quite as enjoyable as is the original Chinese version.<p>There is little I can say to add to the multitude of voices that have reviewed this film.  I found the director's vision to be so vast and complex that is was astounding.  The window it opened to the beauty of central China  was incredible.  Lee was definitely in control of the pacing and of the performances of his cast, which are outstanding, but pale in comparison to the texture of the story and the backdrop of what is China.<p>This is one of those films where words fail to describe the experience, and gushing praise just makes others who view the film wonder ....&quot;What's all the fuss about?&quot;.  If you view it as a martial arts film, or a historical romance, or an epic, each view is too limited.  It is all of these things, and more.<p>Crouching Tiger will be in my list of the top 5 films of all time for many years to come.  Ang Lee is brilliant.</p></body></html>

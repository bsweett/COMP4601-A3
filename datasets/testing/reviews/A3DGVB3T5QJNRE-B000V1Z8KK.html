<meta name="summary" content="A Scathing Indictment Of The American Justice System!"></head><body><p>I have to admit I found the violence, which was a bit excessive, to be an integral part of the story. In Shooter, the good guys win in the end by a landslide! Not only do the good guys win, but they have to win! The mass murder that took place in the name of corporate & government power in "Ethiopia" can not be allowed to happen all over again in Ecuador! In Shooter you are, unfortunately, left only with black & white, life & death choices.<br /><br />While this is supposedly a work of fiction, Hollywood, in my opinion, just substituted Ethiopia for Nigeria, or perhaps, Cameroon!<br /><br />It's a simple fact: There are so many mercenary forces around the world for hire, they are even currently employed, in a huge way, to fight in Iraq against the insurgents! So it's not so far fetched that they are being used in very poor countries to get rid of tribal/indigenous people who are trying to stop large development projects, like an oil pipeline. I know I would get a bit testy if some outside force, in cooperation with my central government, was going to force me off my land and/or harm the environment that my family is dependent on for wholesome food and clean water! (For further information on on this complex subject, see the documentary - "Pipe Dreams" by Terri Hathaway or read anything by the late Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.)<br /><br />But what does this have to do with the American justice system? I couldn't think of a more scathing indictment than when the U.S. Attorney General, himself, throws up his hands in the air and says there is nothing he can do! How can the most powerful U.S. law enforcement agency possibly stop American mercenaries in the employ of corporate and government interests working both inside and outside of the United States? In other words - when it comes to extreme human rights violations, the lofty U.S. Justice system is powerless, and only the story's hero has the courage, and ability, to stop these foul villains from committing further atrocities in the name of progress!<br /><br />What a commentary on American society!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1842778110">Looting Africa: The Economics of Exploitation</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1870716221">Genocide in Nigeria</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586420259">In the Shadow of a Saint: A Son's Journey to Understand His Father's Legacy</a></p></body></html>

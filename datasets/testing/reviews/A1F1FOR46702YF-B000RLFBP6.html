In the near future, the city of Detroit is under financial ruin and violent crimes have overwhelmed the city's struggling police department. On the first day of his new assignment, police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is gunned down by dangerous criminals but is rebuilt as a lethal law-enforcement cyborg by the multinational corporation Omni Consumer Products to eradicate the criminal elements of the city. "Robocop" is a rousing futuristic thrill ride that stands the test of time. Director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instincts & Total Recall) delivers a slick and well crafted story, non-stop action, fine performances and sharp social satire. The 1987 futuristic actioner also stars Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer and Daniel O'Herlihy. "Robocop" spawned two sequels, comic books, video games, action figures, two animated series, a short-lived live action series and a four-part television miniseries.<br /><br />"Robocop" 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition comes fully loaded for fans of the 1987 Sc-Fi favorite. The 2-disc DVD contains both the R-Rated theatrical release and the extended uncensored version. Both versions are presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is quite good with little noticeable grain. Both 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks offer an enjoyable home theater experience. Among supplemental material, the DVD contains the "Flesh and Steel: The Making of Robocop" documentary, several behind-the-scenes featurettes, theatrical trailer, TV spot, picture gallery, deleted scenes and an in-depth audio commentary with director Paul Verhoeven and production crew. Overall, "Robocop" 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition gets an "A-".</p></body></html>

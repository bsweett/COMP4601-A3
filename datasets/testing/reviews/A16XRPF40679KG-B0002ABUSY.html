However it's got running zombies and they are still running long after they died. That works in the 'the return of the living dead' series which is part comedy. (still a classic though). but not so well here. The acting is fine  but the detail and social commentary is lost in this movie. It's  a higher budget movie but the filmakers just don't have the soul in the story the first version had.  Taken on it's own?  It's still average for a high budget horror movie. It's lost all the humor of the original though which is a shame. So it's a average horror movie. But running zombies , as in sprinting should be left for the return of the living dead series. The blu ray looks great though and has extras. It should though being a newer movie.</p></body></html>

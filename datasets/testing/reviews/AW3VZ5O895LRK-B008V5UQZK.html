<meta name="summary" content="Mixed Marriages: Heaven and Hell on Earth!"></head><body><p>Let me join the chorus of approval for what started out as a small movie and ended up, deservedly, a huge hit.  I'm from a mixed marriage, Italian (mother) and New England WASP (father).  The only difference here is that the materfamilias half is Greek.  Small difference.  The huge difference is always how emotional, loud and overwhelming the ethnic end is and how restrained, cool, controlled and underwhelming the WASP end is.  This film captures that difference perfectly.  It is safe to say that the big attraction for the WASP end of the couple is getting away from the emotionally stultifying world he inhabits.  John Corbett (from "Sex and the City") is marvelous as Ian in that role.  Actually, this role isn't very different from that tv role but he does that kind of role extremely well and you couldn't ask for a more attractive, beguiling leading man.  He may lack range as an actor but that's not a problem here. Nia Vardalos, the leading lady, comes to film from comedy plus she also wrote the screenplay.  She is wonderful as the ethnic daughter who has to deal with her volatile family upon announcing that she is going to marry a non-Greek.  All hell breaks out.  Great as Corbett and Vardalos are, this movie is almost stolen right underneath them by Michael Constantine as the father.  He is the family member who has the hardest time accepting a mixed marriage and he is both hilarious and touching every step of the way.  The rest of the supporting cast is all top notch as well.</p></body></html>

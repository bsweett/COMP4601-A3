<meta name="summary" content="Land of the Dead is entertaining, but leaves some confusion............."></head><body><p>20 years after "Day of the Dead", George Romero is back, possibly with the success of "28 Days later", remake of his "Dawn", or the parody, "Shaun of the Dead". Never the less, he is back, and thank you Mr. Romero. People ask why do the roaming zombies not look all that bad when all their victims get ripped to shreds? Go back to the original, "Night", some freak radiation problem,(their only guess), and the dead emerged from their graves, in tact, and fresh. Many graveyards in the country. My problem, in a world gone mad, one building, Fiddler's Green, is the place to be. What is money worth, what do these people do for a living? Just a bunch of rich people exploiting their money, for what? Useless in a zombie world. They have to hire renegades for supplies....for money? Why? Where they going to spend it? The renegades just loot stores, money is worthless. They just want in Fiddler's Green, not going to happen. Social satire is abundent, exspecially when the dead break into Fiddlers Green. For a sec, its back to the glory days of "Dawn of the Dead", except then, they were trying to survive, now, people want into the so called prestigios tower and off the streets, and the better life, does it really exsist? Great gore for horror fans, fast paced, zombies start to get smart, like Bub in "Day of the Dead", using weapons, mumbling directions to each other, but otherwise, where is this film really meant to go? Dennis Hopper and his briefcases of money............what, open up a diner for the undead? "Dawn of the Dead is the best, surviving with what you have, and if greed takes over, you will be punished. Some trivia, Tom Savini, fx God of "Dawn" and "Day" makes a cameo as Blade. I do love how Romero keeps his zombies slow moving, instead of track runners.Also George quit smoking while filming "Day of the Dead", that didn't last, hard habits are hard to break, keep thrilling us George, we love you. People don't knock the effects, alot better then the bluefaced zombies in the origial "Dawn". I think they are quite brilliant myself, good job, Greg Nicotero.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="not quite as good as the 1951 version,but still pretty good (3.5/5)"></head><body><p>i have to admit,i actually liked the 1951 version of this film<br />better.don't get me wrong,this is still a good film.it has a good deal<br />of suspense.the setting is good,the whole being isolated in a remote<br />location,nobody around for miles scenario.Alien had the same sort of<br />vibe a few years before with the added element of claustrophobia in the<br />mix,and did a better job.The Thing is just a little too slow and drawn<br />out.add a few scenes of chaos and noise for effect,and a creature that<br />just didn't do it for me in terms of how it looked and moved.despite<br />that,i did like the whole mystery element to it.that was well done.and<br />the ending was interesting.you sort of have to draw your<br />conclusions.for me,The Thing is a 3.5/5</p></body></html>

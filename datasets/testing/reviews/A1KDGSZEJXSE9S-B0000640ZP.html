<meta name="summary" content="Brillant Movie!"></head><body><p>This is a great movie from start to finish. This is one of<br /><br />those movies that alot of the actions and words will not<br /><br />make complete sense until you see the ending. The acting<br /><br />in this movie is great. The young kids put most movie stars<br /><br />to shame. Nicole Kidman also gives a good showing as the<br /><br />stubborn wife that can't see anyway but her way. She manages<br /><br />to be onscreen almost the whole movie, but she doesn't hog<br /><br />the spotlight or take away all the focus.<br /><br />The movie is different from most movies of it's genre<br /><br />nowdays because it doesn't try and overwhelm you with<br /><br />special effects and gore... The music and emotions and<br /><br />such to draw you in. It's just so rare for a movie to<br /><br />be this flawless in times were movies try to use<br /><br />computers and such instead of the talents the actors and<br /><br />actresses.<br /><br />It's a movie that if you have a short attention spand you<br /><br />might want to avoid because you will get bored. But if you<br /><br />want a movie that will require you think and watch then<br /><br />this is a nice change of pace it's better than most any<br /><br />movies that came out in 2001.</p></body></html>

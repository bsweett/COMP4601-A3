It has a little bit of everything a guy's movie should have...wanton and gratuitous violence, language that would make sailors blush and of course beautiful (and dangerous) women. I really liked seeing Brad Pitt take on a different role than what I've come to expect from him and just run with it. Michael Fassbender is at his swaggering stiff-upper-lip best as well.

<meta name="summary" content="Best Naval War Movie."></head><body><p>It could have used a battle somewhere in the middle but the one at the beginning and end are realistic and well done.  The story is about friendship, honor, and duty.  There is alot of dramatic things such as when the man gets knocked overboard during the well done storm sequence, the man drowning himself with a cannonball as a weight, and the 2 main characters playin music together and fighting over right and wrong.  Overall its a good war drama, with good action, performances, drama, cinematography, and visuals.  I give it a 8 out of a 10 because it needs a battle in the middle to help quicken the pace a little to make it more watchable but everything else is good entertainment.</p></body></html>

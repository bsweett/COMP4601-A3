Miles, a wine enthusiast and failed writer, takes B-list actor Jack to the California wine country, where he envisions them sipping pinot noir and enjoying delicious food. Jack, however, sees the trip as a final opportunity to sow his very wild oats before entering into the eternal servitude of marriage. As expected, the trip doesn't turn out quite as either friend has planned it.<br /><br />The cinematography in this film was absolutely beautiful, with magnificent sweeping pans of the California countryside. As well, I really appreciated how the film, through the eyes of Miles, explored the world of wine and food. It was passionate and interesting.<br /><br />Also, let me add my voice to the chorus of people who were surprised when Paul Giamatti was not nominated for an Academy Award last year. He did a great job in Sideways. What I liked best about Miles was that he was a contradictory character, like so many of us are. He did bad things, like steal money from his mother and lie to his best friend, but he was also capable of great loyalty, self-examination, and devotion. (On the flip side, I felt that Jack was almost a total idiot, with very few redeeming characteristics to his muddy name.)<br /><br />I also liked the way that, although the story didn't end with everything tied up in a nice bow, you definitely felt that Miles was going to be all right, that he was going to make it just fine. Sometimes all people need is one person who really gives a hoot about them.</p></body></html>

A True Babe---in Charlize Theron, who is not only blonde but actually beautiful in a unique way (most Hollywood blondes are blandly homogenous) and can actually act.  Marvelous eye candy.<p>2.  Somewhat interesting characters---the computer nerd is pretty stock, but the others are somewhat original, esp. Handsome Rob, who's just hilarious.<p>3.  Somewhat original action scenes---how they dislodge the safe in Venice, and then the armored car in L.A., was rather neat.  <p>4.  Unusual choice of Cool Car---I'd expect Porsches, BMWs, Ferraris...but never the Mini-Cooper, which looks the Communist-era East German Trabant, a little box on wheels.  <p>5.  Competent dialogue---most action flicks are full of clunky, hackneyed lines that just make you feel sorry for the poor actors who have to deliver them with a straight face.  This screenplay in contrast seems to have been written by actual junior high school graduates.<p>Now my dislikes:<p>1.  Plot gets more than a little unbelievable towards the end---namely, why didn't our heroes just as easily wack Edward Norton's character themselves at the end, instead of paying off the Russian mob a huge chunk of loot to do it for them?  <p>2.  Why does Charlize Theron get to keep her clothes on in this movie?  What a crying shame, especially considering she didn't in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; which was geared to far less of a predominantly male audience.  Wait...could it be the PG-13 rating, which would allow in a lot more prepubescent moviegoers?<p>3.  Cheesy product placement.  C'mon, a world-class professional hacker typing away at a DELL laptop for Pete's sake???  Yeah, right!</p></body></html>

Who takes a ride from a lone weirdo and not one of these morons suspect anything when they arrive at an abandoned mine where the guy lives???? How is that possible???? Don't waste you time or money on this one, rent the Devil's Rejects, plenty of gore, a wacko story with a demented clown and a sense of humor! Enjoy!</p></body></html>

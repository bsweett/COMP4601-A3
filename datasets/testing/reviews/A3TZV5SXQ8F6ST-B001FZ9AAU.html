<meta name="summary" content="The Marvel Man-Machine"></head><body><p>In summers that are now filled with super heroes vying for cinematic dollars, Iron Man climbs to the top of the mountain, with the human side of the story not being overwhelmed by high-tech gadgetry.<br /><br />With a neat twist to the comic book top gun, Robert Downey Jr. portrays industrialist Tony Stark, who creates the power armor that ultimately becomes the Iron Man power suit while being held captive by terrorists. Stark is assisted in the task by the ill-fated captive Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub). The plot then takes a roller-coaster ride of betrayal, redemption and avenging the death of his fellow captive, while building up to something called the "Avenger Initiative".<br /><br />This character may become a surprising franchise in the crowded marketplace of super heroes in the contemporary settings of war and politics. The 2-disc Blu-ray edition is an outstanding way to start on the adventure or to see it again....for the very first time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Review Of The Goonies"></head><body><p>This 1985 family adventure classic has a great cult following, and with good reason, this film was the most popular movie of that year. The Goonies is about a group of young friends who is on a search to find a hidden pirate treasure, and trying to outwit a family of career crimnals. The special features includes a video commentary by director Richard Donner and the cast of The Goonies as well as the now-classic 1985 Cyndi Lauper music video. Watching The Goonies has brought back a lot of fun memories for me. the movie is perfect for rainy day weekends or for the kids to watch. :)</p></body></html>

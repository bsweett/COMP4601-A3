This strategy works for Mel Brooks, but here Ferrel takes potshots at everything and pretty much misses everything. For example, there is a voice over at the end for a character that is never seen in the movie. Was that intentional and not funny? Or was it unintentional and sloppy editing? The language is bad in spots. Furthermore, there is a lot of yelling in the movie by different characters. I am not sure why that is funny.<br /><br />The good points were the dog was cute, Steve Carrel as Brick was funny, and some of the cameos were funny. I won't spoil the cameos, because who they got to play which character is part of the fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the scene was not as funny.<br /><br />The movie just doesn't work for me.</p></body></html>

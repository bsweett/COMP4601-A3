<meta name="summary" content="Odd thriller targets two different audiences"></head><body><p>"Man on Fire" is an odd thriller. It seems to be appealing to two different audiences - kids seeking thrills and violence, and adults looking for intelligent entertainment, a la its director, Tony Scott's, "Spy Game" [2001]. In trying to play both ends against the middle, the movie fails to satisfy either audience. At nearly 2 ? hours long, it is too long and convoluted for kids. Beginning in the second half, there is violence so surreal and unexpected that it turns off most adults. Finally, the ending, which I anticipated early in the movie, is so gimmicky it tends to make BOTH audiences feel cheated.<br /><br />Denzel Washington, who plays Creasy, a has-been former CIA operative, leads a cast of consummate professionals. Down on his luck, alcoholic and suicidal, he finds himself in Mexico City. He meets an old buddy [Christopher Walken] who secures him a job as a bodyguard for the young daughter [Dakota Fanning] of a rich couple [Marc Anthony and Rhada Mitchell]. At first Creasy plays his usual, all business self, but soon the girl wins his heart. They bond in the movie's most moving scenes. When the girl is kidnapped, Casey is nearly killed trying to save her. While he is hospitalized, the kidnapping goes terribly wrong, and the kidnappers declare they have killed her. When he recovers, Creasy goes on a revenge rampage of Biblical proportions. It's not a pretty picture, and only an actor of Washington's abilities could sustain our empathy with the character.<br /><br />Supporting actors include such greats as Giancarlo Giannini and Rachel Ticotin. I can imagine all the actors on the set begging the director to tell them where their characters were going. How Scott responded, I will never know, but I also imagine the set as being rather chaotic.<br /><br />Adding to the chaos of "Man on Fire" was the decision to film most of it in a jarring, MTV-style mode. There is nothing in particular wrong with this editing technique, if used sparingly. If used over the course of 2? hours, though, it's the equivalent of writing a book using all caps.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Die Hard  (1988)"></head><body><p>Director:  John McTiernan<br />Cast:  Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedalia, Alexander Gudonov, Paul Gleason, William Atherton, Hart Bochner, James Shigeta, Reginald Vel Johnson.<br />Running Time:  132 minutes.<br />Rated R for extreme violence, language, and brief nudity.<p>Fresh of his success with the popular television series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, Bruce Willis takes his stab at the motion picture business with full force.  &quot;Die Hard&quot; works on many levels--mainly as an action flick with a powerful leading star that adds a touch of normalcy and humor--but it also discusses more important views such as the criticism of the culturization of Japanese technology that was taking place at the time as well as the horrific, ongoing threat of terrorism.  It s a film that shows just how vulnerable any business or workplace really is to a terrible force but also how one man can stand up to the challenge and ultimately make a difference.<p>John McClane (Willis) is a New York City cop who travels to the Los Angeles area to reconcile with his seperated wife (Bonnie Bedalia) and family, who left him to pursue a lucrative job with a Japanese financial industry skyscraper.  While participating in a Christmas Eve party, the building is overtaken by German terrorists who want to use the hostage Japanese executives to break into the company safe.  McClane watches as the head terrorist (played brilliantly by Alan Rickman) blows the brains out of the Japenese CEO realizes that the game is on.<p>With the help of a gun-shy cop (Reginald Vel Johnson--yes, that's right--Mr. Winslow from &quot;Family Matters&quot;) and to the annoyance of police chief Paul Gleason, McClane runs around like a chicken with its head cut off attempting to save the hostages.  While on the explosive one-man war, Bruce Willis plays McClane in a very believable, humorous fashion--which is the quintessential reason for the film being one of the best of its kind.  &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a non-stop frenzy of excellent action sequences, a superb and witty screenplay written by Jeb Stuart and Steven D. de Souza (adapted from the Roderick Thorp novel), and top-notch, edge-of-your-seat direction from McTiernan.  The Five Star Collection DVD features a deleted scene and some excellent commentary from cast and crew.  One of the best action films of the 1980's.  A superb roller-coaster ride of thrills.</p></body></html>

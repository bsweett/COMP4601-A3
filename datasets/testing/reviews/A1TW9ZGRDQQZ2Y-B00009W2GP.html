There is more action in this film than the first two combined. The ceiling shootout at the Club Hell, the 20 minute epic battle against the machines, and of course Neo's final rain-soaked confrontation with Agent Smith are great and worth admission price alone. If you were dissappointed with Reloaded, don't give up hope just yet. Revolutions is why we action fans go to the movies!</p></body></html>

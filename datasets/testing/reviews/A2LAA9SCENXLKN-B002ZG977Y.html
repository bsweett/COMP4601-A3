Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />This movie impressed me, I was impressed (person comes in room) *cough*redundant*cough*. But first, if you don't like it when people take plots from the original and totally replace them (re-imagining,) then this isn't the one for you.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, this is not just CGI. It is also mind-numbing action. Just kidding. Well it does have that quality, it is very smart. First off, the film pays a lot of homage to the original, keeping everything in. What is not in the main plot makes a cameo *cough*I WANT THAT MECHANICAL OWL!!!!*cough.* It also has some symbolism, more on that later.<br /><br />So there, the CGI is awesome. I said it, I'll say it again. This CGI beats Avatar, it is up there with War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park. Maybe even better (THAT'S A STRETCH THOUGH.) But seriously, some of the best CGI I've seen in a while. Have you noticed that all the characters look very, very modern. Not even trying to resemble the original? PERSEUS LOOKS LIKE HE JOINED THE MARINES!!! (Perseus, Marines...worst joke ever...but seriously...laugh Jake...laugh.)<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit it, the stop-motion of the original cannot be beat. Also, the CGI monsters have very different colors and patterns then the original. (As you can see with the Kraken.) For instance, the scorpion and pegasus for that matter are both black, when in the original pegasus was white and scorpion was yellow. Scorpion is also MUCH bigger in this film. Pegasus is joined by white horses, and is much bigger. The scorpion does have a more realistic pattern. But, I gotta stop, CAUSE I'M INSULTING HARRYHAUSEN! GOD DANG IT! SOMEBODY PUNISH ME!!!<br /><br />I like the inclusion of Hades, and just the whole plot is very different, and great. So, I can't compare which is better, there both very different films. It'd be like comparing The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla. I know Godzilla is based off Beast, but there both very different. I will say that the replacement of the Seagull with the Eagle is both a good and a bad. Eagle being the US symbol, but Seagull being more loose and saying "GOOD TIME PEOPLEZ! HERE COMES BOB MARLEY!" "Three Little Birds, hopping on my doorstep...singing sweet songs..." etc. But the Eagle says "BOOM! HERE COMES SALIVA!"  "BOOM! DO YOU WANT IT? BOOM! DO YOU NEED IT? BOOM! LEMME HEAR IT! Ladies and Gentlemen..." etc.<br /><br />It felt shorter than what it was, it felt like maybe 1.5-2.5 hours but it's 3 hours and 2 minutes. [P.S. I am sorry I am not reporting the 3-D, I got ripped off at the theater. YOU CAN ACCOMMODATE SEIZURES, BUT WE ASPERGERS PEOPLEZ NEED IT TOO!) I might add something on the 3-D another day, since I've been offered a treat by one of my friends. They feel my pain. How does that song go? "Nobody knows the trouble I've seen....Nobody knows my sorrow..." (I hope you can see me laughing while I typed that.) (I've been quoting a lot of songs in this review.)<br /><br />All in all, a great film. I can't compare it too the original, but it is close enough to deserve that title. Clash of the Titans.<br /><br />P.S. PERSEUS IS THE SON OF POSEIDON, NOT ZEUS!!!!!!<br /><br />The Rating? Heck, what the heck, 4.2/5.<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman signing off.</p></body></html>

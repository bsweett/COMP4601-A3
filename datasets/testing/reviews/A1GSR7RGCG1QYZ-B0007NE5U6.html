Was it the actors feeling like they were too comfortable in their roles? Maybe. Was it the unchallenging story that fell too clearly into a clich&eacute;d moment than a fun film? Maybe. Was it the random exploits of our character that pulled us away from her and into a world that we were unfamiliar with? Maybe. Was it the lackluster music that filled my ears with pain instead of enjoyment? Maybe. It could possibly be one of these options or all of them, but when I walked out of the theater, I didn't feel the same excitement as I did when I walked out of the theater for the first one. Bridget had changed (or maybe it was me, but for the sake of argument I will say Bridget), and it wasn't for the better.<br /><br />Let me explain my four points from above a bit clearer to see if anyone can help me discover what went wrong in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. First, the comfort level of the actors. To begin, did Renee look bigger in this film. In the first film she was plump-cute, in this film she seems just plump-plump. She seemed to just stroll through her lines not giving us half the emotion or excitement as she did in the original. Instead of building upon Bridget Jones, Zellweger just gave us a recycled version of the original Bridget Jones, jokes and all. She was just the same as the original. Nothing new was created, but more was destroyed. Firth was equally as bad (GASP for me to say that), but he just never came out of his shell. In the original I wanted Jones to be with him by the end and in this film I just didn't care. He felt and seemed cold-hearted, even in all of his emotional moments. I wanted his character to be over-the-top instead of under-the-weather. Finally, there was Hugh Grant, so literally just didn't care about this film at all. There was no passion in his eyes or any magic in his words. Together this troupe made an unfunny film where they attempted to pull everything back from the original. The book was not the same as the original, so why should this be?<br /><br />This leads me into my second point regarding the unchallenging story. It seemed and felt as if Zellweger was falling her paces instead of leading her character. The events that surrounded her seemed so surreal that I never really felt as if they were happening to her. Somewhere near the center of this film we go from personal story to fantasy. The fact that the director could only tell us with Darcy did for Jones proved that money and creativity were lacking in this sequel. The director obviously did not have a very good grasp on this film, and it was obvious from the beginning to the end. The entire Rebecca moments were laughable and unemotional. I needed a dramedy instead of a silly-goofy film. Who felt as if the fight between Darcy and Cleaver was two men looking to get paid instead of act. Why was this scene even in this film? I can tell you why, it is because women love Firth and Grant fighting and the studio executives wanted to pull those same women back into the audience. Well, couldn't we be more original and find someone else to fight? Apparently not as we are forced to uncomfortably sit through two hours of repetitive motions that we had already seen from the original. URG!<br /><br />Third and I know this is something that we probably couldn't avoid because it was in the book, but the change of scenery was pointless. I like Jones in her environment, London, it allows her humor to come from inside instead of from her 'wacky' expeditions. The ski trip moment was horrible. I even felt awkward throughout it. It just showed me that there was more money and more ability to travel. Did anyone else seem to notice that the prison seemed awfully glossed over? This is built another level to disappointment that I was already feeling from this film. Why did we have to butcher a great character with sight gags? Bridget Jones is not a sight gag person, it is her uncanny passion that makes her funny, not putting her butt in pig feces.<br /><br />Finally, there was the music. In the original the music complimented the film. In Edge of Reason, it only detracts us from the film. It is the most random chaotic choices encountered in a film. From classic oldies to modern pop, Bridget Jones changed before my own eyes as a wanna-be music video and platform for those that want to get ahead. If it was going to be a repetitive film like the first was, where was 'It's Raining Men'. That would have at least made me chuckle. Instead, there was some American-ized Christina Aguleria/Pink wanna-be blasting her song in this very British film. Chalk this one up to yet another disaster brought about by this director. Did she even see the original? The music failed in this sequel, causing a distressed viewer run back and rewatch the original.<br /><br />Overall, this was a horrible remake. Jen seemed to feel the same, but still found it enjoyable to purchase when it is released. I felt as if there was something missing. Bridget Jones is not one that needs to change for a new generation, and I felt this is what director Beeban Kidron did. She tried to make her perkier, plumper, and hipper. Bridget Jones is a character that is supposed to speak to women in the audience by her awkward behavior and passion for love, but instead what I witnessed (and I think the women will agree) was an actress packing on more weight than needed to gain the sympathy of anyone in the audience. She put no emotion behind her character, nor did anyone else involved. This felt like a painful sequel, and it was obvious that nobody was fully behind it.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></body></html>

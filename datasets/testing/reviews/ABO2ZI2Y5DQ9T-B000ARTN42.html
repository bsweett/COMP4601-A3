<meta name="summary" content="Well-Told Story about one American Dream; and See Knock-Out Performance from Crowe and Giamatti"></head><body><p>Well, you may not this guy, but you have to admit he can act.  Yes, I'm talking about Russell Crowe, star of 'Cinderella Man.' And the film's results at this summer's box-office must be  disappointing to the studios (Touchstone, Universal, Miramax and Imagine), for it barely exceeded $60 million. Here's another reason you don't see this film.<br /><br />In fact, 'Cinderella Man' is a well-made film about a boxer Jim Braddock who lived a life during the 1930s in America.  Though the script of Cliff Hollingworth and Akiva Goldsman is nothing but a familiar 'dreams-come-true' type of story, the good acting and production designs raises the film several rank higher than where it might have been.<br /><br />Like another Depression-era film 'Seabiscuit,' Jim Braddock got everything, lost it, and came back to get it again.  During the Depression, Braddock, formerly young promising boxer, is now trying to get a job at the dock.  No longer able to fight because of his broken fists, and having caring wife and three kids at home, Jim needed money.  At one time, he goes not only to Public Relief, but also to the promoters who once decomissioned him, and literally begs for money.<br /><br />But thanks to his faithful trainer Joe Gould, who convinced the promoter to give him another chance, Jim Braddock returns to the ring.  Everyone thought he would lose; Joe might be thinking as anyone else, like 'This is going to be his last bout."  Maybe Jim himself thought that way.  Contrary to their lowest expectation, however, Jim wins.  You know, sometimes strange things happen in the history of sports, like last year's Major League Baseball.  And in Jim's case, he becomes Cinderella Man, a national celebrity and hero of the time when many people just stopped dreaming.<br /><br />The producers of 'Cinderella Man' should be grateful to the actors, especially Russell Crowe as Jim Braddock and Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould.  Their acting are both rivetting in a different way; Crowe presenting a convincing portrait of fierce (and often desperate) fighter and loving father, and Giamatti a glib manager whose glibness cannot hide his humanity.  And special mention to Craig Bierko, heavy weight champ 'Max Baer'  who killed two boxers on the ring, and can smile and brag his power.<br /><br />Ron Howard tends to include too many things in his film, losing the blance of the entire film, and he doesn't change.  The film runs as long as 2h 24mins, but the length is no problem here with a good story and acting.  Still, Renee Zellweger as Jim's wife Mae Braddock is far from satisfactory, not required to do much (and why Renee Zellweger?  She is miscast, I am afraid).  Worse is the role of Mike (played by Paddy Considine, 'In America') of whose presence gives little impact to the story.  His character and the friendship with Jim is awfully underwritten.<br /><br />But the worst part of the film is, if I have to point out, is its title.  Even though the name is historicaly correct as Jim Braddock's alias, the name, when used with a film released during the summer season, sounds like a comedy starring Will Ferrell (I confess. I really thought so at first).<br /><br />As a film 'Cinderella Man' has flaws, but the actors are certainly Oscar worthy.  And it is a good example to prove that a good story well told never fails to move us.  Even though it was told many times before.</p></body></html>

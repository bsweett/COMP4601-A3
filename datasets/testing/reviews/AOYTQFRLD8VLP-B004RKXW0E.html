<meta name="summary" content="Setting Aside Childish Things"></head><body><p>Well, I thought they could go no further with this tale after "Toys Story 2", but the imaginators at Pixar weren't quite done with this one yet.<br /> 15 years after the world first met Woody(Tom Hanks), Buzz(Tim Allen), and the gang, we find out what will subsequently happen when Andy(John Morris) does go to college and decide the fate of his beloved childhood playthings.<br /> Andy's Mom(Laurie Metcalfe) and sister, Molly(Beatrice Miller) are dealing with this rite of passage, helping him decide what to take, and what to leave behind.<br /> In the meantime, Andy's toys, which have been neglected for a considerable amount of time, are desperately stooping to subterfuge just to get Andy to pay attention  to them and even to just hold them again after so many years.<br /> We learn that some of the family have departed--the penguin, Wheezy and Woody's beloved Bo Peep having been lost to new owners in yard sales.The precious play things have been forced to regroup, and have adapted sufficently to the situation by now, but are still confined to a box. Woody, however, may be slated to go to college with his owner.Anticipating  that they will be discarded rather than given away, the little green soldiers(with R. Lee Ermey as their sergeant) depart.<br /> But soon the group, including Jessie( Joan Cusack), Mr. Potato Head(Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head( Estelle Harris)Slinky, (Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney), the three Aliens( Jeff Pidgeon),Bullseye(Frank Welker), Hamm(John Ratzenberger), and Rex(Wallace Shawn) mistakenly end up at a daycare center, where they encounter Stretch the Octopus(Whoopi Goldberg), Molly's former Barbie doll(Jodi Benson) who was intended for the nursery school, Barbie's dim-witted clothing fanatic counterpart, Ken(Michael Keaton),Big Baby,Chuckles the Clown(Bud Luckey) and last but not least, the intially friendly but eventually sinister Lots-O-Huggin' Bear(Ned Beatty).<br /> The new arrivals are overwhelmed by the onslaught of small children, and ask to be placed in the room with the slightly older charges. But the menacing Lotso refuses and through means of intimidation plans to keep them in their place.<br /> Having left one eye behind at Andy's house. Mrs. Potato head discovers that their arrival at the nursery school was  a mistake, and eventually, after some misgivings, conspire to return home. A temporary separation from the gang results in Woody's encounter with a young charge named Bonnie, (Emily Hahn) who takes him home, and places him in her room with Trixie, the toy Triceratops(Kristen Schaal),the porcupine Mr. Pricklepants(Timothy Dalton) and the purple-haired Dolly(Bonnie Hunt).<br /> Chuckles explains how and why Lotso came to be the twisted character that he became, and despite having the toys under marshall law in the afterhours , and some potentially harrowing experiences, we know Andy's toys will always find a way back to their owner, and that anyone who stands in their way will end up where they do not want to be.<br /> In watching this, I have recalled how a girl I once babysat thought her Ken Doll was stupid, and I wonder if my now-grown former charge had a hand in making this film. But Ken's shortcomings, and support from allies such as the Chatter Telephone(Teddy Newton)--a toy I had when I was young,  combine to tip the balance in the toys' favor. We even learn along they way, that Buzz has a Spanish mode(Javier Fernandez Pena)!<br /> If Andy only knew what his toys went through to stay with him over the years!<br /> Well, all good things must come to and end, and this tale  deals with the realities of growing up, and moving on, with one last fling with friends for old time's sake. As the trilogy gently reaches its poignant conclusion which can make grown men mist over, we leave this beloved ensemble in very good hands.</p></body></html>

I challenge you to watch this movie just once, all the way through, not stopping and backing up to check out details, and figure out all the ways in which the illusions were created. I'm going to have to watch it another couple of times myself.<br /><br />Quite apart from the absolutely brilliant plot, the actors and actresses, the costumes, the settings, all are just wonderful.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays illusionist Eisenheim, and Jessica Biel plays the aristocratic young Sofia, whom he had loved as a child. But she was a titled lady, and he was the son of a cabinet-maker who made furniture for her family. They were forcibly separated, but not before he gave her a locket which opened in a secret way to reveal a picture of him. Keep your eye on that locket.<br /><br />The Crown Prince comes to one of Eisenheim's performances, and when the illusionist calls for a volunteer who "is not afraid of death," the prince volunteers Sofia. She recognizes Eisenheim as the young man she once loved, but does not reveal this to the audience. He asks "Have we ever met?" as part of the act, and she says no. Then he does his illusion of standing her in front of a mirror, the image in the mirror is murdered, but she is OK. Great show!<br /><br />Sofia is supposed to marry Crown Prince Leopold, whom she does not love. But Leopold has revealed some of his darkest secrets to her, so if she will not marry him, she must die.<br /><br />From there, I refuse to give away anything. You will have too much fun working it out. Now I think I'll go watch it again and see if I can add it all up.</p></body></html>

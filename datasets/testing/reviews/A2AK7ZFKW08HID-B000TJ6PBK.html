<meta name="summary" content="Another Great Stephen King Adaptation!"></head><body><p>I unlike many of Stephen Kings book lovers enjoy most of the movies based on his books. This one is no exception. I really enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson in this movie, he is kind of creepy. Love the blu ray version with the alternate ending.</p></body></html>

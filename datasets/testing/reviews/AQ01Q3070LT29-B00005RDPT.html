<meta name="summary" content="Devoted to 1960 version.  Shaobo Qin is the scene stealer."></head><body><p>I always wanted them to make a remake of Ocean's Eleven.  When I heard George Clooney wanted to do it, I was excited.  Saw it in the theater.  Well, I did not like Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Bernie Mac.  But I did like George Clooney, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould and Shaobo Qin.  Cameo appearances of Angie Dickinson (!) and Henry Silva (both in the 1960 film) was fantastic.  Other cameo appearances were Eydie Gorme, Wayne Newton, Jerry Wientraub, and Sigfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn.  Steve Lawerance has a cameo too but I could not see him in the Full Screen version.  Thank God for Elvis Presley music.  I'm still devoted to the original Ocean's Eleven (1960), but if they made a sequel to this 2001 version, I would probably watch it. I disliked the ending of this version.  Shaobo Qin is certainly a scene stealer, isn't he.  If they make a sequel I hope Qin is in it too.  Like the original film, this was filmed in Las Vegas too.  That's the way it should be.

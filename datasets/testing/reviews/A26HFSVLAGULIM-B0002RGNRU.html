<meta name="summary" content="DR. MIERZWIAK says "TECHNICALLY SPEAKING - IT IS BRAIN DAMAGE" - BUT ITS A SUPERB DRAMA!"></head><body><p>Jim Carrey does very well in this highly unusual drama. If you are considering purchasing this DVD, go with the 2-disk "Special Edition".<br /><br />MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE FILM:<br /><br />The chronology of this film is unconventionally ordered, but it is not just for the sake of being different. I got this DVD for my 16-year-old daughter to watch as she is a big Jim Carrey fan, but I found the movie to be more compelling for me than I expected. Jim Carrey's role was serious and he was superb. The supporting cast, a rather eclectic ensemble were perfect for the role, especially Kate Winslet as Carrey's very weird significant other [Clementine] and Tom Wilkinson as the mad scientist/doctor who appears as staid and perfectly mainstream as everyone's family doctor or dentist. Wilkinson's mundane delivery of really profound statements is shockingly powerful. One instance has Carrey [Joel Barish] asking Wilkinson [Dr.Mierzwiak] if the procedure could cause brain damage to which the good doctor replied blandly, "Technically speaking, it is brain damage, but nothing you will miss; like a night of heavy drinking." The result of all this is a huge and unexpected emotional connection and investment in the characters based completely on a ridiculous premise.<br /><br />So well done is the character driven theme of this movie that I found myself believing that all this was possible while simultaneously wrenching over the pain Joel and Clementine were going through as a result of this relentlessly-irreversible procedure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />The transfer is great, as expected being a mega-budget new release. As far as the features go, I expected much more due to the really intriguing nature of the film. We'll have to settle for a pretend TV commercial featuring Dr. Mierzwiak and his new memory-erasing procedure, a small featurette, and a few deleted scenes. In the new "2-disk Special Edition" we can see some additional cool features but for those of us who already bought the first widescreen or fullscreen DVD release it is a bummer.<br /><br />If you are considering the purchase of this film, go with the 2-Disk "Special Edition" because you'll get DTS stereo audio as well as the additional special features in the bargain.<br /><br />OVERALL:THIS FILM DESERVES REPEATED VIEWINGS<br /><br />My daughter and I have watched this film at least 10 times and we have yet to tire of it. We both feel it is Carrey at his best in a new and very effective role. It is a film that one understands and enjoys more the second time. See what you think!</p></body></html>

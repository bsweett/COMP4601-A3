Halle Berry is terrible, she was trying to imitate Ursula Andress's famous bikini moment. And failed miserably, her acting was of the worst kind. Brosnan looked bored. Of course after the movie came out, he mentioned how that he wasn't going to do another Bond movie unless they focused less of CGI and more on the story. And that's all this movie is, an Ice hotel. Really?!, Really?!, invisible cars. And a fight between two souped up cars, One of the many problem I have is that MI6 has had an agent shadowing the bad guy for awhile. And amazingly she hasn't been able to come up with anything yet, that would raise a red flag with me. And surprise surprise surprise, turns out she's working with the villain all this time. This movie is on the same level as Moon Raker, A view to a Kill. I have to agree, when Brosnan went to cuba. You could tell he was trying to look cool and sexy, but he just came across as old and creepy. No, No, No, this movie is bad. The main plot you ask, why to use a laser in the sky. That's right, a laser in the sky. This was Brosnan's last movie, and I don't really blame him. Halle Berry was NOT, that good. Sorry, a terrible movie.</p></body></html>

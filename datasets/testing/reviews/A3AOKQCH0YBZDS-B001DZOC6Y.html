<meta name="summary" content="M. Night Shyamalan Has Lost His Edge!!"></head><body><p>Okay, I LOVED M. Night Shyamalan's movies "The Sixth Sense" & "Unbreakable" beyond words as both movies were excellent! I've been sorely disappointed with each film M. Night Shyamalan has been associated with since including "Signs", "The Village", & "Lady in The Water"!<br /><br />However, M. Night Shyamalan's end of the world movie/apocalyptic film, "The Happening", has to be his all time worst film to date hands down. The storyline sucked, the acting was lukewarm at best and I found the majority of the characters to be annoying!! The only interesting performance was played by Betty Buckley in her role as Mrs. Jones (the isolated/crazy woman in the middle of nowhere).</p></body></html>

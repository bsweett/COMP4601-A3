<meta name="summary" content="M. Night Shyamalan's bedtime story is not really meant for those of us who get to stay up late"></head><body><p>"Lady in the Water" is M. Night Shyamalan's bedtime story about a lonely apartment building janitor named Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) who lives in a cottage by the swimming pool and who befriends a narf named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard).  A narf is a sea nymph from stories from eastern mythology.  I would say specifically from Korean folklore since what we learn about narfs come Mrs. Choi, Choi being a popular Korean surname, except that Shyamalan made up the narf as a bedtime story he wrote for his children, which he then turned into this film.  So when you go online to learn out more about narfs and the whole mythology behind them, you are not going to find anything.<br /><br />Cleveland knows that somebody is taking unauthorized dips in the pool late at night, but he has never been able to catch them.  Instead when he learns why our mothers told us no running around the pool, he is rescued by Story.  She tells him that she is a narf, but not what that is, so he does some investigating and uncovers what she is up to, which leads to more questions and more investigating, and finally to the need to do something to help Story get back to the Blue World.  However, the problem at the heart of this film is that Cleveland and the residents of the apartment are acting out a bedtime story that they do not know and not knowing it presents problems for figuring out what to do.  Getting people to believe is not particularly a problem in this film; getting them to understand is the fly in the ointment.  Tell people they are caught up in Cinderella and they can figure out who is who (e.g., Leonardo da Vinci is the fairy godmother in "Every After").  Trying to get a show of hands as to who would be part of the Guild and who would be the Guardian is only get to get you blank stares.<br /><br />I know that there are people who totally detested Shyamalan's previous movie, but I liked "The Village," although to be more specific I really liked Howard's performance, which I thought should have been nominated for an Oscar (most people who hated the film readily admitted her performance was excellent).  So it did not surprise me that he would want her in his next film, but Howard is given relatively little to do beyond looking pale and wet.  She might be the title character, but this is Giamatti's film and it is his character that has the big moment, relatively speaking.  Still, "Lady in the Water" is devoid of the memorable moments that I usually find in one of Shyamalan's films.  I had watched his previous four films in the last week to prepare for this one opening today and this is simply the one of those things that is not like the others.  It is probably not going to garner any new fans for Shyamalan, and the serious nose tweaking he gives film critics is not going to institute influencing enemies either.<br /><br />The opening of the film reminds me of the prologue to "Watership Down," in establishing the mythology behind the story we are about to see.  But whereas Richard Adams had a whole series of stories about El-ahrairah, Prince Rainbow and Lord Frith, all Shyamalan has is what we see and hear about here.  Part of the problem is that as soon as you understand what Story is up to it raises all sorts of questions about the past.  Well, okay, it does to me, but probably younger members of the audience will not be as bothered by such nonexistent details, which serves as a reminder of who it was that Shyamalan came up with this for in the first place.</p></body></html>

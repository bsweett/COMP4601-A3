I am aware that there are something like 600 million VCRs in homes across the US and only about 3 million DVD players (*currently) ... however, as a DVD  owner, I feel left out with the release of the INDIANA JONES VHS set.  I  just don't want to spend $30-something on tapes that I'll eventually  replace with a DVD -- whenever it is Lucasfilm releases it!  The Indiana  Jones trilogy are my favorite movies.  I WANT to own them.  But I'm afraid  I must practice patience (or &quot;count to 10&quot; as Indy's pop would  say ... although I think the DVD release is more than &quot;10&quot; away  ...)  My favorite is RAIDERS.  I love the way TEMPLE OF DOOM switches  gears.  And CRUSADE is fun, but ultimately unmemorable.  Now ... if only I  could view them in widescreen DVD (with extras, please, Mr. Lucas!)  tick  ... tick ... tick ...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the first one by far"></head><body><p>I am sometimes a little iffy when it comes to naughty movies. My Christian friends, the most devout among them, are always cautioning me against indulging in what they call the "devil's work".  A gory scarefest like "28 Weeks Later" qualifies, at least in their eyes.<br /><br />But as you regular readers know, I have a checkered past and have run with some pretty hedonistic crowds in my day.  I had to keep it a secret from my church group that I watched "28 Days Later" - which wasn't hard because as a rather blatant amalgam of many superior movies, I was underwhelmed.  Though at least we got a brief glimpse of Cillian Murphy's pee pee.  No such luck with Robert Carlyle in the sequel.  But in every other department this sequel outdoes the original.<br /><br />This was definitely a slow-builder but once it got going, it didn't let up until the end.  It's only 90 minutes long, but feels more like 50 minutes given that the chills and thrills come fast and steady.  Not for the very squeamish.</p></body></html>

The DVD now comes with a pair of 3D glasses, but I watched the standard version...I just don't really care. None of the "Friday" films can be called masterpieces and part 3 isn't much different from it's predecessors, but it's the weakest of the first three films as a result of low-quality acting, dialogue, and story.<br /><br />The first seven minutes serve as a recap of the last film and then we meet characters who we all know will be quickly dispatched by Jason so we can meet all the main characters. Returning director Steve Miner piles on the cheap scares leading up to Jason's first kill.<br /><br />Next we meet a large number of college kids heading out to a cabin in the woods for a weekend stay. Of course, Jason is already awaiting their arrival.<br /><br />No further description of the plot is needed; you all know what happens next. Part 3, as I said, does not differ much from the previous entries...22 minutes into the film we get the stereotypical old man character that warns the kids about the doom that awaits them.<br /><br />There are more problems with it. All of the actors are inexperienced and that's obvious. No one gave an Oscar-caliber performance in the other films either, but here...The actors seem shy and awkward. The dialogue and the delivery of it is atrocious. As if that's not bad enough, the movie has two stoner characters that are completely out of place. They both look about 10 years older than the others and their presence makes no sense.<br /><br />This, however, is the installment where Jason (played by Richard Brooker this time around) got his iconic hockey mask. Good thing too as Jason looks more funny than frightening without it.<br /><br />Most of my complaints about the movie are common for a slasher film. The whole concept of a slasher film is for a group of people to be systematically killed in interesting ways by some maniac, so why does dialogue and acting matter? Well, really, it doesn't. But I just don't see any of the actors, writers, or director having much passion for this project. It seems like they all just wanted to get it over with. It is that factor that makes this the weakest "Friday" up to this point.<br /><br />Luckily, "Friday the 13th: Part Three" does have it's moments of suspense and, for all it's faults, is entertaining. It's not a complete pile of garbage, but there's nothing impressive here.<br /><br />GRADE: C</p></body></html>

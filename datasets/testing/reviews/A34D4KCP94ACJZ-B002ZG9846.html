<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly Entertaining Mix of Action and Humor"></head><body><p>Kick-Ass is based on Mark Millar's 2008 comic book of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134352">the same name</a>.  The story is adapted for the screen by director and producer Matthew Vaughn.  The film comes off as a tongue-in-cheek cross between some of the big budget American comic book based films of recent years and live action anime.  The action scenes, just like the film's many colorful characters and its outstanding soundtrack, ask to be taken seriously enough to care for its characters, but in the end are appealing enough as fiction to provoke the audience to laugh, cheer, and generally stay exciting from beginning to end.  The theater I was in gave a hearty applause to Kick-Ass when it ended, and that was deserved.  After all, who doesn't like it when drug-dealers get taken out by likable underdogs that the audience can generally empathize with.<br /><br />Kick-Ass follows high school age David (Aaron Johnson), an every-teenager who wonders why real-life superheroes don't exist.  This reminds me of a fantastic special on the Science Channel about how Batman could be real, but his life expectancy would be incredibly short, so there's David's answer I suppose.  Anyway, so David settles on becoming a superhero without powers; just a green wetsuit, some batons, a taser, and later some much more heavy duty weapons that would make the US armed forces envious.  Obviously this is a film that asks for some suspension of disbelief but to say David's evolution into superherodome is a hard road is an understatement.  He does meet some very interesting fellow superhero's along the way including Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his little eleven year old girl Mindy, or Hit Girl (Chlo? Grace Moretz).  Hit Girl brings the film's overall appeal to a whole other level and there is no doubt she will be a cult icon in years to come.  She curses at her opponents and then flips and dances around with her weapons in kind of a ballet of vengeance.  Legs are amputated, throats are slashed, and the back of heads are blown out all to the sound of the Dickies version of the Banana Splits Theme Song and Bad Reputation by, who else, the Hit Girls.  Finally, David meets fellow superhero newcomer Red Mist, who is complete with his own vehicle, the Mist Mobile.  Red Mist is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and is of course known most for his role as McLovin in the 2007 comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZEZGI">Superbad</a>, but if he didn't shake off type-casting as a nerdy Live Action Role Player in the underrated 2008 comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OD4S50">Role Models</a>, then he has done so here as Red Mist.  Mark Strong, who made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV6A">Sherlock Holmes</a> a far better film as that film's antagonist, plays this film's antagonist Frank D'Amico, and does a fantastic job in taking his role just seriously enough. He's a great villain no matter the genre.<br /><br />Kick-Ass has perfectly timed humor to hopefully place the violence of the film's action scenes into a different lens for its audience.  It's not easy to defend violence in a movie that is clearly trying not to be taken seriously unless the violence is used as comedy itself, and here that can certainly be argued.  Firstly, in several ways, Kick-Ass is a movie about revenge so the violence has some emotional purpose, however flawed the characters may be for employing it.  Secondly, the violence comes off as a cross between Japanese animation and three stooges slaptick humor.  It is certainly a mix that made me laugh very much.  The humor in the film is also strong in its dialogue and the general actions of its unique characters.  The cast seems to get it and I have no doubt that Mark Millar, who wrote the original comic book, was working very closely with Matthew Vaughn in making this a pure effort with every single detail fully understood.  Everyone working on the film was very likely on the same page.  Highly recommended, especially to those who can really appreciate it, and to those who think it might be kind of a family film because one of its most visible characters is an eleven year old girl, think again.</p></body></html>

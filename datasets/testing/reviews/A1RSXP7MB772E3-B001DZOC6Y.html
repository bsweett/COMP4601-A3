<meta name="summary" content="A Great Mystery/Horror -that lacks the Cinema greatness of earlier films."></head><body><p>It plays to your senses and keeps you under the deep shroud of mystery kin to Nights brilliant "Signs". The comments made by the character, which are otherwise well witnesses to the apocalypse, are sometimes distractingly juvenille, yet never does Night lose track of the eminence and Random quality of danger pulsing through this Dark movie taged as Nights first R-rated Film. It is some accomplishment for a struggling director to Diversify himself into a group of audience limited in its capabilities by law of its Adult rating, and does it benefit from unadulterated suspense and a passionate attempt to be accepted for such by new and old fans? I would say the intent is there yet the zeal and outright pleasure in making cinema has been degraded from my position as audience member. He retains his loyalty to many ingrediants that made him popular and highly regarded, yet that "exact" moment of cinema greatness  is missing here, and from his last picture, "Lady in the Water." But it is a good movie, just not the cinema greatness I anticipate is still in him.</p></body></html>

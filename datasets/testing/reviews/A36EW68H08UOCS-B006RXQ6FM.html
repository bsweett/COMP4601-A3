<meta name="summary" content="How do you bridge the gap between Faith and..."></head><body><p>Religious belief is founded in faith, the condition of believing in something that is unseen by the person of faith. "Doubt" as a concept is the polar opposite, the yin to the yang of faith, but both bound together at the hip like theological Siamese twins.<br /><br />People of faith prize the highest kind of faith - the unshaking, unswavering, unalterable faith that absolutely believes, no matter what.  I saw this kind of faith simplistically depicted in bumper stickers that proclaimed "God said it.  I believe it.  That settles it." But is it okay for a person of faith to have doubt?<br /><br />John Patrick Shanley had already proven his abilities as a writer with, for example, his Oscar-winning script to the delightful "Moonstruck".  In "Doubt" he does double-duty and directs as well.<br /><br />The four principle performers all earned Oscar nominations, and this film is uniformly excellent. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Flynn, a compassionate Priest who opens the film with a sermon on exactly the topic of Doubt.  We learn that the man allows a place for doubt within his faith.  St. Nicholas is a grade school in Father Flynn's parish, and the principal there is Sister Aloysius, played by Meryl Streep, is a humorless nun who not only doesn't allow for any doubt in her beliefs or actions, but also doesn't allow for pretty much any views contrary to her extremely narrow view of the world.  She despises ball-point pens, for example, because you must press harder with a ball-point pen than with fountain pens, and she has an undisguised contempt for those who use ball-point pens - such as Father Flynn.  But the rich screenplay also shows a little of the humane side of Sister Aloysius as she helps and shields an elderly nun who is going blind, fearing that the poor dear will be put out to pasture if her disappearing sight is discovered.  None of the characters are one dimensional.<br /><br />Amy Adams is superb as Sister James, a bright young nun who teaches history and withers before the stern gaze of Sister Aloysius.<br /><br />At this Brooklyn Catholic school young Donald Miller enrolls.  Donald is African-American and doesn't quite fit in.  The staff take particular note of young Mr. Miller - not wanting to single him out for good or bad, but also wanting to make him feel welcome as in 1964 a young black man may not be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the all-white school.  Father Flynn in particular seems to encourage Donald, and in an early scene Donald confides that he aspires to become a priest as well.<br /><br />Sister James sees something... or does she?  She recognizes that what she has observed is circumstantial at best - Donald was called out of class to the rectory, and she is certain that she smells alcohol on his breath when he returns.<br /><br />Sister James dutifully informs Sister Aloysius, and the stern headmistress is absolutely certain - with no doubt - of the worst thing this can imply about ball-point pen-using Father Flynn.<br /><br />Father Flynn is confronted in a series of sensational scenes by Sister Aloysius, pleading not only his innocence, but also a "how DARE you even THINK such a thing" attitude that adds...doubt... in the eyes of the audience.  But Father Flynn knows that a public accusation such as the one Sister Aloysius is certain of would ruin him.  What Priest could recover from a scandal with an altar boy, even if he could be "cleared" in an investigation?<br /><br />Viola Davis also earned an Oscar nomination as the boy's mother.  She sees the school as a way for Donald to escape both the neighborhood and her own abusive husband.  If the Priest is kind to the boy, why should she have doubt?<br /><br />The dialogue is razor sharp and as good as Shanley's script is, his words are helped immensely by the delivery and the body language of the remarkable cast.  The academy award for adapted screenplay went to "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9KR8U">Slumdog Millionaire</a>", and I thought that film was excellent (as evidenced by my 5-star review), but I find this script a cut above. Not a tawdry story about a degenerate Priest, this is instead a story about the dichotomies that exist between moral rigidity and compassion, moral certainty and doubt, with a rich understory about the gap between the haves and have-nots, exemplified by Viola Davis as the woman who is willing to accept the possibility that a priest may be taking advantage of her son, as long as it gives the boy a possible road out of the nowhere world of their neighborhood.</p></body></html>

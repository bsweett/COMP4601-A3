<meta name="summary" content="Creepy, In A Good Way - Recommended"></head><body><p>This remake of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WJDA">The Crazies</a> does a great job setting the mood right from the beginning and was able to sustain the level of suspense fairly successfully all the way through to the end. I like zombie themed movies and also enjoy escape movies, so this was a good fit for me, despite the occasional "slasher" elements.<br /><br />No plote spoilers from me: The story unfolds in an idealistic farming community where life is predictable and everyone knows everyone, in short a place I would like live. When a seemingly random divergence from the norm occurs, quickly followed by odd (and deranged) behavior by normally upstanding citizens, the small town sheriff (well acted by Olyphant) and his deputy (Anderson) begin to investigate the connections between the events. Add to this a very wholesome and loving relationship between the sheriff and his doctor wife (Mitchell), and you start to care about the three main characters. The pace of the movie changes quickly when the military arrives to contain the situation and it did keep me in an uneasy state (which is good for a horror movie).<br /><br />I have watched this three or four times now and still find it enjoyable.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="alice in awesome land"></head><body><p>I had absolutely no idea Alice in Wonderland was so... dark, twisted, highly unusual and hypnotically colorful, haha.<br /><br />You see I never actually watched the original animated version because I was under the impression this was a Disney film intended exclusively for *girls* so I completely avoided it for years.  A blonde-haired little girl stumbles across a bizarre fantasy land, makes friends with many of the people, and instantly changes into a much bigger giant girl simply by drinking or eating something magical?  Yeah... not exactly what I would have considered a *cool* movie.<br /><br />Well, that all changed last night.  Hey, anything with Johnny Depp must be at least decent, right?  Well yeah... but it deserves a higher compliment than being tagged as simply "decent".  It's a really exciting adventure that's honestly a bit darker and more complex than I originally thought...<br /><br />That is, assuming this movie is exactly how the animated version goes storyline-wise.  I have no idea how different it really is to that (or any other generally accepted *official* version).<br /><br />The only thing I really know is that the animations and many unusual effects featured in this particular version of the popular childrens story are extremely psychadelically enchantingly... bizarre, haha.  No other possible way for me to describe its many vibrant layers of eye candy.<br /><br />I know one thing for sure- most of the characters are downright uniquely strange or ugly.  Talking soldier frogs?  A cat with magical disappearing abilities?  A queen that's unbearably unattractive?  A beautiful exceptionally white angel creature?  Two chubby vulnerable twin boys?  An oranged-haired joker... whatever he is (Depp's character).  A bloodhound that talks?  Oh, and who can possibly forget the extremely awesome demonic creature that just appears out of nowhere and attacks the good people of the land?  That is one really dark moment of fairy tale storytelling, and I won't dare spoil his reason for existing or what happens.<br /><br />Hmmm, now I really have to sit and wonder just what kind of person this film was intended for all along.  Children?  Well I suppose it would HAVE to be a childrens movie.  Whatever the case- the delicious smell of fabric softener coming through my living room vents from the dryer and washing machine in the basement below is making me feel really fruity and happy.  Maybe NOW is a good time to give Alice in Wonderland another shot and appreciate it in the way originally intended.  Here we go!</p></body></html>

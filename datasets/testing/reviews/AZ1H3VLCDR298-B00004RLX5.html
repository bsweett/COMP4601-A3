<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, but where the heck is the extras?"></head><body><p>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is the considered to be the best trek film, and for good reason. After 2 dark films, this one is a light comic fantasy, with great character interaction and laugh-out-loud situations the characters find themselves in. But I am here to review the DVD, so you all can make an intellegent decision on whether to buy it or not. The ONLY feature is a documentary that you can find on the VHS version, so there is nothing new here. The only reason I can think of for Trek fans to shell out their wallets on this is because of digital picture. The sound quality is not that good either, it sounds much better on the Wrath of Khan DVD. Hopefully Paramount will release a more loaded version later, but now if you already own this on VHS it won't be a major improvement.</p></body></html>

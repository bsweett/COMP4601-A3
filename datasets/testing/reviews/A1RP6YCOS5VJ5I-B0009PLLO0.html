Even though Colin and some of the others aren't Greek, the cast is still perfect. I love biographical films and this is one of the best I have seen dealing with the subject of ancient times.<br /><br />This film has been given so many negative reviews that it didn't deserve. 'Alexander' is definitely excellent compared to some movies that Hollywood has been putting out recently. The scenery to the story itself is beautiful. There are moments that are truly breath-taking. The visuals of the film are complemented with the music score that really does set the mood for the film and matches the scenes perfectly. 'Alexander', in it's entirety, is definitely something to see.</p></body></html>

But my friend said it was very good, and she brought it over for us to watch.  I am so glad I gave it a chance.  Sandra Bullock is wonderful as a woman who is living a week in which every morning she wakes up to a different reality.  Everyone else - her mother, her kids, her girlfriend - seems to know what is going on except her.  She even seems to begin to ride the weirdness a little until the occurence of more sinister events.  There is a mysterious prescription bottle in her sink.  Is she losing her mind or is this a warning?  Even if it is a warning, how can she get out of the cycle if she can't get off the merry go round?<br /><br />Chilling thriller with a surprisingly warm ending.  No, it is not what you think; not predictable at all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Great Science Fiction Films Of All Time"></head><body><p>Amazon.com's reviewer's excellent review of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; covers all the bases about this superlative science fiction film; my own review can't be nearly as thoughtful. Surely &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; inspired the great space operas which followed in the 1960's and beyond, from &quot;Star Trek&quot; to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, and indeed, &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Leslie Nielsen's Commander J. J. Adams is clearly the archetype for Captain James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. His relationship with the ship's doctor, Lieutenant &quot;Doc&quot; Ostrow (Warren Stevens - who later appeared on a classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode.) clearly presages Kirk's relationship with Dr. McCoy. This science fiction adaptation of Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; may not have the same literary quality as its predecessor, but it is nonetheless a spellbinding tale about a mad scientist whose uncontrolled emotions wreaks havoc on his adopted planet and Commander Adams' starship. Walter Pidgeon is spectacular as Dr. Mobius, the film's version of Prospero; both Nielsen and Warren are fine as the ship's captain and doctor, respectively. The soundtrack with its theremin score is widely regarded as a classic of science fiction music. Without question, this film is an absolute must for fans of science fiction cinema.</p></body></html>

This is Pixar's first film after winning the Oscar for their previous film "The Incredibles". This is cute, funny, and heartwarming. John Lasseter's (this is the fourth Pixar pic that Lasseter has directed) directing and Joe Ranft's (who the film is dedicated to) co-directing is excellent! The story by Ranft and Jorgen Klubien (who has also been involved with Pixar's 3 recent films "A Bug's Life" (1998), "Toy Story 2" (1999) & "Monsters, Inc." (2001) and the screenplay by Phil Lorin, Dan Fogelman, and Kiel Murray (who has also been involved with Pixar's 2 recent films "Finding Nemo" (2003) & "The Incredibles" (2004) is excellent! The music by Randy Newman (who won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 2001 for "Monsters, Inc.") is excellent! The film editing by Ken Schretzmann (who has been involved with 2 Pixar films "Toy Story 2" & "Monsters, Inc.") is excellent! The visual design of the film is beautiful and one of the best that I have seen in an CGI-animated film, even from Pixar.</p></body></html>

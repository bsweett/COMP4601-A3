<meta name="summary" content="One of the most polarizing films in recent years"></head><body><p>Earlier this year, I had the opportunity (or misfortune) to watch Shortbus, a sexually frank film that was meant to be a huge study and deconstruction of people's perceptions of sex but really, it was just a message film with a bad story attached to it. The Fountain was most likely made to be an art film; a film that was meant to be studied and dissected and debated about a la 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Matrix. While these films are meant to be admired for the amount of attention and passion put into it, that doesn't automatically make it a film that deserves heaps of praise or at least from everyone.<br /><br />In the first of 3 of interconnected storylines, Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is a medical doctor and researcher looking to cure brain tumors. This is an extremely personal case since his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz) suffers from a brain tumor. Izzy is writing a book entitled the Fountain, a period piece about the Conquistador Tomas who is sent on a mission by the Queen of Spain to find the Tree of Life in the Mayan civilization so she can use it to restore glory to Spain since an evil Inquisitor has been causing trouble. In the third storyline taking place about 400 years in the future, a bald Jackman is travelling through space in a bubble which houses a tree as he travels to a dying star, said to be the gateway to the Mayan underworld. Shifting back and forth, we see the passion and determination of how far one goes for love.<br /><br />Now I have to give props where it's due: this is one lush and gorgeous film. Probably the bulk of that praise goes to the future segment done largely by macrophotography. Even though the idea of a bubble spaceship will elicit laughter, it just looks fantastic and was probably quite a sight on the big screen (our stupid theatre never showed it here). The rest of the film is as good from Spain and Old Spain with the present day segment looking the most "normal". The problem is, like how I felt about 2001, is that the film seems too...cold, kind of clinical as if the character's emotional journey is an important one but the way it's presented as a detached quality. Some will definately disagree and say it is but that's the basis of the film: everyone will walk away with different ideas of what they just saw which becomes a slight problem.<br /><br />The problem is that this film wants to be important and studied that it almost has a calculated approach, like they know they're making an important film and this is something for people who truly get it. This is meant to create discussion. "Is there a Tree of Life? Does love last forever? Is the Spanish segment Tommy and Izzy's past life? Did Tommy find the Tree of Life and is travelling through space? All in his head? Can 2 and 2 really equal five? Dude." I thought Requiem of a Dream was a technically better film than it was emotionally. The Fountain isn't as bad as that but some might walk away feeling like they saw a technically outstanding film but a little bit too pretentious for its own good.<br /><br />Even if you might have conflicting views about its story, you got to admit the acting is pretty spot-on. While best known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men films, Jackman is practically on fire here playing his character with such emotion and drive that it reaffirms this guy is one to watch. And while probably the more subtle, Weisz is excellent as Izzy and Isobel (the Spanish Queen) and you really believe someone would hunt to the ends of Earth and Space to be with her again. The rest of the cast, namely Ellen Burstyn, are good but you don't really know much about them and probably will forget their names. But ultimately this is Jackman and Weisz's movie and they deliver in spades.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with a negative or positive review, this is a film everyone should at least see once.</p></body></html>

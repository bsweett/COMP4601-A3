The Pianist is one of his most celebrated films, winning 3 Academy Awards including one for Polanski as Best Director. It also won the Palme d'or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002. The Pianist is a Holocaust film, based on the autobiography of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski survived the Holocaust and this was obviously a personal project for him; I think his personal history is (for once) relevant to the film, because his background makes him very aware of the Holocaust and the horrors that accompanied it.<br /><br />The film begins in Warsaw, 1939 as Great Britain declares war on Nazi Germany. Wladyslaw "Wladek" Szpilman, a highly lauded pianist and his Jewish family see their happy existence crumble around them, as Germany's invasion of Poland is well under way.. They're required to wear armbands identifying themselves as Jews and soon are evacuated from Warsaw into a Jewish district.<br /><br />There's not much more that needs to be said about the plot. Unlike many Holocaust movies, The Pianist gives a very in-depth look at the day-to-day life of Jews in the Jewish ghettos. What makes this so impactful is the way Polanski lets the story unfold. We know where the story is going, while Szpilman and his family do not...Yet, we're just as shocked as they are when things go from bad to worse. Don't think from what I've said that The Pianist is just another history lesson...There's a deeply human, intriguing story that draws you in and can be quite suspenseful.<br /><br />The film itself is incredibly well-made and I applaud Polanski for re-visiting the unspeakable horrors that he lived through. There are scenes that are shockingly horrifying and they are filmed with an unflinching honesty. Polanski almost always keeps his camera detached from the action, making the audience feel like a helpless onlooker. In one of the film's most devastating scenes, Wladek is separated from his family as they're put on a train to what will be certain death. It's not only fantastic on a cinematic level, but an emotional one as well.<br /><br />Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance as Wladek and he really did deserve it. He gives a believable, low-key performance completely without ego or bravado. Its perfection and power come from how human it is and his ability to never seem like he's acting. Brody IS Wladek Szpilman in this film.<br /><br />Movies don't come more powerful than this film. It's a beautiful, heart-breaking, suspenseful film with one of the decade's greatest performances and one of the world's greatest directors.<br />There's a scene towards the end that is one of the most profound and powerful in the entire film...And it's just a man playing piano. It's a perfect example of how thoroughly Brody portrays Wladek, but also a testament to what an amazing director Polanski is. The Pianist is one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, but it's also one of the greatest films ever made. It's an absolute triumph that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

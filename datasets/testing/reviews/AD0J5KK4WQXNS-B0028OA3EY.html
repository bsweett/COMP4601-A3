No, it's a flying cheesy emotional wreck"></head><body><p>Over the years, gosh since maybe around the time of the first Matrix movie, magazines have been abuzz with how Hollywood is trying to script a new Superman. Screenplays where rejected and revised more than you or I have had hot dinners. Nicolas Cage was touted to play the man in red underwear. Then everything went flat. Spiderman came out and ruled. So naturally we waited for Hollywood to pump out the one that started it all. Summer 2006, Superman is here, and starts with an introduction where we get the same title effects of the 70s version with some CGI planets thrown in. All is looking good until Kevin Spacey stands around for minutes on end, looking old & bald, and saying "Wait for it" while nothing much impressive happens. The Marlin Brando scenes we all heard about do not exist except for a brief 5 second screen image that is superimposed on a crystal... and that is it. Superman returns from his debacle across the cosmos because he heard his planet had been spotted. Lois Lane has a kid. Kent goes to work in the Daily Planet. There is a power cut and Superman saves a plane from crashing, the best special effect in the movie is 20 min into the film! Between the twiddling-of-your-fingers, Kevin Spacey saying "Wait", and Superman sulking about Lois having a kid, you want something to happen and it does... Superman flies with Lois around the world to violin music. At the point you know something has gone terribly wrong and you know the direction that Singer is taking you. You will not be wasting your time getting up and going to watch X3 instead in the other screen. Secretly I just wanted Superman to let Lois fall. Heck, anything to just keep us awake. After the violin-playing flying around, Lois meets Lex Luther and he tells her that is going to take over the world by creating a super sized country in the ocean. There is then a terrible plot twist involving children that will make you balk, scenes with a plane flying around and a shipwreck just to have Superman pull people out of a sinking vessel (what was that all about???) and then a Superman Lex fight sequence involving kryptonite that begs to ask why Superman didn't detect something sooner. And it is not as if the Superman Returns makers thought much out either... this is a thorough no-brainer with many "what" questions asked, between Spacey's "wait" from start to finish. Even fans of Superman I, II and III will be scratching their heads. Not since Ang Lee's The Hulk has there been such a mess of the Superhero franchise. Thank God for Sam Raimi and Spiderman. Even Batman Begins got the emotional balance right. Sadly Singer's Superman Returns is a terrible, terrible, terrible untidiness, a wasted Kevin Spacey and asks us to just eat up whatever is slapped onto the canvas. And 3 hours of it. Give me a break. I want Superman, not Supersulk! This isn't what we waited 20-30 years for! I feel like Kathy Bates in Mysery and want to stand up and shout at the screen! Very Sadly, instead of preventing the trainwreck, Superman just became one.</p></body></html>

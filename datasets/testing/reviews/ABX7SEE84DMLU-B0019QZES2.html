<meta name="summary" content="Love Dustin and Barbra"></head><body><p>I agree with a reviewer below - the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand made this movie incredibly funny.<br /><br />The first movie was OK, but kept mining the "surveillance" vein until it kind of stopped being funny.  Here, having Dustin and Barbra for DeNiro to play off is a master stroke.<br /><br />I also like Ben Stiller quite a bit.  I think that he has a very expressive face and really has fun with what he's doing.<br /><br />Must admit, though, that I thought Stiller and Meara were funnier.  Does that betray my age??</p></body></html>

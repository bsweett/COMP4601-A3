I didn't hate 12, but it really wasn't that good.  13 is a better movie than 12, but it does not live up to the original.  The story line is very similar to the first movie, the characters have lost their freshness, and none of them seem to be used enough.  This is an enjoyable movie to watch, and I did laugh at the striking Mexican scenario.  But there are some gaping plot holes and not enough magic to make this picture a winner despite some tremendous star power.  Rent this one.</p></body></html>

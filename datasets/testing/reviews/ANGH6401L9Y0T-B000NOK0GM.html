Seems amazing that this is my first encounter with so famous a movie and/or book. Anyway, I recognized the theme music.<br /><br />Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna just in time to catch the funeral of his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Lime's girlfriend Anna (an actress named Vallei) is at the funeral, and Martins ends up involved with her life for a variety of reasons, among them the fact that her passport (she's Czech) was forged by Lime. Since Vienna is ruled by a four-nation coalition of Americans, British, French and Russians, the Russians want to repatriate her, treating her as a member of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />But there's more. Martins soon begins to suspect that Lime's death was not an accident, especially since different witnesses give different accounts of what happened the night he was killed. The title "The Third Man" relates to the fact that one witness said there were three men who carried him to the sidewalk after being hit by a truck, whereas the other witnesses say there were two.<br /><br />Next, he discovers that the police are searching for an associate of Lime's that disappeared a couple of weeks earlier, and everyone keeps telling Martins to go back to the states and not get involved. Involved in what? He's just trying to find out how his friend died. But the more he probes, the more he discovers that there's a lot more here than a simple accident, or even a murder.<br /><br />Nothing is what it seems at first in this movie. Nothing, really nothing. Good guys, bad guys, motives, even real facts. There's very little I can add without telling you too much. I think you will find the ending unexpected no matter how closely you pay attention. But that's fine; it's worth seeing twice to catch what you missed.</p></body></html>

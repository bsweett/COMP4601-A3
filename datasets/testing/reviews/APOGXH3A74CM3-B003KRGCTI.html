The grittiness of this film pulled me in from the very beginning.  The post apocalyptic wasteland that Eli travels through gives the film a cutting edginess, as does the action.<br /><br />Top notch acting, and an intriguing story.  It was the ending that really took me by surprise, so much so I ended up watching this a second time wondering how I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />One of the best films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />"I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see."<br /><br />One premise of the film is interesting to ponder:  can faith be the cause of an apocalypse?  or is it the source of salvation?<br /><br />"Both thorns and thistles shall bring forth, for us, for out of the ground we were taken for the dust that we are... and to the dust we shall return."<br /><br />Eli did fight the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith.  It's up to us to decide if that's a good thing, and if it matters.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a more complete movie than the first"></head><body><p>while i gave the first movie perfect marks for sheer entertainment,this sequel is actually a more complete film,in my opinion,as much as this type of movie can be.for one,the story is actually much more interesting and more developed.the humour quotient is upped in this one as well.there are quite a few chuckles.some of the transformers are really neat,especially on the Decepticon side.the fight scenes between the Transformers are quite spectacular,though that isn't surprising.what is surprising is that the transformation scenes(when the vehicles change into their robot forms and vice versa were not seamless,and looked herky jerky to me.in the original film,this was not an issue.still,it's immensely entertaining.and despite a few minor issue.a better movie overall.as an aside,the movie is nominated for a Razzie Award for worst movie,which mystifies me.it's nowhere near Razzie calibre.oh,well.for me,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a 5/5</p></body></html>

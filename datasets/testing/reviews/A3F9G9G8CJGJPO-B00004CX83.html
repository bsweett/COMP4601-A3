Gotham's mayor tasks district attorney Harvey Dent with finding a way to make the city safe again, in hopes of revitalizing local business. Dent, in turn, targets notorious, well-known mob boss Carl Grissom, who is believed to sponsor most of the criminal activity within Gotham and who is known to be paying off a significant part of the police force.<br /><br />  Gotham, meanwhile, is slowly starting to take notice of a dark vigilante dressed in a bat costume that has started to prey on criminals during the night. The movie actually opens on a lost family that gets robbed by two hoodlums. Batman confronts the two thieves and instructs one of them to tell all his friends about him. Newspaper reporter Alexander Knox is on the scene after Batman disappears, but his questions are deflected by skeptical cops, nameley Lt. Eckhardt, who is one of many police offers on take from Grissom. Eckhardt is paid off in a back alley near the crime scene by Jack Napier, Grissom's second in command, who is both intelligent and erratic - leading Eckhardt to call him "nuts". (In fact, Napier has very psychopathic and strange tendencies, such as carrying around a "lucky deck" of cards, which, of course, includes a joker.)<br /><br />  When Grissom discovers that his girlfriend is cheating on him with Napier, he sends Napier out on a job to Axis Chemicals with the intention of Napier being discovered and killed by police, who he has tipped off to the job. Eckhardt and police arrive at Axis and begin a shootout with Napier and his goons. Unbeknowst to both, Batman is there to personally apprehend Napier - but must release him when a hostage (Police Commissioner Gordon) is held at gunpoint. Soon after, Napier kills Eckhardt. Later in the scene, Batman again tries to apprehend Napier, but a gunshot ricochet hits Napier in the face. Napier falls over a railing and is caught at the last moment by Batman, as Napier hovers above a vat of dangerous chemicals. Batman's grip slips and Napier falls into the vat, presumably dead. Batman escapes the scene.<br /><br />  Batman, as we discover, is actually billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne, an orphaned businessman who lives along in the large mansion Wayne Manor, with only his trustworthy butler Alfred to accompany him and help him in his double life. Bruce quickly falls for photojournalist Vicki Vale, who has recently arrived in town to cover the "Bat Man phenomenon" and has attracted Knox's attention as well. Bruce is successful in courting Vale, and the two spend a passionate night together in the mansion.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, Napier pulls himself from a local river where Axis's pipes drain. Obviously wounded but unsure of what happened, he visits a backalley surgeon, who does what he can to help Napier but is honest in his evaluation: "You have to understand that the nerves were completely severed, Mr. Napier." Napier sees his new disfigured reflection in a mirror (while the audience does not), and, at that moment, goes off the deep end. He confronts Grissom, who thinks him dead, revealing his new appearance, with eerie white skin, green hair and a permanent grin. Referring himself as the Joker, he claims "Jack is dead" then shoots Grissom and vows to take attention away from Batman with his "plans" for Gotham.<br /><br />  The Joker begins to overtake the underworld, while Gotham is unsure what to think of him or Batman. The Joker's plan, and a successful one in that, is to use his knowledge of chemistry to create hygiene products that are dangerous when mixed. His plan begins to grapple the city with fear. The Joker then crashes in on the Gotham Museum of Art and tries to entice Vicki Vale to join him romantically, as he saw her in a photograph and was immediately smitten. Batman arrives and saves Vicki, and then explains to her how the Joker is poisoning people through combinations of products. Vicki is unsure of what to think, as many still believe Batman himself to be frightening and just as dangerous as the Joker. Dismissing her worries, he calls the Joker "psychotic" and renders her unconscious then drops her back off safely at home. At home, she is then confronted by Bruce, unaware that he just saved her life. She is upset at him for various reasons but the two are interrupted by a visit from the Joker, who is intrigued by being face-to-face with billionaire Bruce Wayne. After Bruce challenges the Joker to a stand-up fight, the Joker pulls a gun and asks: "Tell me something, friend. Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?" He then shoots Wayne dead. The Joker then leaves amid his own hoopla, and Vicki is shocked to see that Bruce is suddenly nowhere to be found, apparently using a metal platter as a bulletproof vest, as he anticipated the Joker would shoot him.<br /><br />  What Bruce has discovered is that the Joker is actually Jack Napier, and that he is also the man who murdered his parents many, many years ago in Gotham. The final clue was that his parents' murderer said the same phrase to him as the Joker said in Vick's apartment ("Ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?") While grappling with this fact, he is schocked to learn that Alfred has brought Vicki to the Batcave, as he is tired of Bruce's secrecy around her.<br /><br />  The Joker decides to pull a huge stunt, hosting his own nighttime parade and throwing free money out to the crowd. Vicki is there to photograph the pandemonium. In the middle of his generosity, however, the Joker begins to gas the crowd and kill dozens of people - while his thug associates are unharmed because of their gas masks. Batman shows up flying his bat-shaped jet and lifts the parade balloons away - as they are the source of the gas. Furious, the Joker shoots and kills his number one thug, Bob, then baits Batman into attacking him, but manages to shoot down the jet with a powerful gun. Vicki approaches the downed jet, where Batman appears to be dead. The Joker finds her and leads her into Gotham Cathedral at gunpoint, where the two begin to climb the many treacherous flights of stairs to the top, where the Joker plans on being rescued via helicopter by his thugs. Batman is not dead, however, and starts to follow them, though he is obviously wounded and dazed from the violent crash. Despite some challenges, Batman manages to finally confront the Joker mono a mono in the belfry and attack him. The two then angrily explain how the created each other and were, therefore, to blame.<br /><br />  Batman: "I'm going to kill you." Joker: "You IDIOT. You made me, remember? You dropped me into that vat of chemicals. That wasn't an easy thing to get over, and don't think I didn't try." Batman: "I know you did." (throws him) Batman: "I made you? You made me first." Joker: "What are you talking about?" Batman: "You killed my parents."<br /><br />  The Joker uses a moment of oppurtunity and pushes both Batman and Vicki off the belfry, where they cling to the ledge for their lives. The Joker's helicopter appears and he grabs a hold of a dangling ladder. Batman shoots a wire around the Joker's leg, then connects the wire to a stone gargoyle on the ledge. As the Joker is lifted away, his attached wire pulls the gargoyle loose and then causes him to fall to his death. Batman saves Vicki once again at the end, and the two are peaceful in each other's embrace. As the movie ends, Commissioner Gordon says that Batman has given the city a signal (the Batsignal) to contact him when need be.<br /><br />  Trivia:(1)Adam West (the star of the TV series "Batman") wanted to play Batman, but Michael Keaton was given the role after getting the nod from Bob Kane, the creator of the original Batman comic strip.(2)In the film, Jack Napier, aka the Joker, is the murderer of Batman's parents. In the comics, the murderer is a character named Joe Chill.(3)It is claimed that Adam West was offered a cameo as Bruce Wayne's father but turned it down, though West denies being offered the part.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bram Stoker say what?"></head><body><p>It's been a while since I've seen VAN HELSING, and I guess time does sometimes foster a different perspective. Seems that, over the years, my ill will towards this film has waned some, to the extent that I actually enjoyed watching this action horror film, just now, just now. And I've always thought this film was less soulless than, say, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, perhaps Sean Connery's most irredeemable flick. Anyway, this is a mixed message sort of review.<br /><br />Some say he's a holy man. Others paint him a murderer. I guess even Bram Stoker got it wrong. What this Van Helsing is, is a legendary monster hunter, and he works covertly under the auspices of the Vatican. His latest mission dispatches him to the remote fastness of Romania, the Mecca for frightful supernatural beasties. There, Van Helsing will hunt his most formidable quarry: Count Dracula. He also meets lovely Anna Valerious, the last in line of a damned family that had sworn to kill Dracula and barred from Heaven until that deed is done. Cue the spectacular action and CG. Cue the dreary plot. And if you can justify the cohabitation of the cool action with the plodding story, then good on you. I have lowered the bar, I've learned to adjust, and I do like the film better now. I still can't say the same for Connery's folly.<br /><br />On one hand, if you've enjoyed those old-school Universal horror flicks featuring Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Werewolf, one draw may be that this movie strives at an homage to them. Each of these terrifying monsters plays a role. On that same hand, if you like your Kate Beckinsale, well, she's here and sporting a funky Romanian accent. On the other hand, the nerve-deadening storyline puts a damper on things; it trudges along. And dear, winsome Kate - while she does her best - could only do so much with her underwritten role. She and Hugh Jackman exhibit the rapport of two dandruff flakes languishing on a poor sap's shoulder.<br /><br />I mentioned that the action is spectacular, and it is. But even the action in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was pretty cool. VAN HELSING is so determined to jump from one CG-driven action spectacle to another that it abandons good storytelling in its wake. VAN HELSING is flash and style with not much substance, pulse-pounding stunts with no refinement. And, yeah, I know, sometimes it doesn't matter that the script is weak because the f/x and the fighty fights are just that good. But, man, when the script is this weak and ponderous? And, I guess, it comes down, too, to the acting performances... and I'm eyeing Hugh Jackman now. This guy has shown natural charm and wit before (his awesome opening number at the Oscars is just one example). But, as Van Helsing, Jackman is so relentlessly dour and wooden, we don't get a chance to glimpse his true personality. So, to boil it down, this flick is Van Helsing pretty much tangling with the usual rolodex of feature creatures, and there's also a half-formed romance with Beckinsale. If you like your fighty fights, this'll do ya.<br /><br />On the plus side, I thought that Van Helsing's assistant, Carl, was a fun character. Carl is pretty much the sole fount of humor here.<br /><br />There are some pretty robust special features on this DVD: 2 feature commentaries; "Explore Dracula's Castle" takes you on a 360 degree tour of several of VAN HELSING's sets; "The Legend of Van Helsing" is a rundown of the character as portrayed in films; "Bringing the Monsters to Life" focuses on the Industrial Light & Magic folks, as they, thru pencil sketches and digital composition, reveal how the monsters were crafted; "You Are In the Movie" grants the viewer the actor's perspective, thanks to strategically placed miniature cameras; "Play the Van Helsing Game" - the DVD pops into your Xbox and allows you to play the game's first level; the movie trailers; and 5 and a half minutes of goofy outtakes ("I give you...Van Halen!").</p></body></html>

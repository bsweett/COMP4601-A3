<meta name="summary" content="Great performances somewhat well told"></head><body><p>As you can tell by the 300 other reviews here, this version of the Aileen Wournos story doesn't tell the whole truth. If that's what you're looking for you need to view one of the many biographs on the serial killer.<br /><br />If you want to see Charlize Theron's monster performance (and makeup) of this real life "Monster", this movie will do the job for you. With the help of some magnificent makeup artistry, pretty girl Theron transformed herself into a trailer trash hooker for this flick. She was well abetted by an equally strong performance by another pretty girl, Christina Ricci, who plays her best bud and lover.<br /><br />If I was a state of Florida official I wouldn't be too happy with the way the Sunshine State is portrayed in this movie. It sure doesn't look like the place everyone east of the Mississippi River aspires to retire to!<br /><br />But the main reason to rent or buy this is to see Theron's once in a lifetime performance. She probably equals the transformation Cliff Robertson made playing a mentally retarded man in the 1968 film "Charly", another tour de force that won an Oscar. People that think great actors are made and not born might want to think again after viewing this movie for Theron sure is a different animal that the one she played in previous movies.</p></body></html>

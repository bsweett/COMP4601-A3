Lee's tremendous success with the remake of The Ring led him to embrace the "if it ain't broke, fix it anyway" philosophy wholeheartedly. A check on his IMDB page shows no fewer than seventeen projects either completed or in production, the majority of them being American remakes of Japanese films (mostly horror, but Hideo Nakata's brilliant mystery Chaos is represented as well). But the bottom line is that if all of Lee's upcoming projects are as well-done as The Ring and The Grudge, folks have nothing at all to worry about.<br /><br />Takashi Shimizu directs the remake of his own Ju-On, translated by Stephen Susco (whose next project is Lucky McKee's adaptation of Jack Ketchum's novel Red, another "can't-wait-to-see-this" movie), and for all intents and purposes, all that was done was replace some of the main actors with Americans. Some of the actors from the original film also reprise their roles here (most notably Takako Fuji as Kayako), while other, better-known Japanese actors dropped into some roles for the remake (most notably Ryo Ishibashi, who gained recognition on this side of the pond as the lead in Takashi Miike's Audition). What you end up with is an above-average cast featuring some actors who really don't get enough exposure in American cinema (Grace Zabriskie, whose role here is understated and chilling in the extreme, for example).<br /><br />Because the original director reprised his role this time, The Grudge bears far more of a resemblance to the original than did The Ring. Still, it bears looking at as its own movie, rather than as a remake, and it is quite a lovely thing to behold-- the horror of the film comes not so much from the events as from the incredible attention to detail and the overall atmosphere of the thing. Definitely worth your time. ****</p></body></html>

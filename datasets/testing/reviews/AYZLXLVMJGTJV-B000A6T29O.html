<meta name="summary" content="Luxurious Sets and High Action Stunts Performed by Ms. Jolie"></head><body><p>Basically my title says it all, this is mainly why the movie was so good. The sets were some of the best I've seen and her toys were even better than some of James Bonds gadgets. She in fact reminded me of a girl James Bond. Her accent is really very good too,, reminded me of Gwyneth Paltrows. The stunts were great and what is really great is that Angelina Jolie did them all without a body double. I really like her fearless energy and it comes across on film as it does in real life. The storyline was not really great and pretty one dimensional with no real subplots and romance was practically nil but what made it a winner was the richness of design and the beauty of Jolie. A worthwhile video to view. <p>Lisa Nary</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tour de Force for all involved"></head><body><p>One of the better movies I have watched recently, this film managed to pull off dead serious and uproariously funny at the same time, and most importantly, kept me entertained throughout.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is both vulnerably awkward and gorgeous at the same time as she stumbles her way through her employment with the ever-demanding Meryl Streep as her boss.  Stanley Tucci also adds some tragi-comic flair to the mix, and the supporting cast supports without getting in the way.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film resonated with me well because its underlying theme is work-life balance, an issue with which I struggle on a daily basis.  The gag reel was also amusing, and the deleted scenes contained some interesting material that didn't make the final cut.<br /><br />The only thing keeping this from getting a resounding 5 stars is pacing.  While I was consistently entertained by the film, the filmmakers could have shaved another 10 minutes from the film and further tightened it without the viewer missing anything.  The most effective sequences are the quick-cut portions showing the day-to-day similarities of Meryl Streep's systematic abuse of power, and in my opinion, several longer sequences could have been similarly intercut as a sort of "running gag," which would have increased the comedic effect and shortened a movie whose premise wears out its welcome slightly before the denouement.<br /><br />Otherwise, a very entertaining film with a fine cast.</p></body></html>

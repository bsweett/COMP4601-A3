<meta name="summary" content="A strong movie"></head><body><p>"Maria" is a strong movie about drug traficing and the pvoerty in Colombia. Its portrayal of the characters are real and never stoop to the level of lecturing the viewer. The acting is great, especially for a group of unknow actors. A real winner of foreign cinema.</p></body></html>

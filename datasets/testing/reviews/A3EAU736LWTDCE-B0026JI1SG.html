<meta name="summary" content="Nice to see a movie with an atypical outcome"></head><body><p>I had not heard much about this movie before seeing it (other than the fact it had Clint Eastwood in it, and it was about boxing) When this movie starts off, you think it is going to be a "Rocky", "Cinderella man" or a "Karate Kid" type of movie (you know the ones, where the underdog is being bullied until they finally rise to stardom) Boy, was I surprised which direction this one went. I like movies with atypical outcomes. So that was a breath of fresh air. I also like old Shakespearian style tragedies, so this movie was right up my ally. Everyone has already talked about the movie synopsis in their reviews; I will just get to the point:<br /><br />Verdict: Very good movie, definitely worth watching. The characters are well developed, the story keeps you interested form beginning to end, and all the actors did a very good job. Its not a very "happy" movie though (meaning it might not be for everyone, especially teens and younger kids, or anyone who gets depressed easily) Still a good movie though.<br /><br />My only MINOR complaints are as follows. (1) I like Clint Eastwood, so don't get me wrong here (I have been watching him since he was dirty hairy and in movies like "the good the bad and the ugly") I just think he is getting a little bit too old to be acting. I'm NOT saying his acting was bad in this movie. He just seemed to be straining a lot to talk, as if he is struggling to say his lines (at times he was even hard to understand). He is an excellent writer, and getting into writing was the wisest choice he has made in his career. He is just getting a little old to be playing the tough guy roll. (2) Once again, the movie was good, but I would have liked to seen a more developed ending. It had a little bit of a rushed feeling to it, and it is a little more open ended than I like. The ending seems a bit abrupt; you will find yourself saying "well what happened next?" I guess you could say the story was good enough to where you just wanted another chapter to see what happened to everyone.</p></body></html>

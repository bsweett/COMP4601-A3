That's what I wanted to ask when this one came out in theaters. Some movies are better if no sequels were made. This one obviously wanted to make more money when the script is really not as interesting and funny as the first one. Apparently, Renee Zellwegger got paid like twenty times more money for this film than the first. The hundreds of donuts, cheese cakes and pizzas she had to eat to gain the 30lbs really showed in this film. She's very "striking" in one scene when she wore a tight fitting gold colour evening gown. Talk about the waistline of BJ. Well, we got to give the American Texan the credit for the stunning transformation, and the British accent is still right on.<br /><br />So we know that she found the love of her life in BJ Diary. Colin Firth reprises the role of Mark Darcy, the future husband of BJ,since they have moved in together. Their relationship looks picture perfect at first, but jealousy and insecurity took over BJ's mind when she mistaken him for cheating with a tall and beautiful assistant. Bridget gets pregnant, and Darcy was very happy and decided to propose to her. Then Daniel(Hugh Grant) reappeared in BJ's life, and they spent some time together in a journalism partnership in Thailand. Bridget's life is at a chaotic state when she was mistaken by the customs for carrying drugs in her luggage, and who will bail her out before she faces possible imprisonment.....<br /><br />There's many attempts on jokes in this movie. They did Madonna's Like A Virgin and Material Girl in the prison scenes, but it didn't provoke much laughters like BJ did when she did All By Myself in the first film. Darcy and Daniel also get to have a man-to-man fight over BJ again, but we know Daniel is not the man for Bridget, because her heart belongs Darcy.<br /><br />Hugh Grant had limited screentime here, and didn't have much chemistry with Zellwegger. Colin Firth is good as a calm and sophisticated high class gentleman/lawyer(a true ladies man). As for Renee Zellwegger, she's tried her best at being funny, and touching while maintaining her British persona, but the role has lost it's zest compared to the first BJ. Hopefully we won't have to see her playing overweight and English again for a while.</p></body></html>

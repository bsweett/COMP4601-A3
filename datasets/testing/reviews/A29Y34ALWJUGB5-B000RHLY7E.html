<meta name="summary" content="A Gooey Mess"></head><body><p>I appreciated Rob Zombie's attempt at reincarnating the '70s--which may have been the best decade when it comes to horror flicks--with his first movie House of 1000 Thousand Corpses. That movie was strange, but fun and a little more than just creepy. But Rob should have quit there.<br /><br />Firstly, this movie seems to be on constant rewind, as you hear and see the same things over and over again, i.e. curse words and brutal, senseless (plot-wise) killing. The blood is computer generated in most scenes, and you can tell easily, especially when the wound begins to wobble out of place. And to add to that, there really isn't a conflict worth mentioning. Yeah, the killers are the bad guys, but they're also the main characters. They're on the run from the law, but why aren't they running? I mean, they stay in the same general area the whole movie. If the conflict was the run/chase, then apparently the writer (Rob Zombie himself) didn't get the memo. Sometime while watching this movie, I began to think the cop was the main protagonist, but that can't be true considering the movie doesn't end with him, but with the killers. So in the end, a lot of what happens was just pointless; The Devil's Rejects is a gooey mess of a movie that's more out to gross you out than scare you.<br /><br />A few other things that bothered me about the movie was, a) the predictability--the last ten minutes are practically spelled out for you-- b) the fact that some elements from the past movie was conveniently left out (i.e. the underground creatures), and c) the characters weren't unique, with only a couple differences to separate them; they all swore like truckers, they're all bad-a**es, all of them are mentally unstable, and none of them blink at the sight of death. The only difference is the on/off switch that the killers don't have when it comes to murder.<br /><br />The movie does have a few good things going for it. As a gross-out movie, it easily achieves its purpose. The setting match the times of the movie (the '70s) almost perfectly. The sound track was pretty decent as well. And the one-liners delivered by Spaulding are as funny as they were in the first, and Spaulding himself is excellently acted despite everything. Plus, the DVD has bloopers, something that always attracts me to DVDs.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie unless you like gross-out movies, or if you really, really enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses. This just isn't a movie that has to be seen and one that fails at almost every point to present some sort of a well-plotted story.</p></body></html>

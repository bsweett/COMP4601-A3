After successfully reviving his `Rocky' franchise with the most recent, and supposed final chapter, "Rocky Balboa", Stallone indicated that he felt he should give fans another hefty dose of mayhem in the form of John Rambo, largely due to feeling like he had left fans a little disappointed by the events of the third film (though I still enjoyed it). Displaying that he is more than just an over-the-hill action star, Sylvester Stallone wrote the story for the newest installment in the `Rambo' franchise, simply titled "Rambo", along with directing and starring in the film, and take it from me he delivers on all counts with this film.<br /><br />"Rambo" picks up approximately 20 years after the events in "Rambo 3", as John Rambo is living out his life operating a longboat along the Salween River in Northern Thailand. However, Rambo's quiet existence has just been interrupted when a Christian missionary group arrives, seeking Rambo's help in crossing the border into war-ravaged Burma. Reluctantly, Rambo agrees to assist the missionaries with the understanding that he would merely be dropping them off into the country and nothing more, but when the group is captured by the ruthless Nationalist Army that controls the area, John Rambo must once more wreak havoc on those that would attack the innocent, and attempt to rescue the prisoners, no matter the cost.<br /><br />For me, "Rambo" is a welcome return from Hollywood exile for an iconic action hero that knows how to get the job done and get it done right. His return, though much more violent than the previous three films, was extremely triumphant in my eyes. Many critics, not surprisingly, felt the movie was brainless, featuring overly simplistic villains, average to below average acting, and so much gratuitous violence that it would possibly make Quentin Tarentino (director of the extremely violent `Kill Bill' movies) turn away. I don't know why the critics hated this movie so much, I felt that this movie was just as good, if not better, than the first and second films, and definitely better than the third film which was good but not as great as its predecessors.<br /><br />The acting was solid, and was exactly what I expected from a movie such as this, it's not like anyone went into the movie looking to hand out Oscars to the cast or anything like that, and to me, Sylvester Stallone ("Rocky Balboa") handled Rambo perfectly. From his steely gaze, world weary outlook, and his no-fuss, never quit attitude, Stallone delivered to audiences a performance that was realistic for that character, making him seem more in line with the all-business attitude the character had in the first two films, yet seemed to have less of with the one-liner spewing persona in "Rambo 3". The supporting cast that comprised the team of mercenaries assisting Rambo on his mission were essentially character actors that I'd seen before, though I couldn't really place them in anything specific; regardless, each actor played their individual characters with a ruthlessness and thirst for money and violence that fit perfectly with their characters' lot in life. The missionaries that Rambo assists are led by a man named Michael, played by Paul Schulze (TV's "The Sopranos"), who comes off as a weak man who can't see the harsh reality in front of him until it's too late, and he seemed to possess a rather off-putting holier-than-thou mentality that is doesn't fit in with the self-less work of a missionary. Portraying the other main member of the missionary group is actress Julie Benz ("The Punisher: War Zone") who portrays her character of Sarah as a woman whose warmth can melt even the coldest heart, and her compassion for others is a true testament to her faith in humanity and God above, a true representation of the missionary spirit.<br /><br />The story for "Rambo" was a well-conceived, hard-hitting, and extremely fast-paced return for the title character, and Stallone along with co-writer Art Monterastelli ("The Hunted") easily silence all the nay-sayers that said another `Rambo' movie would never work for today's audiences. The characters are well-written and in some cases are given a surprising amount of depth for an action movie. Now, I'll admit that some of the characters are not as developed as others; but then again, this is an action movie, not some heavy dramatic Oscar contender, so what do you expect? As far as the excessive action of the story is concerned, I don't feel that it was any more gratuitous or over-the-top than any other action movie these days, and to me, I thought that the action was very realistic and necessary given the circumstances of the movie. Plus, I'm sure if someone was to go back and look at past reviews of those critics that ripped "Rambo" for being overly violent, you would find that these very same critics most likely praised the excessive, extremely bloody, and senseless violence of the two `Kill Bill' films, so I wouldn't take their comments in that regard too seriously.<br /><br />"Rambo" is a superbly triumphant return for America's jaded action hero, John Rambo. Full of enough action to keep even the most ardent of action junkies satisfied, along with surprisingly well-written characters and dialogue for an action movie, and not to mention the film was also able to shed some light on the disturbing reality that exists over in Burma or Myanmar, or whatever it's actually called. Overall, "Rambo" delivers audiences a pulse-pounding sequel that easily lives up to the excitement and adventure of its predecessors and possibly surpasses them all in the end.<br /><br />"Rambo" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></body></html>

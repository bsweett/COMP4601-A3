Unfortunately Hollywood execs don't have the cajones to front a big budget Horror movie unless it can guarantee an initial curiosity from moviegoers.  Cue the current remake trend.<br /><br />The original Dawn is considered by many Horror fans to be a masterpiece(yours truly included); it's an emissary from the Golden Age of Gore.  Amazingly the 2004 version updates the original without coming off as cheap or a cop-out.  It works because it plays the Horror straight.  There isn't a big push to infuse humor(although it's there, don't worry), the Horror is center stage and omnipressent.<br /><br />First and foremost the focus is the survival situation. I love the scene where Sarah Polley's character just drives by a woman pleading for help. Instinct has kicked in, self preservation is all there is.  As you watch you get the feeling that each character is acting as they should.  That in itself is a rarity in Horror films.<br /><br />Second is the saving grace for this film and that's the excessive gore.  One of, if not the key elements of the original Dawn was its gore fx (from genius Tom Savini).  This remake really sets a new standard for big budget gore, as in its:<br /><br />A. realistic enough to make you ask "How'd they do that?"<br /><br />B. presented as something new<br /><br />This movie succeeds on both levels and after watching it you will never look at a truck backing up the same way again.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead was not only one of 2004's best surprises it was one of the year's best moviegoing experiences.  Highlighted by an impressive cast including Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, and the exremely underappreciated Jake Weber, Dawn of the Dead provides non-stop action and genuinely frightful moments.  Watch the original and then watch this.<br /><br />P.S. Don't forget to sit through the credits!!!</p></body></html>

Pretty much everyone I know makes multiple references to it in just about every work-related conversation I've had. One it started showing up in commercials, I figured it was time to get around to seeing it. And while I didn't think it was awful, I have to wonder what those who say "if you've worked in this environment, you'll think this is the funniest movie ever" were smoking when they saw it. It's mildly amusing, but nothing special.<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock for seven years, the plot: Peter Gibbons (Standoff's Ron Livingston), a drone at a large corporation, is just living day to day, doing nothing but working, obsessed with Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), a waitress at the local sports bar, with his only social interaction outside the workplace being with his somewhat psychotic neighbor Lawrence (well-known voice actor Diedrich Bader) when they talk through the thin walls of their condos. The company brings in a pair of efficiency experts, Bob (John C. McGinley) and Bob (Paul Wilson), and something snaps; Gibbons decides to simply neglect his job. Needless to say, the second he does this, his supervisor, Bill (Gary Cole) calls for his head, and the efficiency experts decide he needs to be promoted to upper management. And things just get weirder from there.<br /><br />It's not a bad film, really-- I just don't think it lives up to the incredible hype that it's now almost impossible to see this movie without experiencing. You will likely be told that it's the best thing since sliced bread, and that if you don't find it the funniest movie you've ever seen, you just don't get it. Not true. Remember, Mike Judge is the guy behind Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill; if you were never a fan, this probably isn't going to change your mind. Still, it is true that if you work in an office environment, you'll either identify with or recognize a lot of these people, and that goes a long way towards redeeming some of the jokes that don't quite cut it. ** ?</p></body></html>

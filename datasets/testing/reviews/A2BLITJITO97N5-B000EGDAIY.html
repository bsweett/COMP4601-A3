I should have learned my lesson years ago that I should ignore the critics and pay attention to moviegoers reviews on online sites. This movie has about two pages of plot which is dragged out for a full length movie. It isn't scary. The creepy atmosphere gets tedious as the plot doesn't move along. The supposedly scary moments are old hat and just get boring with repetition. A loser.</p></body></html>

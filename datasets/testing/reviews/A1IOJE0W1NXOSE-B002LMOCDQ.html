Sophie has never known who her father is and in an attempt to find out she does a bit of detective work via her mom's diary.  She discovers that there are three men who potentially could be her dad, and she invites them all to the wedding unbeknowst to her mother.<br /><br />Watching Meryl Streep and her two buddies recreate their old singing group or Meryl Streep singing to her daughter who is about to be wed will take you from cheers to tears.  Streep's acting abilities translate beautifully to her singing, whether it's a teary-eyed mother reminiscing about her daughter's childhood or a feisty middle-aged woman leading the other local women in a rousing Abba song.  This movie is just plain fun, so watch it and enjoy!</p></body></html>

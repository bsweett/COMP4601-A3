Altman does a great job with the material. The direction was timely and well-paced. The acting was good. Streep had the northern plains accent down. Woody Harrelson was funny. Lily Tomlin who played Streeps's sister did not have the accent down. However, she did well. Garrison played himself rather well. The major problem I had was the plot. The movie had Guy Noir as the head of security. Kevin Klein played him well, but the character was too stupid. Even in the skits on the show, Noir's cases were silly, but he wasn't a total idiot. There was an angel of death, which worked in spots but on the whole was confusing. One of the better scenes involved the angel. When the angel was still mortal, she died when she lost control while she was driving because she laughing at a joke while listening to "A Prairie Home Companion."  She didn't even understand why the joke was funny. She and Garrison talked about why the joke was funny. The scene was pure "Prairie Home." The best of the movie for me was the beginning. Altman does his thing of rapidly switching between different characters and plot lines. The humor of the conversations were hilarious. The effort the producer exerts to get Garrison on stage in time was hilarious. The bad joke song was very good too.<br /><br />I recommend the movie. Keep your expectations low and just let the humor come to you. The movie really works most of the time. Just don't expect the plot to make sense.</p></body></html>

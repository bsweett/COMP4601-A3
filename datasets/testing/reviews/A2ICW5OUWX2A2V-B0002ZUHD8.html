<meta name="summary" content="Eh, it's OK"></head><body><p>Wow, instead of noble King Arthur wearing a crown sitting in a white castle amongst green fields, we have a roman general fighting braveheart like warriors in Britan.  Interesting eh?<br /><br />I never saw King Arthur in theaters, and I was not really interested in seeing it anyway.  When it came out on DVD I decided to take a look.<br /><br />Early on I was quite suprised with the movie.  It had an interesting start, and the early battles were interesting (if a bit long).  The scenery was gorgeous and the story was moving along quite well.  All seemed good and true, but after the halfway mark had passed, I actually began to loose interest in the movie.  Not even huge battles could really get my interest back.<br /><br />I think that the main problem with King Arthur is that it kind of goes on too long.  This being an unrated directors cut, there are apparently several minutes of battles and gore put back into the movie that were apparently cut out for the theatrical release.  To be honest, the new battle scenes dont really add much.  They also make the battle scenes go on and on to the point where a battle that should last at the most, five minnutes soon stretches out to ten minutes of non-stop chopping, hacking and slicing.  Well, it may not be ten minutes, but it felt that way.  When the final battle came on, it just kept going and going and going.  By the end of it I was actually bored!  I kept thinking, "Come on, get it over with."  Not a good sign.  At that point, I didint care about the heroes or if they would win or not.<br /><br />So in my opinion, the biggest problem with the movie is that the battle scenes need to be trimmed down.  From my experience in film classes, you need to keep a battle as short as possible instead of dragging it out.  It would also have helped to have some overhead shots showing all the soldiers fighting by the thousands.  Those would have really helped make the battles more interesting.<br /><br />Oh wait, theres the rest of the movie to review?  OK.  The scenery, props and costuming department really shine in this movie.  The scenery of Britan is absaloutly gorgeous, to the point where I'd like to take a vacation to visit some of the locales.  The costumes feel really authentic (well, except for the much talked about leather brassiere) and make the movie more believable.  I also must mention the great ice battle sequence, which was a refreshingly origianal take on "How can seven guys hold off seven hundred guys?".  The acting was on the whole, mediocre.  The only charachter I was really interested in was the main bad guy (who is never named in the movie), who spends most of his time killing people and frowning.<br /><br />Personaly, I found the idea for the film being set in roman times with Arthur as a Roman general to be fascinating.  We've all heard and read about how Arthur was the romantic gentlemen.  Here, he's a figher with morals and beliefs, and to enforce those beliefs, he often has to slice and dice.  I won't get into how historically accurate this setting is, but I find it quite refreshing.<br /><br />So in the end, this movie is simply OK.  It's not great, it's not awful, it's just a middle of the road, average movie that with some more improvments, could have been really good.</p></body></html>

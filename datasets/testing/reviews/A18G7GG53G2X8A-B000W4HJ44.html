<meta name="summary" content=""Hairspray" is the Word"></head><body><p>"Hairspray" is full-blown entertainment, a fun-filled musical comedy that pulls no punches when it comes to spectacle. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, and I have no doubt that anyone who sees it will feel the same way. Here's a film that truly knows how to make the audience feel good, thanks to some notable talents: Marc Shaiman's soulful music is upbeat and infectious; leads like John Travolta, Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Queen Latifah give performances perfectly suited for this kind of story; David Gropman's production design, Rita Ryack's costume designs, and Judi Cooper-Sealy's hair designs make for an absolutely dead on look. This film--and you'll pardon the pun--hits all the right notes. I expected nothing less from a film adaptation of a Tony winning musical play, which itself is based on the 1988 film written and directed by John Waters.<br /><br />Taking place in Baltimore in the year 1962, "Hairspray" tells a story that's equal parts humor, heart, and social commentary, all of which are strung together through song. The main character is Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a big-haired teenager who dreams of making a name for herself, despite being overweight. She also dreams of a Baltimore that doesn't segregate because of skin color. Overcoming adversity is not a new to storytelling, but it certainly is relatable, which is probably why we root for this character so passionately. As she sings "Good Morning, Baltimore"--the opening song--her strong resolve practically flies off of the screen, filling us with the kind of admiration usually reserved for older, more experienced people. Nonetheless, she is a teenager at heart, as seen with her devotion to "The Corny Collins Show," an energetic (and segregated) music variety program hosted by the aptly named Corny Collins (James Marsden).<br /><br />Tracy auditions for the show, only to face the wrath of Velma von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), the deliciously wicked station manager. She would rather die than see this fat, pro-integration young girl dance on "Corny Collins"; not only would it spoil the station's reputation, it would also mean new competition for her bratty daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow), who's aiming to win the upcoming Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant. In realizing the situation, Tracy decides to organize a protest march. Offering their full support are Seaweed Stubbs (Elijah Kelley) and his mother, Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah), who also hosts the once monthly Negro Day on "Corny Collins." This aspect of the story was interesting, mostly because the seriousness of the Civil Rights Movement was successfully given a light-hearted spin. It was in no way offensive--if anything, its message was made even clearer.<br /><br />A number of subplots weave their way through the film. One of the most important involves Tracy's mother, Edna, perfectly played by John Travolta. There's a refreshing complexity to this character that I wasn't expecting; she's a housebound laundress who uses her weight as an excuse to hold herself back. But with the love of her husband, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), and with a little help from Tracy, a newfound self-esteem begins to emerge. One of the film's most enjoyable scenes is of Edna's fashion makeover, a highly choreographed number that shows her in her best light. This character could have easily been a joke; the reality is that a male actor had to sing and dance in drag while wearing a fat suit. Fortunately, Travolta so thoroughly disappears into his role that any degree of phoniness is overshadowed. Edna Turnblad is a silly character that I wholeheartedly believed in.<br /><br />Another subplot involves Link Larkin (Zac Efron), a regular on "Corny Collins" and a teen heartthrob in every sense. Initially an item with Amber, the young singer/dancer finds himself drawn to Tracy after she joins the show. Of course, Tracy is absolutely wild about Link, with his slick black hair, his Elvis-inspired dance moves, and his romantic singing voice. Why else would she have a picture of him inside her school locker? Her puppy love comes across during "I Can Hear the Bells," a delightfully na?ve song which documents her future with Link. Listening to her sing is her best friend, Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), a peppy young girl who constantly sucks on a lollipop. She eventually takes part in her own subplot; she and Seaweed begin an interracial romance, much to the dismay of her ridiculously traditional mother, Prudy (Allison Janney).<br /><br />All this and more make for a film that's begging to be experienced. "Hairspray" is a nonstop good time, filled to the brim with energy and soul. Every character, every song, and every dance step work together flawlessly, and I just couldn't keep myself from smiling. I loved everything about it, from the performances to the music to the story. I have the feeling this will someday become a classic among American musicals, a beloved treasure of the same caliber as "Grease."</p></body></html>

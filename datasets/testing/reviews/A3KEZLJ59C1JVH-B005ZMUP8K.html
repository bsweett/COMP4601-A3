<meta name="summary" content=""Pirates of the Caribbean: Attack of the Giant Squid!""></head><body><p>Wow. I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed with a movie. I want to preface this review by stating that I absolutely ADORED the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film, and I've been anticipating the sequel for years. Now that I've seen it, I almost wish it hadn't been made at all. It was such a letdown!<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with "Dead Man's Chest" is that the plot is incredibly confusing and difficult to follow. There's just too much going on at once. Things get off to a rocky start right from the beginning: at first I thought the opening scene was just a dream sequence or something, but then I realized that it was ACTUALLY HAPPENING. Basically, the movie begins by showing Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) crying in the rain on her wedding day. It seems that her fiance Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) has been arrested by a newly appointed official of the British government, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), for helping the pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape. Elizabeth soon finds herself under arrest as well, and Beckett threatens to hang her and Will unless they agree to coerce Jack into stealing the key to Davy Jones' locker.<br /><br />While all this is going on, Jack and his crew are busy manning the Black Pearl. Jack is stunned to discover that Will's father, the legendary pirate Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) is still alive. Bootstrap reveals that Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is looking for Jack in order to resolve an old debt. Unfortunately for Jack, Davy Jones is basically an undead sea creature/pirate. Yes, that's right: remember how in the last movie Jack was running from a haunted pirate ship that was manned by a crew that turned into skeletons in the moonlight? Well, this time Jack is running from SEA MONSTER PIRATES! I wish I was making this up, but I'm not. Basically, it's "SpongeBob SquarePants" meets "Night of the Living Dead." The costumes and special effects are impressive, but the sea monster pirates are extremely creepy, and not in a good way. Why do the bad guys all have starfish and coral growing out of their faces?! It's so wrong! And if that's not bad enough, Davy Jones commands a giant sea dragon to do his bidding. The sea dragon (basically a Loch Ness Monster/giant squid combo) attacks unsuspecting ships and pulls them to the bottom of the ocean.<br /><br />Are you confused yet? You should be...and I haven't even explained half of the plot yet! I'm not even going to try. I left out a bunch of other random stuff, like the Pygmy tribe that thinks Jack Sparrow is a reincarnated god, the crazy voodoo witch doctor who I couldn't even understand half of the time, and Elizabeth's makeout session with Jack...yes, with Jack! (That last part was pretty funny, though.)<br /><br />The bottom line is, this movie just doesn't flow very well. It's too confusing and I really didn't understand the whole sea monster theme that they have going. There are some good things about the film: the costumes and special effects are amazing and all of the actors delivered outstanding performances, especially Depp. However, the script really sucks, which is such a shame. The jokes weren't all that funny and the storyline was just plain ridiculous at times. I liked the way Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) was worked into the story so well, but even that was ruined for me at the end of the movie. There was hardly any swordfighting in "Dead Man's Chest," and then Jack, Will, and Norrington finally started going at it, but then they jumped on that huge wheel and started rolling around the island and I just couldn't take it anymore. Sigh.<br /><br />Here's how the movie ends: Captain Jack Sparrow is swallowed by the giant squid creature. No, I am not making that up...I wish I was! Jack gets swallowed up and we have to wait until the third "Pirates" movie to see what happens to him. "Dead Man's Chest" was really part one of two...it ends with a big cliffhanger. The one redeeming bit of news at the end is that we learn Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is still alive and will be prominently featured in the next "Pirates" film. (I have no idea how they're going to explain that, since he seemed pretty dead at the end of "The Curse of the Black Pearl," but I guess anything is possible. It almost seems like Barbossa is going to HELP Will and Elizabeth save Jack, which makes absolutely no sense to me at all. Barbossa is supposed to be a VILLAIN! Bill Nighy was fine as Davy Jones/Octopus Man, but another reason "Dead Man's Chest" came up short is because Barbossa wasn't in it.)<br /><br />If you were a fan of the first "Pirates" movie, I'm sure you'll want to see "Dead Man's Chest." Prepare to be disappointed like I was. The movie just didn't do it for me. (It's make a heck of a lot of money at the box office, though, mark my words!)</p></body></html>

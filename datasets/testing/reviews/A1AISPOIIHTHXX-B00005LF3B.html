After the underrated Contact, he focused attention on making a story in which for a good chunk of the movie, there's no dialogue or score. Whereas nowadays he seems more concerned with testing his new expensive toys (CG technology) than combining it with a story which he always did so well. It's not exactly one of the best of his career and if it wasn't for the main performance, it probably wouldn't mean much but that being said, it's good for what they managed to pull off.<br /><br />Chuck Noland is a FedEx employee obsessed with time and making sure packages are delivered in a speedy manner. With a girlfriend, Kelly, he's planning on marrying, life seems alright until a late Christmas delivery has to be made and while en route, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Entirely alone on an empty island, the once time-obsessed Chuck now has too much of it and has to learn how to survive.<br /><br />Cast Away on my first viewing when it first came out was one of those movies that I liked but didn't necessarily love outright. But now and then, there's that desire to re-watch a movie again to refresh your memory or just to see how well it holds up. The film does hold up pretty well and you got to give it to the filmmakers for actually holding our attention for the whole film with no cinema conventions. And credit has to go to Tom Hanks who manages to hold our attention all on his own and even make the scenes where he pretends to talk to a volleyball not feel silly. Plus there's his dramatic weight loss he did to further add to the realism and his Oscar nom was well deserved.<br /><br />If there's some scenes that bring the film down slightly are the non-island scenes where he's about to leave and when he returns home. It's necessary to show his life and daily activities before he gets stranded but you still feel slight cutting down was in order. The post-island scenes are also polarizing since they do feel different and almost alien-feeling to the island but with the film at a relatively healthy 2 h 15 minutes sans credit, it feels like it does take awhile before we get to the ending though I like how it leaves on a slightly ambiguous note.<br /><br />With a terrifying plane crash sequence, a compelling middle section though slightly inferior bookends, the film is good though because the film is better that doesn't make it amazing but considering what it could've been, I'm glad it's this way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The movie proof should have been burned with the wicker man, just bad"></head><body><p>Wow, this is just about the worst movie I have seen all year.  The only nicolas cage movie that is worse in 8mm.  Wow this is bad.  If somebody remade the original thinking that they could make it better, then I'd hate to see the original 1975 movie, it must be horrific, or else this director botched this up bad. Cage plays a cop who comes to investigate the missing daughter of his old fiancee.  The minute he reads the letter, you know it's also his daughter. But, the ignorant man doesn't pick up on that until his ex lets him know 40 minutes into the movie. Also, any man that would stay 5 minutes on that Estrogen laden Island without thinking it was wierd....Come on, how stupid can you be.  Finally, he hung around even after the plane radio was smashed up and transport of the island was limited....how many clues does this guy need to say hey, forget it, something is fishy here.  Nope.  The dope deserved to burn for being the most ignorant gullable person alive.  Thank goodness a guy like this isn't a superhero like spiderman...his spidey sense is broken.  If you just want to see a bad movie, con a friend into renting this.</p></body></html>

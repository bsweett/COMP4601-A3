<meta name="summary" content="An unfulfilled love story"></head><body><p>The cinematographically spectacular film "Atonement" was a marvelous adaptation of the passionate Ian McEwan novel set in 1930's pre-war England.  The onset of the film is set in a majestic English countryside estate where the privileged Tallis family reside.  Young sister Briony, a talented writer, played impressively by Saoirse Ronan is immaturely competing for the affections of James McAvoy playing Robbie Turner, son of the family housekeeper with her older sister Cecilia played by Keira Knightley.  McAvoy had been mentored by the Tallis family, sent to Cambridge and about to enter medical school.  The subdued relationship between Knightley and McAvoy smoldered during a erotic lovemaking scene in the library unfortunately witnessed by the jealous Briony.  The smitten 13 year old had her revenge by unjustly implicating McAvoy for a sexual assault on her cousin Lola who had been staying at the estate.  McAvoy is dragged away from the tender embrace of Knightley to prison in handcuffs.<br /><br />The film then fast forwards four years to Northern France where McAvoy and two mates are trudging through the fields retreating to the amazingly filmed mad pandemonium of Dunkirk.  Released from prison to fight in the army, McAvoy and Knightley, a London based nurse still communicate and pine for each other.  Briony now a nurse in training realizes the tragedy her lies have spawned, separating the two lovers. She tries to make ammends and re-establish communication with her sister.  Using flashbacks and flashforwards the story plays out though the chewed up battlefields of Europe and bomb plagued streets of London.<br /><br />The conclusion of this film reveals that an aged Briony played by Vanessa Redgrave an accomplished and prolific author is touting her ultimate novel and lifelong labor "Atonement". She fills in the blanks of this tear jerker love story and her regrets of the effects of her actions.<br /><br />Kudos to McAvoy whose portrayal of the humble, disgraced Robbie should propel him in stardom.  The magnificent cinematography of Seamus MacGarvey using a variety of English filming locations combined with a dedicated screenplay by Christopher Hampton combined to make "Atonement" a surefire Best Picture candidate.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Witty and Entertaining"></head><body><p>Writer/Director/Actor Mike Binder has crafted a smart, witty, and emotional film with "The Upside of Anger." Joan Allen shines as Terry Wolfmeyer in a part written especially for her. Kevin Costner is superb as Denny Davies, an ex-baseball player (does he portray anyone else?), turned radio VJ. Kerri Russell, Evan Rachel Wood, Alicia Witt, and Erika Christensen are all perfectly cast as Terry's gorgeous daughters.<br /><br />The script was wonderful with its perfect blend of comedy and sadness. These were real people experiencing the trials and tribulations of everyday life in an accurate portrait of suburbia. This is definitely not a studio film that portrays the perfect people living in a  perfect world. It is a terrific portrait of a real American family told through biting comedy and drama.<br /><br />I liked these characters because they were not designed to be likable -- or, more precisely, because they were likable in spite of being exasperating, unorganized, self-destructive and impervious to good advice. That would be true of most people I know, including myself, so I appreciated them.<br /><br />Despite a few minor `holes,' this was a a wonderfully made comedy of domestic manners and quite possibly one of the best films of the year. Many people walked out of the theatre, so it is not for all tastes, but those who appreciate a great script and some fine acting should it a chance. I will never forget this movie.</p></body></html>

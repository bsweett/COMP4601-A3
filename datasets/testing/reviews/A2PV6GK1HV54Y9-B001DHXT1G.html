<meta name="summary" content="Better than Hulk."></head><body><p>The Incredible Hulk is a better version than Ang Lee's Hulk which was released a few years ago. This particular movie is more lively and exciting but it is not a perfect action flick. Edward Norton and Liv Tyler make a lovely couple as Bruce and Betty and William Hurt is pretty flawless in terms of acting. Stan Lee makes a cameo apperance while Tom Roth once again steals every scene, he is truly creepy in this. Good solid movie with excellent special effects.</p></body></html>

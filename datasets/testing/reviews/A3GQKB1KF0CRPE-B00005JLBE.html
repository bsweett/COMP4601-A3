<meta name="summary" content="rather surprised by how enjoyable"></head><body><p>I have watched this several times before I wrote anything.  The movie takes repeat viewing well.  Frankly, Bond was, and always will be Sean Connery.  But, time marches on.  We have been through Lazenby, Moore, Dalton and now Brosnan. Each bring their<br />own touch to the role.<p>Pierce is losing his pretty boy look as he ages, a plus in my opinion.  He is finally growing into the new age Bond.  Halle Berry is great as Jinx, naturally gorgeous to look at, but she also brings a much need touch of humour.  Toby Stephans is a strong Bond foe, and his fight scene in the fencing school with Brosnan is one of the highlights of the movie.  Very impressively staged scene that has great tension.  A bit more believability than a lot of the typical Bond action sequences.<p>Sadly, with Q's Desmond Llewelyn passing, you have dry humour in the form of John Cleese assuming the role of the gadget master, who outfits Bond for his cases.  There is a cute homage to the original Connery films with Brosnan tinkering with old props from Thunderball and From Russia With Love.<p>Face it, Bond, like Star Wars is showing it's age.  Neither seem to impress audiences as they once did.  With that in mind, I did not expect this to be a grade A Bond classic.  Brosnan, while doing justice to the role, fails to make it his own, and each film he has done, just fades in my mind, even after watching several times.  <p>This Bond film is fresh, it will stay with me, so basically, I think it's the strongest of Brosnan's efforts.  He really seems to hit his stride in the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very, very, very funny."></head><body><p>Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever designed by a group of men you will ever find from the 20th Century.  The killer bunny, the virgins, the weird prince who wants to sing, the lack of horses for the knights, the Knights who once said Ni.  The movie is full of extras and so is are the DVDs.  Legos, sing-alongs, on-screen screenplay, commentaries full of back-stabbing, complaints and whining by the crew of Month Python.  Looking for a message?  Well, there may be a few, but mostly it was meant to be funny, the kind of funny that burns into your brain and slowly burns its way out, till you laugh aloud on the bus, or at the wedding, or when they are trying to pull a tooth.  The kind of funny that hits you right when you're trying to chew that very hard piece of beef that you think MAY be bone, but you don't wish to spit it out, because that would be bad manners.<br />Well, enough of that.  Just buy it already.  I would also suggest you buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OKQK">Jabberwocky</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305388458">Life of Brian</a> DVDs.  If you don't I'll send a bunny after you.</p></body></html>

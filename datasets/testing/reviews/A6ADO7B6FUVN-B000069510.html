Before the story begins the audience is introduced to the Umbrella Corporation that produces 90% of every home's household products.  However, its large profits are derived from military technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry, which is unknown to the public.  The story begins with Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up with temporary amnesia caused by gas released by the Hive's supercomputer, the Red Queen, as a defense mechanism.  The Hive is a secret underground research complex with an exterior design similar to the form of a virus, which hosts over 500 scientists.  Alice learns through a group of special operatives working for the Umbrella Corporation that she is also a special operative and something has gone wrong in the Hive.  The mission of the group is to find out what went wrong and turn off the Red Queen that has seemed to run amok.  As the group enters the darkened corridors of the Hive they enter a nightmare that submerges them into an agonizing reality of hellish creatures that want to nourish.  Resident Evil is a fast paced horror tale where the unknown is known, yet the moment of surprise will cause nerves to twitch involuntary as it offers a creepy cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

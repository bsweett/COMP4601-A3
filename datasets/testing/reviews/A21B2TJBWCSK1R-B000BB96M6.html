<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's return to form!"></head><body><p>When Johnny Depp and Tim Burton team up to do a movie the results are usually fantastic: Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and to a lesser degree Sleepy Hollow. However, since Planet of the Apes, Burton's films have been missing that certain personal touch - the fascination with darkness mixed with a touch of wonderment - that used to make them so good. Fans keep hoping that his next movie will be a return to form but it hasn't happened yet. So, anticipation was high for Burton's latest, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starring Depp as none other than Willy Wonka. If anybody could successfully tap into Dahl's sensibilities it would be Burton, but could he equal Gene Wilder's memorable and much beloved take in 1971?<br /><br />Depp plays Wonka like a funky mix of the optimistic Ed Wood, the arrested development of Andy Kaufman and the flash of a kids show host. It's a typically off-kilter performance by Depp who proves that his recent foray into big budget movies (Pirates of the Caribbean) hasn't ruined his ability to create memorable characters. Depp's Wonka doesn't really like the kids with the exception of Charlie and barely conceals his contempt for them and this comes out in funny asides or amusing facial expressions from the rubber-faced Depp. There are also hints of deep regret and a damaged psyche as the film progresses and Wonka's troubled past is fleshed out (this is the major point where the film deviates from the book) explaining his motivations. As he did in Pirates of the Caribbean, Depp plays it broad creating his own Wonka that isn't better or worse than Wilder's - just different.<br /><br />Burton wisely doesn't try to remake the Wilder film but goes back to Dahl's book. This is the first film since Sleepy Hollow to feel like a truly authentic Tim Burton film as he really connects with the material in a big way. It's almost as if reconnecting with Depp on this film (and Corpse Bride) has helped the filmmaker find his way back to what made his films so interesting in the first place. Let's hope that this is the beginning of a move back to more personal films like Ed Wood and a distancing of director-for-hire projects like Apes and Big Fish.<br /><br />Included is the obligatory theatrical trailer.<br /><br />"Attack of the Squirrels" shows how an animal wrangler trained the squirrels for a scene in the movie. For most of the squirrels, it took 2,000 repetitions to learn a specific task.<br /><br />"Fantastic Mr. Dahl" takes a look at author Roald Dahl with vintage archival footage of the man and testimony from his friends, family and collaborators.<br /><br />"Becoming Oompa-Loompa" examines how they took actor Deep Roy and transformed him into an army of Oompa-Loompas thanks to CGI. Of all the actors, he had to work the hardest playing so many different roles that was then augmented by special effects.<br /><br />"Making the Mix" is a collection of featurettes that explore various aspects of the movie, including the origins of the project, the changes they made from the book, the casting process (including the kids), Danny Elfman's score and how he approached such a daunting task, costume and production design and finally the special effects. Thankfully, Burton relied as much on practical sets and miniatures as possible with the CGI done only to compliment the real sets.<br /><br />Also included are several interactive games.<br /><br />"Oompa-Loompa Dance" takes you through two dances from the movie and then you have to try and keep an Oompa-Loompa dancing by following the corresponding moves.<br /><br />In "The Bad Nut" you have to help Wonka's squirrels sort good and bad nuts with only three tries to get it right.<br /><br />"The Inventing Machine" allows you to make your own candy and test it on an Oompa-Loompa.<br /><br />Finally, there is the "Search for the Golden Ticket" which allows you to help the five children find their respective ticket through a series of games.</p></body></html>

Romero's version was still way better overall. The problem with this one was a lack of character development, yeah, but more so, a lack of plot development. Certain points simply moved too quickly, other too slowly. It was more about the zombies than the background behind them, which is the truly important part that makes the first one jell so well. There were just too many jumpy sequences, not enough time allowed to really get to "bond' with any characters, and some truly unrealistic characters and situations. I thought Andy was a nice touch the first one could have benefitted from, but the Chips thing was just fairy-tale time. Using a few original cast members was cool.<br />As far as acting, it was pretty lame. I don't know what Ving Rhames was thinking, unless it was a helluva paycheck. And even the gore level in the director's cut was disappointing; the original was FAR more stomach-churning. And let's face it; in a film based on walking dead people feeding on the living by taking bites out of them, gore should play a definite part. It was a good try, it really was, but Romero's is still #1. See both and you'll understand.<br />PS: If you haven't seen this yet, be careful of a few reviewers who apparently felt they needed to replay the entire plot scene by scene.</p></body></html>

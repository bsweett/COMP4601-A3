<meta name="summary" content="Journey to the Center of your Popcorn Kernal"></head><body><p>Cheesy to its core. Brendan Fraser mugs his way through this family-fared piece of fluff, while CGI Dinosaurs and glow in the dark birds make up the ooh and ah factor. With a running time of barely 90 minutes, there's no filler at all, but frankly, there's no depth. Fraser, with his affable charm, at least gives the film a center. His nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and their Icelandic volcano guide (Icelandic actress Anita Briem) are given little else to do except run from danger and scream often.<br /><br />Given that "Journey To The Center Of The Earth" was set up as a kids effects movie (I did not see the 3-D version, but the 3-D moments were obvious), this is pure, mildly exciting and non-frightening entertainment. Be prepared for the fact that this movie is meant to amuse 8 year old boys, and you'll be fine.</p></body></html>

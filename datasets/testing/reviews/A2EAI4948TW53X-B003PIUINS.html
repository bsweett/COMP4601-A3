<meta name="summary" content="Best teen horror movie in ages"></head><body><p>It's about time they made a good teen horror movie.  A good cast with an original premise makes for an enjoyable thriller.  Finally the killer isn't some deranged psycho that is too predictable like scream or i know what you did last summer (two movie franchises that suck by the way) In this film death itself is the taker.  Cool special effects and death scenes.  I can't wait for the sequal</p></body></html>

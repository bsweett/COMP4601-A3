Heath Ledger did an amazing job in this movie. His facial expressions were classic and his physical movements often gave a slapstick feel to the movie, which was good! This movie needed all the comic relief it could get. In fact, I thought that the film did take itself way to seriously and that was a major flaw. It could have been a bit lighter and without all the scenes of animals getting killed. It is certainly NOT a movie for kids, and I think it could have been better if it was more welcoming to kids. But all in all, I thought it was a great story and the special effects were cool. Matt Damon was good enough, Heath Ledger was perfect as a conflicted soul. I'd say this movie is worth owning if it's a decent price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A pedestrian script that's incredibly well acted"></head><body><p>Through a combination of excellent makeup and Meryl Streep's uncannily close impersonation, it's almost like going back 25 years and seeing the lady herself perform. If ever an Academy Award was given to the right person, this was the time - Streep absolutely clones her mannerisms, speech inflections and style in a way I've never seen anyone else come close. But besides the outstanding performance, the script is somewhat lackluster, deciding to take the career of one of the most iconic people of the century and focus on the least interesting parts.<br /><br />It's not that the script itself is terrible - it's better than many films I've seen in the last 12 months. It's more that it feels like a missed opportunity since there are dozens of events that could have been drawn upon to make a more interesting film. In making a movie that's essentially about isolation and loneliness, it fails to capture the sheer passion and depth of feeling - both positive and negative - that the average Briton had for Mrs Thatcher.<br /><br />Overall, I'd still recommend the film to people who are interested in the former Prime Minister but be prepared for watching something that's very small scale given the grandness of the times when she was in power.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Who really is the victim?"></head><body><p>During the first 15 minutes of this movie you are going to think that it is a common pedophile movie. Then it takes a "dramatic twist" and several other ones during the movie that will leave your "jaw on the floor". The psychological aspects of this movie are very shocking to say the least. Throughout the movie you are sitting there thinking "who is the victim here?". There is one part of the movie that all men will be squimish and make pedophiles think twist about picking up someone underage again. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes "scarey and tortuous" movies.</p></body></html>

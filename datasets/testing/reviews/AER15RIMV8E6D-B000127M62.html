<meta name="summary" content="FREDDY VS. JASON.....PLACE YOUR BETS!!!"></head><body><p>If you love A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, or both, you'll definitely love Freddy Vs. Jason! I love the awesome fighting sequences between them. I love all the blood and gore when they slash at each other! I remember seeing this with a friend when it first came out. There were some parts we laughed at, some we thought were cool. If you love slashers fighting, you'll love FREDDY VS. JASON!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent film"></head><body><p>I, personally, found this movie to be quite excellent.<br /><br />The opening scene is just terrifying with Javier Bardem.  (Although, the thick accent of Tommy Lee Jones' voice over was a bit of an obstacle at first.)<br /><br />I think the overall film was just great, and true to the novel it was based on.  Every performance was mesmerizingly good!  The eerie absense of a score made it all the more real for me as a viewer.  And the cinematography was well executed.  I could not have asked for a better adapation.<br /><br />A word of caution: I know many people cannot stand this film, but I think it deserves at least one impartial viewing.  I liked this as a modernization of "the western" genre.  In stead of trying to cram modern ideals into an historic setting, the Coen Brothers updated the western using great source material as their guide.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, especially for Javier Bardem's chilling performance as one of the greatest maniacs in movie history.</p></body></html>

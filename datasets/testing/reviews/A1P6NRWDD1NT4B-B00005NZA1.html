<meta name="summary" content="Unbreakable Didn't Break New Ground"></head><body><p>Unbreakable could have been written as an episode for the Twilight Zone. Meaning, the story could have been told in 30 minutes.  All that was built up ends in a Twilight Zone type twist ending, yet it is a disappointing one.  The film making is stylish and moody, but the pacing is too slow. Also, the Samuel Jackson character as well as Spencer Treat Clark as Bruce Willis' son are hard to sympathize with.  I'm a comic book collector, and this movie did not put &quot;fanboys&quot; in a good light.  I think a lot of people were not impressed with this movie.  Just look in the Amazon.com &quot;Used MarketPlace&quot; and you'll see why.</p></body></html>

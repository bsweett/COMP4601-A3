<meta name="summary" content="Great "Next Gen" Sci Fi Movie!"></head><body><p>I'll be adding to this review (when I get the DVD!) but right now wanted to tell ya, this is one of Paramount's better Star Trek films.<br /><br />The Borg finally get blasted out of space.  Everything's going fine until a big Borg ball comes flying out towards Earth, spitting out "tachyon particles" which we Trekkers know means time travel.  Yummy.<br /><br />The better aspects of this film:  What would you do with a historic figure?  Would you tell him all about his future exploits?  Or when you find out he likes to drink moonshine, '60s rock, and only invented Warp Drive for the money, what would you think of him then?  Kinda like finding out George Washington had black slaves, that kinda thing.<br /><br />Deanna Troy getting tipsy was fun; Data apparently being lured by the Dark Side (sex); and Picard's obsession with the Borg being in line with Melville's obsession with Moby Dick (plus a quote from the book).<br /><br />Nice direction from Frakes and a good way to wrap up the Next Gen.<br /><br />The second DVD has various Trekkie things, such as Jerry Goldsmith tribute.  Gosh, I had no idea he did the music for Voyager, Star Trek The Motion Picture, and ALIEN.  WOW....<br /><br />What else you should beam up to your Wish List, Scotty:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305910189">Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6T262">Star Trek Movie Set (The Motion Picture/ The Wrath of Khan/ The Search for Spock/ The Voyage Home/ The Final Frontier/ The Undiscovered Country/ Generations/ First Contact/ Insurrection/ Nemesis)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRT">Star Trek - Nemesis (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

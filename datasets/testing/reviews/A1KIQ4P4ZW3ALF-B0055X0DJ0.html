<meta name="summary" content="Additive & Subtractive Math"></head><body><p>In order to comment you have to give a minimum of one star. Didn't the Amazon programmers ever get past basic additive and subtractive mathematics? For example, I would give this movie two stars for it's CG effects. However, I would remove one star for excessive redundant and visually too-fast-for-appreciation CG effects. I would remove one star for a rambling poorly constructed and not very creative plot. I would remove one star for rote stereotypic read-the-script acting. Then remove a star for a formula script. And, as most everyone else has stated, remove another star for writers & directors not knowing their target audience. Finally, remove two more stars for language appropriate only for 17 to 19 year olds and sexual innuendo appropriate for never-got-around-to-growing-up adults.<br /><br />I'm not very good at math, but I think it's about -5 rating.</p></body></html>

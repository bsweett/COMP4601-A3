<meta name="summary" content="INDIANA JACK"></head><body><p>While FIREWALL isn't going to be one of Harrison Ford's most memorable films, it's a snazzy, tight, involving thriller that shows Mr. Indiana can still keep up with the bad guys.  As Jack Stanfield, a bank security director, Ford finds himself forced to help a smooth villain rob the bank he works at, since his family is being held hostage.  Paul Bettany is a super villain, combining a gentlemanly exterior with a nasty, nasty interior.  Virginia Madsen doesn't get much to do except play the purloined wife, but she does it well.  The rest of the cast offers good support, and the action is brisk, with some suspenseful scenarios.  Critics were unjustly harsh on the film; it's quite entertaining, folks.</p></body></html>

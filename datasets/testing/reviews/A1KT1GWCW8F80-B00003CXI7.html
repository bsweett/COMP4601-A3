<meta name="summary" content="Weak 4 stars for Original Yet Conventional movie"></head><body><p>This is director Robert Zemeckis' attempt at a Hitchcock-like suspense movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, much of the suspense comes from the old tried-and-true suspense movie conventions of walking backward so you don't see what is in plain view; over-reactive fumbling and bumbling and dropping important things; and the intrusive musical cues.<br /><br />However, like all Zemekis' movies, this one contains some impressive camera moves and special effects, which include shooting upward through a glass floor.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good throughout, and most of the success of the movie is due to Michelle Pfieffer's performance. Harrison Ford was good, and played a bit against type.<br /><br />The movie left a few loose ends untied (such as the situation with the neighbors, and some visions and apparitions), had a few lapses in logic and reality (yeah, I know it's a ghost movie) such as the boat mast poking a hole in the windshield though not breaking it, and some of it was a bit too convenient (one accident at the exact location of a previous accident), and the final scene felt tacked on (think how nicely ambiguous it would be if what lies beneath just sank past the camera...)<br /><br />Overall, the movie is pretty good and entertaining, and though it started off strong, it tapered off a bit as it got into the second half.<br /><br />DVD extras include a commentary by Zemeckis and 2 producers, a brief documentary of (mostly other) Zemeckis movies, and text-based cast/crew info.</p></body></html>

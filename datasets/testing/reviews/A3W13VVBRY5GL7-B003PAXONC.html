<meta name="summary" content="Great in parts, otherwise very pedestrian"></head><body><p>From the moment that the Fresh Prince of Bel Air bounds across your line of vision, complete with a sniper rifle and about four thousand CGI deer (oh! and also a pride of fake lions...), you'd be very forgiven for thinking that "I Am Legend" is going to be Just Another Action Movie. Indeed, the glaring awfulness of the computer-rendered deer is enough to make you forget all about the beautiful post-plague New York cityscapes (in themselves worthy of huge praise, they're chilling and very impressive), the thitherto-great performance by Smith as a man hounded by loneliness and personal demons, and the very cute Alsatian by his side.<br /><br />But with further viewing, "I Am Legend" becomes much, much better - for the most part - and is, by the time the credits roll, not Just Another Action Movie, but something more enjoyable - if two-dimensional.<br /><br />The Good: Smith gives a gorgeous, nuanced performance as plague survivor Robert Neville - when he's allowed to act, that is. When he's forced to shoot, run, chase, do action - he reverts to a horrible sort of MIB stereotype - but during Robert Neville's more emotionally complex scenes he's actually excellent. Director Francis Lawerence does great things with the aforementioned bare New York of the future, and we can really sense the isolation and loneliness of Neville's plight. And yes, there are several worthwhile "jump" moments, too, with which to keep the action moving along nicely. It's just a shame that most of the action is hackneyed - which leads me to<br /><br />The Bad: Boring chase & evade sequences and frankly ridiculous computer animations (the animals are a minor offender: the crown of stupidity in this case belongs squarely planted on the heads of the totally unrealistic, poorly-animated Zombies) ruin the great work of Smith and his director in "I Am Legend". Also, the ending is very hackneyed - I'm not sure if it's reflective of the novel since I haven't read it - but as a movie, we've seen it all before.<br /><br />Still, criticisms notwithstanding, "I Am Legend" is a worthwhile way to pass an evening's viewing: I wouldn't buy the DVD because no amount of extras could make up for the fact that, while enjoyable enough with all-too-brief moments of excellence, "I Am Legend" is just not engaging enough to watch twice.</p></body></html>

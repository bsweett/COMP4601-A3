<meta name="summary" content="Return to Science Fiction"></head><body><p>In 2002 Pierce Brosnan returned for the fourth and final time as James Bond, in the twentieth official Bond film.  I enjoyed this film more than "The World Is Not Enough," but less than "Tomorrow Never Dies."  I find it interesting that so many Bond fans dislike this movie so much.  There are things about this movie to dislike, but this movie has as much going for it as the other Bond movies with a strong science fiction flavor, and perhaps more than some.<br /><br />This Bond movie begins with Bond penetrating North Korea.  However, something goes wrong and North Koreans capture Bond.  During the opening credits we see bits and pieces as Bond is tortured and Madonna sings a song from her electronic period (can we say "yuck?").  Soon after the credits are finished Bond is traded for diamond decorated Zao (Rick Yune).  Bond is not pleased that he was traded, but is even less pleased that he is being considered a traitor.  Bond is not one for waiting for things to happen, so he escapes from custody to discover that he is in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Bond slowly discovers that Zao and Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) are somehow linked.  Gustav demonstrates the Icarus solar satellite in Iceland, both for its ostensible purpose (providing light in dark regions of the world when needed) and for a far more nefarious purpose.  Bond never waivers from his goal, helped along the way by Halle Berry as Jinx, Judi Dench as M, and John Cleese as the new Q.<br /><br />Several things about this movie annoyed me.  I thought Madonna's role in the movie was okay (though others did not think so; read more below).  However, her song was annoying.  I would have to nominate Madonna's song in this movie as one of the worst Bond theme songs ever.  I was also displeased by the CGI used when Bond escapes from being drowned.  The escape looked like a video game, and was cheesy by Bond standards.  The escape should have been handled in a fashion that did not required animating Bond.<br /><br />On the plus side, this movie had a lot of cool stuff.  The opening scene was filmed for real.  The surfers were taken out to the waves on jet powered wave runners which enabled them to ride the big waves.  The invisible car was a major coup for the film makers.  In fact, the military has been experimenting with techniques to make people and vehicles literally invisible for several years, and though they are well behind Q, one of the approaches is similar.<br /><br />The CGI of the Icarus satellite was excellent; one of the best CGI spacecraft ever.  I enjoyed the car chase between Zao and Bond in the ice hotel.  In the making of features there is lengthy discussion of the changes that had to be made to accomplish the car chase.  I also enjoyed the fight scene in the laser room between Bond and Mr. Kil (Lawrence Makoare).  The robot and laser combination was a stroke of genius, and Halle Berry's peril appeared real.<br /><br />Last, but not least, is the sword fight between Bond and Graves.  Most of the scenes were filmed with Brosnan and Stephens, a tribute to both men's abilities.<br /><br />This movie edition also includes an array of extras on two discs.  There are commentaries, pictures, making of features, and much more.  I found it strange that some of the better features from the previous version were replaced with less valuable features.  What appears to be most noticeably missing is a feature listed on the box, the "Ministry of Propaganda" from the previous release.<br /><br />This movie received an incredible 25 award nominations of all sorts from various organizations and countries, winning 5.  The only downside was the Razzie Award to Madonna for Worst Supporting Actress, and the Razzie nomination for Worst Original Song.  I think this may have been the Bond film with the most award nominations ever, and possibly the most award wins ever.<br /><br />"Die Another Day" marks 40 years of "official" Bond films.  Bond films are a microcosm of western technology, showing what we thought of as high-tech in five different decades.  I find it interesting that what we considered cutting edge in the early Bond films has been surpassed by what we have in our homes today.  I also find the changes in styles and mannerisms interesting as well.  Yet, through it all Bond remains suave and self-assured, seemingly invincible and with vast knowledge and capability.  While there are no real supermen of which we are aware, if there were such a being, Bond would have to be one.</p></body></html>

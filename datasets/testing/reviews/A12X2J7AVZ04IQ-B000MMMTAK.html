I cringed and laughed at the same time, because everything Borat said is something I've heard others say, regarding our own culture. I'm only wondering how much was staged, and how much real. I really liked Luenell, especially at the etiquette-heavy dinner party. Mr. Cohen is definitely a force to be reckoned with, and I applaud him for his effort. The DVD has lots of extra scenes that were cut, and will be as offensive as the film itself. I really enjoyed it a lot. The only way I could  see a sequel is if Borat took a northern route and met the mid-westerners like myself. We have foibles of our own, and the southerners have been picked on enough. I can't blab away plot-points, but this is truly a sweet, outrageous, crazy display of human nature; innate prejudices that everyone insists they don't have; longing for acceptance in an often alien world. And the consistancy of Mr. Cohen's performance is nothing short of amazing. He IS the new face of comedy in this millenium (Ali G, etc., accepted).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Extraordinary Epic"></head><body><p>Yes, this movie was made forty-plus years ago, so it contains an uncomfortable amount of silly overacting so prevalent in dramatic films of that period.  Yes, the film is rife with stereotypical depictions of Romans, Jews, and Arabs, and offers a very sanitized version of a leper colony.  And yes, the movie has a religious theme, which makes it almost unworthy in today's politically correct culture.  Despite all of the above, director William Wyler gave the world an engrossing, beautiful film, complete with stunning cinematography, a compelling story, moving musical score, and perhaps the most famous racing scene in the history of moviemaking.<p>I first saw BEN-HUR as a young boy at a theater; I was captivated throughout the three hours, thoroughly entertained and in awe of the majesty on the big screen.  The film instantly became one of my favorites, and remains so to this day.  Few things do I enjoy more than watching a beautifully crafted, well made movie, and my appreciation certainly was not unique, as the film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1959.<p>The story is familiar to us all:  Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a young nobleman from a prominent Jewish family reunited with his childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who returns to Judea as a Roman tribune.  There is genuine warmth and friendship between the two men, yet the clash of their cultures drives a wedge between them--a wedge that becomes a chasm as Messala banishes Judah to the slave galleys and sends his mother and his sister to prison.  Thus Judah's life becomes a quest:  a quest to survive, a quest for vengeance.  Judah survives the galleys to become the adopted son of a Roman general (Jack Hawkins), and his triumphant return to Judea permits him to challenge and subsequently confront Messala in a chariot race--a breathtaking sequence of spellbinding, unforgettable scenes. <p>And although Judah's heart is twisted with anger, BEN-HUR is also the story of love, redemption, foregiveness--all depicted under the shadow of the crucifixion of Christ.  And in the aftermath of the crucifixion we witness a miracle, a wondrous event that makes this movie so compelling.  <p>A sweeping, extraordinary epic, BEN-HUR is highly recommended and well worth three hours of anyone's time.<br />--D.

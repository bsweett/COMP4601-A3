<meta name="summary" content="Boo Critics, Good Movie"></head><body><p>I had heard this movie wasn't good at all, but I still wanted to see it and ended up buying it, sight unseen.  What a great movie this ended up being.  I didn't find it bogged down with a bunch of BS, over the top special effects, or just plain badness.  Masterfully put together and wonderfully entertaining, this is a movie you will want to watch over and over again.  Oh and Orlando Bloom plays a Blacksmith who can sword fight in an epic film, never would have I guessed that. ;)<br /><br />This movie is worth your time.</p></body></html>

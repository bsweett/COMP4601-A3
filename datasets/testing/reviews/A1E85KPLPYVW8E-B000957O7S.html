<meta name="summary" content="90% of the funniest parts were given away by the previews"></head><body><p>Hitch proves to be nothing more than you're typical "run-of-the-mill" romantic comedy that offers only a few laughs. The biggest downfall for me in Hitch was that most of the movie's funnier moments were completely squandered by the previews (which is nothing to new in movies these days). This includes the food allergy scene, the scene were Al and Hitch kiss, and the scene where Al shows off his less than decent hip-hop dance moves to Hitch. I'm pretty sure I would have found these parts a little more amusing if I hadn't seen them in the previews on television a hundred times. But then again, movie studios aren't too worried about giving away too much in a trailer, they just need to get you into the theater and that's all they are really worried about.<br />Also, it seemed to me in the last half hour or so, the film really lost where it was trying to go. There were a lot of other things going on plot-wise with a few different characters that made the film seem like it was trying to juggle too many things at once and having a hard time keeping pace with all of them.<br />Other than that, the movie was just okay. There were some other scenes that were worth a chuckle or two. Probably would make a good date movie for most couples. I know my girlfriend liked it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Average action film"></head><body><p>Plenty of shootings and car chases but nothing to get excited about.  Some of the plot hooks seemed far-fetched (but maybe they make more sense if you've seen the first movie).  For some reason, I have a problem seeing Matt Damon as an "action hero."  Overall, the movie is o.k. as long as you're not expecting too much.</p></body></html>

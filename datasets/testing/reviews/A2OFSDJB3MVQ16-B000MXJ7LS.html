<meta name="summary" content="Stone's 9/11 movie"></head><body><p>After the financial and critical disaster of "Alexander", Oliver Stone was called upon to direct this intimate story of the effect of 9/11 on two firefighters.  Using considerable restraint and an non-exploitative approach, Stone explores the trauma and the tensions involved in rescuing these 2 heroic firefighters and the effects it had on their families.  By personalizing this story, Stone has not trivalized this important story but has created a tribute to these two men and a memorial to those who died risking their lives in this tragedy.</p></body></html>

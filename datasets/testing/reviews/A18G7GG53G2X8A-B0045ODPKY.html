We as audiences will buy into a whole host of cinematic flaws as long as there are sights and sounds to keep us amused, and in all honesty, I don't know whether or not I mean that as a criticism. Maybe it's just what is. "Salt," like so many summer action movies before it, is a fun thrill-a-minute stunt caper, and yet it possesses not a single shred of plausibility. It's one of those movies that gives you license to put your brain on autopilot; you're not supposed to question it, you're just supposed to enjoy it for what it is. I hope this isn't a copout on my part, considering all the other escapist summer films I've dismissed ("Eagle Eye," the "Transformers" films, "The A-Team"). The fact that it's a spy thriller may have something to do with why it works. Tales of international intrigue involving secret agents are generally successful.<br /><br />The plot: Trusted CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused by a Russian defector of secretly being a sleeper agent for the KGB, Russia's foremost internal security organization. He also says she will be involved in a plot to assassinate the President of Russia, who will be in New York City attending the funeral of the American Vice President. Although she denies the defector's claims, she realizes that she will be held against her will, which will endanger the life of her German husband, a spider scientist (a plot point that isn't as inconsequential as it might seem). Using every trick in the book, Salt escapes headquarters and goes on the run, claiming that she's out to clear her name. Pursuing her are Agents Winter (Liev Shreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor); the former is willing to believe her innocence while the latter is highly suspicious.<br /><br />One of the film's most ridiculous yet clever story points is an elaborate decades-old scheme by the Russian government to brainwash children into being KGB agents. Their goal: Raise them to blend in, have them infiltrate the United States, and then let them bide their time until X Day, an operation that will plunge the country into nuclear war with the rest of the world. You'd be hard pressed to find a better sinister plot in a James Bond film, with or without the silly gadgets and gizmos built into wristwatches and ball-point pens. What does any of this have to do with Evelyn Salt? Wouldn't you like to know? Let's just say that, whatever her association, she gets to take part in many death-defying stunts, including impressive acrobatic leaps from the tops of semi trucks and gas tankers, all moving along at average freeway speeds.<br /><br />Stories like this require a plot twist or two, and you'll get them both in "Salt." I will say that, given the formulaic nature of spy thrillers, the twists aren't all that surprising - one is, in fact, so predictable that I could tell it was coming as early as the first ten minutes. But what this movie lacks in surprises it more than makes up for in sheer action spectacle, aided greatly by decent casting choices. Jolie, still in her prime, has been amazingly versatile, with credits as diverse as "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," "Changeling," "A Mighty Heart," and "Wanted" to her name; it's always a good sign when an actor can convincingly touch you deeply in one movie and get your heart pounding in another. Schreiber and Ejiofor play fairly generic roles, but in all fairness, they do the best with what little they're given.<br /><br />The only disappointment is Salt's husband, Mike Krause (August Diehl), who's featured so infrequently that I couldn't bring myself to care about him. This is bad because he is an important character, not merely because of his field of study, but also because of his emotional ties to Salt. Flashback sequences showing the two together should have been enough, but for me, something was missing. Maybe it was just a matter of too little screen time; had he been more actively involved, had he been given more dialogue, something substantial could have developed. As it is, I don't think anything of great importance would have been lost if this character had been altogether removed. Let the spider thing work itself in differently.<br /><br />We need another mindless action film about as much as we need another reality show. But if they absolutely have to be made, then "Salt" is a good indicator of what they should be like. Yes, it's silly from start to finish. Yes, it doesn't bother with anything that's even remotely realistic. But boy, it certainly knows how to keep an audience entertained. The action is plentiful. The mystery is engaging. The characters are well-played. The suspense is palpable. It's a lot of fun. And here I go again, sliding that entertainment card from out my sleeve, slipping into a fairly weak hand. Are we too easily amused? Movies like this are enjoyable distractions, but I shudder to think this is all we have left when it comes to summer popcorn flicks. As is the case with real salt, too much isn't good for you - just a pinch will do.</p></body></html>

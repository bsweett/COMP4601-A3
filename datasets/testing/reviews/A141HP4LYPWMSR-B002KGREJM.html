I also appreciated how the film created the presence of violence and horror without actually having all the gratuitous visuals that we see all too frequently.<br /><br />Negatives: The one drawback for me was the portrayal of Doctor Garrigan. It's not the performance of James McAvoy I'm refering to but the character itself. Garrigan is a self-indulgent, morally weak individual who simply isn't a sympathetic figure. When things start falling about and his life is threated I really didn't care whether he survived his African adventure or not.<br /><br />I consider the 'The Last King of Scotland' to be a good but not great film. However if nothing else it's worth a watch or two for Whitaker's performance alone.</p></body></html>

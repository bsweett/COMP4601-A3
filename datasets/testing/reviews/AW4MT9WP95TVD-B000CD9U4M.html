I love Burton films and I love Depp, so I may be just a tad predjudiced, but I had a smile on my face from begining to end.  Depp's Wonka is innocent bordering on malevolent.  He had me in hysterics.  Burton's best work wonders with sets and effects providing a visually beautiful and magical world.  You can still like the original, but it's okay to appreciate this vivid retelling too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="United 93"></head><body><p>"United 93" is the first major motion picture to be released since 9/11 to deal with the events of that day.  Focusing on the plane that did not reach its target, the film moves in almost real time from take off to the crash landing in Pennsylvania.  Writer-Director Paul Greengrass has taken pains to be as accurate as possible, and when the story veers into the unknown, the story told is very plausible.<br /><br />The actors are mostly unknowns, preventing any one person from distracting the viewer from the story.  This was a wise choice by Greengrass, and is successful in keeping the viewer focused on the story.  The actors all do good jobs, even though none are developed excessively.  This, combined with the hand held camera work gives the film a more intimate feel, as if you are there among them on the plane.  Greengrass received 100% support from the families, and a substantial number of the people on the ground play themselves in the movie.  That alone should speak of the quality of the film.<br /><br />"United 93" is a tense, gut-wrenching movie of a group of people and their determination to stop four evil men who wanted to bring America to its knees.  Is it too soon?  I say no...it is never to soon to remember the heroic things that that the passengers did.  They should be remembered and honored as heros.  "United 93" does just that.  This is a must see movie.</p></body></html>

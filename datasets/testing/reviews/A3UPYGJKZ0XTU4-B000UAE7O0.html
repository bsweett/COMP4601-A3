Truth be told, "Planet Terror" owes a lot to 1980s sci-fi action-horror, but this homage to zombie movies surpasses most of the films it emulates. I expected to be bored. I was surprised to find myself giggling at the gorefest. There are severed limbs, vile disease, splatter, and grotesqueries galore. But it's a hoot.<br /><br />Go-go dancer Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) crosses paths with ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) just as a dispute between a rogue Army officer (Bruce Willis) and a mercenary scientist (Naveen Andrews) results in a toxic biochemical agent being released into the air in their small Texas town. The gas turns those who ingest it into grotesque zombies who prey on the living, ripping their victims limb from limb. The lovers lead a motley group of survivors against the zombies -despite Cherry's newly-acquired disability.<br /><br />"Planet Terror" is scratched and speckled, recalling a film that has run through the projector too many times. The film in the Weinstein 2007 2-disc set is 10 minutes longer than the theatrical double-bill version, but there is still a "missing reel". One fake trailer, for Mexican vigilante flick "Machete", precedes the feature. Tarantino's "Death Proof" is more cerebral in its comment on exploitation cinema, but "Planet Terror" is better-paced and has more laughs. "Planet Terror" manages to be both self-parody and a terrifically entertaining example of those films which it parodies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A needless, but entertaining, remake of a classic"></head><body><p>I hate remakes.  The horror genre has become a breeding ground for remakes and re-hashes of classic films in the genre, as is the case with Halloween.  As flawed as House of 1000 Corpses was, musician turned director Rob Zombie more than made up for it with The Devil's Rejects, which really seemed to find him coming into his own.  That's why I was looking forward to the Halloween remake, of which I had heard both great and terrible things about.  After viewing it, well, it's not nearly as terrible as what I had heard, but at the same time, the film is a needless remake that wastes much of it's potential.  The subtlety of John Carpenter's original classic is replaced with brutal violence and buckets of blood, as we witness the beginnings of Michael Myers' (played as a child by Daeg Faerch, and later by X-Men's Tyler Mane) journey to becoming a killer from his childhood on, as Zombie makes an attempt to give the viewer a sympathetic view towards Michael.  The relationship with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is further examined as well, as is Michael's return to Haddonfield.  The abundance of backstory and sympathetic view towards Michael Myers is where Halloween fails, but where it succeeds is with Zombie's techniques for getting the most out of the shocks and scares that he pummels the viewer with.  The final act, in which Michael faces off with Laurie Strode (the super cute Scout Taylor-Compton), is a visceral blast, as is what leads up to it.  As he has done before, Zombie has peppered genre stalwarts throughout the film, including his wife Sheri Moon, Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree, Sid Haig, and an all grown up Danielle Harris, whose role here is a far cry from the petrified child of Halloween 4 and 5.  The two-disc Unrated edition features an insightful commentary from Zombie, plenty of deleted scenes (including Adrienne Barbeau's deleted role), a more downbeat alternate ending, and a pretty funny blooper reel.  Not for the faint of heart to be sure, Rob Zombie's Halloween remake isn't anything spectacular, but it's nothing terrible in the least either, and more than worth checking out for horror/slasher fans young and old alike.</p></body></html>

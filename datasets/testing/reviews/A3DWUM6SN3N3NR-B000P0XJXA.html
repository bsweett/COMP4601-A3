It deftly keeps you guessing what will happen next while being immersed in the intricasies of every scene. The suspense is constant and the camera work is expert.<p>Mamet is capable of doing the seemingly impossible: creating a film that is visually appealing and possessing a great story with superb acting.<p>Yes, there is some cheesy dialogue here and there, but overall this film delivers the goods in almost every way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Serial Novel and Outstanding Film Adaptation"></head><body><p>Darabont followed up his brilliant adaptation of King's Shawshank novella with this brilliant adaptation of the serial novels &quot;The Green Mile.&quot;  I actually saw the movie prior to reading the book, and was absolutely amazed at how closely the movie follows the book.  If anything, the movie adds material instead of excising it.  The only subplot that the film fails to explore has to do with a cruel nursing home staff member who is practically abusive to the main character.<p>Otherwise, what you find in the serial, you find in the film.  The characters are all incredibly memorable and brilliantly cast.  Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan steal the show, while David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson, Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchison, and Harry Dean Stanton fill out the supporting roles with enough depth for four films.  <p>Although the story has supernatural elements, the key to the story are the human interactions--Hanks' sensitivity to the needs of prisoners condemned to die in Louisiana's electric chair, and the twist ending that manages to give all of the true &quot;bad guys&quot; their just desserts (and not all of those bad guys are the ones in the cells).  <p>Perhaps the best of all of the King adaptations, the Green Mile will make you laugh and make you cry, but most of all, it will make you CARE.</p></body></html>

It tells the true story of novice nun Maria, who is sent to be a nanny for a retired captain (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children. The captain is still sad over the loss of his wife, and distances himself from the kids. He becomes engaged to a snooty baroness (Eleanor Parker), who dislikes children and is especially jealous of the pretty, young novice. Maria is quite the singer, and in no time she has the kids, and their father, singing Austrian folksongs all over the countryside, and soon, she and the captain marry. The story takes a serious turn as Germany annexes Austria, and the captain is ordered to report for duty in Hitler's forces. <p>Julie Andrews radiates confidence and joy in song after song, many of which have become familiar to everyone, especially Edelweiss, Doe, A Deer, and My Favorite Things. Her voice is pitch perfect and she looks great with Christopher Plummer. Salzburg is so beautiful, no wonder they sang all the time. This is a charming, romantic, and exciting musical the whole family will enjoy.</p></body></html>

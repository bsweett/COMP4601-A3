It teaches people, and Aaron's son, not to accept the status quo in thinking, that there are alternative realities depending on how one wants to use spin it. A truly libertarian film to the point of absurdity. Great comedy no matter where your politics fall.<br /><br />Parental Guide: simulated sex, frequent F-bombs, no nudity.</p></body></html>

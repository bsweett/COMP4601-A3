The only thing debatable about this flick is it's placement in the pantheon of the greatest flicks of all-time.  Personally, as far as it's place in the Bogart canon, I rank "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" above "Casablanca".  That's not to diminish the film but it just goes to show what an impressive body of work Bogart left behind.  There's more quotable dialogue here this side of Tarantino.  Snappy dialogue wouldn't work if you didn't have the right actors delivering it.  Aside from Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the supporting ensemble on hand here(Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, et al.) seemed to have been plucked from heaven.  Essential is an understatement when describing "Casablanca".</p></body></html>

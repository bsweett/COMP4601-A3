<meta name="summary" content="Another good sports movie"></head><body><p>This is another great sports movie that will most likely be up for academy awards.  As much as I hate Russell Crowe his performance as Jim Braddock is really good as usual Crowe does another good performance as in A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator he does it again in Cinderella Man.  As are the performances of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are really good to.  Renee Zellweger is hot.</p></body></html>

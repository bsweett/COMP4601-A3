<meta name="summary" content="one of 2006's best but its most overlooked"></head><body><p>Christopher Nolan gained much praise for his work in the twist-filled Memento but gained even more recognition when he successfully kickstarted the battered Batman franchise in Batman Begins. As a roadstop in-between the Batman sequel, he did this film focusing on magicians and the mystery of illusion. Maybe because of this, the film didn't get much attention; trading box-office success for critical praise. Too bad cause this was ultimately one of the year's best films that at times takes too many sleight of hands but in the end is masterful in its story unfolding.<br /><br />Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) are 2 fellow magicians who become rivals when tragedy strikes. Borden is the most talented magician but the one with the least charisma. Angier is a true showman and performer but not the know-how on tricks and thinking to pull off magic feats. Both want to one-up the other; thinking of bigger illusions and even sabatoging the other's performance. To spoil any more would be a crime and you'll see how far one can go in the name of being "the best".<br /><br />One of the problems when you have a film like this, especially one about magic is not only not revealing anything that will spoil the film but also letting the film outsmart watchers who dissect everything. "Was that an important plot point?" "Is that part of the twist?" Some guessed the film's twist but I honestly didn't even know simply because there was no reason to dwell on that particular thing. The fault the film does though is get too twist-y. It at times felt like "I fooled you! no wait you fooled me, now I'm gonna fool you back!" It piles on a story element after another until your hurt head hurts.<br /><br />Acting-wise though this is perfect across the board. Bale and Jackman play great rivals and characters while we also have Michael Caine, Andy Serkis and Scarlett Johansson with even Ziggy himself, David Bowie showing up in a impressive role since he isn't bad in the role. The one weak link although it's a needed character is Johansson. Remember Chris Rock's joke about Jude Law and what movies he wasn't in? Maybe it's just Johansson overkill but she just stands out since we just seen her in too much it seemed.<br /><br />My guess is that we're going to get double-dipped. Since this wasn't a Best Picture contender, there's no reason why the extras are so slight but all we get is a brief and surface-skimming making-of and an art gallery. This should've got way more extras although the one that people look forward to, a director commentary, is not as anticipated since Nolan isn't the most engaging commentator but still, we should've got more than this.<br /><br />Definately go and watch this and experience something that should've had more attention when it started.</p></body></html>

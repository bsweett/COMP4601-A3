<meta name="summary" content="One of those movies I thought I'd seen... but I never really had"></head><body><p>First off, this is a really fine set. The film looks better than I expected and the additional materials are fairly fascinating.  This is a good example of a movie being well-served by DVD.<br /><br />Also very cool is the documentary about the lost spider pit sequence and how Peter Jackson recreated it.  I actually wasn't that impressed with the recreation -- it's fine, and I'm sure they had fun, but it's mostly just an exercise.  Still, the documentary *about* the spider pit sequence, and how Jackson and Frank Darabont and Rick Baker et al put it together is interesting enough almost to stand alone on its own.<br /><br />About THE MOVIE: This is a film I'd always *thought* I'd seen.  In fact, I'd only seen bits and pieces of the original but most of what I knew about "Kong" came from seeing the remake as a kid.<br /><br />I've now seen it, though, and it's a pretty amazing little creation.  Exciting, amusing, passionate, occasionally vicious and always a little mysterious.  I watched it primarily because I'm very psyched for the '05 remake, but was completely impressed and even if the new version stinks (which I kind of doubt) it's done me a service by leading me to this strange little gem.</p></body></html>

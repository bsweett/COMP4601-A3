She warns everyone on the ride of what she saw.  7 people get off the ride, but don't believe her.  The ride starts, and no sooner did the students go outside the ride, they witness the accident.  The 7 people who got off the ride die one by one in mysterious ways throughout the movie.  Two girls (I don't remember their names) both die while in tanning beds.  They burn to death.  One guy gets his head smashed while at the gym.  The deaths are fake.  It's as if the people who die have brittle bones and are made out of sticks.</p></body></html>

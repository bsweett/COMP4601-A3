This film is great, it grabs you by the throat and doesn't let up until the credits start rolling like most awesome films made by Quint.  This is now my fav Brad Pitt movie and all the actors in this film played their roles very well,  even Hitler was spot on.  The action was great, the effects were very well done and the realism was great, no corners cut here, honest and brutal.  Great story, great film and I hope to see more like this soon, awesome job!</p></body></html>

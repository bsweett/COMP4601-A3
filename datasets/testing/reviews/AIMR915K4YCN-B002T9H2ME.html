He's there to man the lunar base, and to make sure the mining machines function properly. Sam is alone, except for the base robot / computer, Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey). All is well until an accident occurs during a routine check, plunging everything into chaos. MOON is a superior science fiction effort w/ a memorable central (almost sole) character. Sam's isolation and loneliness are palpable. He is supposed to be nearing the end of his 3-year mission. Of course, that would be too simple! If I had to compare MOON to any other film, I would say that SILENT RUNNING would be it's closest relative. Both films deal w/ solitary figures in bleak situations. In space! Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

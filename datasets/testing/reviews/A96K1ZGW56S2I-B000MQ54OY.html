When I saw the previews for HAPPY FEET, I knew that it would be a movie I was going to see, for better or for worse.  Despite Robin Williams' voicing several characters, I was leery at first and thought the film might just turn out to be another lame animated animal movie.  This wasn't the case.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET begins in Antarctica at the meeting of two Emperor penguins, a soul-singing baritone named Memphis (Hugh Jackman) who sounds and acts like Elvis and a sweet-voiced earth angel named Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman).  In this group of Emperor penguins, soul mates find each other through the heart songs that they sing.  Some melodies just don't sound good together.  Memphis and Norma Jean meet and have an egg.  Norma Jean leaves with the females to get food before the winter ends and Memphis stays behind keeping guard and warming the egg until it should hatch in the spring.  During the longest night of the year as the male penguins huddle together walking in a massive circle, Memphis drops his egg while walking on the outside.  He is able to rescue the egg, but the accident hurts him to his core.  During the spring thaw, the egg hatches.  It is a fine baby boy, but one who can't sing but can dance better than Fred Astaire.  Norma Jean returns and for a time things are alright.  But as their son, Mumble (Elijah Wood) grows up it is quite clear that he is different from everyone, not only can he not sing and wants to dance, but even in adulthood his body is partially covered in feathers and his eyes are brilliant blue instead of the normal black penguin eyes.  After being outcasted, Mumble sets out on an adventure of his own.  He makes some new friends, meets some fascinating creatures, and ends up discovering the mystery of the disappearing fish.<br /><br />The movie has a great vocal cast.  Hugh Jackman continues to illustrate why he will soon be the #1 actor in America--his talent seems to have no limits.  Nicole Kidman gives Norma Jean the homey sensuality that recalls the famous actress of her name sake.  Elijah Wood, no doubt using his LORD OF THE RINGS experiences, seems perfect as Mumble and Brittany Murphy surprises as Mumble's love, Gloria.  Robin Williams serves as the comic relief of the movie portraying not just one, but three different characters. Williams is gifted as a voice actor and does his job well (I just wish he would go make to making good live-action movies again).<br /><br />When I saw the original trailers for HAPPY FEET, I thought the movie was going to be about dancing penguins.  As it turns out, most of the movie is about singing penguins.  In fact, the movie is basically a modern musical; there isn't much original music but instead various popular tunes and some not-so-popular ones are used as the music that moves these flightless birds.  For most of the movie scenes move from one major song to the next one, interlaced with some dialogue and humorous visual effects.<br /><br />Speaking of visuals, the animation in the movie is amazing.  The penguins look unbelievably realistic.  They seem as real as some of the living, breathing penguins you might see in a zoo.  There are also some moments later in the movie where the animation is perfectly blended with live action footage of people.  I honestly was unable to tell for sure what was live footage and what was animated.<br /><br />Though the movie relies upon some formulaic devices and storylines, HAPPY FEET isn't a typical animated feature.  The major message of the movie has to do with living a life of difference and integrity.  There are parts of the film that can be viewed as being a religion satire, a political commentary, or perhaps a little of both.  The film doesn't take sides with either a conservative or liberal point of view and the religious element serves more as prodding not to abandon belief, but to not disengage one's intellect in worship.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET doesn't gloss over the dangers that are apparent in life.  There are a group of birds who attempt to rip Mumble apart when he is still a child.  There are other seals that attempt to eat the penguins as well as a couple of orcas who almost succeed in devouring Mumble and one of his friends while they are on their quest.  In this sense, HAPPY FEET more resembles a classical fairy tale of folk story in that it doesn't gloss over the dangers that naturally happen in living life.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET is one of the two best animated movies of 2006.  It's a very different movie than the other best animated film of 2006 (CARS).  However, it does what it does extremely well.  Besides, it's got a bunch of singing and dancing penguins.  They're just so darn cute, it's hard to resist.</p></body></html>

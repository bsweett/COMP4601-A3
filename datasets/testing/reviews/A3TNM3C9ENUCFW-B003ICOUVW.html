<meta name="summary" content="Good old fashioned horror"></head><body><p>Plagued with delays, reshoots, on set bickering and changed release dates Director Johnston's remake/homage makes it to the silver screen, and is a good old fashion scary movie.<br />Interestingly, the DVD and Blu-Ray release will feature a further 17 minutes of footage, aka "Directors Cut" which according to an interview with the director is mostly in the first half of the movie to build tension, and fill in some back story.<br />It was said that here (the cinematic) release wanted to be concise and get to the first transformation sequence in as soon as possible to keep the audience attention. This ideal I can understand, as all too often one must sit through an hour of build up to get to the meat of the action (no pun intended) and see what has been teased in trailers and TV spots. Time will tell as to whether these 17 minutes make a whole lot of difference, my view is that it will be a nice to have, rather than a need to have. For me the picture felt pretty complete.<br />Del Toro is great from the first scene as the grieving brother summoned by his late siblings fianc&eacute; to the funeral, to try to find out what happened after his mangled remains are found in a ditch near the family's stately home.<br />There's an air of a troubled past about from the get go, as he reunites with his estranged father Anthony Hopkins. We learn in flashback that he witnessed his mothers apparent suicide and was committed to an asylum and suffered untold horrors by his father at a young age, in hopes of cleansing him of something.<br />Hopkins as always is masterful, and more than distracting as the brooding Lord of the manor, with more than a few secrets to hide.<br />Hugo Weaving, as Inspector Abberline also puts in a fine performance, as does Art Malik in a nice cameo role.<br />The similarities to the original Lon Chaney are hinted at more than played out, but it feels, and looks good as he begins to delve into the history of Blackmoor, the nearby gypsy encampment, and the family "curse".<br />They did a great job with filming locations. Chatsworth house (The Blackmoor stately home) is actually in a lot better condition than they made it appear with a dreary run down CGI touch up, and may be familiar to viewers of many movies like Pride & Prejudice. Actually about 160 miles from London, for the purpose of the movie it's setting is supposed nearer to the capital, as Del Toro walks there from London towards the climax of the movie. Castle Combe in Wiltshire is used extensively for the village scenes, and creates a perfect period feel for the late 19th century setting. Those who have actually been to that part of England will know that "yes, it actually looks like that today" an obvious reason why it was chosen.<br /> Emily Blunt is captivating but deliberately understated as the grieving fianc&eacute;, slowly drawn to Del Toro's gentle handling, and the romantic connection is thoughtful without being overplayed.<br />So to the special effects and make up, well those familiar with Rick Bakers talents, particularly in the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024FADD8">American Werewolf in London Special Edition</a> (which is seen by many as still the benchmark for the most realistic depiction of the transition from man to wolf) will not be disappointed. Here however, we get more of a direct reference to the original, in that Del Toro is an upright Wolf Man, sort of 50/50 as opposed to being completely lupine or monstrous as in the recent Underworld movies for example.<br />It was also interesting to read that the makeup took only two hours to apply, and one to remove, with Baker remarking that the hirsute Del Toro was easy to change from his current form, to "just a more hairy version of Del Toro with teeth and claws"!<br />You can complain about the constant full moons, the question of where Del Toro's clothes disappear to and reappear when he changes back, and a number of artistic flaws in the story, but the pace and suspense of the movie keep you viewing. This is escapism after all.<br />There are some graphic scenes during the numerous changes and attacks, but the strength of the tension lies more in the good old fashioned scary moments, plenty of searching of dark rooms, and roaming around at night in forests, and more than a few "Boo" moments to make most people alarmed.<br />It's a relatively predictable story, I saw the end coming a mile away, as I'm sure most did, and of course the filmmakers have the left the door open for a sequel. That said, it's an impressive piece of gothic horror well presented with today's technology and sure to do well at the box office, and on DVD. 4 Stars.</p></body></html>

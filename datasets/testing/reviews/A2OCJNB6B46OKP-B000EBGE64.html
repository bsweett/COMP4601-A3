<meta name="summary" content="The Secret Is Out... (Part 2 of 8)"></head><body><p>And so the second year begins at Hogwarts school of witchcraft & wizardry. As does the second cinema adaptation of the world of Harry Potter. This piece in the saga starts off right on a good note when Harry is visited by a mysterious elf named Dobby, who warns him that terrible things are going to happen at Hogwarts this year and that Harry must stay away. Unwilling to listen Harry finds out with his good friends Ron & Hermione that long ago one of the founders of the school created a secret chamber where a hidden chapter of the school's history has lay dormant for 50 years. Now there are bloodstained messages on the school walls and non-magical born students are ending up in comas, but worse all fingers are pointing at Harry Potter. Now Harry must question and dive into a world that has been locked away only to bring the secrets of the hidden chamber out in the open.<br /><br />This movie as well as the book is by far my favorite in the saga. This movie really shows significant character development and true bonds of friendship through Harry and his companions. Chris Columbus did a fantastic job for his final directorial attempt, still keeping close to the original story, but also really working with the kids bringing their acting abilities up to speed with the aging characters to make the audience connect with the characters as they did in the book.<br /><br />While the movie is better than its predecessor, it still does rank as the best in the saga for there is still much to learn and 5 more years left to go.</p></body></html>

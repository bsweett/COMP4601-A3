<meta name="summary" content="Raw Realism; Fine achievement by Herzog"></head><body><p>The version I watched had a disclaimer at the beginning: Modified from its theatrical release. I don't know what that means, but the film I watched was riveting and always interesting. Mr. Herzog's narration keeps everything in perspective, telling the sad story of a man who was disillusioned with society at large, and his own disappointments at success (it's said he lost a role in "Cheers" to Woody Harrelson). I'm reminded a bit of "Into the Wild", but this is more a story about a guy who was a bit removed from reality, and thought he could empower Mother Nature herself. He thought of himself as primordial, when in fact he was clueless that nature has its own idea of survival. I guess it's no different than the crazy people who want exotic animals for pets, and end up being their lunch. Nature cannot be out-guessed, and poor Timothy Treadwell got crazier over the years. Too bad Amie went with him; she's an enigma in this film, never a clear shot of her.  Mr. Herzog's narration is intelligent enough to make this an interesting story about a delusional (albeit well-meaning) person. The stunning shots in Katmai Nat'l Park in Alaska are breath-taking. But it's all about the bears.  Bears will be bears, and Tim couldn't understand that. Tim was na?ve and a bit of a narcissist; his association to reality deteriorated, and he got the obsession, as most people crave to fulfill, but it was his demise. There's a fine DVD extra about Herzog's input into the music score, whch was very interesting. "Grizzly Man" won many awards as Best Documentary Film in 2005, but failed to get an Oscar nom. I guess that just goes to show that we're all entertained differently, and we can't all relate to certain things. Indeed, I heard how violent this film was (NOT!), but watched it because of its awards recognition. It's basically a film about obsession gone bad, and not as gruesome as I'd been led to believe. I recommend it.</p></body></html>

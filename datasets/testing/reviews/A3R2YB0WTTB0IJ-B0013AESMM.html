<meta name="summary" content="NEIL JORDAN, OPUS 15"></head><body><p>*** 2007. Directed by Irish born director Neil Jordan. Jodie Foster earned a nomination for the Golden Globes for her performance in this movie. A NYC woman becomes a vigilante after the brutal death of her boy-friend. Not bad but it's nonetheless a little disappointing film from the author of such masterpieces as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767847415">The End of the Affair</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXBJ">Mona Lisa - Criterion Collection</a>.</p></body></html>

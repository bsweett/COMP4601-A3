<meta name="summary" content="Another Victim of Trilogy Disease"></head><body><p>I'm not quite sure what began the trilogy trend, though I have a guess.<br /><br />For movies, it was probably Star Wars. Star Wars, itself, likely was a trilogy to follow in the footsteps of the Lord of the Rings. Interestingly, Star Wars was originally conceptualized as a trilogy of trilogies (9 parts, comprising three sets). The first number of book series made from the Star Wars universe all had to be trilogies, too (like the Zahn series).<br /><br />Whatever the origin, the fact is that any book or movie today which touches on the fantasy/sci-fi universe *must* be a trilogy. It's expected.<br /><br />While Pirates of the Caribbean is only roughly fantasy, it certainly draws on the same sort of fan base. And, sadly, it suffers from the same disease. As soon as the first movie was successful, its backers *didn't* say: "Ooh! A hit! We should make a sequel"; what they said, instead, was: "Ooh! A hit! We should make it a trilogy!"<br /><br />Why? Why two more films, and not just one more? Was it, like George Lucas, that they'd already planned out an entire series, and so Dead Man's Chest was already a vital part in the larger, overall plot? Was it like Tolkien who, ironically, never envisioned the Lord of the Rings as a trilogy--did they simply write one huge movie that had to be divided into three parts so that audiences could view it comfortably?<br /><br />No. Pirates of the Caribbean, like the Matrix debacle of a few years back, is a trilogy simply because it is expected of them. And, watching this second film, you can tell.<br /><br />Dead Man's Chest is going through the motions. And there are, apparenly, a lot of motions to be gone through--this is a long film, clocking in at about 2 and 1/2 hours. It concerns that lovable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow as he does his damndest to escape the business end of the deal he'd made with Davy Jones--100 years of servitude on board his barnacled ship. Sparrow seeks the "Dead Man's Chest" which holds a power over Jones, while other players (i.e. Turner and Norrington, naturally) seek the same Chest for their own purposes. Adventure and hilarity ensue. Kind of.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is stretched rather thin, and cannot support the incredible running time. It's almost as though they'd taken half of what might be a good idea, and tried to make it into an entire, feature-length movie. It's propped up with some very long action sequences (much like Matrix Reloaded) which, I have to admit, are pretty frikken rad and inventive. Those action sequences are the best part of this film, excepting for 14 year old ladies who would probably vote Depp and Bloom as the best parts, without even needing to see it.<br /><br />The characters, themselves, don't get a lot of dialogue time with one another because they're all separated for most of the picture. It's a shame, too, because their interactions were such a strong part of the first. Their characters kind of need one another to play off of, and so Turner and Swann and even Sparrow all seem less charming, and less interesting, while off on their own adventures.<br /><br />The humor is intermittent, though the two "chorus" pirates (one of which is Mackenzie Crook--Gareth from the original BBC version of The Office!) are wonderfully funny, all the way through.<br /><br />All in all, I think it's a shame that they tried to stretch this out into three movies. It's clear from watching Dead Man's Chest that they really didn't have a whole lot to say in this film (there are only a handful of moments that really matter, and most of those come at the very end of the film, to set up the third). And so, instead, they just have the characters running around, telling jokes and getting into various awkward situations because the writers feel impelled to fill the time somehow. It weakens the characters, makes this movie feel long to sit through and hurts the franchise, itself.<br /><br />The Curse of the Black Pearl was wonderful--a five star film. This one only deserves three. I sincerely hope (because I'm going to be in the theater with all of you, watching it) that the third movie manages to reclaim this series' once-held substantial merits.</p></body></html>

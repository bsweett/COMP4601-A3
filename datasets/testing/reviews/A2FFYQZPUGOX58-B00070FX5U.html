<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray release - 2012"></head><body><p>Be aware, there is more than one Blu-ray release of this movie; at the time I bought this movie, Amazon listed three Blu-ray "Total Recall" releases:  2006,  2007 (Special Edition),  and 2012 (Mind-Bending Edition).  If you are new to Amazon, you may not have noticed that the reviews are all lumped together;  when checking out the reviews, you will find the version title just above the review's text.<br /><br />Lion Gate's 2012 Blu-ray release looks fine and I have no issues with this product.<br /><br />If you have never seen Arnold Schwarzenegger's version of "Total Recall", there are two things you should know.  Firstly, it is great science fiction.  It delves into the question of just who are we?  Are we the sum of our memories?  In "Total Recall" someone has replaced the memories of the main character, who believes himself to be a man named Quaid;  he still has the same skills, but his personality is different.<br /><br />Secondly, you should know this is a violent movie;  how violent?  There are many scenes in which you could use the words: blood, bullets, and breaking glass in their descriptions.  I counted 17 violent scenes, 16 which involve gunfire and one scene where death was meted out with sharp pieces of equipment and a fire axe.<br /><br />In spite of the violence, it is a well done action-movie, so riveting, so fast paced, that there is no time to get another popcorn. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 4.  Subtitles & Languages: English, French, and German;  Spanish is not included.  Bonus Features:  Schwarzenegger & Director commentary,  Director interview,  Special Effects,  Trailer,  Documentary "Imagining Total Recall", Restoration comparison, and Photo Gallery.</p></body></html>

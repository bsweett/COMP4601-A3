<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF ARNOLD'S BEST"></head><body><p>A MAN TAKES A DREAM VACATION TO MARS. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, HE LOSES HIS MEMORY. AND WITH SADISTIC VILLAINS AFTER HIM, HE MUST FIGHT TO STSAY ALIVE. THIS VIOLENCE-FILLED ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIE IS ONE OF ARNOLD'S BEST. FILLED WITH EXPLOSIVE ACTION, THIS IS A MUST-SEE MOVIE. IT'S TOO BAD THAT A LOT OF SCHWARZENEGGER'S RECENT MOVIES FAIL TO BE THIS GOOD. FOLLOWED BY A CABLE TV SERIES.</p></body></html>

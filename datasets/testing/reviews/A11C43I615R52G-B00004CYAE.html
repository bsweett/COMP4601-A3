<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Movie, Unnecessary DVD"></head><body><p>Mary Poppins is one of my all-time favorites. Is fantastic film that is perfect in every way. the actors are excellent, the animation superb and the songs are unique. five years ago, Disney released a 40th Anniversary Edition DVD with 2 discs. It was one of the best DVDs editions that Disney had released with everything that we need to know about the movie besides the fantastic restoration of the film.<br /><br />This January, Disney released a 45th Anniversary Edition. While some people like me will think that was too soon for another re-release, Disney as usual, wants to gain more profits. This new DVD has the same picture and sound than the original. Nothing is shinier, crispier or anything. Is exactly the same. Disc one holds the same bonus material as the 40th Ann. Ed. Disc Two presents us Disney on Broadway, a bunch of featurettes that shows us the new Mary Poppins musical. This is completely a waste. We are concern about the movie itself not the musical so this is unnecessary. The other bonus materials are the same that the ones in the 40 Ann Ed. But, in order to put this Broadway featurerette, Disney dropped some good material about the movie that are encountered on the previous DVD. This material is: a game (not such a loss), the deconstruction of a scene featurette that was fun but most important of all, the Party where it shows the party after the preimiere of the film in 1964. What a shame that they dropped this extras to put things that have nothing to do with the film. So this is a very unnecessary DVD so my suggestion is don't buy it, and if you haven't bought Mary Poppins on DVD yet, buy the 40th Anniversary Edition which is still available and is the same price of this new Edition.</p></body></html>

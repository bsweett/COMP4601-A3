Murray Abraham) and felt towards Mozart practically the same as Salieri did. 15 years later I watched the movie again. As I allowed myself to perceive it more in the position of Mozart, I couldn't help swinging my vote to Mozart this time. The more so as the movie depicted how Mozart, deprived of wealth and success, was initially reluctant to take a mystery man's proposal - to work on Requiem. He simply could not face his own demons and revisit his guilt towards his father, plus he lacked the energy to finish such a grand project. But for that promised pay, he took Saleri's bait, forced himself to meet the impossible deadline and work until his last breath. The final hours of Mozart was brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hulce. The last scene where Mozart was thrown into an unmarked mass grave was devastating.<br /><br />The script was ingeniously written and tightly knit. The music score powerful and touching. The movie presented sympathetic and unbiased views of Salieri and Mozart at the same time. Coupled with fine performances of the two actors, the movie allowed the audience to see and judge for themselves. Abraham's brilliant portrayal of Salieri won him the Oscar - Salieri could not accept how Mozart, in a life style so different from his, could write such magnificent pieces.  Consumed with envy, he set out to block Mozart from any recognition of his talent. Even to this extreme, he was Mozart's admirer as much as Mozart's enemy till the end, secretly watching Mozart's play, the Magic Flute, and eagerly helping Mozart record his last notes for the Requiem.<br /><br />The movie inspires. One Chinese proverb about two competing talents with only one as the ultimate winner can be adapted to the movie: "If Salieri is already born to this world, why bring Mozart also?" - a remark made by the loser as to his misfortune to be a contemplary of the winner and thus the loser failed to make his own mark in history. It also supports the idea "Who knows oneself better than one's deadliest enemy?" The movie also reminds me of the biblical parable of Lazarus and the wealthy man. While Lazarus, unlike his wealthy neighbour, was poor and constantly starving in his few days on the earth, it was Lazarus who was in Abraham's bosom to enjoy a happy after life while his neigbour suffered down below. Thus set eyes not just on the present but on the eternal. So went Mozart and Salieri according to the fiction and the movie.<br /><br />A great movie! Incidentally, 27th January, 2006 marked the 250th Anniversary of Mozart's birth.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alien variation"></head><body><p>I watched this with some trepidation, as Vin Diesel is not a great actor and most of the other films I've seen him in have been - well - awful. However, this film, rather like the Terminator films for Arnold Schwarzenegger, suited him perfectly and it was much better than I expected.<br /><br />Its a tense Sci-Fi/horror film in which a spaceship crash lands on a planet and the surviving crew have to contend with the planets less than pleasent inhabitants as well as Riddick (Diesel) who is a dangerous prisoner being transported on the spaceship. Riddick is no ordinary prisoner though, and because of their desperate situation the crew enlist his help to try and survive.<br /><br />Its all well done and in places pretty scary. The cast all give good performances and the director and cinematographer have done a fine job creating another world. Some of the camerawork in particular was cleverly done and this especially added to the tension in the film.<br /><br />Obviously it owes a huge debt to Alien and Aliens, but it is sufficiently original to hold up in its own right. OK it isn't as good as Alien or Aliens but if you watch this with an open mind you'll probably be surprised at just how good it really is.</p></body></html>

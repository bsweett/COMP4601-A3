<meta name="summary" content="A fierce, fascinating movie with a brilliant Natalie Portman performance."></head><body><p>BLACK SWAN is the story of a ballerina driven to insanity by her drive to succeed and to be perfect.  It's also one of the more purely fascinating movies of 2010.  Natalie Portman gives the performance of her career as Nina, the dancer.  Nina has been with the professional ballet company headed by Thomas (Vincent Cassel) for a number of years, and she's hoping this will be the year she gets a lead role.  He's reviving SWAN LAKE, and needs a new White Swan/Black Swan.  Nina is a technically proficient dancer who will do well as the prim, proper, chaste White Swan.  But where is her fiery passion and urgency that will be needed to play the Black Swan?  She doesn't dance with the lack of self-control that his character calls for.<br /><br />Portman's character is something of a clich&eacute;.  How many times do we see the driven perfectionist who can't let go and allow herself to let her feelings show because she's so concerned with getting the technical aspects perfect?  It's hardly a new idea.  Neither is the introduction of the character Lily (Mila Kunis), a carefree, full-of-smiles dancer who joins the company.  She isn't so dedicated to her art that she can't go out and party.  But she dances with the ease and passion that Portman cannot muster.  The two develop a tentative relationship...but is Lily really a fierce competitor, trying to psyche out Nina?<br /><br />And Nina doesn't need much mental manipulation.  She lives with her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer who babies and controls her daughter to the point of suffocation.  Nina is also mentally teased by Thomas...who tries to trick and manipulate his dancer into showing something new on stage.  To say that Nina puts tremendous pressure on herself would be an understatement.  She chews her nails and compulsively scratches herself, leaving tears in her skin.  And she sometimes sees things that aren't there.  Nina is tightly wound, neurotic and obsessive when the film begins.  As things progress, we can see, with great clarity, how she begins to lose herself more and more.<br /><br />I don't want to say much more, because the journey Nina takes is fascinating.  What's amazing to me is that this movie is really a potboiler or melodrama.  It follows a clich&eacute;d path, treads familiar ground.  Yet every moment of it feels new and real and dangerous.  Director Darrin Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER) has done an amazing job of constructing the film to feel like a deep psychological study and a period thriller at the same time.  It feels like something from the `60s or `70s and like something modern and edgy at the same time.  He has chosen to film in digital video, and for once, the low budget choice works.  The film has a slight darkness and fuzziness to it that only helps the mood.<br /><br />The screenwriters have also written about the details of ballet and SWAN LAKE in a way that lets viewers totally unfamiliar with the story have a good sense of what is going on.  We understand the show and what Nina is trying to achieve.  And for those many folks who say the ending is hard to figure out, I can only say, "you're trying too hard."  It is a fascinating and gripping ending...but it is quite clear.  Don't be turned away because you think you won't be able to "get" the film.  I found it surprisingly accessible.  My 18 year-old daughter had no trouble grasping it. (Although there was enough sexuality in the film to make me uncomfortable at having brought her.)  I didn't hear people grumbling on the way out of the theater either (and the place was packed, by the way...I think this little art film is going to make some pretty decent money.)<br /><br />And please don't miss it, because you'll miss some good (even great) performances.  Cassel is perfectly cast in the very clich&eacute;d role of the artistic director.  Pompous, self-centered and yet somehow alluring...we see the creative side along with his cruelty.  Hershey is frightening in her role...reminding me of Bette Davis in her BABY JANE days.  And Mila Kunis continues to tackle unexpected and challenging roles...and with BLACK SWAN, she has put her days as Jackie on THAT `70S SHOW behind her.  And Natalie Portman is a slam dunk for an Oscar nomination with her riveting performance.  She's on screen for the entire film, and must accomplish much of the dancing herself.  She looks weary, frightened, fragile, strong and dedicated.  Her work here is so accomplished and takes us on such a journey; I was exhausted by the end because the ferocity of her work gripped me so tightly.  It's easily the best female performance of the year.  For her work alone, the movie is worth seeing.  Fortunately, there's plenty else to enjoy in the gripping, highly-recommended BLACK SWAN.</p></body></html>

Ellis, 2003)<br /><br />The original Final Destination was a hackneyed, if clever, take on the slasher film-- what if the killer was Death itself? The surprise success of the movie, which gained an audience well beyond the usual slasher-film groupies, immediately had the studios hunting up ideas for a sequel. It should be no surprise by now that Hollywood + sequel = junk.<br /><br />In this one, one year to the day after the explosion of Flight 180, Kimberley Corman (Tru Calling's A. J. Cook) is on the way to Daytona Beach with her friends when she has a vision of a horrible accident on the highway, and refuses to budge from the on-ramp. Needless to say, the accident happens, and everyone who got stuck behind her on the onramp is now set to be stalked by Death. Kimberley and her new love interest Burke (Hart's War's Michael Landes), the cop who was trying to figure out why she wasn't merging, try to figure out how to cheat death, enlisting the help of Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the sole survivor of Flight 180. (Yeah, that confused me, too. There's an Alien 3-style revelation about Devon Sawa's character about a quarter into the movie.) Clear gets our old pal Bludworth (Tony Todd) involved as well, and we're off to the races.<br /><br />I have to admit, I give the movie grudging props for not going where I feared it was going to go (Tony Todd battling it out with Death in a steel cage match), but man. I can almost see the board meetings on this one. "So we have all these ideas for how to kill people. Story? Who cares?" And that's basically what you get. I also have to say that the final scene in the movie is worth the price of admission by itself. Which is good, because nothing else about the movie is. **</p></body></html>

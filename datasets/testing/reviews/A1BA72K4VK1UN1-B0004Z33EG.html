Here we have the very best of Stallone and a fine supporting cast. This is one of those films that will simply suck you right in to the very end -- a "page-turner" of a film. And if you're into SPECTACULAR cinematography, they pulled off a double-coup on this one! Action! Action! Action! No dragging! I have to restrain myself from watching this DVD more than once a month -- I don't want to get Stallone Burn-out. In summary, what more can I say? A troubled Vietnam Special Forces guy gets plenty even with small-town American idiots for not appreciating his service to his country, (and that of his now-dead peers!). If you liked "Walking Tall" and/or "Deliverance", it's the same sort of idea: justified revenge for atrocities on the "little guy." I guess my enthusiasm for this film shows what a regular Redneck I am way down under. Anyway, this one is a collectors' item, not a doubt of it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unmemorable!!!"></head><body><p>This is a fun and cute comedy with a great cast and beautiful scenery, but it drags on WAY too long, and ultimately ends up as an unmemorable waste of 2 plus hours. I know I would have liked it more had it been about 20 minutes shorter. Either way, this is worth seeing for fans of Diane Keaton, who just sparkles. Jack Nicholson is his usual self, but I LOVE Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand, who unfortunately, aren't given much to do. Keanu Reeves is less irritating than in his other films and luckily, has a small role. I'm glad I saw this, but it is way overhyped by critics. The usual formulaic Hollywood romance, only this time, the ones who fall in love are old.</p></body></html>

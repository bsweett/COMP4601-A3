<meta name="summary" content="Benefits from Multiple Viewings"></head><body><p>Had I writtent this review after the first time I watched this Tarantino splatter fest back in 1994, my rating would have been one star.  Apart from the unusual way in which Tarantino tied together and revealed the interaction of the stories out of chronological order, I saw nothing of even remote social redeeming value in the film.<p>Having not seen other Tarantino flicks at the time, I did not understand that Tarantino's medium always involves extreme, stylized violence, the more outrageous the better.  <p>Whenever my reaction to such an iconic film is so intensely negative, I always try to revisit the film at a later time, as much to understand the root of the phenomenon as to make sure my initial perceptions weren't skewed.  In this case, I believe they were, by the gratuitous and graphic violence and strong language.  Upon re-viewing the film, I discovered some of the subtler moments of really good acting, particularly Samuel L. Jackson's final &quot;Ezekiel speech&quot; in the diner and Bruce Willis' uneasy reconciliation with Ving Rhames after their encounter in the pawn shop.  These moments alone make the investment of time in the whole, lurid journey worthwhile.<p>While I was still utterly repulsed by Orlando Jones'character accidentally getting his grey matter spread across the interior of Jules' car, the perverse humor of this and other situations in the film were more amusing when considered in the context of what Tarantino was trying to present.  At first, I simply could not get past the combination of the temporal displacement of the exposition or initial shock value of the lurid subplots Tarantino's characters constantly found themselves in.  <p>Pulp Fiction is film that definitely benefits from multiple viewings--if you can stomach watching it more than once.</p></body></html>

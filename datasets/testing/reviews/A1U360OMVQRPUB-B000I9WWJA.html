<meta name="summary" content="Inside Man Turns Plot Inside Out"></head><body><p>Dalton Russell tells views in the beginning that he's going to reveal everything once only, and that the viewer had better keep up.  He and his gang of thieves infiltrate a large metropolitan bank and get caught inside.  Detective Frazier, who is struggling with an Internal Affairs problem of his own, as well as a girlfriend who's ready to tie the knot, gets called in to handle the negotiations.  Only the bank robbers aren't in any hurry to negotiate.  As the hours spin out, with SWAT teams ready to invade and a rich man growing more desperate by the minute, the plot twists and twists again as all of the characters play out their own agendas.  Frazier knows early on that this isn't a typical -- and may not be at all -- robbery.<br /><br />Spike Lee directed the movie.  He and Denzel Washington (Detective Frazier) have paired on MALCOLM X.  The director has had a string of movies, choosing material that he wanted to work with.  Denzel has been in MAN ON FIRE, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, OUT OF TIME, RICOCHET, JOHN Q, TRAINING DAY, THE BONE COLLECTOR, THE SIEGE, DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, and CRIMSON TIDE, all of which might be of interest to viewers of this film.  Jodie Foster has starred in FLIGHTPLAN, PANIC ROOM, and SHADOWS AND FOG.  Clive Owen has begun a successful American film career after enjoying one in England for several years.  He's starred in DERAILED, SIN CITY, and THE DRIVER.<br /><br />The movie progresses at a relatively slow pace, and doesn't really deepen any of the characters to any degree, but it does offer the viewer plenty of chances to guess what's going on.  The suspense mounts slowly, and the ending comes together in a manner that is almost anti-climatic.  The mood and atmosphere play out nicely, with enough characters introduced to make the situation even more complicated.  It's easy to watch and is entertaining in a what's-going-on way more than a thrill-a-minute way.  The film almost harkens back to the 1950s in its stylistic set-up and gentle, uncompressed storytelling.<br /><br />Once the movie is over, though, a thinking viewer will see a tremendous amount of plotholes as well as scenes that were actually distractions from the plot and red herrings to the mystery solvers.  But it did play fairly so that going back and putting the pieces together makes sense.  The final resolution of the stand-off at the bank was played almost too low-key to satisfy.  If it hadn't been for the question about what was actually going on still in play, viewers might tend to be disappointed.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN is a good movie for an evening home with a buddy who loves movies, or with a spouse.  Fans of Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, and Clive Own can see their stars in some of the best on-screen presence they've had.</p></body></html>

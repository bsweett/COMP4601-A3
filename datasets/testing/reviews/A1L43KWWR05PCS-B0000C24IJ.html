<meta name="summary" content="TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE LITE..."></head><body><p>I rented this film after viewing a trailer for it, because it had reminded me of two horror favorites: the film &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and an episode on the X Files about a backwoods inbred family.  I was not disappointed, as it certainly seemed to be a cross between these two favorites.<p>While there were no real surprises, other than a very effective opening scene, the production values were first rate. The inbred family was certainly creepy and their house certainly was appropriately macabre and revolting, as befits such a family that enjoys dismembering and eating their victims. It is these hospitable folks that Eliza  Dushku and her friends meet up with in the backwoods of West Virginia with predictable results. <p>The film simply offers a few thrills, some average acting, and, as I said, some first rate production values, thanks to film production veteran Stan Winston. It offers nothing more and nothing less, which is too bad, since it had those great production values going for it. The problem with the film is that it copied too much from other films without offering something of its own to give it that certain edge and make it memorable in its own right. Tobe Hooper did this better in &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, as did the X Files television show. Still, notwithstanding its predictability, fans of the horror film genre should find this film enjoyable. It is, at the very least, worth a rental.</p></body></html>

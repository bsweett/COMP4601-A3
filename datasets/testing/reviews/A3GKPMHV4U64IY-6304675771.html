<meta name="summary" content="John Landis's Horror Classic"></head><body><p>There may be a lot of comedy in this film, but it is really horror and tragedy.  As soon as one starts watching one can tell that this film will not have a happy ending (unlike Landis's Innocent Blood).<br /><br />A pair of young Americans are touring the English countryside when they fall afoul of a werewolf.  One winds up dead while the other is only wounded.  He wakes up three weeks later in a hospital to discover that there is some sort of coverup regarding what happened.<br /><br />The tending nurse falls for him while the doctor trusts the sincerity and looks into the events.  But the full moon quickly rises and all concerned begin to realize that something is very definitely wrong.<br /><br />The werewolf is a classic tragic monster and this film maintains that tradition.  No one asked to be a werewolf and they did not get that way through their own actions.  But this is not a typical werewolf film.  There is a higher degree of characterization and interaction than is usual.<br /><br />Landis fans will recognize his signature catch-phrase taken from the title of his "adult" movie attempt.  That movie is actually being shown in the theater where one of the film's important meetings takes place.</p></body></html>

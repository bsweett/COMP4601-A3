Arguably the best performer ever on "Saturday Night Live," Farrell has made a career out of bringing hilariously ridiculous characters alive.  Ron Burgundy is another such creation.<br /><br />Set in the 1970's, in an America on the cusp of new "fads" like feminism, jogging, and environmental awareness, "Anchorman" charts the fall and redemption of Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top anchorman.  As the title character, Farrell brings his unique brand of hilarious sincerity to one of his most befuddled characters.  Ask yourself -- could any actor bring more to the line, "San Diego, as everyone knows, was founded by Germans in 1904"?  If you love Will Farrell, you are sure to like, and quite possibly love "Anchorman."<br /><br />Burgundy and his "crack news team," which includes Paul Rudd as the horny roving reporter Brian Fontana and Steve Carell ("The Office") as weatherman Brick Tamland -- and Carell plumbs the depths of how low the bar is set for weathermen in San Diego, rule San Diego's TV screens.  But trouble hits paradise when Burgundy's boss Ed Harkin (played by the always perfect Fred Willard -- although he's given surprisingly little to do) is instructed by "corporate" to bring on . . . gasp! . . . a woman!  Yes, feminism hits the newsroom in the beautiful form of Ms. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, proving that she is worthy of overcoming her "Married With Children" legacy).  Can Burgundy and his pals tolerate this desecration of the male bastion that is the newsroom?  How can Burgundy reconcile his professional pride with his raging lust for the delectable Ms. Corningstone?  Can Burgundy woo the resisting Ms. Corningstone with his fiery jazz flute performance?  Of such false drama is hilarious comedy made.<br /><br />One can easily imagine Will Farrell and his buddies cranking this movie idea out over a long weekend of beer and pizza.  Many of the jokes are indeed inspired.  Look for some hilarious references to "West Side Story" as the news teams from different networks get together to "rumble."  Vince Vaughan leads the second-tier news team with comic timing that proves that "Swingers" was no fluke.  (From this insanely funny idea we get wonderful cameos from Luke Wilson as the anchor from the third-tier newsroom, from Tim Robbins as the anchor from PBS (of course), and from Ben Stiller as the anchor from the Spanish newschannel.  Genius!)  Who else could conjure up a cologne named "Sex Panther" that "smells like pure gasoline"?  Who else could dream up a beloved pooch who wears a head-gear retainer to bed and speaks with bears?  The comic talent at work here is dazzling (look for another inspired cameo from Jack Black, by the way).<br /><br />Still, at the end of the day, "Anchorman" leaves one unsatisfied.  Perhaps its because the movie is so darn short -- even the "uncut, unrated" version clocks in at barely over 90 minutes, and that's with filler.  True, a lean, mean comedy is better than a bloated gasbag, but this movie is so lean that it borders on emaciated.  Or perhaps it's because the cast of the movie is so darn good that the expectations can't be met.  Whatever the reason, "Anchorman" does not rise to the level of beloved comedies.<br /><br />Full disclosure -- I was on the floor laughing when Vince Vaughan's character was introduced as "Wes Mantooth," which is the name of one of my best childhood friends.  To hear that name attached to that character had me in stitches.<br /><br />Another point -- this is the "unrated uncut" version of the movie, but unlike so many other comedies, "unrated and uncut" does not translate into "more T&A."  I am not a prude by any means, but too many "comedies" use nudity to cover up the fact that the movie just ain't that funny.  "Anchorman" is refreshingly nudity-free, choosing to go for real laughs rather than blatant titilation.  The language, while coarse, also generally refrains from profanity, with one funny exception.<br /><br />Check out "Anchorman" for some huge, if isolated laughs.  I cannot say this is a "must for the film library," but you should definitely see it.</p></body></html>

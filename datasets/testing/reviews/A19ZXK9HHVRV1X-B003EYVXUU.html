But with "Let Me In," a remake of the highly acclaimed Swedish film "Let the Right One In," Hollywood finally gets one right.  This somber and chilling tale of a friendless, put-upon 12-year-old boy who becomes romantically (albeit platonically) involved with the vampire-girl next door emerges as a sort of antidote to the far more crowd-pleasing and commercially successful "Twilight" series, providing a more subdued and thoughtful variation on the same theme.<br /><br />Transferring its setting from Scandinavia to an equally frigid and snowbound Los Alamos, New Mexico, the remake remains true to the core elements that made the original such a quality film in the first place:  its artful tone, its unsensationalistic approach to its material, and its incisive look at what it means to be a misfit in a world in which conformity is prized above all else - and never more so than during adolescence.  For Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) are both outcasts from society, Abby quite literally since her condition makes it impossible for her to interact with others in any kind of meaningful way (except to devour their blood).  But Owen is no less of an outsider, since his diminutiveness, shyness and dreamy nature make him an easy and perpetual target for the town's bullies.  It's no surprise, then, that Owen and Abby eventually reach out to one another for love and acceptance, despite the seeming impossibility of their relationship.<br /><br />As a horror film, "Let Me In" doesn't hold back from showing us the requisite gore and grue that comes with the genre, but director Matt Reeve's script is far more concerned with the interaction among characters and the exploration of theme than it is with piling up easily achievable gross-out moments.  For instance, the gruesome task of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival helps to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.<br /><br />Smit-McPhee and Moretz are both superb as the inter-species Romeo and Juliet, and there's a fine supporting cast to boot.<br /><br />In this case at least, "Let Me In" is a command well worth obeying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This Is A Story of Jack and Diane"></head><body><p>Diane Keaton- I just love her! She is a fabulous actress who is able to take the screen as her own, and then slink off and we miss her.  Jack Nicholson is a superb actor who is bigger than life and knows it. He owns the screen.<br /><br />In "Something's Gotta Give" Jack plays a record producer who is always dating younger women. That seems to be Jack's persona. One of the young women he is dating is Diane Keaston's daughter. Diane is about to visit her daughter, at the same time that Jack is having a heart attack in the daughter's apartment. Diane and her daughter bring Jack to the hospital. and worry and fuss over him. For some inexplicable reason, Jack goes to Diane's beach home to recuperate.  Diane is a writer and is having some difficulty getting her story together. She and Jack share some time together, walk the beach, have some truthful moments. One night their romantic intentions turn into sexual love. Diane falls in love. Jack falls a little bit in love, but doesn't want this attachment.  They play cat and mouse for a year or two. Diane runs into Jack when he is with other woman. Jack finds he is having anxiety attacks that mask as chest pain and is at the local Emergency Department  every week. He receives advice that he should relax, take it easy. He sells his business and goes to the Caribbean, where he discovers after one day that he needs more in life. He does s a strange thing; he visits every woman he has ever had in his life. Most of these women slam their doors in his face. However, one or two tell him what life was like with him, and he listens.  Jack learns that he needs someone in his life, and he wants Diane, He follows her to Paris, where she is celebrating her birthday with another man. He braves the storm and wishes her well.  You know the rest- eventually they find each other, and fall madly in love.<br /><br />This is a romantic comedy that has many true moments. Most of the characters in the movie are overlooked for the two giants Jack and Diane, however, that is another movie. It is a great chick flick; more of a women's movie. Entertaining and fun. I saw this on a chilly autumn afternoon, with a roaring fire and hot chocolate- a perfect end to a perfect day.<br />Highly recommended. prisrob</p></body></html>

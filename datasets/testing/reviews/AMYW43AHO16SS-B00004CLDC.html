<meta name="summary" content="The best film of the 90's!!"></head><body><p>It's hard to pick what Martin Scorsese movie is the best.  As a matter of fact, "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" were the best movies of the previous decades.  When I first saw this movie, I thought it was brilliant.  Now, over 13 years later, this movie still holds up like "Citizen Kane".  Probably the best gangster movie of all time!!  And without question the best film of the past decade.<br /><br />UPDATE!!  I just purchased the Two disc DVD set of Martin Scorsese's finest work.  Scorsese and actors Lorraine Bracco and Ray Liotta gives some great retrospect on the grounbreaking film. There is also a few documentaries on life in the mob. But my personal favorite is the "real" Henry Hill and the FBI agent who help him turn in Jimmy Conway and Paul Cicero giving their observations on the DVD extras. This is a must-have for fans of the movie.<br /><br />Note: I still get a kick out of many of the actors in this film who would appear later on in "The Sopranos".</p></body></html>

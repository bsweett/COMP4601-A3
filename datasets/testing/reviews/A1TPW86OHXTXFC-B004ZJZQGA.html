Along the way, there are times of great sadness and poignancy, times of abandon, times of goofiness, and that kind of humor that is really funny because it grows out of character and close observation. Farrell in particular hasn't been this good in a few films, perhaps because this time he's allowed to relax and be Irish." Roger Ebert<br /><br />'In Bruges' is one of those films that surprises you around every corner. The first impression I had was 'I have got to visit Bruges'- the film depicts such a beautiful, medieval city and every scene has a new vista. The city seems to play upon the characters- the towers, the museums, the churches, the pubs, the cobblestone square, and the canals all feed in to give us a view of the mindset of the two main characters. Brendan Gleeson, a big hunk of a man who has a face like a map of the world. Every feeling, every expression is shown on his face. Colin Farrell, is a true Irishman, Bruges to him is a 'shitpot'. He is not a sightseer, nothing nice about the place, just wants a beer in a pub and to move on. Ralph Fiennes as the boss back in London, heard on the phone and finally seen.<br /><br />These two men Gleeson and Farrell are Irish hitmen. The premise is pretty simple. They kill and one of them made a mistake and killed a child. They have been sent to Bruges to hide. The boss loves Bruges, and this is supposed to be a treat. Well, it is for Gleeson, he is the inveterate sightseer and does all the spots and enjoys it. Farrell, on the other hand hates Bruges- hia scene is beer and pubs and he wants to go home.  He realizes some fun when he comes upon a movie being filmed. He makes friends with a young woman who supplies drugs to the crew, and a dwarf who is in a dream sequence. From there on the film moves from one surprise to the other.  We finally get to see Fiennes and his surprising personality. That is all I am going to say.<br /><br />This is a sharply written and  superbly acted film. As one of my other friend's review states- this is 'Pulp Fiction' with heart and soul.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-29-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844541711">Colin Farrell: Living Dangerously</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001BKBM0">A Dangerous Man</a></p></body></html>

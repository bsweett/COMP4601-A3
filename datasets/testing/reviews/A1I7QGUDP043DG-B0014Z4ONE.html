<meta name="summary" content="First one is the favorite, but get the set!"></head><body><p>The first Indiana Jones will always be my favorite. I was at an adventurous stage of my life when it came out, and the boulder rolling down toward him in the first scene only wet my appetite to go on Safari or tromp through a jungle for myself! The sequels are good too, and I like the interaction between Indiana and his father in the later movies. Their relationship adds more depth to the characters. And of course, a good love interest can always bring new twists to an adventure story.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

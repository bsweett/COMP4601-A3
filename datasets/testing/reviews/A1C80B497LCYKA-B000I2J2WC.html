Yes, it's very clever - clever enough to make him a lot of money. But it is poorly written in a skeletal sort of way - so void of fleshy detail that it reads like a movie script, which probably helped to convince Ron Howard that it would make a good movie. If Howard hadn't made a movie out of it, it probably would have been forgotten in five years or less, the way all fiction of this type is. Now, it could very well be remembered for ten.<br /><br />Mr. Brown has taken history with all its wonderful detail, disassembled and reconstructed it according to a fantastic plan to discount the Church and prove that Christ is not God. By redefining and reinterpreting everything that has happened in the past two thousand years - from events to symbols - Brown attempts to prove that Jesus married Mary Magdaline, and that she, not the chalice from the Last Supper, was the legendary Holy Grail. According to Brown, because they were married and had a child, the Church has spent the past twenty centuries persecuting women and killing off anyone that could prove the humanity of Christ, especially if they were one of his descendants. Thus, the stage is set for a fantastic mystery thriller.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard assembled the best cast and crew, the finest sets and locations, and everything else that money could buy in order to make this film live up to its namesake. He used many of the techniques he perfected in BEAUTIFUL MIND to recreate Brown's eerie tale of cover-up, secret societies, codes, treasure hunts, murder, and all the things that make good pulp fiction entertaining. His film is almost a page-by-page adaptation of Brown's novel. It's uncanny how true he was to it. As far as research and professionalism, Howard actually does his job far better than Brown.<br /><br />Unfortunately - or fortunately - the cast is drab, as are the sets and locations. The story itself gets so bogged down in all the explanations and revelations that, unless the viewer has read the book, he will probably be lost and confused. And when it's all over, the viewer is left with the feeling, "So what?" There is no satisfaction in learning Brown's thesis that Christ was just a man. When you've taken away the hope of the world, what else could you expect? Even from an entertainment standpoint, it is very unsatisfactory. There are a couple of suspenseful moments, but it isn't fun the way a real suspense thriller or murder mystery should be. There are just too many philosophical discussions and not nearly enough adrenaline pounding moments. There's not even a love story.<br /><br />To top it off, to anyone of faith, it's very disturbing. So, any way you look at it, except perhaps financial, the film's a flop - which makes me seriously doubt the rumors that they're planning a sequel. People may have watched the first one to discover what the hubbub was all about, but they won't make that mistake twice.<br /><br />What the book and movie do accomplish - other than making a lot of Christians mad - is to raise the question of how much facts and history can be changed to accommodate a story. After all, we're talking about fiction here. But this is light fiction that is playing with some serious facts and some monumental history; and not just any history: the history of the Church. More importantly, it is fiction that has changed Christ from being God to being just a man - so it's blasphemous fiction to boot. Three centuries ago, both Brown and Howard would have been hung, if not burned at the stake, for their "light fiction."<br /><br />Besides the blasphemy, what bothers me most is the fact that these works lack integrity. They don't respect anything or anyone. They casually misrepresent facts without any attempt at being accurate; but worse, they misrepresent the truth, without any attempt at being honest. Even a fiction writer has to be honest with his research in order to be believable. But this writer and director don't even make a pretense at it. And what's worse, most of their readers and viewers don't seem to care, which shows how far we've come in our own integrity.<br /><br />So, we have a book that is uninspired and pedestrian; a film that is dull and confusing; both of them without integrity, even blasphemous; and neither of them particularly entertaining, except on the most superficial level. Need I say more?<br /><br />Two out of five stars for the book (primarily for cleverness), and three for the film (primarily for production values).<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

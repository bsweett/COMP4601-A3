<meta name="summary" content="A Wild Ride!"></head><body><p>After 12 years, I finally got around to seeing this one.  I never figured my wife would enjoy it, but my stepson had it on DVD.  What a wild ride, with career rescuing or career establishing performances by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.  Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel, among others, add to the bloody, profane fun.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Area 51..The Movie"></head><body><p>It's too bad the creators/producers did not use the same type of grand scale destruction when they made GODZILLA two years later.  INDEPENDENCE DAY was a culmination of sci-fi movies up to that point taking parts of 1950's classic sci-fi, most notably WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then taking some inspiration from the 1980's television mini-series "V". Finally, using the modern special effects of STAR WARS. Also, the film used bits of modern conspiracy theories about alien abductions, close encounters, and government UFO cover-ups  (i.e. AREA 51 and ROSWELL) and aspects of modern technology (i.e. computer viruses and cable/satellite television).  The film is therefore, a little derivative in the overall plot of an alien threat from outer space bent on destroying the human race and taking over the Earth. However, what makes the movie work and memorable was the human element of the film with engaging and well-defined characters to care about.  From Will Smith's "Capt Steve Hiller", Jeff Goldbloom's "David Levinson", Bill Pullman's believable  "U.S. President Whitmore", Judd Hirsch's curmudgeon father to Goldboom's David "Julius Levinson" and finally Randy Quaid's crop dusting pilot "Russell Casse".  The list goes on as even the small support roles were handled great on the human level.  Lastly, the military and political characters were handled intelligently.  This is a crowd pleaser film and had the film been released after 9/11, it probably would have been more successful because of its sense of pride and patriotism themes.  There are some lapses in terms of resolving the alien threat in a mere few days.  When in terms of real human conflict, it takes months and years to resolve anything.  But, hey! This is Hollywood and it's only a movie...but what a movie!  Great production values, great casting and decent script makes I.D.4 one of the few modern sci-fi movies that would be considered a modern classic on an epic scale. The creators took on something old and made it new again. A film which demands repeat viewings for its overall feel-good aura.</p></body></html>

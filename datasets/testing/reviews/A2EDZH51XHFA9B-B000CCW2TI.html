What I find interesting is that the two movies aren't that far off from one another: full of young-and-beautifuls doing their thing, while we, the audience, are invited to watch.<br /><br />The main difference between the two movies is that Red Eye does not, thankfully, have a Kevin Williamson-penned script; most of Craven's troubles started when he hooked up with Williamson, and since 1996, Craven's movies have, to a one, been better when Williamson is not writing them. Here, teleplay writer Carl Ellsworth adapts his own short story. The good news is, it's not Kevin Williamson. The bad news, which isn't so bad, is that Red Eye reads, as one might expect, like an episode of your basic TV thriller.<br /><br />In this episode, Lisa (Rachel McAdams, of Mean Girls fame) is returning home after a funeral, rushing to catch the red eye. Typical airport stuff. She runs into a stranger-- I don't want to say handsome stranger, though I'm sure some folks will find him such-- named Jackson (28 Days Later's Cillian Murphy, who looks far better with a beard) a couple of times, then finds out he's got the seat on the plane next to hers. While every trailer, ad, and copy has told you what Jackson's deal is, why should I?<br /><br />There's nothing here you won't see coming a mile away, and actually, you've seen a good deal of it before. Craven, in his prime, could have still turned such a derivative work into a blissfully stylish Craven masterpiece; here, while his touch is certainly felt, it still comes off rather like a particularly brilliant episode of Magnum, P. I. ***</p></body></html>

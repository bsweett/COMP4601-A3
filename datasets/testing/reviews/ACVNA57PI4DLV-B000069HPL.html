<meta name="summary" content="A capitalist comedic masterpiece"></head><body><p>Peter is a cubicle worker who goes to see a hypno-therapist with his girlfriend and, as the therapist dies on the spot, is never awakened from his blissfull state. Subsequent events conspire to promote him, and with his two laid-off co-workers, he elaborates a plan to get rich : while uploading files for the Y2K problem, they include a virus-like program that takes rounded-off dimes from bank operations and puts them in their account, thus making them rich. But everything goes wrong, of course.<p>Office Space is definitively a hilariously funny comedy, from which it is difficult to extract boring or flat scenes. It is also a refreshing satire of anti-social views about the workplace, in a movie world where hatred of all things corporate is commonplace (which is to be expected, I suppose, given that no one in Hollywood needs to work in cubicles for a living, so they can badmouth it all they want). This is a very precious movie. Its only main problem is being too short - I was left off wanting more ! But that is, of course, a good thing.</p></body></html>

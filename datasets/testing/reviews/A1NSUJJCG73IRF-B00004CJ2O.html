<meta name="summary" content="Friday the 13th  (1980)"></head><body><p>Director:  Sean S. Cunningham<br />Cast:  Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Kevin Bacon.<br />Running Time:  95 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, gore, language, and mild sexual situations.<p>One of the more influential slasher films of all time, "Friday the 13th" was one of the few in the series that was moderately scary, used specific camera positioning and foreground for its scares, and possessed a fairly intelligent script.  A group of camp counselors are looking forward to their work at Crystal Lake campsite, only to hear the warnings from townies that they are in severe danger and that they should leave immediately.  Ignoring these threats, the teenagers live life as if they are no worries.<p>Their attitudes change when a maniac killer starts to knock off all of the counselors, each in a gory fashion one-by-one.  Adrienne King is the main scream queen, running around the camp finding dead bodies all over and finally encountering the killer and learns the truth of the systematic murder spree.  Excellent special effects by master Tom Savini and a tense, dramatic musical score, yet the performances are fairly laughable and the plot gets old quickly (which obviously means they should make nine more sequels!).  The final scene is absolutely terrifying!  Not one of the best, but still important to the genre.</p></body></html>

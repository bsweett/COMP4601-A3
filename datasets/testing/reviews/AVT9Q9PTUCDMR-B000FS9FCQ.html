<meta name="summary" content="flawed Orwellian comic book onscreen"></head><body><p>I'm tired with this whole "it's a graphic novel" nonsense, when really a graphic novel is just a fancy way to say better done "comic book." V For Vendetta has lots of great Orwellian type themes, but it still comes across as far too simplistic and dumbed down for the masses.<br /><br />First of all, if you can get past the ridiculous mask and '60s mop top Peter Tork haircut of V (and why in the scene at the pub when this V guy first appears that not a single patron makes as wisecrack about the fop in the ridiculous mask is so beyond me it's mindboggling).<br /><br />The action is definitely good. The casting is brilliant. John Hurt (hey, 1984 and all) as the Orwellian leader of Britain was perfect as was the SCTV-like telescreen he talks through. The Stephens--Fry and Rea--were inspired. Again Britain seems bereft of actresses such that yet another American must play an English heroine (Natalie Portman, come on down).<br /><br />As far as the extras, all you get is a 15-minute "Making Of" which is good but spends a little too much time trying to tell us how there are parallels in this graphic novel to the post-911 world. Sorry, but I get tired of this Conspiracy 101 drivel being spewed by anyone, and the fact this movie had virtually no impact at all on people's consciousness proves that that was a stretch (unless you now count donutheads at Occupy Whatever City wearing V for Venti masks)<br /><br />It's good fun to watch as long as you leave your brain cells at the door.</p></body></html>

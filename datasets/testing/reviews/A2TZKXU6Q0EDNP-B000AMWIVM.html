But the parallels are very obvious to anyone who's seen them.<br /><br />As 2 people wake up chained to the walls of a toilet of an abandoned factory with a corpse lying in the middle of the room, the expectable questions arise in their minds: "How did we get here". "What's going on?". "Who is that corpse". Soon they find out that they've become a central piece in the game of a psycho who's teaching them a lesson which they don't understand. We as viewers are given more clues to figure it all out than they have, but as the thread unreels we have a disturbingly lingering sense that what we are let to know is pure deception. Their choices? To either kill each other or free themselves by sawing off one of their chained legs.<br /><br />  Sounds like this could get pretty gory, correct? Not really, as the main premise of the "Saw" is a purely mental one, in the sense that it's more aiming to be a sarcastic mindgame on the viewer rather than a cheap thrill gorefest. The violence is mostly implied and the violent scenes are actually few (keeping in mind what this could've become).<br /><br />  The film succeeds with flying colours in its mission then, as noone will easily resist trying to find out who the evil game-maker is. But as the clues pile up and the atmosphere goes from dark to darker so do the twists. Speaking of twists, there are so many here that the script writer walks a very thin line actually. The storyline is in danger of tipping over any single minute but this is a job ultimately well done. Aside of one single plot mistake (albeit sizey)  that i spotted right at the very end, the rest of the film is actually rock-solid. And even this one mistake will be inevitably excused because "Saw" offers a tremendous ride throughout to those that like their minds tested.<br /><br />  This is then the best asset of the film. It's not just a mere "whodunnit" flick but also a very stylistic dark film that will surely enter the pantheon of great thrillers in recent time.<br /><br />  The atmosphere keeps being in heavy competition with the excellent plot and in the end noone really cares who wins that contest. You want to see the story unraveling and you become increasingly addicted to the darkness oozing out of the screen.<br /><br />  On top of that, with the exception of Danny Glover, the main characters are wisely chosen to be 2 not known actors who do a more than just decent job delivering their parts. The dialogue is up to par with the rest of the film and overall "Saw" wins the bet with itself in highly convincing fashion.<br /><br />  No need to get into the details of the plot here. If you were fascinated by the Usual Suspects and the Cube be sure to see this film. It will be right up your alley.</p></body></html>

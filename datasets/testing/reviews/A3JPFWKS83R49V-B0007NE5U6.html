<meta name="summary" content="This Bridget Jones Passes, but Barely"></head><body><p>What is a young woman supposed to do when she is torn between two lovers? That is the question posed by this movie, "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason". Renee Zellweger is back in the main role as Bridget Jones in this continuation of the original Bridget Jones from 2001. And this time around, she is forced to choose between her new lover, Mark, and her former lover, Daniel.<br /><br />This movie is the type that most will find agreeable enough to give it a chance, but it isn't as loaded with laughs as some viewers will hope. I found only a couple of scenes funny, and I started to wonder why the movie was billed as a romantic comedy. It is really more dramatic than humorous, and many of the attempts at humor are tired and worn out- the type of humor you hear over and over again in movies.<br /><br />I didn't care much for the storyline of this movie, mainly because it is so ordinary. How many times have we seen a movie like this- one that portrays a woman who is torn between two men, feels jealous about the new guy, but is still attracted in a strange way to the former lover, even though he has betrayed her trust in the past? It is the same old formula from Hollywood that we have grown to expect, but would like to see changed.<br /><br />I like the performances of the three main characters; Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant. They all bring a certain degree of charm to their respective roles and they all seem believable, although it is difficult to look at Hugh Grant as a bad guy. He just doesn't have a nasty- enough look to fulfill this role, even if his bad reputation is because of dishonesty in relationships.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent flick, and those who enjoyed the first Bridget Jones will probably like this one too. There isn't anything particularly memorable about it, but there is enough entertainment overall to make it worthy of seeing just once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid sequel to the Christopher Reeve movies"></head><body><p>I went into the movie with a lot of skepticism. Star Wars fans all seemed to hypnotize themselves into liking Revenge of the Sith, and I was concerned that so many comic fans liking the new Superman movie was something similar. In this case, I needn't have worried.<br /><br />In the end, I only have minor quibbles. Everything I was worried about (the kid, Lois being engaged) worked out great, the Super stuff was beyond awesome and the visceral impact of seeing Superman "return" five years after 9/11 was weirdly cathartic: I haven't been to a superhero movie where a lot of people in the audience were crying before, but people were absolutely bawling when Superman was re-revealed to the world after the first big rescue of the movie.<br /><br />Brandon Routh isn't the world's greatest actor, but neither was Christopher Reeve. But both had the decency that Superman (especially the Cary Bates-drawn Superman of the 1970s radiated) requires. Worst haircut ever, though.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth, while not my first choice for Lois, made the character semi-appealing to me for the first time ever (Action Comics was my very first comic book and I subscribed to Superman with my allowance money through the 1970s), although at the end of the day, she's still kind of a bitch. But Singer clearly saw Lois Lane as Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby, and Bosworth was even dressed the part. That sort of manic, well-meaning but steam-rolling character actually could make Lois charming, if the writing ever fully catches up to the interpretation (it never has in the comics -- there Lana Lang was always clearly the better love interest, Betty to Lois' Veronica).<br /><br />Kevin Spacey split the difference with Gene Hackman's over the top version of Lex Luthor (did I mention that this film is an explicit sequel to the Christopher Reeve movies?) and a more realistic Luthor for an audience that has seen Oz and the Sopranos. His comments about prison were a great grounding in reality and his personal attack on Superman at the edge of the cliff (you'll know it when you see it) is one of the great iconic images that I suspect will be recycled in the comic books for years to come.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was fine, although I think Frank Langella was badly miscast -- sorry, Frank, but you're a bad guy, not a generic cipher but generally friendly editor type. But boy, has Parker Posey fallen from her indie film queen days.<br /><br />Spider-Man's Daily Bugle was always more realistic as a newspaper (even if that newspaper was the New York Post) than Superman's Daily Planet, and this movie was the first time the Planet seemed like an actual newspaper (the LA Times, in point of fact, down to a lot of the decorations in the Planet building), although Lois asking questions that were answered in the press packet about the shuttle was annoying. (Although maybe only to me.)<br /><br />I think the twist everyone saw coming was handled very well, and Lois' fiance, rather than being an anchor around the neck of this film, actually added a lot to the proceedings from where I'm sitting, because it definitely gave the feeling that life had moved on and here was a guy that the audience couldn't really dislike and who fills the roles that Clark left empty in both of his personas when he left Earth. (It also proves that he annoyed me as Cyclops in the X-Men movies because Cyclops is annoying, not because the actor is. Cyclops has always sucked.)<br /><br />Without question, though, this is Superman at his most Super in any film or television show. Kudos to the creators for making it look hard for Superman, which isn't something that always happens in the comics.</p></body></html>

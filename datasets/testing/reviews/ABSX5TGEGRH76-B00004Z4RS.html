I'm glad I did, because this movie is great.  I guess the visuals are the real stars of the film, but the actors are still good.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are great as Proffesor X and Magneto, respectively.  Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is on the mark, and the character Toad (Ray Park) is cool in his own way.  The script is good for the most part, but it does have some clich&eacute;s, such as Wolverine and Cyclops fighting over Jean Grey, or Storm giving Wolverine a lecture about choosing sides.  Also, a few lines weren't written very well, especially when Storm is about to fry Toad with a lightning bolt.  She says, "Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?  The same thing that happens to everything else!"  I just don't see the threat.  But all of the jokes were great, my favorite being the "Middle Claw" with Wolverine.  This is a feast upon the eyes, and is very good for some laughs.</p></body></html>

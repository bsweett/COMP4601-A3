<meta name="summary" content="I  despise most family movies. They are phony  &  treacly"></head><body><p>with stupid, obvious humor so the kids, (& slow adults) get it.<br />But not this one. It's simply great. Adult enough yet it won't corrupt the kids. It's a long movie but doesn't seem long. As a director, Ron Howard rarely takes risks & he doesn't in Cinderella Man,  but still scores. Both stars, Russell Crowe & Renne Zellwegger wanted to do this. It wasn't just another job. Crowe might be the best actor of our time & is simply very believable as the humble, honorable, boxer, James Braddock. Renne Zellwegger is hot as his wife Mae. But she is not here for that. They are a loyal couple, in love & have three young kids. They are good people & excellent parents. Paul Giamatti does anther great turn as Jim's  agent, who never turns his back on his best friend. Crowe has several tender scenes with his little girl & little boy. These are done without schmaltz or self consciousness. That's acting. Howard gives us a good feel for the great depression that engulfed America. He captures the despair of the millions of people it ruined & beat down. The Braddock's were among these yet they had been prosperous in Jim's sucessful career. The depression came & Jim busted up his hand. He was just another, old broken down pug. He gets a second chance & rides it to the top. It's a love story about a committed couple, sticking out the bad times together. It's about their loyalty to each other & the loyalty of Joe, the agent & friend who never stopped believing. The only sour note was the treatment of Max Baer, the champ, Braddock beat. By all accounts, the portrayl as  a sadistic brute who enjoyed hurting his opponents (two died in the ring with him) was not true. License was taken because the film needed a villan. This movie is recommended for all. Also recommended are the extra on the dvd. Deleted scenes were shown with commentary on why they were not used by Ron Howard. This was very good & highlighted the fact that this was a well edited film. Other lengthy extras & a brief comments by the principals was also appreciated.</p></body></html>

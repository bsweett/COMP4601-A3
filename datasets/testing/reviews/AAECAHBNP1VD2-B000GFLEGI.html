If the pontificatiors would take the time to really learn about George Romero, they'd realize he'd be laughing like hell at all the analysis people attempt on his Dead films; they try tp pull them apart like the zombies pull apart some victims. Watch the extras, for God's sake.<br /><br />Yes, there's no doubt Romero injects social commentary in all his films, but especially the Living Dead series. He admits it readily and also explains that he never attempts to make it obscure or hidden, but totally accessible to anyone open to catching it.That's part of the beauty of the whole Dead series; they're simplistic horror films with some wicked comedic twists on one level, politico-socio comment on another. And unlike so many art-film wannabes, both levels are right out there; no digging necessary at all.<br /><br />While Land, granted, isn't equal to George's Dawn (the remake may have had a good cast and interesting new elements, but it still paled next to the original)or the film Day was initially intended to be, it's still an enjoyable romp that has the master's hand all over it, and that proves that the inventor of the genre is still it's best interpreter. And despite the Dawn remake and 28 Days' super-speed zombies, George proves again that the original official ghoul shuffle is still the best and most effective.<br /><br />Bottom line: don't try to dissect this. Just enjoy it.</p></body></html>

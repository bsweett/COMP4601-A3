The ending will shock you to pieces. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film.</p></body></html>

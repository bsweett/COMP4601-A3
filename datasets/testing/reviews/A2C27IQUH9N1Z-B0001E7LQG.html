<meta name="summary" content="Nicholson and Keaton shine"></head><body><p>Nancy Meyers (What Women Want) wrote and directed this charming romance starring Diane Keaton as a successful but lonely playwright and Jack Nicholson as a successful music producer who has never dated a woman over 30.  Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves handle their supporting roles quite well, though the storyline for their characters is not as well written, and Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau are terrific in their small parts but are, unfortunately, underused.<p>The true pleasure of the film lies in the interactions between Keaton and Nicholson, who make you appreciate what good acting is all about, even as they make it look easy.  They are terrific onscreen together.  The film holds together just fine until the last half hour, when the action moves to New York and becomes less intimate, and the ending is much too trite and tidy.  Nonetheless, I would recommend the film based on the first two-thirds, which are completely enjoyable.<p>The film can be heard in English or French, and can be subtitled in English, French or Spanish.  Extras include two commentary tracks -- one with Meyers, Keaton and producer Bruce Block, and one with Meyers and Nicholson.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding horror thriller!"></head><body><p>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a very successful NYC Wall-Street yuppie in the 80's, he's got a wealthy lifestyle, a great apartment, nice taste in music and a beautiful fiancee named Evelyn (Reese Weitherspoon). He seems like a perfect man for any woman but underneath that skin he is a vicious coldblooded murderer that loves taunting, raping and mutilating his victims especially keeping their bodies in the closet but how long can he bring back his sanity?<br /><br />A chilling and ultraviolent horror thriller based on a novel is quite an interesting and gory satire on yuppies in the 80's, there's quite a bit of sex such as the gorgeous Reese Weitherspoon half naked in one scene and of course graphic violence like nailgun massacres, chainsaw murders and that kind of thing. The film co-stars Jared Leto, Josh Lucas and William Defoe in fine acting roles in this picture, it's one of the best horror-thrillers of the 2000's and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre plus the soundtrack is great.<br /><br />This special edition DVD contains the unrated uncut version and remastered picture and sound with nifty extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, "American Psycho: From Book to Screen" three part featurette, an Essay on the pornography of killing, TV Spots and Trailers, and "The 80's: Downtown" featurette about the 80's.<br /><br />Also recommended: "High Tension", "Maniac (1980)", "Driller Killer", "Saw Quadrilogy", "Psycho (1960)", "Psycho II", "Psycho III", "Psycho IV: The Beginning", "Hostel 1 & 2", "House of 1000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects", "Scarface (1983)", "The Burning", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", "The Untold Story", "Misery", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series plus 2003 remake and The Beginning", "Office Space", "Vertigo", "Funny Games", "Black Christmas (1974)", "Silent Night Deadly Night", "The Shining", "Nightmare (a.k.a.

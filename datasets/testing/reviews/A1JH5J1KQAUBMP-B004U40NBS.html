She is completely natural in a very demanding role that included doing much of her own dancing.  Director Darren Aronofsky reveals Nina's character to us gradually.  At first, she seems like a very together young lady with a supportive mother (Barbara Hershey) and a dream job, but we soon begin to learn that there is much more going on beneath the surface.  Aronofsky's approach allows us to make these discoveries for ourselves rather than laying it all out for us.  At times, we are not sure what is fantasy and what reality.  I felt he stumbled a bit at times (possible minor spoilers here) with some scenes of physical transformation and some business with her mother's paintings that contrasted in a jarring fashion with an otherwise subtle yet devastating portrait of obsession.</p></body></html>

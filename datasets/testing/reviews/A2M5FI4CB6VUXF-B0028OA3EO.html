<meta name="summary" content="Great Acting, bad plot"></head><body><p>Brandon Roush and Kevin Spacey lead a very able cast in a less than able movie. The script/plot was horrible and unbelievable. You don't really get to see astronomers FINDING Krypton... and how can they find what isn't there? The world was destroyed.<br /><br />Having Superman leave should have been motivated by something more believable. Maybe some other Kryptonians survived and were thriving in another distant civilization or whatever.<br /><br />The point being that this plot failed from its very inception. Frank Langella made a great "Daily Planet" Editor and the rest of the cast were very well played. But the movie didn't give you any information about the Christopher Reeve series. My son kept asking me questions that would have been answered had he seen the Christopher Reeve movies first. If you're going to make a movie for a new generation, to try and revive a love for Superman, it's best to return to his roots.<br /><br />You can always send him on a different mission later, but when introducing Superman to a generation that wasn't alive in the 1970's and 80's you need to give them background on how he became Superman to begin with.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better traps, more gore, awesome surprises"></head><body><p>Many films lose steam by the third installment - but not SAW III.  The script is as tight as the first two installments, and the gore even better!  John is back, with sidekick Amanda, and new victims are set up for deadly misadventures.<br /><br />John kidnaps a doctor to take care of his cancer, linking her by a collar to his heartrate.  If he dies, she dies.  Meanwhile, a new victim must fight his way out of a maze compromised of other victims, victims who were indirectly or directly responsible for killing his son in a car accident.  Think pig guts!!  Amanda has some new colors to show.  Let the games begin.<br /><br />What great traps we have here!  Any horror or gore fan is going to absolutely love the pig-guts vat (nasty!), but we have chest-rippers, ice showers (close the door, its cold in there), "The Rack" (John's admitted favorite), explosive collars, and shotgun tubes.<br /><br />This movie is a "Do not miss!" for any horror aficionado, but if gore makes you queasy, you'd best stay away.  For the true horror fan, if you put butter on your popcorn, throw a little red dye into the melted butter for that added sicko effect, and ENJOY this 10 star gore fest!</p></body></html>

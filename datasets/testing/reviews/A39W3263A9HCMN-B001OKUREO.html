<meta name="summary" content="Am I missing something?? Did the above 2-star reviewers actually see this movie???"></head><body><p>The only reason I gave this 2 stars and not one star is because of Josh Brolin. And did Chris Crocker write the script? Because this movie is too sympathetic. In fact, it should be called "Leave Bush alone!". Granted, Brolin's performance is great. It's almost like watching George W. himself play the role.<br /><br />I agree this movie had lots of potential. It's a look at George W. Bush's presidency, and I admire Stone for trying to do that. Howver, just because you did it with "JFK" (which is a fantastic movie IMO), doesn't mean you should do one for Bush. That said, this movie fails to reach its potential because the whole time it seems as if it's trying to get us to sympathize (sp?) for Bush.<br /><br />There are some good moments in the film and they do highlight some of the actual events in Bush's reign. But other than that, unless you actually do sympathize for Bush, this movie is a complete waste of time.</p></body></html>

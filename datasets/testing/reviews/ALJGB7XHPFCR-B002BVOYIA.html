Living in United States, it is unbelievable how our media and government 'selectively' chose to ignore this massacare. That's when you question the objectives of governments who want to 'free' other countries from 'opression' of dictators and genocide. Where were these guys when 1 million people lost their lives in Rwanda? Perhaps, 1 million rwandan lives meant nothing to them and in future the countries from which we have nothing to gain will remain sub-human and meaningless to governments like ours. Don Cheadle gives the performance of his lifetime, before this I thought he was best in Out of Sight, but the performance in Hotel Rwanda overshadows the one in Out of Sight, and all of his other movies.</p></body></html>

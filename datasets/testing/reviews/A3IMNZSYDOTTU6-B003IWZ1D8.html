<meta name="summary" content="The Only Thriller You Need To See...Hitchcock's Best..."></head><body><p>Alfred Hitchcock was a true genius in terms of making a good thriller or horror film, and he invented the slasher genre for many filmmakers to follow. PSYCHO is the ultimate testament to that, and along with THE BIRDS, established Hitchcock as a true visionary with the movies.<br /><br />Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane (with such gusto too!), a woman unhappy with her job at a real-estate establishment. But when a man comes in with a bunch of money to invest, Marion suddenly develops other ideas on her way to the bank and decides to run with the money, ultimately changing the outcome of her life. She runs into the police, but nothing happens and she heads to the Bates Motel, where she meets Norman Bates (played perfectly by Anthony Perkins) and is completely unaware of his evil nature.<br /><br />One of the most shocking happenings of the movie is the killing of Marion only 30 minutes into the movie, something no bold filmmaker (except Hitchcock) would dare do. The rest of the movie unravels the madness of Norman's world and the madness of his mother, and you'll find not what you're expecting. The end shot of the film of Norman's face features a creepy on shot of a superimposed skull and it will leave chills on you.<br /><br />When Hitchcock made PSYCHO he made sure that all the theater owners closed the doors after the movie started to make it an enormously successful device, and it worked. PSYCHO is not only a masterpiece, but a lesson that sometimes the person next to you might not be who you think they are. Definitely a must-own, a must-buy, and a must-see!</p></body></html>

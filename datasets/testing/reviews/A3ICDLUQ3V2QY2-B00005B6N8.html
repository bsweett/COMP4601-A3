It makes a whole-hearted effort to recapture the horror, claustrophobia, and emotional turmoil of Ridley Scott's &quot;Alien.&quot;  But it just fails.<p>There are two basic problems with this film.  First is the monster.  In &quot;Alien,&quot; we had a man in a suit; in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; we have computer-generated creatures.  The Alien, designed by H.R. Giger, actually looked like it was in the environment, because it was, giving the actors something to react to.  The creature in this film, by John Cox's Creature Workshop, doesn't, despite a marathon technicial staff.  It's entirely too obvious, too often, that the actors are reacting to the air, expecting the thing to be matted in later.<p>The other problem lies with the characters.  The actors themselves do an admirable job, reflecting the known skill and acclaim of folks like Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, and Keith David.  The problem is that we have no sympathetic point-of-view character to hold onto, and thus we don't much care if they live or die.  The only characters we have who aren't at least somewhat objectionable are a group of Muslims on the hajj, and as most of them have no English, they can't serve as the audience surrogate in the action.<p>The movie is, mostly, visually beautiful.  The location work, shot in the same desert as &quot;Mad Max,&quot; makes for wonderful atmospherics.  The shift from relentless sun to total darkness (think Asimov's &quot;Nightfall) is done mostly well, with a few scientific errors easily overlooked in a movie.  And the creatures, when they hold the screen themselves, are remarkably well done.<p>This doesn't make up, however, for the manifest weaknesses of this film.  It tries to hard to ape elements of successful past sci-fi horror, and it just doesn't hold up.<p>A sequel is due out next year.  Here's hoping we're at least given a POV character we can hang onto and understand.</p></body></html>

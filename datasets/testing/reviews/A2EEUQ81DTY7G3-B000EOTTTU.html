<meta name="summary" content=""We will build a new world""></head><body><p>When the native Algonquin tribe looks out over their unspoiled Eden and sees two British navel ships, their reaction is a mixture of interest and astonishment. Who are these strange men who have landed on their shore, with their white faces, lank hair and strange smells? Yet their thunderstruck reaction to the Englishmen who are slowly infiltrating their land is laced with concern that has yet to blossom into worry.<br /><br />The English convey that lands in Virginia in 1607 - scored to a gorgeously striking flourish of horns - will spell doom for the native Indians; and over time their way of life, their culture will gradually disintegrate. The Jamestown colonists, led by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) eventually lands his men, intent for them to eke out a life in this strange and lush world.<br /><br />For Jamestown - named after King James 1 - will be the new, enlightened, and egalitarian society, free from the suffocating social strictures of merry old England. When Newport promptly vanishes back to England for reinforcements, the settlement's security is placed in the hands of the formerly disgraced Captain John Smith (a very good Colin Farrell).<br /><br />However, things aren't going well for this fledgling colony - the landscape proves to be harsh, food becomes scarce, with these inexperienced European outcasts beginning to wonder of they will ever be able to survive in this alien world. In search of food, Smith leads an expedition up the Chickahominy River, but along the way when a Powhatan tribe attacks his group and he is taken prisoner.<br /><br />Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg) is prepared for slaughter Smith, but at the last minute Pocahontas  (Q'orianka Kilcher), intervenes and his life is spared. Powhatan agrees to let him remain and teach the princess his language, hoping that her friendship with the Captain will tell him of the visitors' intentions.<br /><br />But as Smith familiarizes himself with the ways of the tribe he considers the possibility of staying on to live among them. He's fallen in love with the princess, who passionately requites his feelings and he sees in their civilization - a lack of greed, vice and cynicism, a new way of being that is lacking in his own.<br /><br />The New World is a gorgeously evocative, sad, heart wrenching and bittersweet movie, with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki capturing the epic grandeur and luminosity of the 1607 Virginia landscape in all its sensual glory. Terrance Malick's direction is languid and fluid - there's not a scene, or a camera angle wasted, as he allows this incredible cinematic experience to gradually unfurl.<br /><br />Watching this beautiful movie unfold conveys the strangeness and magnitude of human history, the weight of human endurance and the power of compassion and love. As Pocahontas is betrayed by her tribe, banished by her father and sold to the settlers as insurance - the slow transformation of her into a corseted and heeled Englishwoman, where she says good-bye to her native roots - is at once tragic and profound.<br /><br />When she eventually meets tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and he asks her to marry him, we know that the transformation of the princess is complete. Although she does not immediately love him, the scenes between them are tentative and caring. The acting is superlative with Farrell, Bale and Kilcher making the most out of their mostly non-verbal roles, providing essential voice-overs as the action progresses.<br /><br />The New World is a languid and lovely dreamscape, a movie of symphonic proportions, a work of breathtaking imagination, and an all-embracing cinematic tone poem. And the use of Mozart's 23d Piano Concerto alerts us to the fact that this is European dream, even John Smith's dream; it's also the dream of a utopian "new world," and where the hopes of a new beginning are dashed, where perhaps victory can only come in the form of a splendid and divine savagery.

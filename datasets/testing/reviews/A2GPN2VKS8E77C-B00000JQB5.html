<meta name="summary" content="An Enjoyable "Horror" Film. More Of An Action-Adventure, With A Dash Of Comedy. An Ideal Popcorn Flick."></head><body><p>This remake of the studio's 1932 film starring Boris Karloff (fresh off his success as the Creature in "Frankenstein" the previous year; Kenneth Branagh's 1994 film version, starring Robert DeNiro as the Creature and Branagh as Victor Frankenstein, is more faithful to Mary Shelley's Gothic story, written in 1818) is a fresh and fun-filled ride you'll want to take again and again. Brendan Fraser ("George Of The Jungle") is an Indiana Jones-type soldier-turned archeologist when a librarian (Rachel W.), due to her brother's (John Hannah) greed, accidentally stumbles upon a map revealing the location of an ancient city. The trail leads them to Egypt, where...I won't say anymore. The sequel is just as entertaining, as well as the prequel (which Sommers didn't direct, but stayed on as producer). All three films should have been rated PG for action-violence.</p></body></html>

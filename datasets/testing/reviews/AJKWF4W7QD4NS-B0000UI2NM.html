<meta name="summary" content="Derivative shlock thriller"></head><body><p>A skin tight leather clad Kate Beckinsale stars in this derivative mess which tells the story of a thousand year plus war between vampires and werewolves.  Beckinsale is a vampire, or a "death-dealer", who hunts werewolves down.  One night she discovers a group of them chasing a seemingly normal young man (Scott Speedman), followed by a plethora of derivative action scenes, campy over-acting, and one too many loose ends and plot holes.  On the outside, Underworld is a stylish thriller that boasts a very attractive female lead, although Beckinsale's true acting talents aren't entirely put to use.  Speedman is wasted as the hapless sap who just happens to be the right guy at the wrong time.  The special effects (especially the werewolf transformations) are phenominal; these effects have come a long way since The Howling.  Other than that though, Underworld is just a mess.  The action scenes seem to be derivative hybrids of The Matrix, Blade, Resident Evil, and a mess of other action/sci-fi/horror films.  Plus, by the time the credits start rolling, we are left with one too many loose ends and questions, plus an ending epilogue that automatically opens the door for an inevitable sequel.  All in all, Underworld had a load of promise, but in the end it is just another derivative thriller.</p></body></html>

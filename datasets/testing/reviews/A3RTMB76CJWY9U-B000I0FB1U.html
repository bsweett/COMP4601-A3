It's not awful. Instead, it's a harmless little comedy that won't change your life, but will give you a smile or two.<br /><br />Nacho Libre concerns the adventures of Mexican monk Ignacio (Jack Black) who has always dreamed of the fame and fortune of being a luchador (the Spanish term for a professional wrestler). The intense poverty of the orphanage he works at eventually inspires him to pursue that dream, but he must maintain a double life to do it as wrestling is considered ungodly by the monastary and, more importantly, by the nun Ignacio has a crush on. Along the way, Ignacio befriends a tag-team partner named Esquelito and runs into a fearsome rival, the gargantuan luchador Ramses.<br /><br />It's fun. The jokes run from good to very lame, and some of the scenes will leave you scratching your head. The direction isn't brilliant, and might disappoint fans of Jared Hess' earlier work, the cultishly-popular Napoleon Dynamite. There are some sequences that seem to be missing from the film. For instance, it would've been nice if Hess had included a scene that would introduce lucha libre (Mexican pro wrestling) to the general crowd, and establish some of the rules, etc. Myself being a professional wrestling fan, I was already very familiar with lucha libre, but I was uncertain as to whether a non-fan would understand what was going on.<br /><br />Jack Black is his normal, comedic self, and that's a good thing. His energy keeps the movie going through some of the stranger bits and lame dialogue. Jack Black fans will probably not consider this one of his best films, but they won't be ashamed of it, either.<br /><br />All in all, this is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. The comedy is harmless and fine for children, as the violence is all cartoonish and there's really no sexual situations or heavy language to speak of. A decent comedy that pretty much lives up to realistic expectations. Three stars.</p></body></html>

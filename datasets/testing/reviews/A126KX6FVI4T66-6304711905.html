K. Corral.<br />In the traditional version his brother is shot before the O.K. Corral.<br />In most versions we never see what happens to Doc Holliday or hear about how Wyatt lives to a ripe old age in California.<br />So this version my well be closer to the actual historical events than most of these movies.</p></body></html>

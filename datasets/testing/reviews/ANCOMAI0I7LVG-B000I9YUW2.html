She has a strong fan base that glorifies her with godlike titles and stand behind her work one-hundred percent.  She may be a good actress, but I present to you exhibit A as proof that she is a dumb one.  I don't know what distresses me more about `The Forgotten', the fact that I expected more out of the plot or the fact that I expected more out of Moore herself.  I remember vividly when this film was released and being intrigued by the way the trailer emphasized the creepy atmosphere of the film, and atmosphere this is all but absent in the actual film.  I remember being excited by the premise, a premise with lots of potential that quickly evaporates in the climatic scenes and fails to live up to its potential.  I remember saying to myself, Julianne Moore is supposed to be a good actress, a great actress even so this has got to be good.  Like I said, good actress or not, this film is just one of many that prove she's pretty stupid.<br /><br />`The Forgotten' plays out like a C-Grade alien flick complete with fields of tall grass (you ever notice how they always tend to show up in alien films).  The story revolves around Telly Paretta, a young woman who has lost her son in a plane crash.  She's still in the thick of the grieving process and has to see a shrink to help deal with the pain.  She spends hours in her son's room looking through his things, feeling his baseball glove, staring at his photographs until one day they all disappear.  There is nothing in his drawers and his face has been removed from all the family photographs.  She thinks her husband is trying to force her to move on but he insists that she never had a son, that she had suffered a miscarriage and has been pretty much batty ever since.<br /><br />The remainder of the film consists of Telly and another grieving parent Ash trying to find their children they claim have been taken from them.  The feds are after them and so they must stay in hiding, and then there's this strange man who keeps showing up, a man they are just certain had something to do with their children's disappearance.  The film to me starts to fall apart the minute Telly's husband forgets who she is.  To me that was just too far because it really has nothing to do with the end result of the film.  This is about a world forgetting about a child and a mother being the only one to remember him.  Having her husband forget who she is was just out of place and unnecessary.  Maybe it was just a way to eliminate the need for his character anymore, but it was just stupid.  In fact, the character of Ash as well was a little to open ended.  He really has nothing to do with the final outcome.  This is a story about Telly and having another parent, especially a male, going through her turmoil was pointless.<br /><br />I think what really did it for me though was the way the film ends.  We're waiting for this explosive conclusion, something really earth shattering and in the end it's utterly disappointing.  It leaves the audience feeling ripped off, seriously ripped off.  The alternate ending provided on the DVD is even worse than the one used in the film.  I'll say this, to me this film works like a loose plot build around a cool special effect.  It's almost like some kid was sitting at his computer messing with some video feed and figured out a way to make people fling carelessly into the sky and said "this would look awesome in a movie" and so they found a way to use it.  And that's just it.  The scenes where people are being extracted into space is actually pretty cool, especially when the whole cabin room flings off, but aside from a cool special effect `The Forgotten' is a forgettable mess of C-Grade cinema.<br /><br />Sorry Moore, but in this case less, or none at all, would have been preferable.  Here's to hoping you smarten up because what I saw in `Far From Heaven' or even `Boogie Nights' is far removed from the poor excuse I see in this drivel.<br /><br />*I just want to say that I'm really struggling with a rating for this film.  I can see how some would find some satisfaction within but overall it is a messy and somewhat boring endeavor.  I'm going with 2 stars against my better judgment (my instinct says 1) based solely on the fact that those special effects are spectacularly used and Dominic West actually does some convincing acting no matter how unnecessary his character really was.*</p></body></html>

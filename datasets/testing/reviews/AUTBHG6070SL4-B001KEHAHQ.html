As a result, remakes often fall short of the level defined by the original. Steve Martin's remake is a unfortunate demonstration of that phenomenon.<br /><br />The original was clever, sophisticated, and drily witty. Martin plays Clouseau with broad physicality, funny accents, and a bit of potty humor. In other words, the exact opposite of Peter Sellers. It's like a Barney sing-along trying to imitate Placido Domingo. When called by this panther, don't anther.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Imaginative And Multi-Layered Fable Of A Movie"></head><body><p>Although it's another genre-bender, writer/director M. Night Shymalan's "Lady In The Water" represents a significant departure from his other movies.  While films like "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village" were dramatic horror-thrillers, "Lady" pulls back the reigns on the frightening and 'traditional drama' elements, and adds in fantasy and a soft humor to its thriller core as the other main ingredients.  Of course, like the director's other movies, it also adds in dashes and undercurrents of other styles, but in essence it's the shift from darker territory into something more fairy tale-like that gives this one its unique identity.<br /><br />  The manager of an apartment building (Paul Giametti) finds, in the swimming pool of the building, a water nymph in human form (Bryce Dalls Howard).  Coming from an alternate world called 'The Blue', the nymph (named Story) has been sent to our world at this crucial time in human history to deliver a message to someone who's destined to play a pivotal role in the near future.  Story doesn't know who this man or woman is, but is supposed to be able to sense it when she encounters them.  And the quest to find this person is the basis of the movie.  Complicatinng the mission is that the nymph hasn't come into our world alone, but has been followed by malevolent predatory creatures (I think they were called Narfs, but I'm not certain) that can perfectly blend into grass and other greenery and emerge either stealthily or explosively.  These beasts were comvincing and highly original, and could have been used to greater horror effect, but "Lady In The Water" went subtle on the darker elements so as to open the movie up for little kids to see too.  Not a bad decision at all, although it would still be cool to see the Narfs turn up in another, more horror-oriented movie - not a sequel necesarily, just something that shares the same mythology.  The building that most of the movie centers around is populated by an interesting ensemble of characters, most of whom have some eccentricity or other to them.  These players are drawn in, first as Giametti and Howard 'scout' different people to see if they're the one, and later as a number of them are recruited into the quest.<br /><br />  When this came out last year, an awful lot of the pre-release talk focused on the lack of big marquee-name stars, and on the fact that Shymalan himself was cast in a significant role.  Interestingly, relatively few people seemed to want to discuss whether the performers who were cast did good jobs (which they all did, Shymalan included), just whether the abscence of household-name performers would hurt the movie's box office (uh, that one was an affirmative too, unfortunately)  Kind of indicative of how the peripherals surrounding a movie (who got payed what; what the studio's marketing strategy is going to be, etc.) seem to be getting bigger than the movies themselves at least in the eyes of a lot of the media outlets.  But I digress.<br /><br />  "Lady In The Water" is a great, original fable, drawing elements from enough different styles of moviemaking and storytelling that it should be pleasing to a wide range of tastes.  Not only thought-provoking but dream-provoking, this one makes a great addition to any DVD collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining in a way that only Tarantino can entertain"></head><body><p>This movie has the feel of a comic book brought to life (in fact, the first half of the movie actually has a segment consisting of comic book animation). This stylistic choice enables Tarantino to present a lot of potentially very disturbing material, especially abundant violence in Volume 1, while making this material reasonably palatable (and I generally don't like watching violence). It also gives the movie a sort of surreal and twisted feel which makes the movie suprisingly engrossing. On the other hand, the plot and characters are relatively cartoonish (though the acting is solid), and I didn't really discern much deeper meaning in the movie, despite a total running time of about 4.5 hours. In short, this movie is entertaining in a way that might even tempt you to watch it more than once, but don't look for anything more than entertainment.</p></body></html>

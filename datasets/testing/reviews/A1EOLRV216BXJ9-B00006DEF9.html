<meta name="summary" content="Extreme High Quality DVD"></head><body><p>Singing in the rain is probably the highest quality DVD I've ever had. Its luscious, saturated colour, enchanting songs, performances of the dedicated talents and wonderful script all make it a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />The trivia behind the scenes are actually equally amazing. Special salute to Debbie Reynolds (19 year-old then) who danced and sang her heart out to meet high expectations, suffered great fatigue and feet injury after numerous takes. Story had it that Debbie Reynolds, after being told that she was not able to dance, had the advice and help from Fred Astaire to pull it off. To Donald O'Connor, at the age of 27, who still ran up the wall and performed a somersault, repeated the demanding act several times on screen, only to be hospitalised and later found he had to do it all over again after the film negatives were lost in a fire. To the uncredited choreographers who also dubbed the tap dance. Behind the glorious feeling and sunny mood of the film were total dedication and committment of these admirable talents. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won my sympathy as the self-conscious arrogant but stately star from the silent film era. It's no concidence her sharp voice echoed that of Judy Holiday in Born Yesterday. Jean was Judy's understudy in Born Yesterday the stage play. It's easy to get all the glory for being the leading role, yet Jean hagen and Donald O' Connor should win high praise for making the picture complete. The more I watched the movie again, the more I admire their work. Gene Kelly had a fever when performing the title song.<br /><br />One last point, Don Lockwood (Howard Keel), Cosmo (Oscar levant), Lina Lamont (Judy Holiday) - these were people once considered for the parts. Singing in the Rain manifested the glory of film making as well as the high demands and commitment of people, on and off screen, to churn out  work of such high quality. Hats off to their hard work!</p></body></html>

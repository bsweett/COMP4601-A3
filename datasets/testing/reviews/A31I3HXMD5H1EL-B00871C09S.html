<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's Classy Voyeurism Thriller..."></head><body><p>One of the joys of Alfred Hitchcock films is his ability to take social taboos, present them in an enticing context, throw in major stars we know and love to perform them, and thus make abhorrent behavior seem attractive!  'Vertigo' is the best-known example of this Hitchcock trait ('Psycho' also  comes to mind), but 'Rear Window' is the most fun to watch, because of the  appealing combination of James Stewart and Grace Kelly!<p>Stewart is a  photographer, laid-up while recuperating from an accident (cleverly shown  through photographs in his studio), who, out of boredom, begins spying on  his neighbors. Jimmy Stewart a 'Peeping Tom'? Only Hitchcock could get away  with this!<p>Of course, Kelly, as his high fashion model girlfriend, and  Thelma Ritter (who is fabulous as his nurse), are appalled by Stewart's  behavior, but are drawn into voyeurism by Stewart's devotion to it,  particularly after he witnesses an apparent murder (committed by Raymond  Burr, in one of the most wonderfully EVIL roles of his career!)<p>The film  takes on a cat-and-mouse intensity, as Stewart attempts to prove Burr's  guilt to his skeptical policeman buddy (nicely played by Wendell Corey). To  add a touch of sexual foreplay to the proceedings, Kelly models a variety  of '50s evening and nightwear, while teasing the injury-constrained Stewart  (&quot;Previews of Coming Attractions&quot;, she purrs). All this leads up  to a fabulous, claustrophobic finale, with camera flashes, and a twist  ending that is pure Hitchcock magic!  <p>The restoration of the film gives  the movie a clarity and modern 'feel' that viewers will love!<p>Watch this  'new and improved' edition, and see why 'Rear Window' is one of the most  popular Hitchcock films!</p></body></html>

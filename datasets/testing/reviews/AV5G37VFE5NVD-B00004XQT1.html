I instantly decided that I would never watch the film, because it looked like a stupid slasher flick.  Then, a few months ago, I saw Christian Bale in "Batman Begins" and thought he was fantastic.  I looked up "American Psycho" on the IMDb and it was rated pretty high.  So I thought, what the hey, I'll give it a try.<br /><br />I'm mighty glad that I did.<br /><br />"American Psycho" is set in New York in 1987.  It revolves around Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), a very successful lawyer who may be getting married to Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), is having an affair with Courtney (Samantha Mathis), and is the object of his secretary's (Chloe Sevigny) affections.  But unbeknownst to his so-called "friends" and co-workers, Patrick is a killer who strikes almost at random.  And now a clever detective (Willem Dafoe) is investigating the murder of one of Patrick's victims.  Will Patrick get caught?<br /><br />The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' bestselling novel, which caused quite a controversy when it was first released.  "American Psycho" the film, like the book, is about two things: one, Patrick Bateman and the murders; and two, the self-absorbed society of the 80's.  Because it's set in the 80's, it has a great soundtrack, and it makes the movie much more fun.<br /><br />Mary Harron's directing is wonderful.  During daytime scenes, the film seems bright and shiny, almost as though it were an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  Then there's the nighttime scenes - dark, grim, with a texture like charcoal.  Harron enhances the film immensely.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is Christian Bale.  Bale's performance in this film is one of the greatest I have ever seen in my life.  He BECOMES the character.  It blew me away.  He can be mean, angry, suave, and damn funny.  The rest of the cast is good, but Bale is absolutely spectacular.<br /><br />While I can't recommend this film to everybody, I would suggest that if you don't mind the occasional blood and are looking for a humorous film, pick this one up.  Entertaining, dramatic, absorbing, funny, well-made, and with a terrific ending.  "American Psycho" is without a doubt one of the year's best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Michael Clayton"></head><body><p>At the law firm of Kenner, Back & Ledeen, Michael Clayton (Clooney) is the "fixer".  He can clean up anything, no matter how messy.  He hates his job, but is well paid and very good at it.  Also, his personal life is a mess.  He owes money and has a strained relationship with his son.  Then, friend and co-worker Arthur (Wilkinson) goes off the deep end.  Arthur decides to blow the lid off a major class action lawsuit against one of the firm's biggest clients, U/North.  The evidence he has is damning, and U/North's corporate lawyer Karen Crowder (Swinton) takes steps to remove Arthur from the equation.  Michael's boss Marty (Pollack) orders him to fix the situation immediately.<br /><br />"Michael Clayton" is a well told, well acted, intelligent thriller.  It burns slowly, but is very satisfying.  Clooney is great as the brilliant but troubled fixer.  Wilkinson's crazy Arthur steals the scenes he is in.  Swinton's performance is solid as someone in way over their head.  The story comes at the viewer from different angles, fitting together in the end, but not always clear in the build up.  Yes, folks...you have to think a little in this one.  That's not a bad thing though, because in the end, "Michael Clayton" is a satisfying thriller.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

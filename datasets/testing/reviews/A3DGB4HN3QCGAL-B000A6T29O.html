<meta name="summary" content="21st century Indiana Jones, with a braid"></head><body><p>Most of the sets were great, I also liked many of the stunts and special effects but not really a great movie. I've seen the Indiana Jones movies, didn't think they were great either, and found this one to be very similar in nature although perhaps more oddly paced. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft might actually be better than Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones but really you're getting Indiana with a braid and an accent. It's O.K. to spend a couple of hours with but not deeply satisfying.</p></body></html>

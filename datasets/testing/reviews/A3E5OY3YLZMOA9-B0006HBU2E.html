You break your neck to see this because you want to know the rest of the story and who Jason Bourne really is but when you get to the end to find all that out and well that's all you find out.<br /><br />You don't get a plot twist or anything to make your jaw drop; you just get a plain old mediocre answer to a plain question. One example of a film with a plot somewhat related to this but made it into a giant surprise is Kill Bill and I'm saying this as in when everything was getting to the end Uma Thurman found out her daughter was still alive. While The Bourne Supremacy has a little bit of a boring ending it still is a great movie thanks to Matt Damon and a few others pulling off great fight sequences much like the first film but more extreme.<br /><br />They did manage make a much needed and surprising change in the beginning of the film that makes it better in every way. Damon definitely isn't the best actor in here once again but he is great in these action scenes. There are a few people that become backstabbers but it's nobody you didn't already guess were villains in the first film. Bourne Supremacy is worth watching but you may get bored towards the ending.</p></body></html>

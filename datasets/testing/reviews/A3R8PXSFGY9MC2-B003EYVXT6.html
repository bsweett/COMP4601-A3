<meta name="summary" content="Splice"></head><body><p>`Splice' is an average sci-fi horror film about what happens when two scientists start playing around with genes and nature and the dire consequences.<br /><br />Clive and Elsa are two scientists who splice DNA from different animals to make proteins for the medical industry.  When they secretly splice human DNA into the mix the result is a weird hybrid, who grows at an alarming rate and has unique characteristics that are at first intriguing and which quickly become more alarming.<br /><br />The special effects in this film are reasonable and the plot, whilst predictable and clich&eacute;d is entertaining enough.  The acting leaves a lot to be desired and I have seen Brody act a lot better than what he offers us in this film.<br /><br />This film feels a bit flat to be honest.  It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it doesn't offer anything new and it plods along without any real zest or flair.  It feels like it is a `sci-fi by-numbers' film and the director doesn't try to do anything new or original with the concept.<br /><br />Never-the-less it is worth a viewing if you can catch it on TV for free or as part of a rental package.  It isn't quite as bad as some people have said, but it's not far off!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

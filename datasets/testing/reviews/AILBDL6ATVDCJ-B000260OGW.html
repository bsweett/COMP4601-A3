<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie Making!"></head><body><p>I remember an old John Wayne movie called &quot;Cowboys&quot;.  &quot;Open Range&quot; brought that same realistic approach to molding a movie around a Western format.  The movie couldn't have been titled better.  The incredible visual work in this movie alone make it a must see; not to mention the believable characters played by Duvall and Costner.<p>The only mistake this movie makes is trying to add more emotional dimensions to the main characters than is necessary to make the film flow.  This only happens towards the end of the film: Charley, suddenly concerned about Boss's real name, after riding with him for years.  Boss, suddenly concerned about good tasting chocolate and a storekeepers lack of finance to enjoy his own chocolate.<p>The action scenes are great, the acting is tight, and the storyline is well trimmed.  I think people will enjoy this film.<p>Click the &quot;buy&quot; button!  You'll want &quot;Open Range&quot; in your DVD collection.<p>www.therunninggirl.com</p></body></html>

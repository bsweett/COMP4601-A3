<meta name="summary" content="Above Average Horror Flick"></head><body><p>As somebody who is not a fan of zombie movies or, for that matter, horror films in general, I must admit that I did enjoy this remake of the 1973 George A. Romero "classic," which I have never seen.<br /><br />Director Breck Eisner and screenwriters Scott Kosar and Ray Wright have created an atmospheric, fast-paced, rather intelligent thriller with three-dimensional characters that evokes more memories of Holocaust movies rather than the films of George A. Romero.<br /><br />The most frightening aspect of this movie is the military, and the way that they treat the people of the affected town.  Had it not been for the uniforms, at times I would have thought that I was watching scenes from SCHINDLER'S LIST.<br /><br />Yes, there are zombies, but they are not the mindless kind that you find in Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  Nor, are they part of a flesh eating "army".<br /><br />These creatures are your friends and neighbors, your husbands and wives, whose exposure to this strange toxin has turned them into killers.  That makes them all the more terrifying.<br /><br />One man, for example, locks his wife and young son in an upstairs closet, and then sets the house afire.<br /><br />The action sequences are very well executed and, I must admit that during the movie, I did jump in my seat more than once.<br /><br />?

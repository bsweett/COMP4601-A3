<meta name="summary" content="What A Great Movie"></head><body><p>I came to this movie having no idea of the comic book character and damn if it wasn't a great movie with a lot emotional impact.  Yeah, it's a movie about a demon who fights against other demonic beings, but at its heart it is also a story of the love between a father and son.  Ron Perlman as Hellboy is simply fantastic.  I've been a fan of Mr. Perlman since his days on "Beauty and the Beast."  I see a lot of the emotion he showed as Vincent in this movie.  All of the actors are great with Selma Blair and John Hurt chief among them. Hellboy is not your usual summer movie fare.</p></body></html>

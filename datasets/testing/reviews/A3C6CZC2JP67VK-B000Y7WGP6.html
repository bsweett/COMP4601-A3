<meta name="summary" content="Very good film be careful what you'd hear"></head><body><p>As we stand in a war that has already lasted longer than all of World War II and Hollywood's method for handling the material is to shoot for the jugular, then crack a one-liner. Audiences can't seem to handle anything remotely serious without shenanigans on the side, but fortunately The Kingdom is so well-made, engaging (even if the screenplay talks smarter than it is), and, at times, heart-stopping that it's impossible to look away As the film opens, terrorists (dressed as Saudi police officers) launch a suicide attack on a softball game involving mostly Americans living inside a Western compound within the capital city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While the suits debate their next move, FBI agent Ronald Fleury (Foxx) negotiates a five-day trip to Saudi Arabia to investigate the crime firsthand. Joining him are three others; the bomb expert (Cooper), the forensics guru (Garner), and the guy whose sole purpose is drop annoying one-liners (Bateman). Once the crew arrives they befriend Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Barhom), a man who knows the inner workings of the terror cells in the area. As the investigation deepens the team finds themselves at odds with who to trust - and who might be the terror mastermind.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg has a keen eye behind the camera and his pacing is what drives the film. While it's more of a procedural than a straight-up action film, once things start getting really ramped up in final forty-five minutes you'll be hard-pressed to catch your breath. That's when it truly becomes apparent that The Kingdom is more about action than actual substance, which is what an astute viewer will pick up on early. I don't have a problem with that as the film is always fascinating, but it's impossible to dismiss the fact that had the screenplay, by Matthew Michael Carnahan, really taken it up a notch in terms of social relevance, this could have been so much more.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is smooth as the leader of the team and Jason Bateman provides a sly comment or two. Jennifer Garner goes into action like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5V8DG">Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A9QK96">Elektra - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and certainly shows what she is made of in fight scenes. It's good to see her on the screen again. Ali Suliman as the Saudi police officer and Ashraf Barhom as the Saudi Colonel are names not familiar to American audiences. They portray their roles well, especially Barhom. You see the mind set of both sides in The Kingdom, from the Americans presence and aid to the groups of terrorists in the Middle East who don't want Americans there at all.  The terrorists seem to think, "Death to everyone but you and me and sometimes I wonder about you." Not everyone in the Middle East is against Americans and we also see that terrorists target anyone---Americans or Saudi in this film---who go against what they want. Nothing new there, this type of mind set has been going on around the world for thousands of years.</p></body></html>

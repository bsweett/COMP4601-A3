<meta name="summary" content="A Spanish-Language Film Suited For Any Audience"></head><body><p>Firstly, and most importantly, everyone must know that this film is Spanish language with English subtitles.  Quick, before you go and vote this review unhelpful for stating the obvious, let me tell you this; most people don't READ Amazon's product info.  They skip right to the reviews.  The thing I first came here to look for is if the fact that it's in a different language take away from the film.<br /><br />After seeing the entirety of "Pan's Labyrinth", the answer is quite simply 'no.'<br /><br />What we've got here is a visual and graphic masterpiece of a story.  The fantasy elements mingle seamlessly with the real-life portions, bringing up questions that will leave you thinking about the movie for hours.  Is the fantasy aspect of the story really happening, or is it all in Ofelia's mind?  What does it mean when the fantasy monsters (which are quite horrifying) not even a fraction as frightening as the evil of the human characters?  This isn't just one of those films you can watch.  It's bloody violent, while also managing to be visually astounding.  The deepness and the heart of the story leaves such an emotional impact, which is only expanded by the simple yet effective use of music.<br /><br />This is a movie one can truly get involved in; you root for the characters, you relate to and cry with them, and--from the way the film is shot--you go on the fantastic journey with them.  There is nothing negative to say about this film at all, except for the fact that even the least squeamish of viewers may wince at some of the most violent scenes.  This is no child's fairy tale.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></body></html>

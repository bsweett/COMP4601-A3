<meta name="summary" content="Crime pays?"></head><body><p>Based on a true story, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN provides a congenial theater outing.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, between the ages of 16 and 19, successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a physician, and a lawyer. In the process, he passed phony checks totaling millions of dollars. Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the nerdy FBI agent out to bust young Frank.<p>This is probably the best acting performance by DiCaprio since TITANIC, which isn't saying much, and Hanks has done better. However, both actors apparently had a lot of fun with their roles here, and it's that energy that makes CATCH ME IF YOU CAN a film worth watching. Also, Christopher Walken is wonderful as the enigmatic Frank Abagnale, Sr., whose business and marriage is ruined by the IRS, which is pursuing him for reasons left largely unspecified. And, while it was never clear to me whether the Old Man clearly understood the extent of his son's mischief, the occasional sly grin and whisper in the ear seemed to indicate that he admired and envied his boy's larcenous spirit and adventurous lifestyle.<p>This film is a flight into nostalgia for those of us old enough to remember the days when commercial air travel still had &eacute;lan, when pilots were heroes, and when the politically correct "cabin attendants" were elegant "stewardesses".  There's one comic scene involving Frank, Carl and an in-flight chocolate &eacute;clair that pointedly recalls that coach fare used to be more than an apple and bagged peanuts.<p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN drags a little by the end, and the lesson of the epilog might be that crime pays. However, it's a reminder that fact can be genuinely more entertaining than FX-laden fiction.</p></body></html>

Is he not the coolest guy on the planet, or what?<br /><br />Now the movie itself I think would have been more enjoyable had I known what the hell was going on when the action hit.  The final fight is a special effects masterpiece, but nothing more.  I thought it was nice bringing old school high kicker Bruce LIang out of retirement to play the beast.  Overall I thought it was one of Stephen Chow's weaker efforts.  I highly recommend Shaolin Soccer over this.<br /><br />The dvd is a really good release and has a commentary with the cast  on it.  You have to read as it is subtitled, but at least you got something.</p></body></html>

Immediately I saw comparisons to `Napoleon Dynamite' and realized that this may just be funny.  Gladly I can say that the money was well spent.  `Nacho Libre' succeeds in making me laugh, and I'm sure it will bring quite a few laughs to each and every viewer.  It's far from perfect and will not be remembered as comic genius, but then again it's a small Nickelodeon film with dry humor and fart jokes so it's not to be expected to reign supreme.  It delivers what it sets out to deliver, easy laughs.  Jack Black is not the funniest guy around, but he knows how to poke fun at himself in order to rouse a laugh, and here he has plenty of playing field with his pudgy physic and boyishly immature charm.<br /><br />The film focuses on Ignacio, a cook in a monastery who dreams of being a pro wrestler.  He desires to help the orphans whom he feeds and all in all is a decent kind hearted man.  When the beautiful nun Sister Encaracion moves into the monastery he begins to try and woo her but he runs into opposition and inside competition.  After being attacked by a street urchin by the name of Esqueleto he decides to team up with this man in order to tag-team wrestle for money.  This way he can purchase fresh and tasty food for the orphans and hopefully win the heart of Sister Encaracion.<br /><br />The acting is decent, what's to be expected from a film of this caliber.  It's not supposed to be brilliant acting so do be disappointed when you realize it's not.  Jack Black is his usual funny self, if you find him usually funny, but to me it was Hector Jimenez who proved to be best in show.  His Esqueleto has the best one liners and he has the physic of a thirteen year old corpse so the physical comedy is golden.  Ana de la Reguera is pretty much a prop here, she's pretty and that's all they really need her to be, someone we believe Black's character would fall for, but also someone we believe could fall for Black.  She works just fine.<br /><br />The real heart of the laughs here comes from the outrageous wrestling matches.  The fighters get crazier and crazier and the moves are as outlandish as they are painful to watch.  Black and Jimenez really shine here with their physical comedy and they provide some of the only `laugh out loud' scenes in the film.  That's not to say that the film is a waste if not for a few fight scenes, but these scenes are the only scenes, at least for me, that excite a vocal reaction.  There are other funny scenes but they are laughs I can keep to myself.  The script could have been a little tighter maybe, but when you sit back and see the style of comedy they were going for it actually works well.  If you're a fan of the humor used in `Napoleon Dynamite' then you'll enjoy `Nacho Libre' and if you're a fan of Jack Black then I'm sure you've already added this family comedy to your DVD library.</p></body></html>

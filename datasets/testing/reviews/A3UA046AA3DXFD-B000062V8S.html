<meta name="summary" content="Arnold's latest work--until the watershed California tourism commercials"></head><body><p>This week's Sid the Elf feature is Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This film was just another step along our path to review every movie Arnold ever made. Well, except for the awful Conan movies. This one followed the ridiculously successful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PC2O">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)</a>. By conventional wisdom, this film failed miserably when compared to its predessor. But, by B standards it might have been just a touch better even though it lacked the same awesomeness that caused us to give T2 5 stars.<br /><br />The B-ness of this flick was almost overwhelming. There's Arnold and his snare drum tight face. There's the fact that they needed to replace the extremely popular(in T2) Edward Furlong for Nick Stahl due to a substance abuse problem. Oh yeah! Also, they supposedly recycled a bunch of ideas that didn't make the cut for T2 such as the female Terminator. Arnold is still protecting John Connor against Skynet and their female Terminator. Arnold also has to protect Claire Daines(John's future wife), a tough job for anyone to get motivated for. Sophia Bush was originally slated for this role. That would have added a star at least. O well. The big wrinkle in this one is that we find out that the T-X is back in good old 2004 from the future to not only kill John Connor, but his lieutenants too. Why? Because she kills John Connor in 2032. But we've already seen that history can be rewritten once because Judgment Day didn't occur in 1997 as predicted in Da Terminator. The question is: Can history be rewritten again?<br /><br />Sadly, this movie fell short. Maybe it was the lack of Arnold lines none of which we would find on a soundboard. Also, the appeal of the indestructability of the T-X was a bit old as we saw that already in T2. Aside from a few cool plot points this one just felt rehashed from the previous films. Sid says its a stay-away. We would NOT have enjoyed this one back in the glory days.</p></body></html>

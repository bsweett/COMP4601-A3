<meta name="summary" content="Cracks Appear in the All-Too Human Queen"></head><body><p>The Queen starts out unambitiously enough. Elizabeth II, Queen of England, meeting the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, a young up-and-comer who is determined to shake things up a bit in government. Elizabeth assures Blair, through her ceremony, forms, and observation that she has survived ten Prime Ministers (her own education in such relations starting with none other than Winston Churchill), that she will not be shaken up. That it is the young-buck Blair who has everything to learn, and not the stolid, stoic Queen.<br /><br />Of course, Elizabeth was raised in a different time and age. Ensconced in various palaces, she rarely gets the opportunity to see what the realm she ironically leads, is like. When her ex-daughter-in-law, the popular Diana, tragically dies in an auto accident, Elizabeth has no conception of what a storm it will set off, both in Britain and the world. She has no *ability* to conceive of it, either: she believes that death is a private affair, and that England is a country of people who are as private and guarded as is she. On top of that, she personally bears Diana no particular goodwill, and so Elizabeth decides to treat Diana's death as a non-event.<br /><br />But the British people--a different British people than Elizabeth imagines--demands a response. Demands a human, feeling monarchy. Blair, the new man of the people, represents this to the Queen, and so we are introduced to a struggle of wills between the old, controlled, powerful Queen, and the new face of Blair. It is also a struggle, more generally, between tradition and change. If you know what normally wins that struggle, or you remember these particular events in your own lifetime, then you know which side wins.<br /><br />Elizabeth is presented an impossible choice: change and relent, or the monarchy, itself, will crack. It is a wonderfully dramatic scenario, and thrilling to watch it portrayed by such a talented, capable actress. Mirren will win the Best Actress Oscar, and she will deserve it.<br /><br />It is also fun to watch other famous characters, such as Blair and Prince Charles, portrayed. It's hard to not like Blair in this film (as he eventually comes around to respect the monarchy he once found silly and dated), and hard not to feel sorry for him in his own, more recent, fall from popular approval. Prince Charles is another matter all-together: it is moving to watch him grieve for Diana, and painful to watch how this man (the would-be King of England) is so bowed over and controlled by others in his life. Despite the fact that the Queen is the centerpiece, the others are all interesting character studies in their own right.<br /><br />It is rare to have a historical film about events so recent, revolving around people still living and capable (and, in fact, still in power). It's nice to be given this sort of insight into the people we still see on the news, to be able to reconsider our once-held notions of them, instead of waiting until they're long-dead to reflect. The Queen provides us with this rare opportunity, and it does so in an entertaining and brilliantly acted way.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie.<br /><br />Five stars.</p></body></html>

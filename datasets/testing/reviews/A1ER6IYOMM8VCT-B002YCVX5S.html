<meta name="summary" content="NOT 'THE DIRTY BASTERDS', BUT "TARANTINO'S LIST"!"></head><body><p>I bought this Blu Ray set some time ago, but I wanted to forget the wide range of reviews I had read before seeing it. 'Inglorious Barsterds' is a very good film and I think Tarantino fans should especially like it. I think my biggest gripe with this film is the subtitles. It's not that I can't deal with them, but having scenes with long dialogue with so many written words at the bottom of the screen, was overall distracting and kept me from watching the scene. I know why the subtitles are used, but I think they could have used some clever ideas like in the first scene to break it up a little. I may not be the fasted reader on the planet, but I can hold my own. If you're watching this film, you had better be prepared to keep your eyes glues to the screen and don't even think of looking away to grab some popcorn for a second or you may lose some vital information. I know some lines were so long I could barely finish reading before I had another paragraph to read!<br /><br />Aside from the subtitles I think the film is beautifully shot and the acting by all is excellent. I enjoyed the story even though those "Basterds" aren't in the film as much as I would have liked them to be. I know some thought the length of the film was a bit long, but I really think the massive subtitling made it feel long. If I want to read a book, I'll read a book but when I watch a film I want to watch the actors expressions and actions. This film has so much subtitling that you can't really do that ,.....for those of you that can read a paragraph in a millisecond...my hat's off to you, but I think this film would have been better received by all, if they had found a way to switch to English more often. One of the joys of watching Tarantino films is to listen to his wonderful dialogue, not necessarily read it. Films like Schindler's List certainly didn't suffer from not using subtitles and I don't think this film would have either. The Blu Ray looks very good and there are some very good extras including alternate scenes, making of etc.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Favourite Western And Among My Favourite Movies of All Time!  Too Bad About the DVD!"></head><body><p>There is no doubt in my mind that this is Clint Eastwood's best ever film effort and it is a testament to this movie's greatness that it has aged so well over the years and I'd wager will continue to do so for years to come.  The themes involved are timeless such as coming to grips with your true self, making sacrifices and hard choices for the good of your dependents, regret for life's past indiscretions, retribution/revenge and like in any true western justice meted out in dramatic fashion at the end as "good" triumphs over abject evil as personified in the form of sadistic sheriff Hackman.<br /><br />This film is so great as well because it blurs the lines between what is good and evil and does man really have the right to mete justice when as Eastwood's character so aptly puts it: "deserves got nuthin' to do with it."  Did both cowboys deserve to die or was it just the unrepentent slasher for example?  How about Ned?  Many issues such as these are addressed in this movie and because it is not just the usual cut and dried western where the lines are clear this brilliant movie that engages the viewer on a more cerebral level makes this not only an excellent western but also a brilliant film regardless of genre to be enjoyed over and over again like a true classic should.<br /><br />I've watched this film a few times and I never tire of doing so in contrast with say "Silence of the Lambs" which I watched recently and realised that it doesn't reward repeated viewing as much although I have to say I enjoyed it a lot when I first saw it for example.  This is why "Unforgiven" ranks among the top 5 films that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing though is the poor quality of the dvd.  The sound quality was okay at Dolby Digital 5.1 surround but the picture quality was very poor and certainly not commensurate with the sound quality.  The widescreen version side of the disc is the way to view it as the fullscreen side was pathetic as too much of the picture is excluded and for some reason the picture quality is even poorer for that side of the disc.  White spots and other imperfections appear on too many frames and the images are blurred way too often as well.<br /><br />I haven't seen the Blu-ray release but as the 20th anniversary of this film is coming soon, I'd like to see a Director's cut version with anamorphic widescreen and much better restored picture quality with good special features released either in Blu-ray or standard or both versions to do justice to a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />This film deserves a lot better medium than this very poor dvd version.  As for me, I'll wait in hope for a much improved 20th anniversary release.<br /><br />Updated 23 Aug 2011:<br /><br />Amazon won't let me review this separately so I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is a big improvement over the dvd I reviewed above as there are now special features to speak about like the making of documentaries as well as the documentaries on Clint Eastwood himself and I especially enjoyed the tv episode of "Maverick" with Eastwood playing the villain for a change.  The picture quality has also improved although not in all the frames as the night scenes by the campfires for example are still pretty grainy although for the most part the rest of the picture quality is pretty good.  The audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is also better than on the previous dvd release although it is not reference quality.  One is left feeling that further improvement is still possible and who knows maybe we'll get a digibook version in the future that will do just that.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

BETTER than the book!<br />Oh geez, I can already sense the comic book purists ready to crucify me.  Relax dudes, stop hyperventilating, wipe the fog from your glasses.  This is just my opinion, and I can say with no hesitation--this film is top-notch, quite possibly even better than the graphic novel!  I think they are both remarkable achievements, of course, but the movie does surpass the book in one major area.  More on that later.<br /><br />Okay, I'm aware of Mr. Moore taking his name off the credits.  That move really makes no sense to me.  Mainly because I am fairly certain he received a fat paycheck for the rights to this story.  If he felt so strongly against any deviation to his artistic vision, he should have stood adamant with his original writing.<br /><br />Now, I am usually the first to diss Hollywood.  I still loathe the changes they made to the great comic book series WANTED.  But some alterations can be good, remember the novel adaptation of THE SHINING?  Some people will criticize something just because it strays from the version they were expecting.<br /><br />And for those who say this movie doesn't capture the emotional capacity of the book--I say BULLOCKS!!!  This movie is packed with excellent depictions of fear, anger, confusion, regret, lust, sadness, apathy, humor, anxiety, sarcasm, pain....seriously, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more thorough psychological examination at the theater.  This is humanity exposed, inside and out.<br /><br />I imagine the harshest criticism for this film is due to the ending.  Zack Snyder does stay EXTREMELY close to the book until the climax.  I am totally surprised to say that I loved it!  It was a small alteration, but made a big difference.  The change was just plain brilliant, plus it made perfect sense with this story.  Really, think about it--would the director make such a drastic change to the end of the most celebrated graphic novel of all time if he wasn't positive of the results?  I think not.<br /><br />WATCHMEN is easily the best film so far this year.  Along with THE DARK KNIGHT and IRON MAN, it's amazing to see the genre rise above the label of popcorn entertainment.  This most likely won't appeal to the masses.  Kudos to the cast and crew for their stellar efforts.</p></body></html>

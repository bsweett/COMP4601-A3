The monkeys and apes have an order also.  The Chimpanzee are the scholars, scientist; the Orangutans are the government officials and religious guardians; and the Gorillias are the military soldiers.  The Gorillias hunt humans and consider them a pest which feed on their corn and food supplies.<br /><br />HONORIUS: "Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?"<br /><br />Zaius is both the defender of the faith and the minister of science.  Zaius maintains a secret. He knows about the forbidden zone, World War III, the nuclear holocaust, archealogy in the forbidden zone, and evidence that man was superior to ape.  Honorius faith is that ape is more compassionate to each other: no ape has killed another ape.  The law giver was an ape and he warned in their articles of faith not too trust man.<br /><br />Zira and Cornelias befriend Taylor and their scientific findings are consider unauthorized and heretical.  The council when confront with evidence of man's superiority will not hear the evil, see the evil, or speak the no evil of such a contemptous idea.  Taylor is not allow to speak in his defense because he is not recognized as having any rights by the court.<br /><br />Interesting Taylors argument is one of evolution.  The Orangutans are religous animals and this Taylors ideas of evolution are ridiculous; the sacred scrolls teach nothing about monkey evolving into man; the Orangutans can not comprehend Taylors claims.  Second, Taylors claim that they cross the forbidden zone does not seem possible.  The council knows no living creature could cross that great distance of desert and barreniness and live.  Third, Taylors companions can not collaborate his story, since two are dead, and the third one, Landon is surgically altered too prevent him for ever speaking again.<br /><br />Zira must speak for Taylor.  Zira begins her argument asserting, if Taylors claims are false then he must have sprang up from the apes.  In other words, Taylor is a naked ape.  Zira further argues that she can find no physical evidence too indicate why humans can not speak.  "An upside down world", perhaps, zoologist today and trying to teach monkeys to speak, form sounds and symbols vocally that could be construed as speech.  Zira says, "Their voice organs are adequate. The flaw is in the brain"  Cornelius rises up and says, "Yes! Behold this marvel, this living paradox, this missing link in an evolutionary chain!"  Man is the missing link.  Cornelius claims contradict the sacred scrolls and the court will not hear his arguments.  "Silence you have gone to far!" Cornelius is treatened with a charge of subversion which would destroy his carreer and bring harsh penalities on him.  "An indictment is in order. Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy."  The ape government positions the religous order, the law, and political power in the hands of the state.  The state is role is too protect the interest of the these three domains.  This sets the stage for an oppressive government and an unjust government and revolution uprisings threaten the government.  The state will use violence to suppress this uprising and consider Taylor a threat too their idealogy.  Therefore, the apes must contain this liberation attempt and return order.  The apes consider the new discovers a social disease rather than a great scientific discovery.<br /><br />'Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport, or lust or greed. Yes, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him back into his jungle lair: For he is the harbinger of death'</p></body></html>

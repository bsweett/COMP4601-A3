<meta name="summary" content="Your move, creep!"></head><body><p>This is the original action packed Robocop.  Through the various TV commercials and news reports that are displayed throughout the film a social comment is made on society showing our in-humane and greedy ways.  Of course this film is extremely violent and shouldn't be viewed by a younger audience, but anyone who can take the carnage will enjoy what this film has to say.</p></body></html>

It was certainly watchable, but is a bit pointless - in announcing that the subject of proceedings is uncovering the identity of the mysterious Keyser Soze, it telegraphs the fact that There Will Be A Twist In The Ending And Keyser Will Turn Out To Be Someone You Didn't Expect (if there isn't, the film will just be plain dull), and unfortunately the twist is guessable after about three quarters of an hour, and all but inevitable by the time it arrives. <p>Could have been better.</p></body></html>

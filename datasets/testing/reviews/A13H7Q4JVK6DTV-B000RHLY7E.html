<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies of the year."></head><body><p>This movie to me is great and should have been watch more because a lot of people did'nt see it and thats what you call stupid people.The reason why I say this is because this movie had every thing a movie should have, great acting as well as a great plot and soundtrack.The Devil's Rejects is a Part 2 of thousand corpses but I know a lot of you might say that movie suck but this one makes up for it all the way.<br /><br />  The movie is about the firefly family and how they get caught and must run for their lives to escape from the cops, and while they do that they leave a bloody trail on the way thats has dark humor and very gory if you get the urated version or even the rated one.<br /><br />  Don't read this review anymore and get this as soon as it comes out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent DVD, with a few minor problems"></head><body><p>I'm not going to try to sell you on the movie - if you are reading this,  and considering buying the DVD, chances are you have already seen it, and  want it for your collection.  The DVD version of this movie - long delayed,  mostly for the commentary track - isn't a bad contribution to the DVD  library.  Die-hard fans will enjoy the director's commentary, although I  felt it was a little lacking, especially in the first hour or so of the  film.  The featurette is nothing special, and either the exact same one, or  one just like it, was run on either HBO or Showtime in 1995, with the  film's release.  The sound transfer is top-notch, the voices are clear, and  the music just right.  The video transfer will leave some fans wanting; the  colors are perfect, but there are dust spots and other minute errors  assiciated with film that are absent from other digitally-mastered DVDs.  Seeing as how there probably isn't much more to ask out of a movie that  mostly speaks for itself, these distractions are minor, and this disc is  definately worth the price for a person who will watch it over and over.</p></body></html>

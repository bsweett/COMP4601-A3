<meta name="summary" content="Just OK"></head><body><p>Robert Downey, Jr. does about as good a job with the lead character as anyone could, and the acting is pretty good overall, but the special effects are just OK, the plot is somewhat juvenille, and the portrayal of the Afghan bad guys is laughably stereotypical.  I watched this movie with the family (not my choice of movie), and it wasn't a total waste of time, but I do wish the time had been better spent.</p></body></html>

Some of my friends hailed it as the best movie they have ever seen, some the most romantic. Does it live up to expectations. Well, yes and no.<br /><br />First things first, if you're expecting humor in the vein of Scrubs, don't even bother with this. It is not even remotely close, in fact it doesn't even try to be. The story is about Andrew Largeman, who is on so many drugs, that he basically sleepwalks through life. He has no emotional connections with anybody. He feels empty, that is until his dad calls him one day crying, and says that his mother has just passed away. Andrew then goes back to his hometown, Jersey where he meets some of his old friends and forges a relationship with someone new. The story then revolves around these people over a span of about 4 days. A journey of self discovery ensues...<br /><br />While the story is hardly groundbreaking, I actually fell in love with this movie, largely because of the fantastic cast and superb dialogue. Zach Braff's directorial debut is actually very good. The characters are a delight to watch. They seem so real. They have their share of good moments and self doubts, just like us. Zach Braff, who practically typifies wackiness in Scrubs does pretty much the same here, but toning it down a level and it works wonderfully. Natalie Portman, who I feel is one of the best actors of our generation (or my generation, at least) is great as Samantha. Portman has been in such diverse roles in her short career, and she pulls it off very well each and every time. Her performance here adds a whole lot of "heart" to the movie. The rest of the cast, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and even Jean Smart provide memorable supporting performances, that stays with you even after the show. As I said, the conversation between characters are also something that drew me into the show. Watch how something you've always thought as petty, turn into something thoughtful. An example of this, is the idea of a "home". Don't get it? Watch the movie.<br /><br />Another thing I would like to comment was the cinematography and music. They went hand in hand, the shots of the neighbourhood were beautiful, fitting the story exceptionally well and Zach Braff has an ear for good music. A nice selection of songs that leaves you with some sort of emotion, for the characters and their experiences.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie that's worthy of my recommendation. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the moment. In fact, I think that's what the people behind this movie are hoping for. Great effort!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gripping Tale of the Drug Trade"></head><body><p>"Maria Full of Grace" is an interesting examination of one aspect of the international drug trade.  It concerns itself with the exploitation of young Colombian girls by drug dealers who<br /><br /> employ them as human mules to transport their heroin to the U.S.  What seems like easy money to these impressionable impoverished young women turns out to be perilous as they make the trek with these balloons full of deadly drugs lodged in their stomaches.  The film's primary focus is on Maria Alvarez(Catalina Sandino Moreno) a seventeen year-old pregnant girl who tires of her job as a flower cutter in a rustic Colombian town living with her extended family of single mothers.  What initially seems glamorous soon takes on ominous overtones.  The film takes place in a matter of a few days, however, with the potentially life-threatening experiences that Maria endures her demeanor takes on what seems like years.  Moreno more than earns her recent Oscar nomination for a performance of great subtlety.  She is more than up to the demands of the intricasies of the changes that Maria's character goes through.  Credit also to director Joshua Marston for an enthralling study of what is potentially sentational material but delivers it in a non-exploitative manner.</p></body></html>

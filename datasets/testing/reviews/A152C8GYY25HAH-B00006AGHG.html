<meta name="summary" content="Unusually intelligent thriller"></head><body><p>"Changing Lanes" is a thriller blessed with an unusually intelligent script by Charles Taylor and Michael Tolkin. Though a little preachy at times and a bit too pat [especially at the end], it manages to bypass many of the cliches we have become accustomed to in such films. It casts an unflinching eye on its characters and their place in a world which sometimes seems to have lost its moral compass. Directed at a brisk pace by Roger Michell ["Notting Hill"] and beautifully photographed by Salvatore Totino, "Changes Lanes" is a thinking man's thriller. [The testosterone and adrenaline crowd should probably pass on this one because nothing is blown up and nobody dies.]<p>On a cold New York morning, we find two men racing to court. Doyle [Samuel L. Jackson] is going to Family Court to try to prevent his wife from moving to Oregon with their two boys. Gavin [Ben Affleck] is a lawyer who's on his way to Probate Court to seal a deal that's of great benefit to his high-powered law firm. Along the way they are involved in a fender bender. Gavin is polite at first but becomes increasingly agitated when Doyle wants to take his time `doing the right thing'. He winds up leaving Doyle stranded. Consequently, Doyle is late to court and loses his case. Gavin, meanwhile, arrives at his destination only to find he has accidentally left an important document in Doyle's possession. Without it, he can not win his case. What ensues is an increasingly nasty game of "Gotcha" between two very angry men, neither of whom is entirely right or wrong. <p>Few mainstream movies ask us to examine current moral values or to question the ways in which we deal with each other. Fewer still question the value of righteous anger. "Changing Lanes" doesn't hesitate to address these issues head on. It does so in a way that is both entertaining and enlightening.</p></body></html>

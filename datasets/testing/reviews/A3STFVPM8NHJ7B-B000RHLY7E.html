<meta name="summary" content="Thank you Mr. Zombie"></head><body><p>I love horror movies and just movies in general. Up until House of 1000 Corpses, I thought the horror movie genre was dead. Horror movies these days have cliched scripts, terriable acting, and usually a who who's list of young hollywood actors. Rob Zombie didnt need any of those for his masterpieces. He loves horror movies, and it shows. Devil Rejects proved that Rob Zombie can produce and write movies as well. The story was kinda of loose, but I still highly enjoyed this movie. Captain Spaulding is probably one of my faviorte movie characters in the last 10 years. He's funny and evil all rolled into one. The movie is ultra profane and violent, and makes you feel helpless, like they are going get you next. Baby is also anther chracter that deserves some credit for her role, she was insane and sexy all rolled into one. Thank you Mr.Zombie for proving that horror movies arent dead and keep on cranking out those master pieces.</p></body></html>

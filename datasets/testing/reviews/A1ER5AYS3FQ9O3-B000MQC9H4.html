<meta name="summary" content="Light entertainment -  but with some great bonus features"></head><body><p>The movie was enjoyable enough but I felt it lacked that romantic "spark" between the two couples featured in the film. The basic premise: Two women decide to trade homes, both of them looking to escape from recent boyfriend troubles. One comes to America, one goes to the English countryside and (you could predict this, right?), they encounter new guys, with new potentials.<br /><br />  Everyone's acting is up to snuff but the film still came across as mildly entertaining and certainly not on my "Top Ten" list of romantic comedies.<br /><br />  However, there were some special moments that stood out, including:<br /><br />1. The always watchable Jack Black, with his irreverent wit, playing against type as a pretty decent guy in this film. He can't completely hold in his wild nature, but he is relatively restrained.<br /><br />2. Eli Wallach. He's a legend and every move of his is thought out.<br /><br />3. The bonus features, including comments from the crew and cast about making the movie. Kate Winslet admits her fears about trying to be fun, the director talks about the process of making this film, etc. The commentary lends insight into the whole creative enterprise, from start to finish, and would be interesting for budding film enthusiasts to see.</p></body></html>

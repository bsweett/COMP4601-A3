<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] Who says Potter is just for kids?"></head><body><p>Where as the first Potter film seemed geared towards young children,  Goblet of Fire nearly seems the opposite.  Not that kids won't enjoy this, though it may be very frightening at times for very young children.  But the teenagers and even adults may find this to be a perfect fit for more mature entertainment.  The tr-wizard tournament is practically the most dangerous event Potter has dealt with yet.  Then there is the formal ball, where both sexes have officialy grown up.  There is even some innuendo, which surprised me from a Potter film, but it was still amusing.  And perhaps death and the reality of it is the biggest impact this film offers.  Oh yes, and Voldemort comes back into full form, played by a deliciously creepy Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Potter films because of how well balanced it was made.  Despite all the danger, fright and incredible CGI action, there is also humor and drama to balance out the equation.  It gives us a little bit of everything, which adds up to high interest and great pacing throughout.<br /><br />The tr-wizard tournament is the highlight of the movie, with Potter and three others competing in a very deadly and real sport.  There are three scenarios that must be won, each more frightening and deadlier than the first.  The first obstacle is aquiring a golden egg protected by a very deadly dragon.  Harry, ends up against the deadliest of dragons in what provides a very suspenseful and action-oriented showdown.  The following scene takes place underwater, in a scene that feels very frighteneing and creepy.  The last obstacle is in a massive hedge maze, with quite the feel of Claustrophobia as the hedges seem to come alive.<br /><br />I thought this was a huge improvement over the last film, Prisoner of Azkaban.  They succes to Goblet of Fire is that it gives us quite a bit of everything, and every scene seems to have a purpose, whether it be imprtance to the story or successfully entertaining.  Potter has definetly evolved into something that everyone can love, especially the grown ups.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Can I give it 6 Stars?"></head><body><p>The film picks up from where the original left off and continues to shed light on the story of the centuries old blood feud between vampires and werewolves (Lycans).  Things get a bit more complicated when an old "new" hybrid threatens to tip the balance between the combatants.<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution is a highly entertaining, action packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale (who is GORGEOUS!!!), Scott Speedman, Tony Curran, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are OUTSTANDING to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />It's got EVERYTHING one looks for in a movie: action, sex, and a great story!  The plot, the setting, the special effects, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT!  Underworld: Evolution is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br /><br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a third movie, which I would definitely line up to watch!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!</p></body></html>

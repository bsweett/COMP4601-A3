It's much more main-stream, American, 50's era, middle of the road.  That's not entirely bad.  The cast is great.  James Stewart is charming and likable as usual, Grace Kelly is exquisite, as usual in her gorgeous Edith Head created wardrobe, Thelma Ritter is endearingly wise-cracking as usual.<br /><br />The story is clever enough featuring a photographer who approaches life through the safe distance of a lens.  I didn't see a lot of chemistry between Kelly and Stewart; he seemed much older than she was, which strained the credibility of her adoration and patience.  There were other things that didn't really make sense, but overall the film pulls you along pleasantly.<br /><br />Hitchcock fans will go gaga over it, uncritically, because it is, after all, Hitchcock.  But if you just want to enjoy a movie on its own merits, this is fun, but a little dated.</p></body></html>

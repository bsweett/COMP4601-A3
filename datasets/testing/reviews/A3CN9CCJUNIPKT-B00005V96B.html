I first saw it in the theater when it came out, in Emeryville, CA, near the Pixar studios and they had a ginormous, life-sized Sully in the lobby.. With real fur!  So cool... but the movie was even better.<br /><br />I am knocking a point off this particular edition, however, because it's not quite the bargain I thought it would be.  When I wanted to purchase "Monsters, Inc." for my kid, and saw that they had an affordable combo pack that had both DVD and Blu-Ray versions, I thought, well, I might get a Blu-Ray someday, so that could come in handy. Yeah, I'll get it!  Unfortunately, the DVD disc does not also include the same material as the Blu-Ray, so a bunch of games and bonus features are not included, which really bummed my daughter out.  These features were already embedded in the old DVD edition: Disney has purposely *removed* them in order to steer customers towards the new format. As a consumer, I resent this enormously, and I think other potential buyers might want to know that the DVD version has been downgraded and will not be as much fun for your kid as you might hope.  Disney is being needlessly manipulative with its product: why not just give us a package that really is in *both* formats?<br /><br />It's still a great movie, though!!

Sorry, but Amazon aggregates reviews of different formats all together in one review pool.  If I hadn't had issues with the DVD/Blu-Ray bundling, I would have given this a ten-star review.  Same problem with "Up" too, by the way.)</p></body></html>

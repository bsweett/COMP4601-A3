<meta name="summary" content="A Period of History Remarkably Rendered"></head><body><p>Director David Fincher's latest film "Zodiac" does a remarkable job of recreating a period of California history in which a diabolically clever serial killer taunted police and the public beginning in 1969.<br /><br />Once that attacks were commenced the individual calling himself the Zodiac Killer sought to use the San Francisco Police Department, the media, and ultimately the citizenry as metaphorical mice to be taunted by a megalomaniacal cat seeking to convince everyone that his superior intelligence enabled him to rule with the public no more than unfortunate pawns.  The least fortunate became his murder victims.<br /><br />The documentary style employed by director Fincher via an intelligent script penned by James Vanderbilt takes a page from the popular current technique used in television true-life criminal case file dramas from such popular presentations as "48 Hours", "Dateline" and programs presented on the "Court TV" network.<br /><br />The film is reminiscent of the 1971 cinema hit "The French Connection," which was also based on fact and involved the interaction between two determined forces, New York policeman Popeye Doyle and Fernando Rey, who played the mastermind of the Marseille drug cartel on the loose in America's largest city.  Gene Hackman won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar playing a dedicated policeman whose search for the drug kingpin becomes totally obsessional.<br /><br />In "Zodiac" the consistently obsessive figure is San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who provides a performance comparable to his excellence effort alongside Heath Ledger in "Brokeback Mountain."  The film is adapted from Graysmith's bestseller about his true-life experiences, "Zodiac Unmasked."<br /><br />Gyllenhaal's dedication and efficiency in marshalling facts prompts the Chronicle's crime beat reporter Robert Downey, Jr. to form a working alliance with him in pursuing the Zodiac Killer.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal and Downey play off of one another superbly as viewers observe an "odd couple" relationship involving a former Eagle Scout who does not drink, smoke, or curse with a San Francisco rebel from the Bob Dylan and Woodstock sixties who can scarcely believe his dissimilar investigative partner is for real.<br /><br />Downey is curt and rebellious to the point where the boozing, smoking, cursing and highly rebellious reporter ultimately quits the Chronicle rather than agreeing to toe the mark and operate the way his superiors, fearing repercussions from the police and community at large over his hands on, aggressive investigative approach, insist that he behave in conformity with their standards.<br /><br />While more polite and doggedly determined in the manner of a tenaciously determined Boy Scout rather than an "in your face" and "I'll do it my way" rebel in the Downey tradition, Gyllenhaal pursues the case to the point where the young lead detective assigned to the case becomes exasperated just as he earlier had with the rebellious member of the duo.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo plays the determined young detective who becomes a victim of the case when he is finally pulled off of homicide detail after Chronicle reporter Armistead Maupin, who will later become a famous San Francisco fiction author heralded within the city's large gay community, accuses him of pawning off a letter he actually wrote and represented as the work of the Zodiac Killer.  While it is ultimately revealed that Ruffalo actually did not write such a letter, the damage has been done and leaves Ruffalo with a bitter taste in his mouth.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal, in the determined tradition of Hackman in "The French Connection," operates with undaunted tenacity.  He encounters anyone he feels can benefit his investigative efforts and tenaciously refuses to let go.  While Ruffalo mumbles with exasperation during one late night unannounced call at his apartment to discuss the case that he will "grab his revolver and shoot" Gyllenhaal he not only fails to turn him away, as intended; when the zealous investigator captures his interest they leave together and share an early breakfast at a local all night eatery to discuss the case.<br /><br />While Downey moves from the Chronicle to the Sacramento Bee while his destructive drinking continues and his marriage ends, he remains within Gyllenhaal's determined sight.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal's efforts take him to Vallejo and Riverside in Southern California as well in pursuit of information to crack the case.  His efforts ultimately prompt him to focus on a Vallejo eccentric who works at an automotive store, Arthur Leigh Allen, played by John Carroll Lynch.<br /><br />The byplay involving Gyllenhaal's investigations and police interrogations of Lynch generate much curiosity.  Viewers can make up their own minds as to the significance Lynch holds in the overall scheme of the case.  "Zodiac" ultimately becomes a fascinating fill in your own conclusion film in that it follows the thrust of Graysmith's book.<br /><br />The most dramatic moment of the case from a confrontation standpoint involves a previously arranged telephone call to a popular early morning San Francisco television talk show.  The Zodiac Killer agrees to call and be interviewed with the understanding that famed flamboyant San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli be present as well.<br /><br />This scene is rendered with dramatic fidelity to the actual event, which has been shown recently in various television documentaries about the Zodiac Killer case.  Brian Cox clearly studied Belli's personal and speech mannerisms in careful detail, as he evidences in this film, playing the famous lawyer with convincing accuracy.<br /><br />"Zodiac" is so accurate in its reverence to detail that it brilliantly recreates the period as well as settings in which the crimes and the investigative events occurred.<br /><br />Viewers are taken through a journey into the past so real that one believes they are part of a time machine experiment focusing on an elusive and diabolical subject that held San Francisco with helpless fear as its citizens pray for answers and ultimate resolution through the serial killer's capture.</p></body></html>

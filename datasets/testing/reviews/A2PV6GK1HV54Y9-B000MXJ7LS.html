The all-star cast are expectionally talented but the true-life survivors they are portraying seem so fake and unsympathetic. Oliver Stone was such a great director but his "masterpieces" have suffered greatly in over a decade, I can't remember a flawless film he's created in such a long time, it's so sad. If you want a film that is truly a tribute to the courageous heroes of 9/11 then I highly recommend United 93 instead. That film is perfect from beginning to end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tom Cruise plays his usual role"></head><body><p>I doubt this guy can do any other role. Each time he's the same, and in none of his roles can you differentiate between the characters. I found some points in this movie extremely slow, although it speeded up towards the end, and I got really into it.<br /><br />What I found funny about this movie, was the fact that I didn't recognise Samantha Morton until she came out of her 'bath'. She's got one of those recognisable faces. I had a laugh during the movie, cos I could hear the conversation between her & her agent in my head. It probably went something like this:<br /><br />Agent: I have a role for you Samantha. What you have to do all the time is cling onto Tom Cruise ...<br /><br />Samantha: I'll take it!<br /><br />(pause)<br /><br />Samantha: What's the catch?<br /><br />Agent: You have to shave you head, and when you're not clinging onto Tom, you spend most of your time in a bath.<br /><br />Samantha: Oh ...<br /><br />The rest of the cast include of course Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow, who was one of the priests in The Exorcist.<br /><br />I normally like Colin Farrell in movies - especially in Daredevil, with his Orish accent. But in this, he annoyed the hell out of me! And why? It wasn't because of his funny sounding accent. No, it was because he was constantly chewing gum. His mouth was so distracting, it was like watching a cow chewing cud. And why was this I wonder, the fact there was absolutely no one smoking in the movie?! Apparently, he also had a lot of trouble delivering the line &#34;surely you understand the fundamental questionability of Pre-Crime methodology&#34;.<br /><br />There's quite a few famous cameos in this, mainly in the train scene, so you have to keep your eyes peeled for them. These include: Paul Thomas Anderson (who directed Tom Cruise in Magnolia and it is reported that he is so hard to find that Anderson himself does not know where he appears; Cameron Crowe,  Tom's director from Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky as the guy who looks at Anderton over the top of his newspaper and recognizes him; and Cameron Diaz, Tom's co-star in Vanilla Sky plays the blonde woman sitting just behind the man who looks over at Anderton on the train.<br /><br />The PreCogs I found really interesting, and of course a woman - Samantha Morton - was the main PreCog, the one had intelligence, of course, what else would we expect? Although it's rarely mentioned (I don't remember hearing the male PreCogs names mentioned) the PreCogs&#34; were all named after famous mystery writers. Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon), 'Conan Doyle, Arthur' (Sherlock Holmes), and Agatha Christie (Murder on the Orient Express).<br /><br />What my Dad managed to point out, were the references to Stanley Kubrick movies:<br /><br />--&#62; When Anderton undergoes his eye replacement procedure, his eyes are held open by clamps, reminiscent of the treatment sequences in A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />--&#62; Burgess, (Max von Sydow) is named after author Anthony Burgess, who also wrote about crime control in the future in A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />--&#62; Directly after the opening montage of the husband murdering his wife, it cuts directly to a close-up shot of the &#34;precog&#34; Agatha's eye. The exact same shot is used at the end of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey after the light show.<br /><br />--&#62; When Anderton jumps off the car and through the window, he lands into a yoga classroom. The head of the class is dressed exactly like the rich old woman Alex kills in A Clockwork Orange. Like Alex, Anderton is characterized by his drug abuse and love of classical music.<br /><br />--&#62; When John Anderton and Agatha are running out of the shopping mall, they pass by a homeless man laying in front of the door who asks for change. The vagrant in the tunnel scene in A Clockwork Orange, where Alex and his droogs beat him is reminiscent of this.<br /><br />--&#62; Agatha yelling &#34;murder!&#34; a reference to &#34;redrum!&#34; from Shining, The (1980).<br /><br />and also Bladerunner (both this & Bladerunner were written by Philip K Dick, although in the credits, this is based on a SHORT story by the author):<br /><br />--&#62; Both films begin with an extreme close-up shot of an open eye, and repeat the eye motif throughout.<br /><br />--&#62; Rutger Hauer's character (in Blade Runner) visits the genetic engineer who created his artificial eyes, Tom Cruise's character visits the surgeon who replaces his eyes.<br /><br />--&#62; Both films feature detectives making a key discovery by spotting a woman reflected in the mirror in the background of a crime-scene image that they are looking at.<br /><br />--&#62; Several times, bright shafts of light pour in through the windows behind the characters as they talk; this effect was used extensively in the earlier film.<br /><br />--&#62; After Cruise's encounter with Crowe, he drives with Agatha through a gorgeous green scenery, and tells her they're going &#34;Someplace safe&#34;, a scene which parallels the ending scene of Blade Runner (the original, not the Director's Cut version)<br /><br />--&#62; As Anderton and Agetha leave the shopping mall they pass a woman on the left hand side carrying an umbrella with an integrated light. This appears identical to those carried by the citizens of Los Angeles in Blade Runner when Deckard walks the streets.<br /><br />I haven't seen either of these movies, mainly because A Clockwork Orange freaks me out too much, and we don't have Bladerunner on DVD. I also noticed similarities to the Matrix (mainly just because of those little spider things, when they're looking for Anderton), and Back To The Future, but I suppose it was just all the future stuff.<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie, although there was a lot of talking about nonsense, which simple people will NOT understand. I'd highly recommend it, if you can stand watching Tom & Colin long enough for Samantha to steal the movie away from them.</p></body></html>

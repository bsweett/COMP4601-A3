<meta name="summary" content="The quintessential feel-good Christmas movie"></head><body><p>Everyone has their films that they must watch during certain holidays.  For some reason, at my house we always watched "Uncle Buck" on Labour Day weekend.  Likewise, Roger Ebert apparently watches "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" every Thanksgiving.  My wife likes to watch "When Harry Met Sally" on New Year's Day.  But Christmas is the time most saturated with films that the season wouldn't be the same without.  "A Christmas Carol," "White Christmas," and some version of "The Grinch" are holiday necessities for many people.  My personal favourite of all these films is Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life."<br /><br />Because the airwaves are saturated with it (because the copyright was not renewed when it expired in the '70's) it's easy to flip by and watch bits until a commercial comes on.  People who have only seen the film this way are missing the joy of the film - it is a finely-crafted vision of a town, the progress of years of the characters in that town, and the steady wearing down of one man's dreams until one Christmas Eve he decides to take his own life.  What he hasn't noticed is all the good he done, and he's momentarily forgotten how much he is loved - by his extended family, by the people in the town touched by his basic goodness.  He is not a Scrooge or Grinch remarkably transformed by the meaning of Christmas, but a good man worn down and worn out that is then rejuvenated by the Spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />Capra and Jimmy Stewart evoke such a sense of place and timing that you can't help by be immersed in the story.  The extended cast weaves in and out of the story, without intruding on the primary narrative.  It's suitable for all ages - in 1947, the MPAA didn't allow anything questionable through - but I suspect that younger viewers will grow bored since the film is mostly dialogue and "grown-up" events.<br /><br />This DVD edition looks very good.  The sound is okay, but as usual, the visuals were cleaned up much more than the sound.  There are a couple short (20 minutes) making-of featurettes, one of which is the same as on the VHS edition that came out many years ago (with Tom Bosley as host).  But the main reason to buy the DVD is so you don't have to sit through the ads and suffer the cuts television stations make to cut down the running time.  This film deserves much better than that!</p></body></html>

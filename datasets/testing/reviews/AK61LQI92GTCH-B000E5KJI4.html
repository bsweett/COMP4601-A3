<meta name="summary" content="Troy"></head><body><p>Slow paced and low-key, about the only thing I liked about TROY were the impressive computer generated battle scenes.  Brad Pitt plays Achilles and Eric Bana his arch foe Hector.  Instead of projecting larger-than-life heroes out at us, they're instead mopey, brooding, and pensive.  This approach may be appropriate for the slacker generation they represent, but it doesn't do much to stir the viewer's adrenline.  Someone forgot to swash the buckle on this one.<br /><br />  Just alright and quickly forgotten.  Glad it was a rental and not a purchase.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Has it's moments but not overall great ..more focuses on the younger audiences and was not funny"></head><body><p>Well this is no Shrek, Findidn Nemo oh wait it's not like most animated films oh wait it is better then Shark's Tale. I found this film to focus more to the younger ages and focuses to much on the naimation and the voces and not on the story. The movie is about Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer). David Schwimmer is the only thing good about the film, Jada Pinkett Smith seems lost and the rest are ok. Overall not that much jokes make the film slow and not intersesting.</p></body></html>

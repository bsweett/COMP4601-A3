And none of the three (Chris Smith's The Pool, Cary Fukunaga's Sin Nombre, and Joshua Marston's Maria Full of Grace) seem to take that provincial "oh, my, look at the interesting natives" approach that's been endemic in American film since Nanook of the North. Obviously, being American myself, and not well-traveled, my main experience of Goa, Mexico, and Colombia, respectively, comes from the media put out by those countries (the novels, the movies, etc.), but going on those, it does seem to me that these filmmakers are trying to look at their subjects from as much a native perspective as they can. That said, it seems that Maria Full of Grace is the least successful of these, in that regard; it focuses on one narrow piece of Colombian life before transferring its action to New York City. On the other hand, looked at just as a film, it is the most successful of the three for precisely that reason; Marston has a story and he's interested in telling it without the details getting in the way.<br /><br />Maria (Che's Catalina Sandino Moreno in her screen debut) is a Colombian teenager whose meager pay stripping the thorns from roses goes towards keeping her entire family fed and clothed. After an altercation with her boss, she quits the job in a fit of pique (and rightfully so), but that leaves her family with no income. Given the choice, she opts for making a lot of money very easily: she becomes a drug mule, as does her best friend Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega in her only screen appearance to date). The first half of the film covers this, along with the two of them befriending another mule, Lucy (Guilied Lopez, another with no other credits), getting loaded up with the drugs, and then heading to New York. The second half of the film is Maria in New York, where things go wrong, as things like this are wont to do, and she finds herself adrift, with her only contacts in the city Lucy's sister, whom she's never met, and the inconstant Blanca.<br /><br />The movie has been hailed many times over for its gritty realism, but no one focuses on the more intriguing idea that this is actually noir. Think about it. There are no good guys in this film (with the possible exception of Don Fernando, a helpful New Yorker, but he is more reporter than participant in the film's events), only bad guys and badder guys. The protagonist is somewhat hapless, has a more hapless sidekick, and finds herself in way over her head from the get-go. Every time Maria attempts to do what she thinks is the right thing, it goes horribly wrong, sometimes more horribly than others. Is that not the essence of noir? Even the ending, which is far more ambivalent than one would expect (noir rarely, if ever, leaves room for hope), is not the kind that normally caps off a straight drama.<br /><br />On the downside, however, is my wife's first comment after she'd thought it over for a while. "Have we seen that before? I don't remember seeing it, but I knew certain scenes before I actually saw them." No, we hadn't seen it before, but it's an understandable reaction; there is very little new here. There is artistry in the production (I originally wrote "production in the artistry" and it seemed right until I reread it, which should tell you something), and a lot of very good acting from people who are not (or were not at the time) actors. But if you experience deja vu while viewing, don't be surprised. ***</p></body></html>

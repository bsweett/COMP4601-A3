<meta name="summary" content="A Horror Story Inspired by a True Story"></head><body><p>I enjoy a good horror story, and this one is that much better by being inspired by the true story of Anneliese Michel, a German woman who experienced a similar progression of events to those depicted in this movie.  I found the movie to be eerie and chilling, and a great movie to inspire thought about the existence of demons in our modern world.  The movie adroitly avoids determining whether there are demons, leaving each viewer to make their own decision.  Though I have always been skeptical regarding stories of possession, this movie certainly was convincing in its portrayal.<br /><br />Emily Rose starts life rather unremarkably.  She was brought up in a family that was strongly, but not extremely, religious.  She went away to college on a full scholarship, the pride of her family.  After a while, Emily began experiencing hallucinations, and she became convinced that demons possessed her.  A number of physical manifestations of Emily Rose's symptoms were very realistic and frightening.  Eventually Emily Rose requested an exorcism be performed after medical treatment seemed to fail.  Soon after the exorcism was performed, Emily Rose died.<br /><br />The trial of the priest that performed the exorcism is the central plot to this movie.  We see Emily Rose's life through the priest's eyes.  The story builds in terror as Emily's symptoms increase.  When the priest's agnostic attorney experiences bizarre manifestations, I started really getting chills down my spine.  I am unable to provide more details without giving away so much that there will be no need to watch the movie.<br /><br />I have always thought that the best horror movies rely on psychology.  This movie does just that.  The amount of blood is minimal, though some of the images are horrifying.  I was unable to see anything in the movie that I thought deserved more than a PG-13 rating, which makes the unrated version a lot of hype, but what is there enhances the chill factor substantially.<br /><br />Hollywood rarely attempts a movie with this level of sophistication.  When it does, it seems like there are inadequate rewards.  In the case of this movie, I confirm Siskel and Roeper's two thumbs up.  Fans of psychological horror and those who have always believed in demon possession will find this movie sufficiently horrific that they will want to watch this one more than once.</p></body></html>

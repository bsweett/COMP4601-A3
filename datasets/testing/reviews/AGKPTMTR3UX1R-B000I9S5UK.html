And that's largely it. A broken-down undercover cop-turned-desk sergeant (Ethan Hawke) is spending a quiet New Year's Eve packing file boxes in his about-to-be-closed down precinct house when cop-killer Laurence Fishburne is brought in.<br /><br />Suddenly, Precinct 13 becomes a war zone as a mysterious group of men lay siege to the building. It soon becomes evident that these are Fishburne's criminal associates, bent on killing him before he can talk. They cut the power, kill the phone lines and jam the radios. Worse yet, Detroit is enveloped in a blizzard, making escape impossible. Hawke and Fishburne, along with Police Department staffers Drea deMatteo and Maria Bello, and a handful of miscreants from the downstairs lockup become a kind of modern-day Alamo, holding off the bad guys.<br /><br />It's an exercise in adrenaline as thousands of rounds are fired and the scene is punctuated by explosions and raging fires. Why the Detroit Fire Department and the National Guard never show up to investigate the noise and flame is a good question, but reality is not a major commodity in this picture. A trackless forest and hills magically appear in Motor City, providing a backdrop to the film's climactic scenes.<br /><br />This is a good purebred action story. There is some excellent character development in the script, more than enough to make you care who wins and loses. Fishburne and Hawke act beyond the limitations of their roles. An aging Brian Dennehy does a turn as the cranky Police Chief. Drea deMatteo is pretty, though seemingly typecast as the office strumpet.<br /><br />The fetching Maria Bello is, as always, better than expected. Given Ms. Bello's relatively limited exposure and the fact that she is of an age where Hollywood eats females, it is a pleasure to see that her star is rising.<br /><br />A fine distraction, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 will keep you entertained.</p></body></html>

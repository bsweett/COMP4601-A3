<meta name="summary" content="A classic movie if there ever was one"></head><body><p>This is one of the top movies in my all time favorites list and for good reason.  It came out two years before I even reached age 10 but I remember seeing and it being fascinated in a chilled sense.  The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous (and somewhat dark) take on the classic Christmas tale--eventually becoming a classic itself.  The first movie to be made in stop motion features memorable characters, brilliant music and great talent.  Parents concerned if The Nightmare Before Christmas is too dark for some of their children should put those feelings to rest; it's a movie and an entertaining one at that.  Like most adventure-influenced children's movies this has its good characters and scary ones.  But it's still fun and shouldn't freak one's kids out at all.  Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those films that is both fun and brilliant.  It's classic!</p></body></html>

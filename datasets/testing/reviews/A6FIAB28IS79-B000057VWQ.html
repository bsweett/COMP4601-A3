Now that it's been removed from public domain and its distribution returned to studio control, perhaps we can begin to appreciate once again what an extraordinary film it actually is.<p>New viewers, especially, have the opportunity to approach the movie not with assumptions about its &quot;excessive sentimentality&quot; but to experience the darkness of George Bailey's suicidal descent, without  which the film's ending would not provide such overwhelming relief and celebration of life's &quot;wonderfulness.&quot;  But prior to this emotional pay-off, we are also first-hand witnesses to much emotional pain.  George's &quot;surrender&quot; to Mary, for example, is perhaps the most memorable kiss in all of film because of its violence (he curses and practically strangles her while yielding up his idealistic dreams of personal greatness).  And later when it appears he has transplanted his grandiose visions to Bedford Falls, where he is its proudest citizen, we suddenly see what his pride has led him to: a complacent self-satisfaction so great it can lead him to thoughts of self-destruction over the disappearance of a mere $5000.<p>More than Scrooge's stinginess or Dante the Pilgrim's sinfulness, George's story reminds us of our own misplaced piorities and their distorted, potentially fatal, consequences.  This is a film that encourages self-examination and affirmation of life like few others.  And because of it's archetypal patterns and complex, rich details of production and performance (it's far more than a &quot;talking picture&quot;), the film can never be reduced to a mere &quot;message.&quot;  It invites numerous viewings, each leading to the discovery of fresh, new meanings.<p>  If you see one film a year, make it this one (even if it's not during Christmas).</p></body></html>

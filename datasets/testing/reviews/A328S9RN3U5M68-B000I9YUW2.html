But for the casual viewer who just picks up this DVD to view because something  (the cast, the graphics, the tone) appealed, this is a fine little thriller that engages your interest and your compassion and ultimately your mind.<br /><br />It has been 14 months since an airplane with five Brooklyn children went down at sea and Telly (the always impressive Julianne Moore) is still grieving for her lost 9-year-old son Sam.  She savors photographs, memories (in flashback sequences which are about as tender as mother/son relationships have been pictured), and yet cannot let go and move on.  Her husband (Anthony Edwards) is supportive as is her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise), but gradually Telly discovers that photographs and memorabilia of her son Sam have been altered or have disappeared.  Confrontation with her husband results in her being told that she never had a son, that she is delusional, and all of her support systems vanish.  Convinced she is right she encounters Ash (Dominic West) who, though now a drunk, was 'apparently' the single father of Sam's best friend Lauren, although on the surface he denies ever having a child.  Telly finds ways to convince Ash to remember and together they set out on a string of events that leads to occult questions about 'The Experiment' that is apparently known to the FBI (among them Lee Tergesen) but has not convinced the local law enforcement (Alfre Woodward).  Odd creature signs appear (in the character of the alien-like Linus Roache), and Telly and Ash are on the run, determined that their children are alive, and in the end the quest of the 'experiment' to discover the particular bond between mother (or father) and child is strained to the bizarre conclusion.<br /><br />The script by Gerald DiPege and the direction by Joseph Ruben work well in synchrony and though the story may offend viewers who disdain the possibility of life outside the earth's surface, the amount of emphasis on parent/child relationships far outweighs the potential hokiness of the manner in which that aspect of the film is challenged.  Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Alfre Woodward, and Gary Sinise give excellent performances (along with a superb supporting cast) and the commitment these actors display makes the movie solid.  Ease up on credibility issues, go out on a limb,  and take this flight of fantasy as a means to explore larger issues and you'll find this film has more merit than you would expect.

<meta name="summary" content="a dissapointment"></head><body><p>The Matrix started off a trilogy that could have and should have been awesome. The original was a classic and shall always be remembered. It's a one of a kind movie. On the other hand, the sequel lost me at certain plot points and had some unnecessary and boring parts but the compelling and absolutely awesome fighting scenes and "the chase" make it a very solid and good movie. And then, we go to the Matrix Revolutions. I was really excited to see the last installment of this trilogy but I was very dissapointed at the end.<br /><br />First off, I don't understand why certain characters are introduced and then that's it. They just dissapear. The frenchman reappeared in this one, but nothing really happened with him. The trainmaster was introduced and fought Neo and then he just dissapeared. The movie does have one awesome scene where the sentinels fight humans and giant robots that they pilot with big guns, miniguns, and rocket launchers. But, this scene did seem to last forever, a little too long than it should have. But, it still was very neat and awesome. And then, there's the ending which was a letdown to me. I won't go into details but this movie was even more of a letdown because the awesome precedessors were ended by a strange, and dissapointed conclusion. If you're a big fan, or just want to watch the REALLY LONG BATTLE SCENE, it's worth a buy, or else, buy the original which is a good movie while the sequels only have really cool and neat moments but are boring and confusing. The Matrix Reloaded is better than this one though because it has way more cool and awesome scenes. Well, there it is, my views on the final installment of a trilogy.</p></body></html>

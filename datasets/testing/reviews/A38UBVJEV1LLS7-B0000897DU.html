However, while the plot falls a little flat (not to bad though) the acting more than makes up for the abrupt ending and overused plot. (Think "Glitter" but with much better results). I was also very impressed with Kim (can't go wrong with that choice) and Murphy (whom I am also fond of, without Ashton). Overall this is a "kinda" must see, just for the simply fact that the hype didn't turn out to be total bull this time. <p>Also, a well deserved Oscar.</p></body></html>

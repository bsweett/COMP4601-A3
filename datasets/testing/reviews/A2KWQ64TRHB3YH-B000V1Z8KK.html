<meta name="summary" content="Excellent action film"></head><body><p>Stephen Hunter's Swagger books, about the country folk father and the son, both unusual marksmen, are superb. I recommend them. They are, of course, better than the movie, but this is usually the case when books are made into films. Nevertheless, the film is excellent. There is no let up in the action. The plot is superb, with its twists and turns, and the ever honest idealistic Bobby Lee Swagger does what he feels he has to do and he does so humbly, without swagger, but with gusto.</p></body></html>

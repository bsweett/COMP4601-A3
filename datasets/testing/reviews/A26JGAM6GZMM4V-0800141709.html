In that same year, Sidney Lumet's Fail Safe was also released. Both pose the same question "What if someone accidentally launched an air strike armed with thermonuclear weapons...and it could not be recalled?" However, they offer quite different answers. Credit Stanley Kramer's On the Beach (1959) with alerting the world to a possibility which seemed a probability when the Cuban Missile Crisis developed in October of 1962. In sharp contrast with Fail Safe which remains earnest but now seems somewhat stale and certainly dated, those who see Dr. Strangelove still savor the genius of Peter Sellers as he plays three major characters (President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake), joined by a surprisingly hilarious George C. Scott (General Buck Turgison) and Sterling Hayden (as psychotic General Jack D. Ripper, self-appointed defender of his nation's precious body fluids). They and other cast members create one memorable comic moment after another. The film concludes as Slim Pickens' Major T.J. ("King") Kong prepares to engage in what he calls "Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!" Few other film comedies have held up this well, especially after almost four decades. One final point. I am so appreciative of the DVD format which, of course, offers clearer sound and image but also of supplementary mnaterial such as the featurette: "The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove" and the documentary: "Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove."</p></body></html>

If she doesn't get it in 20 minutes, he will rob the store near the phone booth where he called her. The money belongs to a gangster who will kill Manni if he doesn't get the cash.<br /><br />There are three different scenarios on Lola's mad dash to rescue her boyfriend. It shows how each encounter with people changed their lives.<br /><br />I liked it because it was different from any movie I've seen. It got a little too far out with the very brief moments she brushed by people. But the main parts of the story was good.<br /><br />Well, great idea for a script. Just needed a little tweaking.</p></body></html>

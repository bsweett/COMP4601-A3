<meta name="summary" content="The Best Of Humankind On One Of Its Darkest Days"></head><body><p>In a lot of ways, the horrific events of September 11, 2001 are things that we as a nation here in America have still not yet come to grips with on any concise, clear-headed level without macho warmongering and bloodthirsty revenge intruding.  The bottom line is that, like the Holocaust, the 9/11 attacks were a prime example of Man's inhumanity to Man.  But there were acts of heroism that day that proved that there is more to us than murder and bloodshed.  This is what is at the heart of director Oliver Stone's film WORLD TRADE CENTER.<br /><br />Naturally, Stone's reputation as a political lightning rod, with films like PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, JFK, and NIXON, makes him a perfect whipping boy for the right-wing fanatics who would brand him a loony or anti-American while at the same time hypocritically using the 9/11 tragedy as so much political propaganda.  But in telling the true-life saga of Port Authority officers William McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), he has given us an example of both American and just plain HUMAN heorism that those on the far-right couldn't manufacture on even their best day.  McLoughlin and Jimeno had gone in, along with 340 of their fellow Port Authority officers, to rescue people trapped inside the World Trade Center towers that day, only to find themselves needing help when the towers collapsed around them and they were trapped under thousands of tons of debris for twenty hours.  Stone, a native of New York, shows us what the Big Apple's finest and bravest had on their hands that day, and brings this whole terrible ordeal to where it OUGHT to be--a personal and human level, not merely a polemic about gung-ho American patriotism, save, loosely, for the Marine who went in there to help Jimeno and McLoughlin out of their would-be grave.  He also shows us the horror and distress felt by the men's wives and families, often through flashbacks during their nightmarish ordeal under the rubble.<br /><br />Like the earlier 9/11 films of this year, the superb FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, WORLD TRADE CENTER looks at 9/11 from the point of view of what really matters--an apocalyptic event in human history in which brave people stood up and fought not only for their lives, but also to save hundreds, if not thousands, of others.  Cage and Pena do a fine job of portraying McLoughlin and Jimeno, respectively, and the entire cast and production move with deliberate pace under the careful direction of Stone, who has left the flashy but excellent editing style of JFK behind here for something much more contemplative.  This movie, as with FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, proves that Hollywood is ready to deal with the human nightmare of 9/11, and so too are the American people.  The question now is, Are the politicians out there ready to deal with it that way too?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A film of true heroism"></head><body><p>At first I didn't think I could watch this film (a sneak preview), it was a horrendous day for everyone in the USA . At last, I  prepared myself to  watch United 93. This is a frightening reenactment  of what could have happened on the airplane that didn't make it's intended attack on Washington DC. It has always been easy for me to sit thru a fictional horror film or thriller. Because we know it is make believe and it is for entertainment.This movie strikes a new chord on the human soul. I didn't think I could handle it. But I am glad I did choose to see it.There were people who thought  this movie should not be released.<br /><br />Let me assure you. You will not leave the film depressed. It is uplifting in a way. Because of the heroic actions of the Americans in the film. It makes you proud to be an American. I highly recommend seeing it. Even for the families of the people on the plane. The director turns each passenger into a hero. It won't be easy to watch. But you really shouldn't turn away from this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="**** SUPERIOR REMAKE ****"></head><body><p>Back in 1989 when Stephen Soderbergh triumphantly arrived on the movie scene with the multi-award winning debut movie Sex, Lies and Videotape the world seemed at his feet. Then followed 9 years of relative obscurity before the release of the excellent 'Out of Sight', starring Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney. Since then of course Mr Soderbergh's career has gone from strength to strength with critical and popular acclaim for Traffic and Erin Brockovich, not to mention the small matter of Oscar recognition.<p>So what of 'Oceans Eleven', the star-studded remake of the 1960 Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack picture? Well, first off, when it was announced as Soderbergh's next movie, it certainly seemed like an odd choice. The original movie was after all, by all apparent accounts, (to put it kindly) not that good and it was generally felt that it had been something of a vanity project for Old Blue Eyes. Then of course details of the cast started to emerge, and what a cast it is, which includes; George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle (with a silly and pointless English accent), Elliot Gould and in a cameo appearance, world boxing champion Lennox Lewis. Surely the combination of Soderbergh, Clooney, Roberts, Pitt et al could not miss, could it? <p>The story revolves around Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a career criminal who has just emerged from a stretch in jail (cooly wearing a blue tuxedo, of course) and his attempts to put together a crew (of eleven) to rob three Las Vegas casino's. Not only is it his aim to spirit away $80m from a seamingly impenetrable vault but all this is to be achieved whilst wooing back his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) who is dating the sleazy casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). To help in achieving this aim Danny contacts old friend Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), and gets bank-rolled by an ex-Vegas tycoon (Elliot Gould), who has a personal grudge against Benedict. Together they form a crew including a Chinese acrobat (Shaobo Qin), and a Jewish con man (Carl Reiner). Precisely what everyone's role is in the heist and indeed the movie is not always clear and perhaps because of this Matt Damon kind of gets lost among the myriad of stars and Julia Roberts is only really required to smile and look good (which of course she does). <p>Much of the pleasure in this movie is seeing all the plans of the heist fall into place with the odd twist and turn. It also has plenty of humour to bring a smile to your face and although this may not be the most exciting heist movie you will ever see, it is none the less everything that that the original tried and failed to be; smart, stylish and quintessentially cool.</p></body></html>

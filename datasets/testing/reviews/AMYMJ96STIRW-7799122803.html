These movies are lovingly and painstaking put together piece by brilliantly crafted piece with results...particularly like "Alice..." that are mind boggling. And yet all the nit picking!<br />I was overwhelmed by "Avatar" and then along comes this Johnny Depp starring plunge into the surreal.<br />What a joy to behold.<br />What a pleasure just to relish in the sheer ingenuity and the aesthetic rush.<br />This would be the movie to take to that "desert island" ... at least for now!</p></body></html>

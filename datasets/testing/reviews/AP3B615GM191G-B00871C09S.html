<meta name="summary" content="Hitch Breaks New Ground Again"></head><body><p>By today's standards, a film like "Rear Window" would seem quite uninspired, unoriginal, and just plain derivative (see: Disturbia).  However, when one considers that Hitchcock's "Window" actually SET the standard, it really can be considered a groundbreaking film.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Rear Window" sees photographer L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) laid up with a broken leg, with nothing else to do but stare out the window at the activities of his city-dwelling neighbors.  One neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) in particular, though, arouses the interest of Jeffries due to his strange behavior and disappearing wife.  At first, things seem relatively harmless, until Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) gets pulled into the proceedings, making things a whole lot more personal.<br /><br />Once again, this movie shows just how far ahead of the game Alfred Hitchcock was compared to other directors of his time.  In 1954, while other directors were cranking out B-pictures, character flicks, or even "variety show" events that did nothing more than draw crowds, Hitch was crafting a spooky tale of voyeurism that still holds up very well to this day.  The directing is fantastic, as Hitch slowly builds the tension to a few scenes towards the end that will make your blood run cold.<br /><br />The acting is also top-notch.  You can't go wrong with Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly shows that she isn't just a "pretty face" as well.  Raymond Burr (though only uttering a few lines of dialogue) is also intriguing as the antagonist throughout.<br /><br />About the only criticism I have of this film (what drops it from a 5-star to 4-star rating) is that Hitch puts in some character development just for the sake of character development...it doesn't really lead anywhere.  A full 20 minutes could have been cut out in relation to character-building, and the overall product might have been more exciting/better paced.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a great movie that truly stands the test of time.  Whatever you do, don't go for the "remake" Disturbia.  Instead, immerse yourself in Hitchcock's original fare and see the master at his best.</p></body></html>

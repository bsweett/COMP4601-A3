<meta name="summary" content="Funny, and sophisticated - all a romantic comedy should be"></head><body><p>I admit that "Something's Gotta Give" [not a great title!] was not on my must-see list. Now, having seem it, it is my must own DVD list. While its stars, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, are two of my all-time favorites, most recent romantic comedies have not been original, funny or, for that matter, particularly romantic. While the only thing in the least original about the movie is the fact that the leads are practically senior citizens, it is outrageously funny and extraordinarily romantic. <p>Harry [Nicholson] is a dedicated playboy who always dates young women. The sad thing is that he is now 63, perilously close to being old enough to be some of his girlfriends' grandfather. One summer day his latest flame, Marin [Amanda Peet], takes him on a weekend outing to her mother's beach house in The Hamptons. The couple is surprised to find that Erica [Keaton], the mom, is also visiting. Erica is a famous playwright. She writes romantic comedies, but, being 57 and divorced, she long ago gave up on falling in love again herself. Suddenly, Harry has a heart attack. The attending physician, Dr. Meyer [Keanu Reeves], suggests that Harry stay at Erica's house for awhile until he is strong enough to go back to New York. It turns out that Meyer has a thing for older women, and he begins to pursue Erica. Meanwhile, Harry's brush with death is causing him to rethink his life [maybe older ain't so bad], while Meyer is forcing Erica to rethink hers [maybe younger is the answer]. The ultimate solution to this love triangle is predictable, but the getting there is great fun. <p>Director/writer Nancy Meyers, herself 54, has written a mature, witty, sophisticated screenplay, but I think she herself knows that it is the magnetism of Keaton and Nicholson that makes the movie such a great success. [Interesting note: In real life the two once were lovers] The supporting cast is excellent and includes Amanda Peet Jon Favreau  and Frances McDormand.] <p>If there is a problem with the movie, it is that it may be somewhat too sophisticated for today's mainstream audiences and critics. It has a very French feel to it, which is perhaps why the ending takes place in Paris.</p></body></html>

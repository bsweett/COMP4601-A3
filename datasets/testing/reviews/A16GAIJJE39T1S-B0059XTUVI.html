<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Steep is excellent as Margaret Thatcher, but too much time is devoted to her as an old woman suffering from dementia"></head><body><p>This film is plotted from a retrospective point of view--from that of Margaret Thatcher as an elderly widow suffering from dementia.  Photographs, music, and TV programs serve to remind the declining old woman of her younger years and her glory days of Prime Minister.  Unfortunately this plotting device devotes too much time to her hallucinations--going through the same sort of imaginings again and again--especially those in which she conjures up the presence of her late husband.  This time would have been better spent on detailing her personal life and work in Parliament and as Prime Minister--or even her younger days as a shopkeepers daughter.  They also would have done well to show her interacting with her friend "Ronny" Reagan--an aspect of her tenure as PM that seems to have been all but forgotten here.<br /><br />Despite this awkward and tedious retrospective framework, this movie has moments that shine--for which we can thank consummate actress Meryl Streep.  I especially enjoyed the part where she acts on the advice of her political advisers and works to remake herself into someone who the voters can better respond to, and who they could imagine as Prime Minister.  The elocution lessons in which she is taught to speak in the grand way that Brits has come to expect from their leaders is hilarious!</p></body></html>

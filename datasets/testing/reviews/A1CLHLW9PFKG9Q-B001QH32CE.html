Her dream is to make enough money to open up her own Pie Diner.<br /><br />She lives with an abusive husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto), who gets her pregnant after a night of drunkenness. How's that for using big words to imply deeds?<br /><br />Jenna decides to keep the baby but she is not happy about it. she discovers that she's fallen in love with her new doctor(Nathan Fillion). And they proceed to make every opportunity to be together and "practice" making babies.<br /><br />Once she's in the hospital, to get birth, the diner's owner, Old Joe (Andy Griffith) stops by to give her a gift. It's enough money to buy his diner for herself.<br /><br />Once the baby is born, Jenna tells her husband, Earl, she wants a divorce and tells the doctor, to leave enough alone and love his current wife. Oh yeah, forgot that little detail did we?<br /><br />The DVD box promotes this movie as if it will be a romantic comedy about this waitress trying to get into a pie-making contest. When the truth is, they mention this contest 2 times in the entire movie.<br /><br />The moral we get from this movie are: it's okay to cheat on your husband as long as he's abusive because you should do whatever makes you happy.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, continue to avoid it. It's pathetic.</p></body></html>

Donald Plesance came back as Dr. Loomis Jamie Lee Curtis returned as Laurie Strode we are also introduced Jimmy played by Lance Guest Dick Warlock plays Michael Myers. Ok the plot is straight forward it's the same night Halloween of 1978 Michael is on the loose Laurie is in The Hospital Loomis & Sheriff Brackett are looking for Michael. Brackett isn't in it for long cause they find his daughters body you do find out that Michael & Laurie are brother & sister I would've loved to seen the reaction it got back in 81. I've heard that this movie runs at a slow pace I feel it runs at a fast pace you want slow paced watch H2 2009 that's trying to be a Greek Tragedy it's a tragedy to watch. I liked Loomis,  Laurie even though she doesn't have a lot to do Jimmy aka Jamie's father & if I have characters I like the longest of movies go by quickly. The last 10-15 minutes own Michael Myers is burnt to death! Then Halloween III came out everybody hated it cause Michael Myers wasn't in it but I thought it was alright then Michael was brought back for 4. I also have a version with the TV scenes mixed in the theatrical version where you find out Jimmy is still alive. I'm hoping 1 day this gets a special edition. This can be watched with the 1st as a double feature you get The Night He Came Home & the Night He Stays for more. But it's hard to pick a favorite between 1&.2.</p></body></html>

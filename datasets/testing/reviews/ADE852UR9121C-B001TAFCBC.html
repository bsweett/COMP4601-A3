It is based on a simple premise but it is told in such a way that leaves me in awe everytime I watch it.<br /><br />Joel is an all-round nice guy who lives a very normal and quiet life. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Clementine shows Joel the wild side of things. She makes things exciting. They're in love. But it's not long before each finds the other annoying. They feel suffocated in the relationship, and they want out. Clementine goes to a clinic and gets her memories removed. Joel, who finds out about this decides to do the same and we are shown glimpses of memories that is being erased while Joel is, in fact unconcious in his living room.<br /><br />If I was unclear about the story, I'm sorry...but this is a movie that you have too see to truly understand. What grabbed me most about this movie was the screenplay and the acting. The story is something we all can relate to...I mean, who hasn't been so in love only to find that it's not working out and soon, you wish that you never met that person. Based on this, Charlie Kaufman has conjured a magnificent story about these two people, as different as light and day, who end up being happy with each another. The love between the characters are described in specific memories, and moments rather than words...and that's the true beauty of this movie. Because of this, it does not end up being like every other romantic movie out there. This movie also questions the viewer, if given a chance...would you really give up the memories of a past love? Would it make you happier? If that love is strong enough, could it bring the two of you back together? These are some of the questions that I pondered upon watching this movie. Charlie Kaufman deservedly won an Oscar for this screenplay.<br /><br />The acting was also superb. Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances here. I was mesmerized by what he brought to his character. Kate Winslet also shines in her role as Clementine. Their acting made the love between their characters seem so real and honest. They strengthen Kaufman's script so well that the whole movie seems natural. The supporting actors are no less impressive. The whole cast brings a certain authenticity to the movie.<br /><br />To be honest, I have not watched a movie as good as this for a long time. It gives a breath of fresh air towards a dying genre of movies in Hollywood, and that is romance. Intelligent, creative and original are some of the words I would choose to describe this movie. You can do no wrong with getting "Eternal Sunshine...". Trust me.</p></body></html>

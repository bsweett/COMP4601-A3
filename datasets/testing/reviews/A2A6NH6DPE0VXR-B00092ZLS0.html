<meta name="summary" content="Dakota Fanning makes the movie"></head><body><p>Hide and Seek is about a father and daugher (Deniro and Fanning) who move to start over after the mother dies tragically. Fanning has no friends there and soon a friend named Charlie enters the picture. However she's the only one that sees him. When weird things start to happen in the house Deniro suspects Fanning because she's the only other person there. She puts the blame on her friend Charlie though which makes Deniro think she needs to speak to a shrink for kids. The under-rated  Famke Janssen (X-Men and Nip/Tuck season 2) plays the shrink who wants to help Fanning. Elisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas)  also stars as a women who starts dating Deniro. At dinner Fanning warns Shue that she might wind up like her mother. Fanning pulls off scenes like that great. She's pretty creepy in this movie.<br /><br />  The movie is well paced and well acted but the trailer itself never left much for the imagination. I mean it takes the surprise out of Shue's characters fate and what even happens to her. Plus when the sheriff asks Fanning what she's drawing and says "you dieing". Well then you know his fate as well. So the trailer doesn't leave many surprises. Plus is disapointing to me that it's not the "my imaginary friend is the killer" kind of movie I expected. I mean I can't really think of any movies that had that concept. So it could've been a great idea for a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, that's half way the idea of this movie but it doesn't go all the way with it. It's a shame because Fanning is in top form here and could've really done something with that. If it did this could've been the next Sitxh Sense. The twist still is decent though I guess. if you never saw Secret Window you might even see the twist as original... I hope saying that didn't give too much away though.</p></body></html>

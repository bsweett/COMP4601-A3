<meta name="summary" content="Whose The Audience For This Flick?"></head><body><p>For starters the stop motion animation and 3-D effects are pretty darned good here.  That's about it.  My complaint with alot of 3-D movies is that they fashion the movies around the effects at the expense of the story.  There's a story alright but the problem here is that when it's not confusing it's downright creepy.  Who were they targetting for this flick?  Little kids who might get the bejesus scared out of them?  Disaffected adolescents who glory in unsavory imagery?  Whatever!  Ultimately "Coraline" is just a waste of time.</p></body></html>

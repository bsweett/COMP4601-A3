<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter Gets Political"></head><body><p>Picking up where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7414C">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a> let off, the fifth Harry Potter flick is the dark tale of maturing students thrust into some very adult conflicts. After he sees the murder of his friend Cedric by the evil Lord Voldemort, Harry finds himself at the brunt of a smear campaign. Seems the head of the Ministry of Magic doesn't like the fact that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are talking about Voldemort's return and is doing everything he can to discredit their reputations. Sort of like the Fox News of magic.<br /><br />As such, Fudge contrives to have the persnickety policy stooge Delores Umbridge (a perfectly cast Imelda Staunton) to makes sure that Hogwarts operates in the manner the ministry deems most fit, even if it means playing dirty. Dissent is callously stifled, relationships are prudishly regulated and students are forced to take equivalency exams that drive Hermione to gripe "We're not learning how to defend ourselves; we're learning how to pass our O.W.L.s." (No wizard left behind, maybe?) The movie then shifts into high gear, driving Harry and a select group of students into an underground mission, to train against Lord Voldemort and protect Hogwarts from not just the evil without but from the conservatives within.<br /><br />Where "The Order of The Phoenix" significantly differs from the other Harry Potter films is in its seriousness. Snape (Alan Rickman finally getting to reassert his character away from buffoonery) reveals why his animosity for Harry runs so deep. Ron and Hermione are acting as young adults, with new characters (Cho, Nymphadora and Luna) sparking Harry's adolescent hormones. Draco Malfoy is not a caricature in this film, and his father Luscious returns as a malevolent force. Helena Bonham Carter brings villainy to Bellatrix Lestrange (shrieking "You Half Blood!" at Harry at one moment). The whimsical tone of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W10FWU">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W74EQC">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a> is replaced (and is kind of a loss) by the darkening of the mood and themes. But after all, it is hard to stay young and cute after 6 years and with an Evil Lord jamming your mind and seeking to destroy you.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix" is a transitional movie in a series gradually forging into maturity. In fact, this is a difficult movie to recommend for younger children because of the darker themes and political intrigue (torturing students is pretty darn dark, even as fantasy goes). But as Daniel Radcliff shows that his acting skills are advancing beautifully and the series refuses to bland out, this is a highly recommendable DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Update - Blu Ray is Outstanding"></head><body><p>My original review is below. Updating to reflect my views of the Blu Ray transfer - its simply phenomenal.  A definite 5/5 star rating for both the video and audio quality.<br /><br />___<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie largely because of its excellence in several different categories.  First, the cinematography, camera angles, set design, production values, etc. are simply outstanding.  Brilliant use of flash-back work, slowly falling snow (reminds me of that great sword fight scene in Kill Bill), etc. all combine to create a visually stunning film.  Second, the acting was very good.  The cast was great, and each person was outstanding for his/her particular role.  Ben Kingsly was very believable as a brilliant psych, and his team were great too (including the German guy - perfect casting for the role).  Even Leo, who I often find unbelievable, was outstanding.  The story was phenomenal too.  I was really expecting a more shock/horror type film, but this was much more aligned with the thriller/suspense line.  The movie ends with intimating that one of two potential interpretations of the film are possible.  I personally believe that the evidence for one interpretation outweighs the other (largely because of a final line of dialogue - "is it better to live as a monster or die as a good guy" (or something like that).  But the story is so well constructed that you could legitimately argue for either interpretation.  Further, while potential twists are somewhat telegraphed early in the film, the primary premise is so well developed and so believable that you don't find yourself constantly predicting the ending.  You should note that the film invites thinking and a bit of debate; if you're looking for a mindless thriller, you'll enjoy, but you'll enjoy much more if you're willing to be cerebrally engaged.</p></body></html>

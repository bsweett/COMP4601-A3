And he's also hoping to cheat on his wife Kelly (Radha Mitchell) with Pamela (Katie Holmes). In the pantheon of the world's villains, Stu is relatively minor. But not to The Sniper.<p>All of PHONE BOOTH was filmed on a single set, depicted as the site of the last enclosed phone booth in Manhattan, at 53rd and 8th. Hearing the booth's phone ring, Shephard picks it up. The audience hears (as a voiceover) the disembodied words of The Sniper. Apparently peering from an overlook above the street, the caller threatens Stu with death if he hangs up and leaves. An appropriate demonstration of his shooting capability is provided, which anchors Stu in the booth.<p>The Sniper has recently executed two of society's sleazebags, one a pornographer. Now it's Shepahard's turn, unless he repents publicly for his many sins, all knowledgeably listed by his tormentor. And to whom is Stu to make this confession? Well, to the hordes of police now surrounding the booth, who think the body in the street is Stu's doing. To the on-site police commander, Capt. Ramey (Forest Whitaker), who has to sort out the mess while wondering why Shephard is glued to the phone. To the broadcast media descending with soundtrucks and cameras. And to Kelly and Pamela, both drawn to the scene by the live TV coverage.<p>Farrell is the unquestioned star of this nail-biter, but it wouldn't work without The Sniper's mesmerizing voice (provided by Kiefer Sutherland). It could be the voice of Satan himself welcoming Stu to Hell, and Farrell's bravura performance leaves the audience with no doubt that he's burning in his own personal napalm of self-judgement, humiliation, and terror.<p>Once one accepts the plot's premise, there's no fault to be found with this film. As an entertainment vehicle, it delivers edge-of-the-seat tension, a moral message, and a satisfying twist of an ending. And even a bit of humor, as when three local working girls berate the beleaguered Shephard for monopolizing the means of secure contact with their Johns.<p>PHONE BOOTH is a jewel of escapism.</p></body></html>

Based on the enormously popular 60's TV show starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, the film, produced by Stan Lee and Avi Arad, deviates from the cliched, but excellent storyline of the original series. Eric Bana ("Troy"; see my review) steps into Mr. Bixby/Ferrigno's iconic role...to middling success. His portrayal of Bruce Banner (David in the original) was well done. Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly ("The Rocketeer," "A Beautiful Mind") does even better as Betty Ross (I hope there was no pun intended on the woman who designed the first American flag), Bruce's long-suffering, ex-girlfriend (a slight extension on her character in "A Beautiful Mind," if you will). I liked HER portrayal THE BEST. If she'd gotten naked, I wouldn't complain (but I guess Universal didn't want to make this into an R-rated picture; our loss). Sam Elliot is equally brilliant as General Ross. Josh Lucas (who's he?) was deliciously venomous as Talbot, a corporate s.o.b who's hell-bent on destroying the Hulk "By any means neccessary." Oscar winner Nick Nolte turns in an ambiguous performance as Bruce's father, who's hiding a deadly secret. The famous line "Don't make me angry; you wouldn't like me when I'm angry," IS in the film; close your ears and you'll miss it.<br /><br />Had I directed this movie, it probably would've been rated R. The ending left me wanting a bit of closure, but it leaves it open for another movie. PLEASE DO A SEQUEL!! Rated PG for some violence.</p></body></html>

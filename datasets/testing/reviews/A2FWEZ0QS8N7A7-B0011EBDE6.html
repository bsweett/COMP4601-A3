<meta name="summary" content="Your Fifth or Your First?  It Matters"></head><body><p>So how many Wes Anderson films have you seen?  If Darjeeling is your first, you may well give more than three stars to this story of three brothers more or less trying to reconnect as they more or less search for their mother on a slow train through a lot of India.  If, as with me, it is your fifth you may find that the characters' quirkiness has become just a bit too pat, that the meandering plot twists feel arbitrary not right and that the film might have been better titled Wes and the Gang Go to India. That's not to say that Darjeeling fails to entertain.  It is splendidly shot, very well-acted, funny, and sometimes moving.  For one fifteen or twenty minute segment that begins with an attempted rescue in a flooded river, it achieves grace and wisdom, and is as good as anything Anderson has directed.  It also has a priceless opening sequence with Bill Murray and, as often in Anderson's films, Anjelica Huston bringing both common sense and majesty to the mix.  But even with those assets, Darjeeling feels more canned than true.</p></body></html>

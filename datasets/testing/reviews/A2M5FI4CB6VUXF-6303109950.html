<meta name="summary" content="So much about this movie bugged me"></head><body><p>I am giving this movie 4 stars, but what I'd really like to do is give it 3.5.<br /><br />So much about this movie bugged me, but it was a great action flick and was a movie about one of my "Old West" heroes, so there you go. I give it an extra half star because of that. (Well that, and it stars Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton and an EXCELLENT Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday!)<br /><br />The portrayals were pretty spot on... however, so many facts in this movie were mixed up and made up and forged and falsified that it might as well be called Historical Fiction.<br /><br />First, When Wyatt and the boys are going to disarm the Clanton gang, we see a building burning in the background. Though Virgil's attention is momentarily drawn, he continues on toward handling the misdemeanor crime of carrying a weapon in town, rather than doing his duty to help put out the fire. As the town would've likely not had a great system for putting out fires, (No fire station for one!) It was up to Virgil as the ranking law man to see to it that this fire was put out. This would have been his first concern. Not whether or not some drunk idiots were carrying concealed weapons.<br /><br />Second, Morgan was not killed on the same night Virgil was shot. Virgil was shot in December, just two months after the OK Corrall Incident. Morgan was murdered in March the following year.<br /><br />Furthermore, the COWBOYS did not wear red sashes. Curly Bill was not the leader, nor was Ike Clanton, nor was Johnny Ringo. The Cowboys were a loose band of outlaws. The whole point of being an outlaw is that you don't want to follow a leader. You might be banded together for a common purpose but you don't recognize authority.<br /><br />There is no proof that Doc Holliday killed Johnny Ringo. In fact, it's more than likely he did not, as he was reportedly not in the area when and where Ringo's body was found. Most reports today claim Ringo's wound was self-inflicted.<br /><br />Wyatt was not at the Sanitarium where Doc died. In fact, he did not even hear about Doc's death until a couple of years later. By most accounts, Wyatt never visited Doc and he never wrote a book about his friend, Doc Holliday. Current research suggests Doc spent time in a sanitarium but may have left and likely died in a hotel room.<br /><br />Josephine Sarah "Sadie" Marcus Earp was not called Josie. She was in fact called Sadie. Her parents were not wealthy and Wyatt was forced to work in various jobs well into his old age. The infamous photo of her was also of an entirely different woman.<br /><br />Marshall Fred White was not an old man as depicted in Tombstone. Born in 1849, killed in 1880, he would have been a mere 31 years old. Younger than Wyatt who was born circa 1848<br /><br />It has been argued that Doc Holliday was in fact a better friend with Morgan and Virgil than with Wyatt. Yet Doc is always associated with Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The Cowboys never shot into the Earp's house, or at the Earp women.<br />(Apparently there was SOME honor among thieves)<br /><br />Sherm McMasters was not killed during Earp's Vendetta ride. No body was dragged as a message or challenge to Doc or any member of Earp's posse. In fact, no member of Earp's group died during the course of the Vendetta.<br /><br />Billy Claiborne was not shot by Wyatt Earp during the Earp Vendetta Ride. He was killed by "Buckskin" Frank Leslie after returning to Tombstone in 1882.<br /><br />Morgan Earp did not die lying on the pool table, but in a cardroom adjoining the billiard parlor<br /><br />All this having been said, I enjoyed the movie. I managed to get quite lost in the portrayals of the various old west characters.<br /><br />I see why people enjoy this movie and I DO recommend it... but with a huge grain of salt!</p></body></html>

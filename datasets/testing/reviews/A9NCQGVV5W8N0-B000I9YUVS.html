I'm still trying to work out why anyone would a) want to remake John Carpenter's 1980 classic and b) more importantly, why they wouldn't try and rework the premise a bit more - ala the excellent 'Dawn Of The Dead' remake, which, in my humble and probably blasphemous opinion, actually surpasses the original. As it stands, what you get are the standard nods to modern tokenism (everyone is young and beautiful, the soundtrack is full of contemporary modern music and there is much more of an accent on CGI) and some decent camerawork. Some fairly decent production values ensure that it's not a terrible film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's just not a particularly interesting one either. Its also not remotely scary, which is a major failing in any modern horror film and what small atmosphere it does build up deflates like a limp balloon when the crew of the `Elizabeth Dane' make their definitive appearance and turn out to be less scary than the ghost pirates from those truly dreadful 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' movies or a villain from an episode of the original series of 'Scooby Doo'. That said, Selma Blair does appear in a rather fetching pair of panties and some of the fog effects are quite nice, but it's not a patch on Carpenter's spine-chilling, 'less is more' original.</p></body></html>

But, I very surprized to see that Rob Zombie did a very well job of remaking the film. Zombie even attempted to take it a step further with trying offer an explaination as what made Myers into the monster known as "the Shape". What even made the film more interesting, was that for the first time. Halloween fans got a chance to hear Myers actually speak. The acting was very good for this time. Especially, that boy who played the younger Myers. He did an excellent job.</p></body></html>

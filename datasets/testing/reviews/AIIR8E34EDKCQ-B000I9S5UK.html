I have not seen the original nor do I care to, it has not spoiled my movie watching experice, I have imagination and a brain, I can enjoy this withouth knocking it down.<br /><br />I loved the suspence that kept up through out the whole movie and the familiar characters I liked in previous movies, Hawke, Fishburne, Byrne, Bello to name a few, and how the loyalties between the good cops, bad cops and criminals kept changing through out the movie.<br /><br />It was fast paced, scarry at times, and you really couldnt guess who was getting killed off when, and they were not sparing the famous faces either.<br /><br />The plot was simple yet entertaining; bunch of people inside the precinct who were fending off good guys gone bad, and try to sit quiet when your own citys defenses are knocing you down.<br /><br />I really had a great afternoon watching this during my Christmas Day off, even my family loved it, and you're talking about a bunch of fussy people!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When everything's at work..."></head><body><p>Honestly, I was incredulous when Ray was getting all the attention it was getting.<br /><br />I was incredulous when Walk the Line was getting all the attention it was getting.<br /><br />And what do you know but that is but an arbitrary and minor parallel that ties these two brilliant works of art together.<br /><br />While some people might complain about a formula developing, such a complaint is slightly unfair.  Sure, the focus of the two movies are similar enough that the exposition of the storyline sometimes seems a bit familiar, something that in a time where originality is upheld as one of the highest virtues, might lead people in the wrong direction about regarding works such as these critically.<br /><br />So they both involve a death of a brother at a young age.  Uh, those deaths?  They actually happened.  So they both involve drug addiction.  Uh, that actually happened.  So they both involve adultery and special love interest.  Well, that actually happened.  And you say it's a shame how both deal so much with post-traumatic stress disorder?  Well... with the things they've gone through.<br /><br />But focusing on Walk the Line alone now, let us contemplate on what this movie so GOOD.<br /><br />For one thing, the acting comes readily to mind.  Acting is one of the most readily apparent and focused on parts of filmmaking for the reason that it's basically what makes or breaks the story.  The acting in this film?  Brilliant, and I'm not just saying that.  Joaquin phoenix's role isn't just unbelievable... it's really believable.  Reese Witherspoon pulls of June Carter and honestly it's difficult to imagine an actress like her actually pulling the strings like that.  Okay, so I'm biased because she's been in mainstream movies of little importance.  But that's the point: she does really well, completely redefining my image of her.<br /><br />And then they can both sing, which I find hilarious considering most vocalists of modern bands can't even seem to sing yet two actors can and can also sing exactly like the people they're portraying.  Ahhh, the state of modern music... but I digress.<br /><br />Secondly, the writing.  As discussed above, the story follows the same rough outline as Ray, but it is different in this way: Johnny Cash is a different character than Ray Charles.  Furthermore, the story they tell of Johnny Cash's life is very good, very touching, and very well presented.  It made the music itself seem that much more powerful.<br /><br />Oh, and the music.  I'm no fan of country music, and I haven't had much exposure to Johnny Cash besides listening to the live prison album alluded to in the movie, but this is some very strong stuff.  It's easy to imagine that miming and overrecording would have been used, but the mere fact that it wasn't just adds one of those indefatigable aspects of what makes this movie work so well.<br /><br />Then of course there's the directing and the cinematography.  Specifically, if anyone's doubting the impactfulness of the work behind the camera, I argue to rewatch that long shot where Cash tears apart the bathroom.  Watch how everything possible seems to be at full work here, movement, zoom, acting, makeup, set design, music, atmosphere, lighting, all targeted in such a way that it does not feel reasonable to assume that such a take could ever be done again, even if all the same mechanics were at work.<br /><br />Okay, so I've basically just hyped it up a whole lot more, adding to that same hype that has people tired and sick of the whole idea of the movie before they've seen it.  Admit it, the mere fact that it's been nominated for some Oscars means that it already feels overrated.  I know exactly what you mean...<br /><br />...afterall, what made me wait to see it so long?<br /><br />But whatever.  Think what you want.  I think this film is pretty darned great.  I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></body></html>

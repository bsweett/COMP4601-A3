Other travelers arrive at the terminal, including the crew. The passengers are inspected for hidden weapons, none are found. The passengers board the flight to San Francisco. An air traffic controller notices a problem with Flight 11 out of Boston. [Delays cost $2,000 a minute.] The radar suddenly loses track of Flight 11 when it is near Manhattan. The see smoke coming out of the North Tower (about 8:45 AM). "I've got a bad feeling about this." United 175 dropped its transponder. Where is it? It crashes into the South Tower~ Flights are halted in Boston, New York, and Washington. Langley is warned about Flight 11 nearing Washington. When will they engage? The President has to make the call.<br /><br />On board Flight 93 one of the terrorists makes a bomb in the rest room. They start stabbing the passengers and enter the cockpit to remove the pilots. Air Traffic Controller hear the disturbance and note the change in direction. They have to get the plane before it gets withing 50 or 60 miles from Washington! "Our time has come" says the terrorist who is flying the plane. "Where are those fighter jets?" The flight attendants try to calm the passengers. "The Vice-President can make the call." The news tells of the attack on the Pentagon. All planes are ordered to land, foreign flights are turned back. Some of the passengers decide to fight back since they have nothing to lose. Where can they get weapons? Others make calls on the air phones. Can they come up with a plan?<br /><br />The passengers attack the hijackers, one goes down. They push a cart against the other terrorist and he goes down. Next the cart is used as a battering ram against the cockpit door so they can attack the last two terrorists. No one can control the airplane so the flight makes an unscheduled landing. It was the only aircraft that failed to reach its target; this saved the Capitol or the White House from attack and destruction. By the time the President authorized shooting down hijacked aircraft it was all over. US airspace was closed, no civilian airliner was in the skies.<br /><br />This film explains why there should be a memorial to the heroic passengers on Flight 93 - in Washington DC. The credits name the real people and the actors who portrayed them. Some actors were the real people who were involved. Could this hijacking have occurred in earlier times when the pilot was required to be armed and many passengers would also be armed? Should the US government have been more diligent? I wonder how they were able to reconstruct the events in the plane when no one survived? [More people were killed in 1993 Waco by US government actions than by terrorists on Flight 93; was that avoidable?]</p></body></html>

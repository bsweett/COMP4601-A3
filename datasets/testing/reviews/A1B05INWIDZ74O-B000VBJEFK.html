<meta name="summary" content="A Film for the Whole Family"></head><body><p>Pixar and Disney have made a film that is truly visually appealing. In this movie we follow Remy the rat who has a unique nose for food. It is so sensitive that he can even detect when the food contains rat poison. His sense of smell leads him to a world of flavors and a love of great food. Though his family looks at any scraps as just energy to fuel the body, Remy has other ideas. So ignoring his father's advice he sets out to fulfill his dream of experiencing great food. Once he finds out he is actually living below Paris, he decides he must become a chef and fulfill his greater desire of creating great food. And it just so happens that he is living beneath the restaurant of his culinary hero, Augusted Gusteau. Remy quickly forms a bond with the garbage boy, Linguini. This leads to an adventure that has a story line that is worth watching. Like an old Disney movie we have a real storyline where we follow our little hero as he learns about what is important in life; family, friendship and striving to be the best you can at what ever you try. You also actually learn what it is like to work in a kitchen of a restaurant and the role that food critics play. This is a movie for those of all ages.</p></body></html>

For those of you old enough to remember, I too was one of those lunatics who stood on line in the freezing cold to see this great film. Crazier still is the fact that I thought it was worth the wait at the time!<br /><br />This great DVD includes some really frightening footage that was not included in the theatrical version of the movie.  In addition, the entire film has been digitally restored at 1.85 and plays beautifully on a new HDTV system, filling the entire screen. Watching this film on a new large screen HDTV  is just like a night out at the movies.</p></body></html>

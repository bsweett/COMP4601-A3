<meta name="summary" content="the ultimate Hitchcock classic"></head><body><p>The ultimate Hitchcock classic, REAR WINDOW gives us a glimpse into the mind of Alfred Hitchcock, and in turn Hitchcock turns the mirror on us and forces us to admit our darkest desire...to be voyeurs.<p>That is exactly what Jeffries is.  Jeffries (James Stewart) is a wheelchair-bound photographer who spends his time cooped up in his apartment, peeping in on the neighbours across the courtyard.  He comes up with &quot;names&quot; for them; Miss Torso the ballerina; Miss Lonely-Hearts; The Newly-Weds and so on.  His only contact with the outside world is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and his wisecracking nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).<p>Unknowlingly witnessing the murder of Mrs Thorwald, he, along with Lisa and Stella, set out to expose the truth about Mr Thorwald (Raymond Burr) and uncover the mystery of her quick disapperance.<p>A beautifully-restored print by James Katz and Robert Harris (also responsible for the beautiful new renderings of MY FAIR LADY and VERTIGO), is the highlight of this DVD.  The original negative was severely faded and turning green when Universal aqquired the entire Paramount film library.  Color-correction and shadow detail are now back to their original state, as is the soundtrack featuring Franz Waxman's sparkling score.<p>The ULTIMATE Hitchcock thriller, with more than a touch of romance and comedy.</p></body></html>

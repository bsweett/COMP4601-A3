This is one of those pictures that only improves after each viewing.  James Stewart and Kim Novack are  stellar in this true masterpiece of filmdom.  Bernard Herrmann's score  complements the movie immensely and is an integral part of the story.  Only  Alfred Hitchcock, a man who epitomizes the movie-making art could have made  this film.  No one can touch the master, Sir Alfred, and the film is  evidence of that very fact.  To show genius at work, the viewer needs to  check out the backgrounds or the beautifully photographed scenes of San  Francisco and surrounding areas; they are as meticulously done as any of  the works of such painters as Degas or da Vinci.  Hitchcock may not have  invented the motion picture camera, but he certainly understood it!  It's  too bad that the rating only limits me to five stars.  THIS ONE RATES A  10!</p></body></html>

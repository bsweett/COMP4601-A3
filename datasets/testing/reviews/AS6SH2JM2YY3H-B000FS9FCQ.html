Wow.<br /><br />From the movie's web site, I found out that many of V's ( the main character) lines are not "original," but come from quotes of other, real,  famous (and infamous) leaders.<br /><br />The action starts quickly, but the story builds slowly. To the end, you are still waiting for answers.  Thank goodness the director and writers leave some unanswered... this is a powerful technique.<br /><br />There's even more.  Media manipulation by government.  The People's revolt.  The importance of youth in shaping the future.  Experiments on people.  Why good cops are essential in society.  There is a segment dealing with homosexuality and a horrible, draconian government approach to it (Nazi Germany is the obvious reference here).  It will be interesting to see how critics relate this part of the film to the "controversy" over Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />I tell you, this is a heck of a film.  And did I mention the action?  Oh, and the hints about the Matrix connection.  This was NOT a "Matrix clone" at all.<br /><br />Should have been rated PG-13 instead of R.</p></body></html>

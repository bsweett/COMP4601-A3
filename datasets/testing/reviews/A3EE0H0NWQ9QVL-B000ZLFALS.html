Not entirely detached from the everyday person presented in films like 'Forrest Gump,' the film manages to mix the mundane with an extraordinary inner voyage.  Love and music have provided people transcendence for centuries.  What makes 'Across the Universe' distinctive is its ability to contrast typical lives as they are transformed, especially here by the Beatles.<br /><br />A song can paint a thousand pictures.  "Hey Jude" is Paul McCartney's lyrical masterpiece about seeking consolation during painful transitions in life.  It may be about Jane Asher or Julian Lennon to him, but the way it's created makes it a lyrical goldmine for everyone.  That's why any film that manages to venture into a voyage using The Beatles' music could easily become a disaster.  (Even the Beatles' own `Magical Mystery Tour' has been rendered flawed at best.)  After seeing this movie, I wondered why no one thought of it earlier.  Much of this vision couldn't have been conceived without digital enhancement, but even then, no outing bereft of imagination can be launched at all.<br /><br />To me 'Across the Universe' succeeds where an admirable attempt of, say 'Tommy', fails.  First of all, fluidity is present.  It is a musical first and foremost, and the "ordinary people" who sing give us admirable, heartfelt performances, making their transformation tangible and audible.  The choreography and computer graphics put on a real show--only occasionally veering close to being stiff or maudlin.  It is also well-rounded, bringing the Peace Movement (with all its attendant flaws), the Black Movement, and the Generation Gap in ways that preserve the music's integrity and universality.  There's a story molded by the music, not the other way around.  Some of the songs selected were huge hits; others were obscure masterpieces.  It seldom feels forced.<br /><br />There's also the risk of becoming clich&eacute;d.  All of the characters in the movie have Beatle names delivered in a natural way.  There's the protagonist, Jude (Jim Sturgess); his love interest, Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood); a sexy, siren landlady, Sadie (Dina Fuchs); her lover and bandmate, JoJo (Martin Luther McCoy) and Prudence (T.V. Carpio), a lesbian companion who catches up to them.  We meet all sorts of characters along the way, including the Psychedelic companions Dr. Robert (Bono) and Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard).<br /><br />My first objection to the film was seeing the bleak landscapes.  Jude is from Liverpool, and all of the friends end up together in New York (significantly John Lennon's major digs)  where the landscape is quite bleak.  There are factories belching out pollution, boxy city dwellings with dreary views, and a dingy laundromat and a bowling ally.  But this is really the point.  Whenever people break out into song, they are brimming with falling in love, expressing outrage at injustice, and reeling with the joys of music and alternative consciousness.  Although some of the nightmares of drug use aren't presented with the dreams, the flow of these dreamscapes is stunning.  In contrast the horrors of reality are presented:  of separation, of war, of death, of addiction.  Each shows the universal need for escape and some solace.  What keeps people humming in life more than a landscape of Beatles' music?<br /><br />There may be objections that the movie never really ends.  It is, in a way, a never-ending story.  But the film does end properly enough with a focal point, one that needs little explanation or apology.  'Across the Universe' may not be everyone's vision, but it is a wonderful vision extremely well done.</p></body></html>

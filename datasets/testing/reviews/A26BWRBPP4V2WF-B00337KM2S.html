<meta name="summary" content="A window of insight into the modern human condition - but a charming and funny one"></head><body><p>Jason Reitman, like his famous father, is able to take even the most preposterous setup and turn it into an entertaining film with a keen eye for the human condition.  Ryan (George Clooney's character) flies about the country working for a firm that fires people.  This is somewhat of a gimmick - Reitman even filmed actual employees who had been downsized, asking them to re-enact their behavior when they were fired (or even to act as they "in hindsight wished they would have acted"), and there are some genuinely noble and passionate observations to be made in these scenes.  In a lesser movie, Ryan would merely serve as the witness to their tragedies.  Instead, we are invited into the world of transients that Ryan inhabits - one of airports, 2-hour friendships with the guy sitting next to you on the flight - and Ryan's sharp observations on the fundamental isolation of human beings give us the first layer of the film.<br /><br />The second layer is provided by the three women in Ryan's life - the woman next door with whom he has a "neighbours with privileges" arrangement, a fellow frequent flyer with whom he has "frequent flyer privileges," and a young new co-worker who is trying to make his job obsolete.  I'm sure the first woman would not even be mentioned in most reviews, but her part, albeit small, is critical to the plot.  When Ryan comes home (to a souless apartment he sleeps in only 50 days of the year) his neighbour pops by for a chat.  It's clear that they have been sexual partners, but Ryan immediately back off when she tells him she's "seeing somebody now."  This is what establishes our sympathy for Ryan - he is essentially moral, unlike the sleazy bosses he is surrogate for.<br /><br />That leaves the other two women free to serve as Ryan's antagonists.  Alex is a fellow frequent-flyer and business woman with whom he has an explicit agreement to meet up with for sex whenever their travel schedules overlap.  She states at the outset that she is just as independent and shackle-free as Ryan, but implies otherwise in numerous conversations that follow.  The unfortunately named Natalie Keener is the keen new co-worker aiming to revolutionize the business by eliminating the need to travel and enabling her and Ryan's company to save millions in airfare.  That this would destroy Ryan's way of life immediately sets him against her, but he smartly frames it as a professional discussion about how badly the company would fare if they became just another cheap hatchet-job operation.  Natalie sets off with Ryan to see "how the job is done," and the three of them (Ryan, Natalie, and Alex) form a kind of triumvirate trolling the airport hotels.  Their conversations on life, love, and commitment form the actual heart of the movie - Ryan cynically independent, Natalie the the traditional romantic (talking and texting her boyfriend every night, having rejected offers from the most prestigious law firms in the big city to follow him to his new job in Kansas), and Alex occupying the middle ground as a sort of mediator.<br /><br />We are now at the 2/3 mark of the film and all is well.  Unfortunately, either from studio pressure or through some sort of internal need for closure, Reitman allows the film to drift off into a more standard cookie-cutter resolution.  I'm okay with the fact that Natalie is given a closed story-arc because her character is designed for that purpose.  I'm okay that Ryan shows her up in a great scene of redemption where he notices something about the man he's firing that allows him to give the fired man hope and promise for a more satisfying life.  Again, I can forgive this scene as it is so well acted and contains such humanity (and because the fired man is played by Reitman's good-luck charm J.K. Simmons).  What I can't forgive is the whole-hearted and sudden transformation of Ryan from lone wolf to den-mother and the resolution of his relationship with Alex.  It's not so much the resolution itself, but the fact that the relationship was resolved that left me unsatisfied.  It's almost like it came from a different, more conventional movie, and it discolours all the events preceding it in such a way that it even spoils the film's re-watchability.  I wish Reitman would have taken a note from Sophia Coppola's playbook - we don't hear what Bill Murray's character says at the end of "Lost in Translation" because it would ruin the rest of the film (no matter what was actually said).<br /><br />So we're left with a film that is excellent for about 3/4 of the time.  The good news is that most films are never good, and I'm thankful for those 3/4.  So I rate this film a 4/5 mainly because it let me down at the end with what I consider to be an artificial resolution.  For those buying the DVD, the director's commentary is actually fairly entertaining, and shows Reitman to be a thoughtful and interesting filmaker, and I look forward to his next project.</p></body></html>

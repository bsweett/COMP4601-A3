<meta name="summary" content="An abysmal transfer of an excellent movie"></head><body><p>The movie itself is a 5-star movie but I can only give this release three stars because of the simply horrid transfer afforded it. Until Amazon comes up with a different rating system that allows us to grade the technical quality of the product (transfer etc) and the product itself (the movie) I have to give it a lower score than the movie deserves.<br />The movie features Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man falsely accused of the murder of his wife. Escaping from captivity a manhunt is launched for Kimble, led by U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard (played in an Oscar winning performamce by Tommy Lee Jones). The ensuing action details Kimble's attempts to clear his name, all the while trying to evade his pursuers. Director Andrew Davis crafts a taught and exciting movie and delivers what is one of the best movies of the 1990s. But for all the movie does right Warner have seen fit to deliver it to Blu-ray in a transfer that is at times painful to watch with a soft and undefined image that contains large amounts of grain and is overall dull with a lack of detail. The Blu-ray fares somewhat better in the audio department however with a very active, if average by todays standards, track. Where Warner does deserve high marks is inclusion of all of the special features from the Special Edition DVD including a feature-length commentary track with Davis and Tommy Lee Jones that contains a lot of good information despite some long pauses. There os also a smattering of featurettes.<br />Overall a disappointing presentation of an exceptional movie. Here is hoping that Warner revisits this title soon</p></body></html>

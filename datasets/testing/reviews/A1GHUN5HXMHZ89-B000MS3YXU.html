Night Shyamalan. Even this movie has a movie critic who belches the line that there are no new stories. Personally I think that anyone that feels that way should be boiled in his Christmas pudding and have a stake of Holly put through his heart as Scrooge would say. Let's suppose for a moment that people have brains they use for new ideas and stories. Further let us imagine that imagination exist and if we are fortunate enough to have it we can see that "Lady in the Water" has merit. Perhaps I'm a fan of Shyamalan and a sentimentalist. But whatever I am I think I know a good story when I see one. He took a story he told his children for years and made it into a movie. Parts of it seem familiar and made me want to do research on stories. But although that would be fascinating work, I don't want to take away from what he has done.<br /><br />What he has done is take an apartment maintenance man that has lost his will to be a physical doctor and made him a sort of mental doctor. One that fixes things for peoples temporary homes and comforts them in a way that touches them more deeply. Enter a water nymph swimming in the pool and other odd occurences. From the beginning he is a believer in imagination and faith. He does not hold much doubt in the possibilty of things outside our tidy little logistics that must define everything infinitesimally. Fortunately he is among people that have that same need to believe in something other than all the violence and laws of man. They all feel they have a purpose, it just may not be obvious at first. If you enjoyed Shyamalan's previous works like "The Village" you will probably enjoy this movie. If you'd rather watch movies like "Black Christmas" or some dark drama or reality show it may not appeal to you. This is mostly a movie of imagination, hope, and faith. I personally found it very satisfying and plan to get the DVD.</p></body></html>

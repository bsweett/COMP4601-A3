<meta name="summary" content="what was Nicholas thinking?!?"></head><body><p>*The Wicker Man* was a major disappointment.  I thought it was going to be something like *Stirs of Echoes* or *The Skeleton Key*.  Something supernatural-ish.  Nah, it was far from it.<br /><br />Officer Malus (Cage) is on leave after surviving from a fiery accident and failing to rescue the victims.  Malus receives a letter from his ex-fiance, Willow, requesting his help to locate her missing daughter, Rowan.<br /><br />So, Malus goes to Summers Isle, which is some isolated island in the Puget Sound.  The people there are different.  Different is an understatement.  You would rather hang out with the Amish than with these people.  It seems like an Amish version of the Amazon women and Themyscira (Wonder Woman).  The women run the island.  The men seem to have been "Stepforded".<br /><br />Anyways, Malus is investigating the disappearance of Rowan.  People claim to not know Rowan or that she has perished.  Willow isn't much help either.  She eventually tells him that Rowan is his daughter.  This news spurs Malus to find Rowan immediately.<br /><br />When he does find Rowan, things become confusing for Malus.  It is revealed that he is the wicker man.  The problem is that the movie doesn't explain the meaning or purpose of the wicker man.  The lack of explanation has deemed the entire movie pointless.<br /><br />You're better off watching *2001 Maniacs* for an entertaining yet chessy  version of the story plot.  *The Wicker Man* was slow and unappealing.  I was definitely surprised that Nicholas Cage chose to be a part of this film.<br /><br />Anyways, you're not missing anything if you don't ever watch this film.</p></body></html>

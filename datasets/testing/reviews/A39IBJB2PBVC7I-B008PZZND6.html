Ironically, there should be no surprise whatever that male-dominated societal enclaves like the military, the clergy, and the State Department are rife with homosexuality, no matter how secretive or repressed.  But this is not even the point of Brokeback Mountain, which is not a "gay cowboy movie" any more than Jaws is a fishing movie.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is a love story, specifically a story of forbidden love, and the horrifying emotional toll such a situation takes.  As with Legends Of The Fall, the real hero is Wyoming, Ang Lee has given us a loving, idyllic vision of the American West that seems to glow with purity and splendor.  (Let's protect it!)  Texas does not get off quite so easily, few people know better than writer Larry McMurty how god-awful flat, dry, and just plain miserable it is.  As to Annie Proulx, (just can't bear to add that affected E. in front of her name), whose story provided the foundation for the film, what can one say except that - wherever you find humanity's saddest qualities, darkest despair, and most senselessly cruel and violent tendencies, there you will find Ms. Proulx!  That's the spirit, Annie!<br /><br />Ledger's performance is haunting; his hurt seems to rise off him like steam.  Gyllenhaal, a terrific actor with a name that's hard to spell, is also outstanding, although his western twang does seem suspect at times.  Great supporting work by the wives.  Michelle Williams, as Alma Del Mar, is every bit as injured and silent as her husband, trapped and very sympathetic.  Anne Hathaway, as the Texas heavy equipment Princess, is perfection; there is a toughness to her that's very believable.<br /><br />The hype surrounding Brokeback Mountain was unfortunate, but inevitable.  Viewers who are able to put their homophobia in park for a couple of hours will discover a masterfully crafted film about two individual human beings attempting to find love in a world exquisitely designed to deny them access to it.  No matter what part of town you're from, that's always a heartbreaker.</p></body></html>

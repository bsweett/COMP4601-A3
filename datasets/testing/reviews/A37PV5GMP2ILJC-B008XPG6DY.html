<meta name="summary" content="Picture yourself on a train in a station"></head><body><p>Maybe this sort of situation was what the Beatles had in mind when they wrote "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"<br /><br />Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is a married man who works in advertising.  His wife is a teacher, and their daughter requires very expensive medical care and lots of parental attention.  The stresses of life are beginning to take a toll on them all, and our story begins when Charles misses his regular train, and finds himself without a ticket and with an empty wallet.<br /><br />"Picture yourself on a train in a station,<br />With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,<br />Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,<br />The girl with kaleidoscope eyes."<br /><br />Aforementioned girl turns out to be named Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston), and when she offers to pay his fare, he feels obligated to return the favor.  Something clicks between the two, and before you know it, they're showing off pictures of their kids and agreeing to meet again.  A couple of meetings later it progresses to a surreptitious assignation (that's my two big words for this review) at a seedy hotel, and all seems to be smooth sailing.<br /><br />"Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,<br />Waiting to take you away.<br />Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,<br />And you're gone"<br /><br />Unfortunately, and just a bit too soon, they learn the hard way that seedy hotel door locks can't be trusted, and from here on in, Charles finds himself in deep you-know-what, as an intruder calculatedly takes him for everything he's got.  Lucinda begs him not to involve the police, even though she got the worst of the attack, so Charles tries to tackle the problem himself, with a little help from a friend.<br /><br />Other verses of the song hint at the predictable twist, so I won't go into those, but suffice to say, the improbable and implausible ending totally derails an otherwise entertaining movie.<br /><br />I'd say this one is a definite rental, especially if you're a fan of Owen or Aniston.  Rated: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 19, 2007</p></body></html>

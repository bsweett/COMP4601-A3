Its not really a thriller, its not really a horror film and it comes off at times as a confused mess.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson a comfortable suburban woman who at first glance appears to have everything. She lives in a great house, has at first blush a loving husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and two young daughters. One day she gets a knock on the door from the sheriff's department telling her that Jim has been killed in an accident and her seemingly normal life begins to unravel. The next morning she wakes up to find her husband alive and well. Is this a premonition that she has had or is she losing her mind?<br /><br />Bullock takes on the role quite well but the non linear storytelling gets in the way of the audiences' enjoyment of the film. Days and events happen at random and the end result is more headache inducing than thrilling. Also, there is a tacked on quasi religious theme that is really not necessary to the story. The interesting question is  posed that if one know about future events does one have the power to change them? Sadly, this story line is not well developed.<br /><br />I saw the regular definition widescreen disc. The transfer is quite good and the audio in 5.1 sound is clear and has no noticible problems. The score by Klaus Badelt is eerie and effective as is the cinematography by<br />Torsten Lippstock.<br /><br />The disc comes with an array of extras including a commentary by Yapo and Bullock, deleted scenes with optional commentary, a gag real, a making of featurette, a completely unnecessary feature that tells the story in normal linear order and a double featurette on people who experience real life premonitions. A word on the commentary: it starts quite dry but picks up as the movie goes along.<br /><br />This is not a bad package for a rental but it is far from one of the best movie of the year. With a lot of work it could have been so much better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best DVD I Have Ever Seen"></head><body><p>Whatever you think of the movie (and I loved it!) this DVD is the best I have seen (and I have about 100). It is packed to the brim with extras, including the best type of commentary by director and designer, and mini features on the making of the movie, special effects, and even web-page equivalents (although viewable through your DVD player and not requiring a computer) on Egyptology and Egyptian artefacts. I would recommend any electronics shop hoping to sell some DVD players invests in a copy of The Mummy because it shows how good the format can be when used to its full potential. Turning to the film, this was a loving re-creation of the 1930s Universal horror movie, yet updated to 1990s standards. In Arnold Vosloo the film has an effective monster, and comparisons with Karloff are unfair. Rachel Weisz is the sort of beautiful actress that appeals to both men and women for different reasons, and funnily enough, George Of The Jungle star Brendan Fraser shows that that film was just an embarrassing hiccup and that he does have talent after all. And of course, the girls love him! The beauty of the desert long shots is matched by the attention to detail in the CGI effects, which shows how effects can enhance a film without making it seem (Terminator II?) like a lot of effects strung together in a loose plot. The fighting skeletons are reminiscent of the best Ray Harryhausen stop-motion work, and it would be good to see more of them in the sequel! There's a lovely scene at the beginning of the movie where a whole room full of bookshelves is 'domino-toppled'. This seems predictable but this sort of corniness is excusable in that it introduces the characters and gives us a contrast with the later action. A lovely film made by a dedicated director and a talented cast, and probably the best DVD made to date.</p></body></html>

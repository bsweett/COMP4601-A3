<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining but McConaughy is not Dirk Pitt"></head><body><p>I would have enjoyed this movie a whole lot more if it wasn't based on Clive Crussler's book of the same title. Being a big fan of Crussler, I have to say that Matthew McConaughy doesn't fit the profile of Dirk Pitt, not even close. Having said that, I can't say this casting chocie was a mismatch since McConaughy actually does a pretty decent job here. Simply put, he's not Dirk Pitt of the Clive Crussler novels but Dirk Pitt created by Hollywood.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining and fast pace action film. Most people would called this a great "popcorn flick". The plot is far-fetched as humanly possible so there really nothing on film to take seriously. William H. Macy plays Admiral Sandecker, a surprised but pleasant choice and he does a good job playing a "boss" figure for once. Steve Zahn provides the comic relief and poor Penelope Cruz was totally miscast in her role. Its also embarassing that her limitation as an actress was totally revealed in a "popcorn flick" of all things. But she was nice to look at and in a movie like this, that is what most people really care about. (That may sound bit chauvinist but its the sad Hollywood truth. After all, they could have easily hire Emma Thompson instead but for obvious reason, they did not.)<br /><br />Overall, a fun movie and if it wasn't based on Clive Crussler's novel and characters, it would have received an another star. (I wonder what Mr. Crussler think about this movie??)</p></body></html>

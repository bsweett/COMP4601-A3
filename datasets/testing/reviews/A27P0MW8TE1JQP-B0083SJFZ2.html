<meta name="summary" content="What the ZEUS?!"></head><body><p>The 1981 Clash of the Titans was/still is a campy yet visually stunning fantasy classic. Campy? You ask? How could it not be, the Myths and archetypes by very definition are larger than life, so it stands to reason that the remake is going to have some camp to it, as well. And it does, but it doesn't disappoint as a popcorn picture, there the remake, like the original delivers. The original has the lovely Harry Hamlin, seriously,  Perseus is prettier than Princess of Argos  Andromeda. In the remake, up-and-comer Sam Worthington (Terminator 4, Avator) plays Perseus and has even less to do with the Princess than in the original, but he sure ain't no pretty-boy, and the new Andromeda is pretty, but Perseus is matched with the cursed and hauntingly attractive IO, this time round. Worthington's Perseus is even more of a reluctant hero than Hamlin, playing the everyman, a fisherman who has his great destiny thrust upon him. We get  more of a glimse of his back story this time, including the flashback to Zeus' seduction of Perseus' mother and another origin for Calibos tied to the bastard demi-god's birth (instead of the cursed son of goddess Thetis. Not from any real Greek myth, It has been said that Calibos was based on Caliban from "The Tempest" by William Shakespeare.)<br /><br /> The story is pretty similar to both the original and the myth; Perseus' re-gifted winged sandals still don't make it to the film's finale. The Mortals feeling as if they have been abandoned declare war on the gods,  Hades  leads the retaliation upon mankind in an attempt to seize power and usurp his brother Zeus. Perseus' adopted family is killed as Perseus swears vengeance Lord of the Underworld. Prideful Queen Cassiopeia again compares her daughter's beauty to that of the gods, to make amends Andromeda must be sacrificed or the whole city will be lost. Son of Zeus Perseus ends up on a quest to save Argos (and the lovely Andromeda ) from the punishment of the Kraken, collecting gifts and companions along the way, like some sword & sandals Magnificent Seven. Unlike the original, this film better captures the sense of scale between the gods and their strife with their less loyal subjects. It feels less like the Argons are the sole mortal effected. The bar for the gods is naturally raised, impressive transmutations and grand entrances and appearances, an homage to the clay figures of the original, only vaster.<br /><br />Although there are no Knights or Dames, the casting for the 2010 film is as impressively close to overkill as the original with egos such as Liam Neeson as Zeus (Olivier in '81), Ralph Fiennes a.k.a. Lord Voldemort is a perfect fit for Hades (omitted from the original). As I said Worthington replaces Harry Hamlin as Perseus, the lovely French actress Alexa Davalo as Andromeda (for Judi Bowker), Gemma Arterto( soon to be seen in Prince of Persia) plays  Io, who befriends Perseus in a much sexier way that Bergus Meridth's character. Luke Evans has a couple lines as the "prettier than Harry Hamlin"other son of Zeus, APOLLO ( ironicly enough Evans will BE playing Zeus in 2011's Dawn of War). A number of models are cast, well, to look pretty;  for example Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova gets her turn as a much lovelier more sympatric Medusa than you would expect, and English beauty Agyness Deyn stands as little more than Olympus window-dressing as Aphrodite. Speaking of pretty, the movie was filmed mostly on location in the Canary Islands, and cinematography makes full use of the lush Greekish scenery .<br /><br />The Great Ray Harryhausen (Jason & the Argonauts), stop-motion genius behind all of the mythological critters of the '81 original initially questioned the need for a remake...but approved of the effects of this one. The homage to his brilliant serpent-bodied Medusa is apparent, as is the return of the the giant scorpions, the Pegasus, Calibos and not to mention the over-the-top sea-monstery goodness of the Kraken for the climax. Speaking of homages, Bebo cameo at the half-hour mark. One new addition the Djinn, desert  mages who extend their immortally by replace their flesh with  "charwood and black magic," appearing  as nightmarish treelike Middle-Earth figures  with glowing blue eyes and wicked teeth. The visuals are pleasing, but the movie was retrofitted with the 3-D effect, so it has it's moments, but isn't super, but the directing style of Louis Leterrier (Hulk) lends itself to the techniques used for the process.<br /><br />Best not to think of this as a re-make, but a Spring Break distraction, for which it serves it's purpose...<br />I expect the Kraken will soon topple the Dragons & their trainers from the box office weeklys.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the original!"></head><body><p>This is the way a sequel should be made!  You build on the original and take it to the next level.  Everything here is great, with cameos from several X-Men and surprises throughout the film.  My only gripe is the fact that Gambit wasn't in this anywhere!  Colossus had only about a 5-second part where he was metal, although he did manage a good few minutes as human. Please bring him back in the next film with a bigger part - and bring Gambit in there too PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! All in all, this is an incredible movie, and it sets itself up perfectly for the final film in the trilogy (the actors are signed for 3 films, and it's doubtful you could get all of them back for any more so enjoy this cast while it lasts). Nightcrawler's part in the film is amazing, and they truly bring him to life as you'd imagine him from the comic books. The teleporting effect is awesome, and the opening minutes of the film will leave you breathless! It totally changed my opinion of Nightcrawler from the comics because I'd always seen him as one of the weaker characters...now I see that he has the potential to be one of the deadliest! Wolverine gets a ton of screen time, and it's nice to see Iceman use his powers (but let's see him turn to ice in the next film like he does in the comics). This movie stays incredibly close to the comics as far as characterization goes, so true fans should be pleased.  Cyclops doesn't get much screen time at all (but being such a stick-in-the-mud character, who really misses him?), but he's obviously going to play a major role in the next one. Hopefully, the final film will have a few key things to make it perfect: Nightcrawler in a cool uniform rather than the circus clothes he wore throughout this one, Iceman TRULY becoming his namesake (the special effects are there, so don't say it can't be done), Gambit (complete with staff, cards, and overcoat), more screen time for Colossus and Kitty Pryde (she's been in both movies so far for a few seconds, so go ahead and give her some serious screen time), and finally, the return of ALL the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (including their new recruit from this film). Get ready for number three to blow you away if this one is any indication of it. This one blows the first one out of the water, so plan on watching it again and again!  Get out there and see it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excuse to exploit sex and torture"></head><body><p>This is advertised as a suspense and horror film. It is neither. The movie is extremely offensive. I have never seen more gratuitous nudity and gore in a single film. There is no suspense in this film. It seems made for people who would like to watch other human being be tortured alive. The biggest problem of all is that you can actually partake in these activities in the 21st century in Thailand. And I am sure in many other countries where mammon rules.<br /><br />The basic plot of the movie consists of two male students touring Europe for a break before they finish up grade school. They seem to be moving around on their Euro Rail Pass, hunting girls for sexual conquest at ever lay over. Eventually they meet this guy who shows them they will be assured a sure thing in Slovakia. So they head there with girls on their minds. Instead they are the ones who are hunted, caught and then horribly tortured. Where the director makes sure you see every bloody detail.<br /><br />Two things surprise me about this movie. One is that it was even produced. The second is how any one can give this a decent review. I would recommend that you watch any other movie instead of this one. Do not support torture as a form of entertainment.</p></body></html>

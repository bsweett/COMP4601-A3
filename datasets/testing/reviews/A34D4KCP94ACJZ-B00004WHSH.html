<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Final Film is Worth a Look on Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>Not to suggest that you can expect to see Kubrick's last film in a stunning new light on Blu-Ray, and although like any Blu-Ray it is certainly beautiful, by comparison to some other Blu-Rays, it is not an exceptional transfer.  I've had a Hitachi 1080i plasma on my wall for about a year now and I finally got a Playstation 3 so I can buy and enjoy Blu-Rays.  Unlike the switch from video to DVD, the upgrade to Blu-Ray doesn't necessarily mean I will have to start my movie collection all over again as I can play all of my DVDs as well, but I was prompted to buy Eyes Wide Shut (a DVD I do own) when I realized it was the unrated version only previously available in Europe.  I thought that might mean it would be closer to what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but the additional footage is really just some extra sexual content.  I should clarify that it isn't really extra footage at all, it's just that a bunch of robed figures blocking our view from some naughty behavior in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQD">American release</a> were actually removed in this version so you can see the naughty behavior.  I didn't even realize the figures were there and now I have to get my arms around the reasons why they were included to begin with.  I don't know, perhaps if Mike Huckabee becomes president those mysterious robed figures will make a dramatic comeback.  That might verify my suspicions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'm not convinced this is what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but contemplating what he did intend is fascinating to me.  I actually consider Kubrick among my favorite directors, so this fascination is probably not as applicable to non-fans. Of his films, Eyes Wide Shut is, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SQ">Barry Lyndon</a>, his least appreciated and most criticized, although not by me.  Eyes Wide Shut is actually one of my favorite Kubrick films.  Even though it is not as cohesive as his others; it is, on the surface at least, among his most stylized.  The interactions characters have are slow and deliberate and it gives the meaning behind each word and each frame more clarification.  Many call this quality dreamlike and it is.  Expressing reality doesn't seem to be a priority in Eyes Wide Shut and I wonder if the film was ever meant to be reality in the first place. Although the film is dreamlike per se, there is nothing at all to indicate that any of it was a dream.  In fact, the presence of the cult mask on Alice and Bill's bed verifies the exact opposite.  Still, I for one believe the style is absolutely intentional and that is supported by the meticulous photography in the film.  Almost every shot seems like it was mulled over again and again.  It is no wonder Kubrick had the reputation for doing almost a hundred takes.  He was a perfectionist and, at least visually, Eyes Wide Shut has more moments of perfection than not.  The acting is good too but really, the control Kubrick has is so evident that it is hard to credit the actors.  However, Nicole Kidman is particularly strong.<br /><br />With all that said, Eyes Wide Shut may seem otherworldly, but its psychological commentary on marital fidelity from the male perspective is very real.  Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is told by his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) that she had at one time thought about having an affair.  The paranoia, possibilities, and the trials he endures psychologically and in terms of his fidelity to her, are tested as he walks around New York City and guides us through his many surreal and outwardly sexual encounters.  It is an exhibition of his gradual psychological breakdown after his wife shared her secret and all of his encounters seem to be taunting him in his fragile state.  There's more than enough here to make it a great film and to connect almost all of the dots, however, some interesting conspiracy theories exist about the orgy cult that becomes the center of the film's climax.  I'd recommend checking those out if you like this movie but I'm not going to reveal my opinion of them one way or the other.<br /><br />With all of that said, I thought the characters themselves are normal and well-adjusted, so the commentary itself is even more significant.  They are actually good people in a film about doing what is all too often perceived as bad things (i.e. sex).  I'm sure there are good reasons not to like Eyes Wide Shut, but for the most part I thought it was unfairly reviewed because of the sexual content and the sexual commentary.  We are so used to seeing nudity strictly used gratuitously, that it was easy to be cynical of its consistent use here, and that is just the visual sexual elements never mind what the film's deeper intentions are overall.  I'm not surprised I guess because if the film has a flaw, it is that it's too cryptic at times.  Either way, I think it's a great movie and it's nice to see this version released on the best technology we have.</p></body></html>

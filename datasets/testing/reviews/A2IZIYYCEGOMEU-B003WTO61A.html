This is a psych-horror film that had so many splatter-fests ripping it off ( with not even close to the impact )- including a thoroughly, pathetic sequel- it should have gotten franchise rights. THE RING wasn't as scary as CARRIE by half. Aesthetically speaking, the afore-mentioned film doesn't even come close to CARRIE ( only a handful of 'creepers' do ). If you love revenge-films, or just no-holds-barred horror this is the ultimate in payback flicks. A must for any horror fan.</p></body></html>

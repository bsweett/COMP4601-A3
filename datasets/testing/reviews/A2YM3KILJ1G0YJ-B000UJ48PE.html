Those who have seen the first movie know the basic plot: Gullible kids, mostly Americans, allow themselves to be tricked into vulnerable situations where they are kidnapped.  Soon thereafter a rich person pays to torture and kill the helpless kid.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel</a> turned heads for its shock factor, with realistic gore, torture, and close ups of some really brazen death scenes.  Eli Roth provides it all for the sake of pure horror.  There are no ambiguities or false pretenses; people are going to be graphically tortured and murdered.  If you don't like it, don't watch.  Hostel II is no different in this respect; however, it is different in the build up.<br /><br />Picking up where the first one left off, a few bits of unfinished business take place.  Whereas the first movie didn't really suck me in, or make me like the characters at all, a better job was done this time to create viewer empathy (except for Heather Matarazzo, who I hate as an actress).  Apathy, or possibly ambivalence, ruled the initial movie, but genuine terror oozes out of this session of tensely persuasive torture porn, especially during a depraved bathroom scene with a scythe that provides enough blood to make <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416524304">Carrie</a> jealous.<br /><br />With a subtle, contemporary tribute to the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430451513">The Most Dangerous Game</a>, it's a sickeningly sadistic look at morality, or the lack thereof in our culture.  If not for the somewhat campy ending, there would have been a sustained uneasiness from beginning to end, and it would be a five-star horror flick.</p></body></html>

Johnny Depp was really good as the demented writer who was still yearning over the loss of his wife, and reliazed to late that it was he in fact who was commiting the atrocious crimes to compensate for her leaving. This is a movie that makes you believe one thing, and then turns right around midstream and throws the right answer at you. Its gripping, frightful and full of insanity. The perfect movie for a dark and stormy night.</p></body></html>

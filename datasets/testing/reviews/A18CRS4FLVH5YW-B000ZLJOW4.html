Any role she plays is always done with such a passion; I am still scratching my head as to why she doesn't get roles that show what kind of talent that lady really has.  If you've seen the HBO series "Six Feet Under" I don't think there is anyone out there that has seen it that can honestly say they weren't moved or totally annoyed by her briefly displayed character in that series.  The irony is, her character "made" that series and provided something no other actress could have pulled off.  Well, Ileana does a little number in "Ghost World" too.  You can honestly look at her character and know there is not one actress in Hollywood that can pull off playing an overtly passionate art teacher like Ileana!  She's brilliant!  Unfortunately, this movie isn't!  It moves too slowly, has a dull plot, uses other extremely talented actors to play dumb-downed roles and fires jokes off at random without a punchline.  There are moments in "Ghost World" that are reminiscent of "Romi and Michelle's High School Reunion," (a far better film that uses humor as a background and not as the focus of the story) which makes me think this film doesn't really have much originality.  Countless movies have been made using the Goth genre as the setting for much more engaging stories but this movie simply doesn't bring home the bacon.  As much as critics have hailed this movie, the only thing this proves is exactly how catatonic critics really are!</p></body></html>

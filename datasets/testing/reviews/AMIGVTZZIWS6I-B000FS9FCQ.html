<meta name="summary" content="A Disturbing, Yet Wonderful Film"></head><body><p>There are times when it is difficult to watch this film.  In a post-September 11 world it is not easy to watch a film that makes a terrorist into a hero.  However, if all you see in V is a terrorist then I think you've missed the point of the film, because there is also a strong undercurrent of patriotism throughout.  V for Vendetta is set in a not-so-distant future that looks dusturbingly like a future that could easily be formed out of real-life current events.  In this future the government  has taken away basic civil liberties in the name of national security; government policies are based on fanatical religious doctine; and those who are different (gays and lesbians) are vilified and blamed for the ills of the world.  Sounds familiar, anyone?  This was also a well-cast film.  Hugo Weaving is simply great as V; and even though you never get to see his face, Weaving is able to convey real emotional strength.  Weaving is a very under-valued actor.  Natlie Portman was also great as Evey, the shy girl who comes around to V's thinking.  It says something about this film that when the final, horrific scene happens you find yourself cheered and excited.  This film is disturbing, but one of the finest of 2006.</p></body></html>

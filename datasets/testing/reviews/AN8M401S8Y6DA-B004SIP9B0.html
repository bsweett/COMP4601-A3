<meta name="summary" content="To all you modernists it's only 97 minutes (including credits), watch it, it is the peoples movie."></head><body><p>From the previews it almost looks like a period piece which might turn alot of people off, but this movie takes place in 1997 the week of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the effect her death had on the british empire and around the world.  I was one year out of high school and on my way to basic training in 1997, to immature and wrapped up in my own mind to understand the impact it had on people, yet watching this movie and seeing the live broadcasts it was touching you could feel it.<br />It deserves it's 6 oscar nominations and one win for Hellen Mirren who does an amazing job.<br />The queen also received 98% positve feedback on rottentomatoes of 166 reviews who can all write better than me.<br />Stephen Frears directs he also directed the grifters and high fidelity both with john cusack, both movies also received 4 stars from the grand pooba of critics roger ebert and made his personal top 10 lists the years they were released.  Roger Ebert being out due to surgery from salivary cancer still reviewed the queen and also gave it 4 stars last year.  You can tell Stephen frears being born in the UK had some fun with this as when Prince Philip tells queen Elizabeth "move over cabbage" when he jumps into bed.  His movie has a great flow and does a beautiful job with the buck and the queen in the woods which symbolizes Dianna as the queen tries to help it but in the end it was still hunted down by the trackers almost as Dianna was by the paparazzi.  He has a great eye for detail i believe i saw a playstation 1 or a supernintendo on Tony blairs tv set.<br />The movie does not take sides, and it shows us a side of a woman that nobody would get to see other than in a movie, and maybe help the way she is remembered.<br />Thanks for reading.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chic flick on speed or sublime flight of the imagination?"></head><body><p>Call it what you will--archetypal fable with a feminist twist, exquisitely choreographed martial arts movie, balletic spectacle balancing image, action, poetry and music--&quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; is a distinctive variation on familiar genres.  The words &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;choreography,&quot; &quot;Eastern&quot; exotic myth don't quite do justice in describing the film.  For one, the action sequences are lightning swift--reminiscent of American silent comedies and more suggestive of music than of formal dance.  And certainly the tempo of this music and the pace of the film seem more Western than Eastern (as does the throbbing romantic cello of YoYo Ma).  Some will single out the three female leads in this rite-of-passage archetypal story as the film's most distinctive twist.  But even more novel is the way the form foregrounds allegory and approaches the theme of teaching and learning.  Film is a medium that is normally &quot;relentless&quot; in his  representation of the physical world, satisfying viewers' expectations of actions that are at least humanly plausible.  But by making his characters fly all over the frame, director Lee keeps reminding the spectator that if you try to respond this film as another action movie you will not only miss the point entirely but be thoroughly disappointed.  Sword play, flying, and fighting are metaphors for living, learning and loving.  All of the 5 principals in the story are learners--and all are failures to greater and lesser degrees.  In fact, the alleged villain, Jade Fox, is in some respects the most sympathetic of all the characters.  She had access to the most masterful swordsman of all but not to his teaching because of her status as a woman.  At one point sword play is compared with word play, or writing (through the picture-grams of Mandarese script).  Whether the instrument is a sword, a pen, or a brush, the viewer of this enchanting parable is finally enjoined to fashion a personal narrative that rejects pride and selfishness in favor of a life sufficiently disciplined to give itself over to love.</p></body></html>

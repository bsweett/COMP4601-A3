<meta name="summary" content="Captain America Rules"></head><body><p>i was so excited to see this movie, i wished i would of seen the midnight showing. this movie was everything i expected it to be. the origin was excatly like the comic, the actors were awesome. hugo weaving did an excellent red skull and chris evans was fantastic as captain america. this movie was awesome. and the battle between red skull and captain america was outstanding. the only problem i have with this movie is that i wished they wouldof stuck with the original costume but other than that this is my number one superhero movie of the year. marvel you guys did great on coming out with good superhero movies for this year. i do hope that marvel will put out the original captain america movie on dvd soon. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></body></html>

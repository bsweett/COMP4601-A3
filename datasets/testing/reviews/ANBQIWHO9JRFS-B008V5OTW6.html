<meta name="summary" content="First-Rate Thriller"></head><body><p>Since my typical approach is to talk about some cheap little movie that no one takes seriously and discuss it at length I believe here I shall discuss a well-known, controversial film and consider it in a very shallow, brief manner.  So here I go:  'Munich' is an extremely sharp, well-done thriller.  So many people are solely interested in considering this film from a political standpoint, I can't help but point out that this is still a movie, a frequently exciting and tense movie at that.  Though I've always  assumed that such covert operations exist even in so-called 'civilized' nations, notions of government funded assassinations and the like have never really seemed real to me, which makes this movie all the more fascinating, turning it into a glimpse into a hidden, but apparently real world. (And it goes beyond this, giving us glimpses of amoral, anti-government, mafia-esque groups in europe and lone seductress-assassins, the latter of which I hadn't assumed actually existed in reality, but perhaps they do...)  Of course, I have no way of knowing how closely the team here resembles the real squads sent out to off Black September, but I've somewhat arbitrarily determined that this is probably pretty close to the truth.  More to the point, film itself makes it very easy to do this, as it simply feels utterly real.  Or, I should say, utterly real at least in terms of how the characters act and their general motivations and whatnot-- The film itself is very stylishly, often expressionistically made, not generally gritty or documentary like or whatever.  It stradles the line, managing to be cinematic but not over the top or anything like that.  Performances are all top-notch, with particular note going to Eric Bana as Avner, leader of the team.  He is the most, well, normal guy in the team, so naturally he is the one who gradually becomes the most affected by their operations.<br /><br />Still, I can't help but discuss the political aspects of the movie to some degree.  Suffice to say, I think it's best to take this film most purely at face value, as an exploration of how violence is bound to effect those who inflict it on others, even if the violence is just and the target deserving.  Killing is neither simple nor pleasant, and gunning people down unarmed men in hallways and bombing others is likely going to have a pretty adverse affect on you regardless of any other details.  This is, perhaps, a fairly obvious point, but like all films that actually work on a thematic level, 'Munich' makes you actually *believe* it with your gut rather than just be consciously aware of the concept in an abstract way.<br /><br />The film isn't w/o a few problems.  Firstly, it takes a bit too long to wind down after the operations are over.  Some of this is necessary, yes, but not all of it.  We're made plenty aware of Avner's deteriorating mental state during the later portions of the operation, we don't need to have it pointed out to us so much after the fact.  Also, the juxtaposition of Avner and his wife having sex and the bloodbath on the runway is pretty damn heavy handed and over the top.  The slow-motion shots of Avner, umm, thrusting with droplets of sweat spraying everywhere as he screams and screams are just a bit much for my taste, thank you.  But that's about it as far as problems are concerned.  This is simply a very good, very believable and intense thriller.  Check it out.<br /><br />Lastly, I've only got the single disc DVD.  It looks very nice, though the artwork itself does make me laugh.  Makes it look like it's a video game.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

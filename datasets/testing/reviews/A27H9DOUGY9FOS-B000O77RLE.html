Nothing could have surprised me more, however, with how disconnected I felt from that picture.  It was a fascinating story and a nice tribute, but its awkward narrative framing and (more importantly) lack of genuine character development disappointed me.  All I felt left with was a heavy-handed message with no real dramatic weight.  I still looked forward to "Letters From Iwo Jima," however, intrigued by Eastwood's ambitions of portraying a Japanese perspective centered on the same event.  Such a bold move makes me respect Eastwood even more.  The film was rushed into release for the 2006 awards season when "Flags" failed to become a critical front-runner, and that decision seems to have paid off for the studio.  Recognized by several major critic's groups, "Letters" also stands as a Best Picture candidate at the Academy awards.<br /><br />Ironically, the aspect that left me unmoved with "Flags" is the strongest asset of "Letters"--and that is character development.  Spending time with a handful of major characters, the film does a nice job fleshing them out in a real three-dimensional way.  The film intimately examines their situation on Iwo Jima, the hopelessness, the strategizing.  The interactions between the soldiers is well developed and genuine, and the incorporation of writing letters as a narrative device provides even more insight.  We get to "hear" their thoughts and to explore their backstory.  The moments that we step away from Iwo Jima in flashbacks are well integrated and provide a greater emotional context for their current situation.<br /><br />As for plot, the film explores the American invasion of Iwo Jima.  Near the end of the war, the Japanese soldiers left to maintain this stronghold have become increasingly isolated and unsupported from the mainland.  With a new, somewhat controversial, General in command--it quickly becomes clear that this is a mission of holding on until death.  American victory seems assured--so with honor, dignity and sacrifice, all the remaining soldiers are being asked to die in the name of duty.  Building a complex system of bunkers within the mountain, they are (in essence) constructing their own graves.  When the invasion actually begins, the battle scenes are harrowing and believable--and the awesome underground cavern system is a claustrophobic and memorable set piece.<br /><br />One of the main popular criticisms of "Letters" comes from a perceived revisionist approach.  By viewing the film's characters as protagonists with humanity, is it glossing over the atrocities committed in a wartime situation?  And obviously, a legitimate movie could have been made to depict this too--but this isn't that movie.  This is a film that examines a few individuals struggling with a moral code which is at odds with a desire to live.  Not every Japanese soldier was a monster, nor was every German or Italian--but neither is every American soldier a saint.  What the film has endeavored to impart is that, most importantly, we're all human.  The average Japanese soldier had a lot in common with the average American soldier.  The film is a tad heavy-handed in those connections, on occasion, but I personally had no problem seeing the characters in "Letters" as sympathetic and real.<br /><br />The performances in "Letters" are uniformly excellent.  The script is tight and logical, the color palette refreshingly bleak, and the staging impressive.  There is a certain dignity and honor in the film--a certain respectful sense of dread as we are led to the inevitable conclusion.  A truly memorable and compassionate piece, I recommend "Letters" without reservation.  KGHarris, 01/07.</p></body></html>

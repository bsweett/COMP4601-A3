<meta name="summary" content="No English Patient"></head><body><p>Now and again British cinema gets overestimated and this is one of those sad events. It maybe that the pairing of James McAvoy and Keira Knightley does showcase some serious talent but it is still a far cry from the Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet type publicity it got.<br /><br />We will be hard pressed to find such an original script that attempts romance, sexual deviance, war time shock surgery and delusions but after seeing it on the screen one can't help but feel that such concoctions end up mixing like coke and Alka-Seltzer, fizzing instead of sparkling, the acting is on par as is the lush cinematography, but direction and story leave pollution where sweetness should have been. We don't mind sad stories, but aberrations like this make storytelling pointless and blunt. Very dissatisfying.</p></body></html>

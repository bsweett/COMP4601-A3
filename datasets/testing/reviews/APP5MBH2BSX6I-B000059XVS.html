<meta name="summary" content="Nearly perfect"></head><body><p>First let me laud the other reviewers who have shared such historical detail with us on this page.  They help flesh out the famous story of the blond Briton who made his mark on history among the dark men of the desert.  I have nothing to add to their comments in this regard; at age 45 I have just seen the film for the first time, having been recently inspired by the NY Times list of "1000 best movies ever made" to see many of The Great Films I've Never Seen.<br /><br />From the perspective of a newcomer, therefore, I have to say I'm astonished at how perfect this massive epic is.  Two years in the making, on a nearly unheard-of scale at the time, bogged down by the many problems of shooting on location in the actual deserts of the Middle East, "Lawrence of Arabia" was such an ordeal that Peter O'Toole turned down the lead in "Dr. Zhivago," David Lean's next epic, simply because he was so wrung out from playing T.E. Lawrence that he couldn't imagine a similar experience for quite some time.  Sure enough, they never worked together again.  Even with all of the problems, this film is simply phenomenal in every way.<br /><br />NY Times reviewer Bosley Crowther, writing in 1962, seemed flummoxed with the fact that Lean chose to leave Lawrence an enigmatic character.  It was a simpler time when this movie was made and released, and Crowther seems to have wanted firm answers to the man's character and his motives.  As the other reviewers here make clear, that's just not the point.  Lawrence was, and is, the embodiment of the phrase Winston Churchill used in reference to Russia, "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."  Time has borne out that Lean was absolutely right to leave it that way, rather than guessing at the man's motivations and hidden life.  A larger than life character is almost always ruined when dissected.<br /><br />T.E. Lawrence came to be known as being as big a character as the desert itself, and Lean's epic drives this point home.  On the day after viewing, one is left with two thoughts especially:  The desert is vast and unforgiving, and Lawrence was equally immovable and probably a manic depressive.  Beyond that, the amazingly rich photography, the loving attention to detail, the perfectly pitched pace of the story and the multiple relationships among the characters, and even Alec Guinness in "brownface" as Prince Faisel, combine to create an incredible work of art that will never grow old.  My only nitpick would be that in one of Guinness's scenes a line had to be changed after principal filming, so that his lips move but his voice says something different.  In a nearly-four-hour film, that one nitpick is so insignificant that I feel retentive even mentioning it.<br /><br />At once an epic on a grand scale, an intimate character portrait that leaves us with tantalizing questions, a historical record, and a war film with an anti-war (or at least war-weary) ending, "Lawrence of Arabia" is unique and cherished, for good reason.  It may have taken me 45 years to see this masterpiece, but it won't take another 45 to see it again.</p></body></html>

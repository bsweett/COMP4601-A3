Not only is it (vastly) technically superior to the CGI offerings from other studios (and a significant improvement even on Pixar's previous offerings), but it again proves that Pixar understands what makes a great film -- story, story, story. The story is character-driven, not plot-driven, a point most Hollywood film makers seem to have forgotten. The characters have believable personalities, legitimate problems, and interact in plausible ways.<br /><br />Which brings me to a point that _hasn't_ been addressed by many reviewers. The PG rating notwithstanding, the insistance of the filmmakers on treating the material in a fundamentally serious way (which has been true of _all_ Pixar feature films) makes "The Incredibles" a _very_ dark film. Though we never see a verifiable on-screen death, most of Syndrome's minions are offed (directly or indirectly) by the Parrs, usually in an explosion or crash. We later learn that Syndrome is a serial killer, having murdered at least a dozen superheroes. And Syndrome himself perishes when he's ground up in the jet engine of his own plane (though this is off-camera, as well).<br /><br />Leaving the theater, I asked a father if he thought "The Incredibles" veered dangerously close to being PG-13, and -- to my surprise -- he agreed. "The previews were all of the funny stuff." (The hysterical scene of an oversized Mr. Incredible trying to get into an undersized super-suit is not in the film.)<br /><br />The reason for the "real" (though mostly unshown) violence of "The Incredibles" is likely the result of the tendency over the last two decades to treat science-fiction and fantasy stories as if they were character-driven dramas (qv, Xena). This is good, because it makes for engaging and believable story-telling. But it also means the villains have to be much nastier -- more like Hannibal Lecter than Captain Hook. "Real" characters need "real" threats (qv, "A Bug's Life").<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is a surprisingly violent film, and I urge parents to think twice before taking kids much under 12.</p></body></html>

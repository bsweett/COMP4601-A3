<meta name="summary" content="This 'Italian Job" okay popcorn entertainment in HD"></head><body><p>Much has been written about the below average HD transfer of this remake in HD DVD and Blu-ray but this doesn't ruin the movie for me since I've seen a lot worse transfers than this. Anyway if you're familiar with the Michael Caine original than you'll even enjoy this revisionist remake of the '70s film. Wahlberg makes a fine hero, Theron is nice to look at and Edward Norton is a lot of fun as the villain you'd love to hate.  If you liked "Oceans 11" then you'll enjoy this.  I've knocked one star for the video quality of this in HD but the price of this in HD DVD versus the Blu-ray is so obscenely low that it definitely ranks as a best buy.  Like would you pay $5 or $6 for this disc in HD or close to $20 in Blu-ray--go figure.  Anyway if you like Wahlberg also check out in HD DVD, "Four Brothers" and "Shooter" all at a bargain basement price in HD DVD!!</p></body></html>

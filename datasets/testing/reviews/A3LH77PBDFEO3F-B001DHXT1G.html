<meta name="summary" content="Hulk Smash!"></head><body><p>Here is my rhyming homage' to the newest "Incredible Hulk", to the tune of Blondie's "Call Me"<br /><br />Bruce Banner is the subject of a movie once again<br />But this time it is different (watching will not cause you pain)<br />Marvel gets it right this time<br />The Hulkster says his "HULK SMASH!"  line!<br />This Hulk! -Movie's fine,<br />It's great if you're the comics kind.<br />This Hulk!- Movie's fine<br />It's much better than my silly rhyme,<br />This Hulk!<br /><br />So...<br />Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy this movie much, but I did! Ed Norton is perfect as Bruce Banner, the CG's are great, Liv Tyler is still a beauty to behold, and William Hurt is a very hate worthy villain. I watched the Video On Demand rental over Thanksgiving and watched "Iron Man" right afterwards and was happy to see that I should do exactly that, as they are tied together. There is a kind touch for the old TV show fans by showing Bill Bixby on TV (The courtship of Eddy's Father) and Lou Ferigno plays a guard at the University. If you don't hate "Super Hero" movies you should like this fun movie as well.<br /><br />3 1/2*</p></body></html>

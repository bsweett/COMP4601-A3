<meta name="summary" content="How Good Is The Blu-Ray?  Wow!!"></head><body><p>Like an another reviewer intimated here, watching animated films the past five years, I have often shook my head and wondered, "How does it get any better than this?"  Then an animated film like this comes out and shows me.<br /><br />Overall movies may not be better today than "in the old days," but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation.  This is another example of that.<br /><br />The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning.  I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes.  From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny (and it's cheaper here at Amazon) to anyone who appreciates art.<br /><br />By the way, this is not "a funny cartoon" but a suspenseful and sentimental adventure story, with a few laughs along the way. I would think adults would like this more than kids.  Meanwhile, everyone - regardless - will have their jaw drop more than once - viewing the incredible-looking scenes. Finally, if you like extras, sit back and enjoy: there are tons of them in this four-disc set.</p></body></html>

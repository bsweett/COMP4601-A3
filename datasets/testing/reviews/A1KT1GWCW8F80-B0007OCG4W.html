They played with each other's emotions for fun, went on power trips, and generally acted like asses. (Sort of like "Hurlyburly" in that respect - lots of angry, pointless talk by similarly unlikable characters played by big-name actors.)<br /><br />The acting was OK, but the script gave the actors nothing to work with. Julia Roberts was not convincing as a photographer, and Natalie Portman's stripper character never actually strips though I knew that before seeing it.<br /><br />I found myself checking the clock at about the one-hour mark...not a good sign. I give it 2 stars only because it was well-made and someone involved must have thought they had a decent movie in it somewhere. I failed to find it, though.</p></body></html>

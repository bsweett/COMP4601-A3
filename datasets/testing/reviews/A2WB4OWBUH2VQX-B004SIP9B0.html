<meta name="summary" content="Honestly, VERY boring and overhyped"></head><body><p>I had great expectations for this film but I was disappointed with it.<br /><br />I actually thought that the Tony Blair character was better acted than the Queen character acted by Helen Mirren. (BTW, I think Meryl Streep got robbed of another Oscar). The Queen's character is flat and one-dimensional and as the viewer, one cares nothing about her so-called internal struggles.<br /><br />The cinematography was nothing special, the score was practically nonexistent and definitely forgetable, and the MTV-like connecting of real television images and the actors was not a smooth and seamless presentation.<br /><br />And then there's the story itself....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.<br /><br />I'd skip this movie.</p></body></html>

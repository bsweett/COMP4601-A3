The painting remains the subject of speculation; some believe Leonardo used himself as a model, others that the woman was a mistress of his patrons. The Da Vinci code creates much the same amount of speculation. Like viewing the enigmatic work by Leonardo in which the exchange between the viewer and the work itself is mesmerizing, engrossing, so it is with the Da Vinci Code. The blockbuster screen version of the historically successful-best-selling book about the frantic Euro-scavenger hunt to unlock a 2000-year-old secret. You must know the story by now it's been on the best-seller list longer than the last 2 Potter books. Okay, just incase...World-renowned Harvard symbologist Professor Robert Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) is called to a murder investigation, of which he becomes a suspect in, at the Louvre Museum. The museum curator has been murdered, turning his remains into a living symbol, well not living, turning his remains into a symbol that will lead Langdon and police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) on the run and on a trail of clues and symbols leading to many secrets worked into the art of Leonardo Da Vinci, tied to a secret society dedicated to guarding the ancient secret. I know even if you haven't read it or seen.<br /><br />The Movie, like the book, has all the style and traditional suspense elements that make a movie of the genre work as an entertaining narrative, taking the viewer along with confidence that it is going one almost mainstream way (really? Secret societies & killer albino monks!!), then surprising you when it doesn't. It feels real familiar as a thriller then events twist and turn another way.<br /><br />The international cast is lead by 2-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks, who, with his stringy academic hair, embodies Dan Brown's protagonist for the film. Symbologist Robert Langdon is described early in the novel as being sort of a "Harrison Ford in Harris tweed" and Hanks is a solid choice (inspite of the fact that I would like to see Director Ron Howard draw from outside his personal actor's pool, casting an unknown is always a gamble). Langdon is the thinkin' man's hero, relentless in his quest to seek out the truth. Audrey Tautou , plays Sophie Neveu,  the strong partner with just as much personal as well as proffession at stake in solving the mystery. Also in Howard's ensemble cast is Sir Ian McKellen who delivers his typically brilliant portrayal as the enigmatic Sir Leigh Teabing. Paul Bettany, who appeared in Howard's Beautiful Mind, plays the bizarre monk Silas. Finally Jean Reno, plays French police captain Bezu Fach, a part written for Reno, literally, Dan Brown wrote the character with the French actor in mind!! Lastly but not least, Alfred "throw me the idol" Molina (Doc Oct in Spiderman 2) plays the Bishop Aringarosa with creepy distinction.<br /><br />Be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel and part of the fuss over it has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden "history" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church.<br /><br />See it, if for nothing other than to see the amazing BONDish locations, historical attractions and real (sometimes) works of art featured in the film. Location including: Paris' Musee du Louvre (the footage of the Louvre at night is beautiful), the Temple Church (of the Knights Templar), Westminster Abbey, Lincoln Cathedral (London) , Rosslyn Chapel (Scotland), Lincolnshire substituting for Castle Gandolfo, the Mediterranean island of Malta. Locations and art included give a much-needed authenticity that would have been lost on a backlot or soundstage shoot.<br /><br />Overall the film is definitely worth the price of admission but, be warned the film stays fairly true to the novel. Part of the fuss over CODE has been the premise that Da Vinci has left clues pointing to hidden "history" revealing Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church. This may anger Christians in general, Catholics in particular, especially those not willing to treat the film as fiction based on controversial theory. I for one am a Roman Catholic and find the material, of both the film and novel, fascinating and worth my time.<br /><br />Another warning due to the complicated exposition of the story the Da Vinci Code runs over 2 hours and many plot points necessary cause the film to drag at times. It has a Pg-13 rating for violence, some sexual content, brief drug references and disturbing images and themes.<br /><br />Lastly, I recommend that other Christians and Catholics (with serious inquires) take advantage of the excitement (good or bad) generated by this movie and use the opportunity it provides for church dialogue. Many churches have responded positively (and some negatively) by arming their congregations with their history and theology, along with strategies to spread their faith. That is what good books and movies should do: inspire people to think and ask interesting questions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Original, subtle, and extremely witty"></head><body><p>I think almost every reviewer will agree that this is one of the most original American films in years. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is wild, outragious and bizarre on many levels. But it is also lyrical and superbly witty. Every time I saw this film I felt like one of my surreal classmates from second grade had grown up and made a movie. But somewhere along the way it seemed that that kid had developed a tremendous understanding of life, of literature and of the audience. <p>One of the refreshing things about &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is that it manages to be wild and unique without trying too hard. It balances an outlandish plot with a subtle and intelligent wit that permeates the entire film.<p>Even the best American films tend to be a little too full of themselves at times. The great thing about this one is that it threw out all assumptions about film making and pushed everything to the envelope WITHOUT any visible trace of effort.</p></body></html>

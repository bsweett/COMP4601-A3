The way I see it, John Cusack's massive appeal cancels out Chevy Chase's patented mugging. This still doesn't make HOT TUB TIME MACHINE watchable beyond a certain frat boy level. However, in that frat boy wheelhouse, this film's a laugh riot. To start with, I love the hell out of the film's title.<br /><br />When life gives you lemons, you can choose to make lemonades. Or you can squirt the lemons in your eyeball. Cusack plays Adam, one of the three childhood friends and losers-in-life who serve as our core characters. Adam is an insurance agent whose woman had left him and whose wise aleck 20-year-old uber-nerd nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) has permanently camped out in his basement. Somewhere along here, we meet Nick (Craig Robinson), once the front man of a band but now a sad sack stuck in a dead end career in pet care. When news hits Adam and Nick of the attempted suicide by their old party animal pal, Lou a.k.a. "Violator" (Rob Corddry), it reunites the old gang. Having fallen out of touch, the three decide to relive the best weekend of their lives, spent in the snowy Kodiak Valley ski resort back in 1986 when they were kids. Adam's nephew, Jacob, tags along, because who doesn't want a chubby young geek as a wingman?<br /><br />Except that the ski resort nowadays is a mostly deserted dump. And that ill-tempered one-armed bellhop (Crispin Glover) is surely putting out creepy vibes. Still, these four losers are up for one night of drunken revelry. And, oooh, is that a hot tub? They jump in the hot tub, and if you've glanced at the film's title, you should be able to make that intuitive leap.<br /><br />"It must be some kind of hot tub time machine..." The quartet wake up the next morning to find themselves somehow transported to 1986, back to that very same weekend they'd been hearkening back to. Back to 1986, era of leg warmers, Red Dawn, MTV when it actually showed music videos, and Eddie Murphy when he was funny. Adam, Nick, and Lou learn that the inhabitants of 1986 perceive them as teenagers, as they'd originally looked in that time, and that familiar events are unwinding as they once did. Can these tourists in time find their way back to their own time, and do it without destroying the space/time continuum? Even if it means that Adam gets stabbed in the eye with a fork again?<br /><br />If you're in the mood for gross out humor, then this is up your alley. HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is a sort of a bromance by way of smutty screwball farce. It trots out an unrelenting arsenal of pervasive language, raunchiness, nudity, and Chevy Chase as a mysterious repairman. There are so many f-bombs dropped in this one that even Lenny Bruce is all apologetic. The story has fun playing with time paradox, whether it's the Violator's surefire sports wager backfiring, Nick's introduction of a Black Eyes Peas joint to the 1986 crowd or his insane phone call to his future wife (who in 1986 is a nine-year-old girl), or a key subplot which threatens Jacob's very existence.<br /><br />John Cusack, ostensibly the lead actor, takes a back seat to Rob Corddry who ends up stealing all the scenes as Lou the Violator. You have to admire Corddry for throwing himself into the role with such abandon. In a sick kind of way, his performance approaches near virtuoso levels. He pretty much tops up his quota of cusswords within the first few minutes. He says stuff that make you cringe, except that, inside, you wish you had the sac to say them. He almost deserves his getting the last laugh. HOT TUB TIME MACHINE falls into my own wheelhouse, me being a child of the '80s. I, too, remember when Michael Jackson was black. I can see where that bully Blaine was coming from when he accused our oddball time travelers of being some sort of "21 Jump Street communist spy battalion type dudes." Heck, I even remember Scritti Politti. And, every once in a while, I get a yen for gross out humor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ugh, ugh....and ugh!"></head><body><p>I'm a fan of Harrison Ford but that wasn't enough to maintain my interest in this tired script. Also, Ford looks less than "committed" to the role, showing his own indifference or exhaustion. Yes, He's usually good as the hero type, bucking the odds, coming through in a pinch.<br /><br />But when an evil gang (headed by Paul Bettany) break into his home and threatens to kill his family if Jack doesn't tranfer money into an offshore account, Ford just doesn't have the ability to transcend the flawed plot and keep things suspenseful. He tries, acting incensed, desperate...etc...but he just doesn't have much to work with. The script needed more surprises and a LOT more tension.<br /><br /> Catch it on  cable - it'll be there soon enough.</p></body></html>

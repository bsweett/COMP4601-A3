<meta name="summary" content=""Zodiac" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Zodiac" is brilliant! One of the best films of the year, thus far. The performances led by Jake Gyllenhaal (as Robert Graysmith, who also wrote the book that inspired the movie), Mark Ruffalo (as Inspector David Toschi, who also served as an inspiration behind the film "Bullitt" (1968) with Steve McQueen) and an impressive Robert Downey Jr. (as Paul Avery) are excellent. The directing by David Fincher (who has also directed "Seven" (1995) & "Panic Room" (2002) is excellent. The screenplay by James Vanderbilt (based on Graysmith's book) is excellent. The music by David Shire (who did the score to "All The President's Men" (1976) is excellent and the use of 70's songs are excellent. The cinematography by Harris Savides (who also did the cinematography to Fincher's "The Game" (1997) is excellent. The film editing by Angus Wall (who also film edited Fincher's "Panic Room" & Fincher's upcoming "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" (2008) is excellent. The casting by Laray Mayfield (who also film edited Fincher's "Fight Club" (1999), "Panic Room", & the upcoming "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" is excellent. The production design by Donald Graham Burt (who also did the upcoming "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button") is excellent. The art direction by Keith P. Cunningham is excellent. The set decoration by Victor J. Zolfo (who also did the upcoming "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button") is excellent. The costume design by Casey Storm is excellent. This is Fincher's best film since "Seven", and yes, it is overlong, but it is interesting and it makes you think and keeps you intrigued.</p></body></html>

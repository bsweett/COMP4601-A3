<meta name="summary" content="My first blu-ray disc and it's AMAZING!"></head><body><p>I just recently entered the world of Blu-ray and I picked this movie as my first disc. I was not disappointed! The movie itself is amazing with stunning visuals, great humor, and real adventure (not to mention a powerful score by John Powell).The movie on blu-ray looks absolutely stunning. The animated water looks so real, as if the drawings were placed on photographs. Not only am I very pleased with the quality of the movie, but this blu-ray disc is confirmation that I'll never go back to standard definition. If you haven't purchased a blu-ray player, this movie is a great reason to experience hi-def movie watching.</p></body></html>

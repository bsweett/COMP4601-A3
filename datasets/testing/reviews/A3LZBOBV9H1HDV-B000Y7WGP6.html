The cast led by Jamie Foxx (as Ronald Fleury), Chris Cooper (as Grant Sykes), and Jennifer Garner (as Janet Mayes) is excellent! The directing by Peter Berg (who also makes a small appearance in the film) (who also directed the upcoming "Hancock" (2008), he also directed "Friday Night Lights" (2004) & "The Rundown" (2003) is excellent!

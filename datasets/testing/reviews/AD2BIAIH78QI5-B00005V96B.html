<meta name="summary" content="Outpaces "Shrek" by Half a League"></head><body><p>What a shame that "Shrek" had an earlier release date than "Monsters, Inc." because this is the better movie of the two..."Monsters, Inc." is a sheer delight, from start to finish. Cute, I mean REALLY cute, story line about how the monsters actually have a work-a-day world where scaring children is a job for superstars. When a human child makes it to the other side of the bedroom door into the monsters' world, all heck breaks out before the situation can be set aright again...the children in my movie theatre, including 3yr-old Alexander, just squealed with laughter the whole time, as did the adults present, too. And not a fart joke in sight! That's the difference between child and adolescent humor, I guess.  <p>If you want to see the TRUE best cartoon movie  of the year, look no farther than "Monsters, Inc."</p></body></html>

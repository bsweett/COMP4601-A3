This movie will certainly do this for you. It's a true blast, and Johnny Depp is amazing as usual. He really has a knack for playing the offbeat character-- perhaps because he himself is offbeat, but in a way that makes you want to see more.<p>Depp stars as Mort, a writer with a severe case of writer's block. He takes long naps, talks to his dog, sits at his computer hoping to write something other than "bad writing," which he won't even bother with. If it's bad, he deletes it. There is no editing. So along comes John Shooter (Turturro) who claims that Mort stole a story of his who leaves behind his manuscript for Mort to look over. Mort is dismissive at first, but soon discovers that Shooter could be more of a problem than what he first thought. <p>Did Mort really steal the story? Nah, and don't worrry-- my mentioning this is not really a spoiler. There's a bit of backstory in this movie with Mort's estranged wife and her new boyfriend and how Mort is coping with the fact that his wife is sleeping with someone other than her husband. I like that this movie is full of mystery, but isn't so twisted that you're not sure what's going on... well, until the end that is. <p>This movie had an ending that I wasn't so thrilled with, and perhaps you may agree with me on it after you actually see the movie because I refuse to give away the twist ending. It's typical. That's all I'll say. (You may disagree-- I'm sure lots of people will like the ending, and I'll bet this is a movie that some people may see more than once, just to catch all those things they might have missed throughout it the first time.)<p>I still give this movie five stars. Not only is Depp fantastic, as he always is, but even though I didn't really like the ending, I was NOT expecting it, and I can truly appreciate that. I love it when it's unexpected, and I'm sure audiences will have their mouths covered in amazement when the final revelation happens. <p>This movie is definitely worth the few dollars to see at the movies. But don't get popcorn. You might not want it as the movie progresses. It freaked me out in some spots to the point where my stomach was in knots, but in a good way-- in the way any thrilling movie should do. I did like that it carried a quirky tone as well, it definitely suits Johnny Depp. His mannerisms and some of his lines and predicaments will make anyone laugh. So see it, you're bound to like it.</p></body></html>

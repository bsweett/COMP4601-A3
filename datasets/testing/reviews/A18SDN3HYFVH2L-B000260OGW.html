He's got the feel for the genre, the interest, and perhaps he still has the pull to keep making the occasional film, though he can be a bit too enamored of the "epic" side of the genre for his own good.  With OPEN RANGE, his need for grandeur and mythologizing gets a bit in the way of what is really a pretty simple free rangers vs town cattle baron story that Anthony Mann and James Stewart would have gotten through in a nicely-paced 100 minutes, and Andre de Toth and Randolph Scott would have zipped through in 85, but Costner has to spread it out to 135 or so, mostly through lots of (admittedly pretty) landscape shots and portentous dialogue - which is mostly decent, but not always necessary. It's one of those films that doesn't really have a lot of whole scenes that you could cut, and that manages to maintain interest, but just feels in the end like too much of a good thing.<br /><br />That major caveat aside, OPEN RANGE is a pretty solid "classic" western that wouldn't have been otherwise out of place had it appeared on the marquees in 1957.  Robert Duvall and Costner star as Boss Spearman and Charlie Waite, respectively the owner in a cattle driving operation and his top hand, who have been together for a decade.  Spearman is expansive, almost garrulous, while Waite is generally quiet if not taciturn, and it won't come as any surprise to western lovers that he turns out to have something of a past - which will come into play when the two and the other members of their crew, bearish Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and teenage Mexican kid Button (Diego Luna) run afoul of the local power in the isolated town of Harmonville, an Irish rancher named Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) who owns most of the land roundabouts, the biggest saloon in town, and the local sheriff (James Russo).  Their only allies, it seems, in an oncoming fight against the might of the rancher's large crew, are the old stablemaster Percy (Michael Jeter in one of his last and best roles) and Sue (Annette Benning) the pretty assistant to the local doctor, a woman roughly Waite's age who fixes up both Mose and Button after run-ins with Baxter's men.<br /><br />There isn't anything terribly new or wildly innovative in OPEN RANGE - how many westerns made since 1920 or so can you say that about, anyway?  But it is nicely put together, and the fairly typical "end of the gunslinger" era is evoked well enough.  Waite is similar to an awful lot of ex-wildmen who are trying to make it in a new life, but find themselves drawn back to their violent days, and the film often seems to explicitly evoke Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN (especially in the mud and rain that dominate much of the middle of the film), though Waite unlike Eastwood's William Munny seems a little more likely to escape a lonely doom - and his partnership with Duvall's Boss is much more equal and lasting than Munny's was with anyone.  The tragic feeling of the Eastwood film is one element that's foreign to Costner's intentions, which are in the end at least a little bit optimistic.  The film is just as much about the different pulls of friendship, work, and love as it is about the frontier vs civilization motif, and one thing the leisurely running time does do is give it time to explore these ideas at some length.<br /><br />Duvall is just great as the grizzled and fatalistic-yet-cheerful Boss, and Costner is fine I guess though it's a little hard for me to ever buy him as a guy with a truly awful past - he just doesn't seem to carry that darkness well.  I really like the fact that Benning is roughly his own age, and she's not glamorized at all; she's an attractive, educated middle-aged woman who's just been unlucky, until Waite comes along.  That seems reasonable, in a small frontier town.  Craig Storper's excellent screenplay (based on a novel by Lauran Paine), full of quotable yet pretty realistic dialogue like the bit I used for my title, also deserves a lot of praise.  The final shootout, greatly extended though it might seem to be, is excellently done, and the coda makes sense I guess, even if it, like much of the rest of the film, seems to be reaching for some kind of grandeur that this fairly simple story can't entirely support.<br /><br />All in all, well worth seeing for western lovers.  Perhaps it doesn't hold up to the greatest films of the past, but then with so few westerns being made today, that would be an awful big weight to lay on the shoulders of the few people like Costner still interested in the genre.  Along with Ed Harris' APPALOOSA a few years later, this ought to show that there's still some life even on some of these well-trodden trails.</p></body></html>

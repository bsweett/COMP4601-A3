Well, critics are wrong; they don't comment on the elements in the film that make it audience-worthy. It has action, and plenty of it. It has historical merit. And it boasts excellent performances from di Caprio, Hounsou & Jennifer Connelly, who should have been nominated, too (along with the strength of her performance in "Little Children"). I was riveted from the beginning, and am so glad I finally saw this film. Indeed, the brutality of man toward fellow man is unsettling, not unlike Edward Zwick's other films ("Glory" etc.). It also emphasizes how helpless we all are to do anything about it. Kudos to all involved.  An added note: I recall that Mr. Hounsou's performance was regarded as one-note and hysterical all the time; I  profoundly disagree. I thought he was centered and totally in touch with his character. And, was he really "supporting"...?He was quite fine.</p></body></html>

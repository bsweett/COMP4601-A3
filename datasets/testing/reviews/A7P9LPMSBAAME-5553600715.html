<meta name="summary" content="BRILLIANT MOVIE--BRILLIANT DIRECTOR"></head><body><p>This movie is a smart, HAUNTING (no pun intended) film done by a brilliant young director that has gone on to create great cinema. The cast, headed by Nicole Kidmam, serves up a CHILLING story that weaves a stunning tale of a household haunted by GHOSTS. This movie is REALLY SCAREY without the gratuitous blood and gore that is the normal horror faire. Two thumbs up. 5 stars. A + SPOOKEY!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark and Hopeful"></head><body><p>As "The Orphanage" came on the heels of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a> and is produced by Pan's director Guillermo del Toro, it is inevitable that comparisons will be drawn between the two movies.  "The Orphanage," however, is more straight forward horror, and has a bit of a conventional premise... until the mystery begins to unravel.  It starts as what seems to be a simple "ghosts captured my kid" story but evolves into something deeper and quite a bit darker.<br /><br />I'm not sure that the writer and director of this film get the credit they really deserve.  Screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez cooked up an intelligent horror film that delves into both dark territory and true emotion, bordering on but never crossing the line into sentimentality.  First time director Juan Antonio Bayona didn't do much to deviate from del Toro's established style and techniques, but it's probably best considering this was his first major film.  Either way, the del Toro/Bayona collaboration has made this film dark, brooding, and scary in a way that makes you scared to look in mirrors, but hopeful in a way that won't make the terror resonate with you TOO long after the film.  It could have used with losing a few minutes here and there, particularly in the scenes with and leading up to the medium, which--until a rather large revelation--sort of took attention away from the main plot.<br /><br />In the end, "The Orphanage" is a horror film the same way that "Pan's Labyrinth" is a dark fantasy film.  It breaks convention, both by being darker than you usually see and by letting the viewer see a bit of ironic hope at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />8/10</p></body></html>

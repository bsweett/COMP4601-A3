<meta name="summary" content="The New Dead"></head><body><p>The latest thing in zombie stories and movies is to have them thinking.  Stephen King, Brian Keene, and George Romero are all on board.  You can practically see the reeking dead studying their thumbs like chimpanzees who have suddenly figured it all out.  Well, that's cool.  Romero's turning however indicates the real stamp of approval.  As horror buffs know everywhere, his "Night of the Living Dead" is an enduring classic. And it's a classic for good reason, with its underlying satire of American life in the 60s. The irony of the one real hero in the movie, a black man, being gunned down by rednecks, struck a chord that rippled beyond the genre of horror.<br /><br />Romero followed up with "Dawn of the Dead", which was also pretty good.  It didn't have quite the punch of "Night", but it had a bigger budget, and the zombies attacking the local shopping mall was funny - in a way that "Night" was not.  We recognized ourselves stumbling past all the shops with glazed eyes.  Then came "Day of the Dead" which was simply bad - and boring.<br /><br />Zombies kind of went into hibernation, or retreated into all kinds of forgettable horror movies - some of them made by Disney.  They were becoming poodles.  Then came Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of "Dawn of the Dead." But Snyder did something different.  He looked underneath the zombie hood, and tweaked things, added fuel injection.  Suddenly zombies were track stars.  They could move and munch.  As good as Snyder's effort was (and it's very good), at its heart, "Dawn" is an homage to Romero.  There is nothing really new in the film as far as new satire goes.  It's still a mall, a reference point for the Dead.  One difference, is that Snyder actually went out and got some good actors to "flesh" things out a bit.<br /><br />Well, it's 2005, and Romero still has something to say through rotting zombie gums.  "Land of the Dead", because of its sharp satire, is indeed a worthy update on "Night."  Time has indeed passed.  The rich live in towers (vertical gated communities), while the little folk are serving them below as soldiers and servants - or, are zombies living in small towns, being ripped off by marauding survivors in night attacks.  Romero returns to his black man as hero, but with a twist - since he is now a zombie (Eugene Clark as "Big Daddy").  And Big Daddy is an interesting twist, in that he seems to be learning how to fight - and teaching others, the Way to fight back.  He actually cares, in that cold dead zombie brain, about his community.  Big Daddy tries to save other zombies, and he cries in rage when they are killed.  In contrast, his counterpart, Kaufman (Dennis Hopper --Romero also assembled himself a good cast for this latest installment), in his high tower overlooking his safe area, could care less about his community.  All he cares about is money and power - and a good cigar.  Romero's critique of modern America, with its widening gulf between rich and poor (what used to be middle class), couldn't be more on target.  What follows is what you pretty much expect: extreme gore, the march of the inexorable dead, some funny moments, and a strangely hopeful ending - for perhaps men and zombies?  Well, I guess we will just have to wait and see.</p></body></html>

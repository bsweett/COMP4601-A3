<meta name="summary" content="The Rock, (...)"></head><body><p>This flick is carried by the charisma of THE ROCK.  The plot, which centers around a 'recovery specialist' named Beck (THE ROCK) who is sent to the Amazon to collect the son of a mobster (SCOTT) who is on a treasure hunt, is solid at its base, but way too top heavy with silly fight scenes, hit or miss humor, and MTV style direction.  This is one of those films that doesn't take itself seriously, hence the action/adventure angle is always on either side of the goofy line between funny and exciting.  You can't help but like THE ROCK, there is something about him that captures your attention, but by the end of THE RUNDOWN, you feel slightly embarassed for him.  It will be nice after a couple more movies to see him in full-on TOTAL RECALLish action mode.  THE RUNDOWN isn't an awful film and does have a few entertaining moments, but must have looked a lot better on the printed page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A bit of a disappointment for me"></head><body><p>Well, I finally got around to watching this movie and I was kind of disappointed. Yes, I knew going in that it was deliberately cheesy, but the grainy, scratchy look got old fast, and the story line is weak and jumbled. Plus, the incessant gore got disgusting fairly quickly. Loved Rose McGowan; she's super-hot and comes across as a sharp, funny lady. Otherwise, I found the movie kind of tiring after a while. I'd give it 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-star ratings.</p></body></html>

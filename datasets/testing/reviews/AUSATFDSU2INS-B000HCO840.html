It's a comic about tolerance, rejection, prejudice, evolution, segregation, discrimination and the perennial search for acceptance.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer brilliantly accomplished to expose all the complex paradoxes, problems and personal issues the mutants were suffering because of the fear the "normal" human beings felt for them. Now, in Brett Ratner's hands, X-3 doesn't stop to examine so many moral dilemmas and jumps straight into action. His execution is more crude and superficial, but more exciting.<br /><br />Once again we find the mutants in the middle of a conflict: just when it seemed they were feeling accepted in the world, a millionaire discovers a vaccine capable of remove the X gene. Some mutants take the news with joy. Others, of course, aren't as pleased.<br /><br />On one side, Professor Xavier and his pupils try to discuss the subject in a civilized and rational way. On the other side, Magneto sees this discovery as a new threat to extinguish all mutants from the planet and convinced with this idea he decides to gather an army that will fight those who want to anihilate the mutants. A confrontation between the X Men and Magneto's army is unavoidable.<br /><br />X-3 is definitely more action-packed than its predecessors, but it also lacks the character development the first two movies carefully outlined to make us care about these people and their conflicts.<br /><br />But balancing with a sure hand the action sequences, Ratner has created a very entertaining ending to this trilogy, making risky decisions like killing main characters and overwhelming us with so many new mutants that we don't have enough time to get to know them as well as the old characters.<br /><br />A word of advice: stay until the very end of the credits. There's a small scene that will make you wonder if indeed this is the X Men last battle. I guess only time will decide that.</p></body></html>

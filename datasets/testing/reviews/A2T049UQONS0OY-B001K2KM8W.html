<meta name="summary" content="A lyric fantasy and adult fairy tale"></head><body><p>"Pan's Labyrinth" is a fantay for adults featuring the character of Greek mythology -- Pan -- that appears under its other name, Faunus, and its relationship with a young girl to whom it promises eternity if she fulfills certain fantiastic and difficult requirements. The film was made in Spain and is in Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br />Set in fascist Spain during late World War II, a girl goes with her pregnant mother to live with her new stepfather, a ruthless and vile Army captain. She meets a fairy -- a Peter Pan butterfly type fluttering around on wings of gossamer -- that takes her to the labyrinth where she meets Pan, whom the film calls faun. Pan explains to the girl the terms of her involvement and, should she fulfill these duties, she will become a princess for life. Or something like that.<br /><br />She takes steps to fulfill her duty, only to regularly run into problems with hobgoblins, bizarre creatures without eyes, lots more fairies floating around, and other distractions. Fortunately, Pan provides her with magic chalk with which she can create her own door whenever she needs to escape one of these moments.<br /><br />In the denouement she must take her new baby brother to the labyrinth and do something really bad with him. When she refues, the story peaks. In the meantime, bad guy stepdad and his army buddies have pretty much worn her down, offed her mom, and sent everyone she knows packing. It wasn't clear at the end of the film whether or not she had fulfilled her duty and achieved her salvation.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is, in my opinion, a high class chick flick. It is full of magic, fantastic scenes and creatures, events that transcend reality, and its heroes are all women and the young girl that stars. The men are almost all bad guys and stepdad is the second coming of Darth Vadar.<br /><br />This movie will interest a lot of people because of its fantastic and lyrical storyline and its marvelous effects. Parents of minor children should be warned there is a lot of violence in the film, much that is graphic in nature, making this far more an adult fairy tale than one for kids.</p></body></html>

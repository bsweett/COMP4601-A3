There was absolutely no love between the older sister and the younger brother. It didn't seem to me like she loved him at all, whereas in "Mrs. Doubtfire," she deeply cared about her siblings. But that was sorely missing in this movie. Scenes showing her care and concern for her brother should have been filmed. Also, more scenes showing Dylan with his mom (Vannessa Williams, excellent as usual) were needed. Same thing with the President's daughter and his wife. Good action, but more sentimentality was needed.</p></body></html>

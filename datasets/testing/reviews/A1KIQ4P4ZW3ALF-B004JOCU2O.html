<meta name="summary" content="Plastically Robotic"></head><body><p>Positives:<br />(1.) Nice train graphics - ahhh, the power of computational software.<br />Negatives:<br />(1.) Really bad script in which the writers must have spent their entire lives at Hollywood Senior High; adjacent pools and clubs. Obviously from the dialogue and human interactions they never had a blue collar working job or perhaps even seen one (except, maybe, the service industry).<br />(2.) Really miscast actors who must have watched old movies to figure out how to play their roles. Yes, I know what I'm talking about because I've had high school summer jobs working blue collar including a rail yard which is orders of magnitude more than either the writers or actors.<br />(3.) The personal interludes to, supposedly, develop the human character side of the story so that it's just not an action runaway train flick seemed plastically robotic and really badly artificially scripted. The acting was so artificial I thought I was watching plastic toys on display at KMart. The interpersonal conflicts were sooo Hollywood - desperate to create more emotion as nothing but a train on a track can get tediously wearisome.</p></body></html>

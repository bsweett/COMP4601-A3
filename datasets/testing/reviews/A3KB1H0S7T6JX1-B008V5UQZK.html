<meta name="summary" content="FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!"></head><body><p>Definitely an outstanding comedy and one of my personal favorites, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, brings to the screen the story of Toula Portokalos, a 30-year old Greek-American from Chicago, played superbly by Nia Vardalos.  She falls in love with Ian, (played by John Corbett-and a wonderful performance it is) and that is when their problems begin as Ian goes through the culture shock that comes with marrying into a Greek family.  All the actors, no exceptions, give it their 100% and it shows! Very well written, very well presented, the movie is without a doubt a major hit world wide!  Needless to say people here in Greece are so proud over the success of the movie!</p></body></html>

If you've never seen a film writing by Kaufman I suggest you see it, if you have you should have been first in line.  What makes this story so unique is the fact that the premise is very simple.  You have a socially isolated man and a woman who is the complete opposite and they have a connection only to be lost in the midst of their every day lives.  When Joel Barish gets his memory erased from her is how the story is told.  We see all the memories they have had together through the erasing of his memory.  Now the audience embarks and a journey of dark and symbolic images that could only come from Kaufman.  The story is so simple yet so powerful that it's very hard to explain the meaning of each image that the film evokes.  The movie is a visionary masterpiece that will evoke emotion from the audience and leave a lasting impact.<p>ACTING: This is Jim Carrey's most emotional and stunning performance.  I really hope he gets nominated for this come Oscar time, but with the movie opening so early that is highly unlikely.  Kate Winslet is fabulous as well, as a matter of fact the entire cast was sensational.  The only rotten egg here was Kirsten Dunst.  I felt that her performance was too forced, too blocky if you know what I mean.  I mean, you really got the impression that she was acting, and that shouldn't be.  An actor's performance should flow to a point where he or she is the character, and I felt Dunst was just trying too hard...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When grief takes over and justice is relative"></head><body><p>It is a film that starts with home invasion gone bad - really, really bad.  Husband is stabbed to death (but survives - Gerard Butler), wife is raped and killed and so is their little daughter.  One wonders what good can come out of such gruesome violence and how anyone surviving such event can ever regain their humanity again.  What is left to hope for, live for and plan for?<br /><br />However, when a victim of such crime is a former special forces agent trained to make tactical plans and kill wothout thinking twice, it seems that all is fair game. With nothing left to live for, plenty of money and time to plan revenge on people who took away what he loved most ofr did nto careenough to fight for justice, all participants in this story are fair game for serial killer who has lost the last connection of his humanity.<br /><br />Not a very believable scenario, but film is a thriller nevertheless.  If taken likely, it is bearable.</p></body></html>

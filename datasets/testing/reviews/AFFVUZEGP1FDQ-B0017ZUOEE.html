<meta name="summary" content="Perfectly follows the horror movie formula with a great result"></head><body><p>Excellent Spanish gothic film by first time director Juan Antonia Bayona that feels like and Edgar Allan Poe poem. Along the lines of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone (Special Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CYLJ">The Others (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> this Spanish film proves to be a great haunting movie. Creepy in all the right places. Suspense builds throughout the movie at a perfect pace; this is basically the perfect formula film. First off, the acting is phenomenal. Every single actor, especially Bel&eacute;n Rueda, delivers an exquisite performance that comes off naturally.<br /><br />The film itself is the perfect formula for a horror movie. But herein lays one of the few flaws of this film: it is too formulaic. If you have seen as many horror/suspense movies as I have, you will be able to predict what happens in this film to a T. A bit predicable to the horror fan, the movie still manages to deliver great suspenseful scenes that made pause and become absorbed in the film. There were some scenes that should have been edited out, but the film had a great pacing, building the suspense on each and every scene. The movie had great pacing and great horror moments that left you wanting to see more. The cinematography and direction are the best aspects of this movie and what gives it that great feeling of suspense throughout. The storyline itself was pretty good, but left many things unexplained. I think that many aspects were inconclusive and unfinished. Still, the film is really good and it is one to watch.</p></body></html>

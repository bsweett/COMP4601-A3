Night Shyamalan's cinematic blunder, a jigsaw puzzle with integral pieces missing from its obscure image.  As can be expected, it suffers greatly at the hands of comparison to Shyamalan's Oscar-nominated masterpiece "The Sixth Sense".  "Unbreakable" is filmed with the same swart and creepy ambience as its predecessor but hopelessly flounders from an indistinct plot and underdeveloped characters.  Where as SS genuinely bolstered interest in the supernatural and managed to include a finale with some reasonable closure, this film is severely lacking of both.  It struggles to clarify its chaotic concept and miserably fails.<p>From the get-go, "Unbreakable" is a jumbled mess.  It remains so in the fact that it bears no plausible connections to the numerous theories it proposes in its laboriously paced two-hour time frame.  It strays far from its preliminary premise and sloppily interjects a scatterbrained theory from a comic book fanatic named Elijah Price, a man who has spent nearly his entire existence in the distilled milieu of hospitals.  Elijah suffers from a rare genetic disorder, one that severely depletes his bone density - his limbs will literally shatter like glass from a misstep of any kind.  In the search for his counterpart, the long-awaited news comes to him in the form of a tragic accident.  Two railway trains collide and all save one perishes - the sole survivor is David Dunn (Willis), an assumed everyday man who is currently enduring a crumbling marriage with his wife of twelve years (Penn).  He emerges from the horrific catastrophe unscathed, leaving his doctor and his family to ponder the miraculous outcome.  Elijah is intrigued and contacts David, bringing to light his inconceivable immunity to bodily harm and insisting that there is an underlying reason for his divine existence.<p>After this assumedly concrete plot is introduced, we are led to believe by not only the trailer but also the first half-hour itself that David's incredible circumstance is an existing phenomenon that begs to be defined.  Instead, we are left in the impenetrable shadows of the movie's ethereal cinematography as the characters themselves scramble to make sense of what is going on.  Because of Shyamalan's conflicting talents as a writer and a director, the plot bends left and right with indecisiveness.  In this inconsistency, Shyamalan throws his audience to and fro and we are left with yet another surprise ending that, unlike SS, lends no ample plausibility or clarification to the rest of the film.<p>Bruce Willis applies his near-a-whisper acting technique acquired from SS to the role of David Dunn, the man who is the moniker of this very movie.  There is never any dramatic tension from this limp character until a specific point in the movie when a gun is pointed at him from the most unlikely of people.  Robin Wright-Penn is wasted in this film as Dunn's eternally exhausted wife Audrey.  Penn always appears as if she has just taken a heavy dose of Secenol, her sluggish approach to her character almost unbearable to witness.  Samuel L. Jackson seems to be the only fire to these watery performances, but even his vehement candor is kept at a bare minimum by Shyamalan's lethargic style.  When examining the performances this film begets, I warn you: be prepared for pure somnolence.<p>There is not much more to comment on this film except that it is a far cry from what we know Shyamalan is truly capable of, and avid fans of SS will be extremely disappointed by the lack of artistry and attention to detail.  "Unbreakable" is doomed from its very induction and will be broken down to the every flaw by many critics to come.</p></body></html>

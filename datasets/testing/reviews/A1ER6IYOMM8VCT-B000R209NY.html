<meta name="summary" content="HUH? DID SOMEBODY ACTUALLY LIKE THIS REMAKE????"></head><body><p>Wow! I can not believe anyone could have anything good to say about this lame movie!? I must say that being a pre-teen when the original film was released, I saw this film many times at the theater. Who could resist this adventure? The young boy is one of the heroes and we get to ooggle  Pamela Sue Martin in hot pants! In the original film when Roddy McDowell ("Ackers") and Shelly Winters ("Bel") die we feel genuinely sad. When Jack Albertson ("Manny") discovers his wife of 50 years has suffered a heart attack after saving the preacher from a horrible under water death, we feel empathy for him (Albertson). I am a big fan of the original, though I must admit it has lost some steam as I've grown older. First I want to point out I have a very nice home theater with a 10 foot screen. I watched a HD version of the new film, so it had everything going for it. The remake doesn't take any time to develop the characters, so nobody cares that their lives are in danger or if they die! There is no build up to the giant wave, so there is no tension when it capsizes the ship! I also thought the special effects were NOT all that big an upgrade, if at all!  This is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen! All the acters including the stars phoned in the performances and the action sequences did not equal the sweat inducing "swim along the rope under water" sequence of the original. A complete waste of time and money! If you are going to try to remake a movie,this is the way NOT TO DO IT!</p></body></html>

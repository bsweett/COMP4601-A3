That is quite a comment isn't it given that Speilberg is only credited as part of the Dreamworks team which produced this picture. The fact is that the man's hands are all over this one in the same way that he "directed" Poltergeist - but didn't. Speilberg has often been accused of using too much "over-sentimentality" in his films. I would semi-agree with this analysis but it doesn't show through too often which is fine - except here in this picture that is dripping and oozing sentimentality from every single frame. I am sorry but this film is tugging at heart strings from the word go and is pulling every trick in the book to try and get the emotional out of you. It reaches a point about twenty minutes into the film where you just say - "Okay, okay I get it, now please, the story, move on with that and some character development, thank you." - but Speilberg is there behind an Oscar-begging Mendes (isn't one Oscar enough??) saying "Go on boy you can do it, tug those strings, more! More! Pluck `em till they have a stroke!"<p>The fact is that this film does so much on the sentimentality front that it is not just annoying, but downright damaging to the movie and everyone who has anything to do with it. It is a misfire in direction, acting and production. How can you take a great story, a great concept, and flat out destroy it from frame to frame by seeing how much sentimentality the audience can take. Even the "Junkie sentimentality Oscar committee" are going to barf at all the cheese - and they did. They snubbed this movie because it obviously stood there before them saying - come on gimme the gold! AND IT DOES JUST THAT! How embarrassing! There is nothing worse than begging for an Oscar and boy does it beg!<p>It simply does not make any sense that no one in the studio said - "Hey, listen guys Don't you think we should tone down on the old sentimentality here for a moment because it is extremely distracting?&quot; It seems that no one even considered that this piece of cinema was about to go to mush under all the mushyness. Road to Perdition IS the undisputed champion of cheese. It sets the benchmark in cheese to which all other cheesy movies will be measured against. <p>I can not emphasize how the plot - something about a hitman and his son avenging the death of his family - is killed flat out after twenty minutes of sentimentality. Do you like the way I use the world sentimentality over and over again in this review? Doesn't all the sentimentality just burn it out? Are you tired yet of all the sentimentality? Do get the picture? It is so bad that it even KILLS Newman's fantastic performance, the astonishing cinematography and the set design. It just drowns it all in a sea of fake tears.<p>Avoid like the plague unless you are a sentimentality sponge of epic absorption properties. It goes to show that even the best in the business can still fail to understand what makes the audience tick.</p></body></html>

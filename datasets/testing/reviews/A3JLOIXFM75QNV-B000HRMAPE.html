<meta name="summary" content="Better than the 2nd, more enjoyable than the first"></head><body><p>MI:3 was a thrilling movie. I mean literally, from start to finish, it was non-stop action. It was certainly and adrenaline rush. Tom Cruise is perfect once more, as Ethan Hunt. I loved him in this. For all you Cruise Bashers, get over it. This movie did extremely well. And the USA is not the end point for film gross.<br />The acting by everyone is really good and its a fun guessing game as to who is the real bad guy. The first Mission Impossible is actually the better of the 3, in terms of plot. However, this film is certainly more entertaining and it just feels fresher. And for a M I film, I found it more believable than the first one and less confusing. And the great thing is, you really don't need to watch any of the other M I movies to understand this one. Its a great stand-alone film.</p></body></html>

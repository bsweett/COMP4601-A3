<meta name="summary" content="Dirty Harry + Archie Bunker ?"></head><body><p>Saw this one in the theater.  Clint Eastwood is a kinda older Dirty Harry persona, with a little bit of Archie Bunker in him--he is not a policeman this time.  He is actually a retired car salesman and former soldier.  The movie begins at his wife's funeral.  He stands in the church, assessing his relatives.  They are just not up to his expectations (granddaughter with piercings and belly hanging out, etc.).  Clint is definitely a character.  He tells it like it is and has a biting sarcastic way of doing it.  He saw his share of "action" as a Korean War veteran, and is not afraid to stand up to people.  He has guns, too.  Clint has a Hmong (Vietnamese) family living next to him and they become part of the story line, as they eventually become friends.  Clint also stands up to gangbangers and tries to help some neighborhood folks out.  There is also a young, baby-faced Catholic priest that pesters the heck out of Clint because Clint's wife had asked the priest to look after Clint before she went to the other side.  I cannot tell you anymore without ruining the story for you, but it is a great storyline with fine acting.  And you know Clint is one of those actors that can say more than words with just a look. It was a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />By the way, Grand Torino is a restored Ford.  I think they said 1962-- a beautiful car that Clint's character restored in the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Top 5 Films for me"></head><body><p>I love this film.  The story of William Wallace and the Scottish rebellion against the English.  The film is beautifully shot, and directed well by Gibson.  The acting is outstanding, with charisma aplenty from Gibson, and a good job by the actor portraying the foppish prince.  Along with Spartacus and the yet to be released El Cid, this is one of my favorite epics.  I would love to see an ultra special edition of this film made.  If you have recently watched Troy or Kingdom of Heaven and enjoyed those films, this one is along the same lines, only so much better.</p></body></html>

After watching Matrix Revolutions I really wished that the Wachowski<br /><br />brothers had just stopped with the first one. This is ghastly. The audience cares about Neo, Morpheus and Smith so what did we get? Morpheus being weak and unsure (and pretty out of shape. Larry Fishbourne obviously hadn't been to the gym) endless scenes with annoying side characters, and horrible cliches. Was the crusty old military man scolding and then having to rely on the plucky kid scene necessary? Were the endless scenes of the commander talking slowly to the counsel needed? And as for the slow talking did anyone notice what a bad actress Jada Pinkett Smtih is? She spends the entire movie scowling and speaking her laughable lines very slowly. While I'm on the subject of laughable was I the only one who laughed at Trinity's death scene? Considering her injuries she shouldn't have been able to talk much less give Neo a pep talk. The battle scenes went on too long and weren't original in the least. This whole thing was just a lumpy mess.</p></body></html>

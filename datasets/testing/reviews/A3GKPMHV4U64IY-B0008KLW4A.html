<meta name="summary" content="Catwoman's Catfight"></head><body><p>This time we have a slightly different Catwoman than comic book readers are familiar with.  This time, Catwoman is merely the current incarnation of a long-running historical character that goes bach through the ages.  Patience (Catwoman) gets her start when she dies.  Mystic cats resurrect her and give her her new abilities.  Patience/Catwoman then has to balance between her two personalities as she tries to find her life's path.<br /><br />This is a very feminine movie.  Our hero represents a female warrior archetype.  She must face and foil the world of men (the police and authority).  Her foe is the maker of beauty cream.  But the new beauty cream could be dangerous to all women who would use it.  All in all most of the characters and imagery are feminine in nature.  This should appeal to female audiences while the skimpy costume should keep the testosterone wielders interested as well.<br /><br />The disk comes with an interesting documentary about the many faces of Catwoman with interviews with the various women who have taken on the role as well as others involved in the television/film versions.  All in all a pretty good disk.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INTELLIGENT -  A WINNER  !!!"></head><body><p>"Proof" is one of the most intelligent movies I have ever seen.<br />It is the story of a mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins) who has developed schitzophrenia in his later years,and his Daughter(Gwenyth Paltrow) who cares for him during his ongoing illness.<br /><br />While everyone who comes in contact with him sees a crazy man, on the inside of his gifted mind he is solving a mathamatical proof that has eluded mathmaticians for years...or so we think.<br /><br />The Father dies, and<br />only the Daughter knows of his work, until she gives it to her boyfriend (Jake Gyllenhaal)as a sort of gift, as he knew her Father well, and was one of his students.<br />She later confesses that SHE wrote the proof, and we are taken through flashbacks of when her Father was alive, to see who after all wrote this groundbreaking equation.We find out in a very revealing unforgettable way, when the Father reads his out loud.<br /><br />His "proof" is nothing but a bunch of gibber-jabber that makes absolutely NO sense. -something about the months of the years and so forth.<br />After being forced by her father to read it out loud, Her heart breaks for her him, because he is so senile, and she puts HER proof in HIS drawer, and locks it, and there it stays until she retrives it and gives it to Jake Gylenhaal.<br /><br />Another drama that plays out in this movie is that the Daughter thinks she is also mentally ill like her Father, and will end up like him.<br /><br /> Hope Davis, who plays her sister also believes that her sister is crazy, too.<br />I, myself, did not believe her to be crazy at all, only a little lonely, and isolated from caring for her father, yet the worry about it plagues her.<br /><br />I have read some of the other reviews where people say this movie was so confusing. I think it made perfect sense the first viewing. The flashbacks were merely to explain the mysteries,not put there to confuse.<br /><br />This movie makes you question if there is any truth to the belief that there is a thin line between genius, and maddness.This movie is based on the pulitzer prize winning play, and is well worth renting, or better yet, adding to your collection...You WILL want to own it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="And I Never Give 1 Star Reviews!"></head><body><p>This movie bored me and my father to tears. We both love history and movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but this movie was simply weird and boring. Colin Farrel tried his best, but I think most people left the theater (and many left early) without truly appreciating what Alexander accomplished and who he was as a leader. To tell you the truth I enjoyed the three hour HIS channel documentary on Alexander more than this. Like I said in my title, I rarely ever dislike a movie enough to give it only 1 star, but this movie has earned the honor of the worst film of the year in my opinion. I had been looking forward to this film since I first heard of it over a year ago and I even ignored the 100+ negative reviews by critics online, but I still didn't like it one bit. The jerky camera during the only two battles in the film didn't help either. Way too much talking and very little action for a guy who conquered 16 countries and 90% of the known world. Save you $10.00, and don't say I didn't warn you!</p></body></html>

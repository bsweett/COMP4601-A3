<meta name="summary" content="Good premise bad execution"></head><body><p>What I hate more than a bad movie is one that had a great premise and wastes it.<br /><br />This is a simple plot.  A man, Clyde Shelton, feels that he was denied justice over the death of his wife and daughter and wants to punish those that were responsible.  But what happens is the ADA, Nick Rice, who prosecuted the case with an eye more on his win lose ratio, becomes the hero and victim of the his ambition becomes the villian.  About 10 minutes is used to set up the story but there is no transition to show or justify anything.  All of a sudden the ADA is caring and the victim becomes a psychopath.<br /><br />Beyond that there are key plot points that are simply wrong.<br /><br />It is stated that Clyde bought a number of properties in the area under his own name but transferred title to a dummy Panamanian company.  Therefore, they cannot locate them because of protections by the Panamanian government.  The first part of this is wrong.  If he bought them under his name, they can find the properties as the names of all previous owners remain attached to the properties forever.  This is a simple computer search.  Additionally, if you have the name of the Panamainian shell company, it would be listed on numerous public records including property tax records!<br /><br />Second, Nick gets a list of amounts paid by the dummy corp and then compare them to the sale prices of commercial properties.  By doing this he locates a property next to the prison that Clyde is being held.  This would be impossible.  It is obvious that the writer never purchased a piece of property!  The check you write at closing is not the purchase price of the property but a net amount, purchase price less deposit plus closing costs, etc.  It is never the exact purchase price.<br /><br />Finally, Clyde is suppose to be a genius.  Therefore, if he planted a bomb, he would have put tamper guards which would have made it impossible for them to move the bomb even a few inches let alone many miles accross town.<br /><br />These a the worst plot points.  There are just too many to list.<br /><br />Add to this a mediocre performance by Jamie Foxx and a confused performance by Gerrard Butler and you have movie that is a waste of time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not history, only epic Hollywood."></head><body><p>Critics of The Last Samurai point out its obvious historically inaccuracies, the cheap ending, the tired plot already beaten to death before its predecessor Dances with Wolves stamped on the carcass, and the negative liberal view of the white man's legacy. All of these are valid points, but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades. One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores. For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, et al, I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance.<br />Furthermore, this movie never claims to be based on facts, so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong. These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries. Somewhere in the middle lies reality.<br />The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world, in a nation, and in a man. Troubled by his own violent past, Captain Algren (Tom Cruise in his limited, grinning, wide-eyed fashion) is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876. The need for Cruise's character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself, but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience. The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography, the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own, powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast, an emotional score, and yes, the message, heavy-handed though it is.<br />Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows, be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire, Jesse James or Wyatt Earp, Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it can't bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license. Were it not morally reprehensible, they'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis....if they haven't already.<br />There aren't a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain. The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep.</p></body></html>

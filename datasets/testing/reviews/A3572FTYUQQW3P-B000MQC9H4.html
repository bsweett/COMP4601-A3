<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Chick Flick"></head><body><p>Once again I seem to tbe in the minority, because while this was a fun film, it was hardly "the best film ever".  The Jude Law character was one of the more believable characters I have seen in a long time. The film is long on Law and Diaz and short on Black and Winslet.  Also the last several films I have seen with Eli Wallach he plays a jew, when the character could have been anyone, but he makes these characters jewish -- that really isn't necessary and he seems to be turning into a professional jew..  The conversations -- especially at the beginning-- between Diaz and Law is some of the best written dialog I have heard in a long time.  The film rocks along switching between LA and England and comes to a happy if implausible end.  How these characters are going to resolve their geographical problems is left hanging in all of the happiness.<br /><br />This film is essentially sex driven and deals entirely with adult love issues, so it really isn't a family film.  The best part is there are no car chases, no explosions, no significant profanity, and there is even some character development with a (thin) plot -- all unusual characteristics in current films.  A fun film and worth renting.</p></body></html>

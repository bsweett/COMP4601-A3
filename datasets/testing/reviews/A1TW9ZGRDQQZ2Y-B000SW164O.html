While it would have been received better if it came out before Johnny Depp's thriller "Secret Window," it still remains a creepy and interesting little thriller in its own right. Robert De Niro is good here, but doesn't thread into any new territory in terms of his performance. Dakota Fanning is the standout by far (she could have said the name "Charlie" ten times less), looking like a reject from the Wednesday Addams auditions. She is creepy and those big eyes demand attention. Without such a good young actress in this important part, the film would have fallen apart from the start. Spoiler Ahead! Just to clarify last minute or so of the film. Some people I was with didn't understand the two-headed drawing at the end. It just meant that she now has the same "symptoms" her father had. Anyways, this is a good thriller that always entertains and was worth my money.</p></body></html>

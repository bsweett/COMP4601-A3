<meta name="summary" content="DREN IS DREADFUL"></head><body><p>Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play superstar geneticists with a knack for splicing DNA from diverse species to create new hybrids that can be used for pharmaceuticals.  The Brody and Polley characters are also a couple when they go home from the lab.<br /><br />When a conflict with a sponsoring company bans some of their research, they continue, but hide their work.  In fact, they take their work home with them.  Big mistake.<br />Driven by their dangerous curiosity, a fast growing mutant, humanoid-like creature, Dren, is the result of their secret experiments.  Of course things get out of hand.<br /><br />This promising film goes off the rails and loses whatever theme it set out to explore.<br /><br />Too bad, there are lots of relevant issues here that resonate with daily headlines about the morality of harvesting embryonic cells.  Also, I thought the creature was not consistent in its appearance.<br /><br />I think we were supposed to feel sympathy if not affection for Dren, but that never really came across.</p></body></html>

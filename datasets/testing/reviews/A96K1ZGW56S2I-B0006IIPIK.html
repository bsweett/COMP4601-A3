A few months later, I saw a longer trailer and thought, "This looks interesting." I decided then I would see the film when it came out. A few days before the film's opening, I discovered that other than the actors, a few props, and some costumes, SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW was completely computer generated.  The movie would be worth seeing for that achievement alone.<br /><br />However, SKY CAPTAIN is worth seeing for far more than for the by-line it will receive in cinematic history.  The movie is a complete throwback to old action/adventure serials that used to be shown before the "A" picture would start.  The INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS films were all inspired by the same pictures. SKY CAPTAIN feels like those movies (cheesy lines and all), but influences from KING KONG, THE WIZARD OF OZ, the Island of Dr. Moreau, and Flash Gordon also have a prescence.<br /><br />SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW takes place in the year 1939. Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an ace reporter for the Chronicle newspaper. She receives a cryptic message from a top scientist about a cynical plan to destory the world.  Before she can find out more, the city is attacked by a huge army of giant robots (think evil IRON GIANTS).  Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) is called into action and saves Polly from being killed and the city from being totally destroyed.  "Sky Captain" has a special base outside of the city where he and his private army work at saving the world. Anyway, neither Joe or Polly can figure out what the robots wanted. Then Joe's base comes under attack as does New York. During the fight that assumes, Joe's best friend and genius designer, Dex Dearborn (played perfectly by Giovanni Ribisi) is kidnapped by the invading army. Thus begins a chase over halfway around the world to rescue Dex and uncover what in the world is going on.  Add some mutated animals, a few dinosaurs, and a flying aircraft carrier and you've got The World of Tomorrow.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg knew that audiences loved those types of movies, that's one of the reasons STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK were such huge blockbusters.  Many people have become way to cynical in their movie watching. Some movies entertain, some educate, and the best do both.  SKY CAPTAIN isn't meant to be a film to instruct the masses and change the world. Instead, it's a huge piece of mind candy that more than satisfies. Of course, the technological wonder that the film is could change the filmmaking world, much in the same way that STAR WARS did over 25 years ago.  There were a lot of STAR WARS imitators and I'm sure there will be many SKY CAPTAIN wannabes, too.  Whatever the case, I left the theatre wanting more and actually excited at the prospect that there could possibly be a sequel. So, put the cynicism away, sit back, relax, and enjoy this wonderful world of tomorrow. It'll make you forget about today (at least for 2 hours).</p></body></html>

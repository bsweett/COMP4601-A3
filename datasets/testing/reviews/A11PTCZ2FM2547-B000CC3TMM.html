Professional "driver" and transporter Frank Martin is one awesome dude.  He can dodge bullets.  Take a jet ski over dry land (can't we all?).  Jump from one building to another in his souped-up Audi.  Even jump out a window, land on a car, and not even wrinkle the lapels of his jacket.<br /><br />And you know what?  It's darn fun to watch.  Jason Statham, as balding and as grim-faced as my accountant, reprises his role as super duper action hero Frank Martin in Louis Leterrier's TRANSPORTER 2.  After watching this sequel, it immediately and readily became apparent the makers of this film decided if they were going to make an action film, they might as well make it (the action) nonstop--and they might as well up the ante on the "Oh, wow!" scale.  And they have succeeded, as we watch brooding Frank take on a scantily-clad femme fatale (Kate Nauta is very, very wicked, you good girl), make a most curious entrance into a jet about to become airborne, and do some amazing things with a fire hose.<br /><br />Forget the plot.  (Was there even a plot?)  Alessandro Gassman is a passable villian; Matthew Modine as wimpy as usual.  Just take in the action--there's plenty of it.  TRANSPORTER 2 is a cartoon disguised as a live-action movie.  Preposterous. . .in a good way.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Heat (1995)"></head><body><p>Heat is a long yet beautifully and at the same time intricately plot mixed movie(which I don't appreciate for other movies this one YES). Michael Mann Did a Good Job unlike on The Insider and Later Miami Vice. Anyhow,De Niro And Pacino are great. (Unlike a later collabo which did not work for me) The Action is great,the vehicles,Corvette*sparsely in there*,Camaros*base models*,A Peterbilt,and other vehicles! Val Kilmer is surprisingly good,jon voigt as well, all the actors, it is a great cast and great action and story throughout the movie.One of the Best Movies out there.</p></body></html>

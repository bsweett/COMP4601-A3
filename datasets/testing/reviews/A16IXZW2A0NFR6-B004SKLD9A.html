<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film Easily Outdoes The Matrix Sequels"></head><body><p>This film is fueled with Orwellian ideas and action scenes that make Keanu Reeves weep. A very intriguing take on a totalitarian government forcing it's citizens to supress their emotions. Christian Bale is impressive in this movie as he usually is. This movie didn't get a lot of press but it is well worth a watch. This movie is a surprise gem.</p></body></html>

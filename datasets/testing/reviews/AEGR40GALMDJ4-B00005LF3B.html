The plot moves a little slow, but not to the point where you fall asleep in the theater.  Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performance, as well as Helen Hunt even though she only takes up about 30 minutes of screen time.  The movie, mostly was almpost without sound.  It was really different and I though that was really bold of Zemeckis.  Tom Hanks grew more and more insane as the movie progresses, and he makes friends with the most iconic of all sports equipment, Wilson the Volleyball.  The film was great and it really made you believe you were stranded with Tom's character, Chuck.  It is a great film all around.  See it.</p></body></html>

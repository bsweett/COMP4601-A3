<meta name="summary" content=""Don't Blow Away...""></head><body><p>A very pleasant surprise, The Holiday, is a romantic comedy that brings to the screen the parallel stories of two young women who travel to each other's countries to get over their troubles with the men in their lives only to find true love.<br /><br />The Holiday is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the MUSIC (!!!) are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Holiday is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 1/2 Stars</p></body></html>

While Spartan is, once again, not that film, it does come closer than any other Mamet movie I've seen. (Except, of course, for House of Games.)<br /><br />Laura Newton (Veronica Mars' Kristen Bell) is a Senator's daughter who has a reputation for being somewhat wild. She disappears one night, and a team of Rangers headed by Scott (Val Kilmer) are brought in to try and find her. It's a simple plot, but this is David Mamet-- there's nothing simple about the details. Double-crosses, cover-ups, spin, incompetent government officials, red herrings, white slavery rings, ex-boyfriends, lecherous professors, the smell of American tobacco carrying in the desert...<br /><br />First off, because it has to be said: what's a David Mamet film without Ricky Jay? Okay, now that I've got that off my chest, it's a technically competent film, and the acting is credible (Kilmer, whose career has become notoriously inconsistent in the past ten years or so, gives one of his good performances here. Not great-- not Wonderland, certainly-- but good.), but it feels like there's a lot missing from this movie. The shallowness of Stoddard (William H. Macy, wasted in the role) has been pointed out more than enough that I can just mention it and move on. It's synecdochic, though; it feels as if there was a lot more of Stoddard in the first couple of drafts of the script (or perhaps in the film before it went to the editing room) and we ended up just getting the edges of the character. I got that feeling with a bunch of other stuff in this movie, too. Some things (can't say what without spoilers) seemed a bit too convenient, as if pieces around them had been trimmed off by editing when they should have been left in. That sort of thing. There's no specific thing I can point to and say 'this is what caused the movie to go downhill' for me; it's a bunch of little stuff that worked, but didn't work quite as well as it should have. That said, it's certainly a credible way to kill an hour and forty-five minutes; you just may end up feeling like you've had some empty calories on your plate after you're done. ***</p></body></html>

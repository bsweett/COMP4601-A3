I, like everyone else who enjoyed the first film, have been looking forward to the return of the wickedly funny pirate captain and the swashbuckling adventures that won us over a few years ago.  Though I didn't hate this film, I have to admit I was disappointed with this second feature.  While the first was fresh and charming, this sequel seems to rely too heavily on the special effects (which are quite good, I won't deny!) and a rather weak story that left me wishing they had taken a little more time and invested in a plot that really pulled me into the movie.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is good, as usual, as Captain Jack but Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, with all their glowing beauty in tact, just don't achieve their character's charisma the second time around.  Davy Jones is an interesting villain and an amazing CGI creation but he just doesn't pack the punch of Geoffery Rush's Captain Barbossa.  Davy Jones' cronies are interesting CGI creations as well, not to mention the Kraken, that feared "beasty" with tenacles that can drag an entire ship into the murky depths.  Visually, the film is stunning and the cinematography is beautiful but pretty pictures does not a great film make!<br /><br />Thankfully, this film is a bridge to the final movie in the triology, "Pirates of the Caribbean:  At World's End".  The ending definitely leaves the door open for the beginning of the third with a very welcome surprise appearance.  With the confirmed appearance of Keith Richards as Jack's father and the faith I have in Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp, I believe we will see a better movie than this next year in May.  If you are a fan of Johnny Depp and the original film, you will still want to see this film on the big screen.  However, one trip to the theater is enough for this one.  The original I saw a couple of times on the big screen.  While Pirates has done gangbusters at the box office this weekend (an estimated 132 million, breaking all records) you would do better to see "Superman Returns" or "The Devil Wears Prada", both better movies than this one.  Recommended if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon!</p></body></html>

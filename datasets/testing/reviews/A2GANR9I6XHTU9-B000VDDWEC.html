<meta name="summary" content="It Sucked"></head><body><p>Wasnt the worst ive ever seen but it was bad. It wasnt a horribly bad movie. The begining of the film looked promising and original and kept your interest for the first hour or hour and a half but the end sucked. Started getting repetitive and boring in the last hour. Had promise but disapointed. Id definetly recomend this over the zombie movie Resident evil which was about 1 and a half stars. This is a 2.5 or 3 stars. It had cool looking zombies and an interesting plot but overall fell short and disapointed. Also on the back cover it says ( scarier than the exorcist) - THATS  a JOKE. It got old after awhile and Its nowhere near as scary as the classic horror movies. Its sci fi. Another comment on the back says ( it will haunt you for days) - ANOTHER JOKE. Id recomend this to you if you like sci fi or zombies just to see it but I wouldnt recomend it to you if you are not into that.</p></body></html>

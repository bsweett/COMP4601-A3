<meta name="summary" content="Don't Carjack Frank's car!"></head><body><p>5 of 5 stars for the Transporter 2 is the best of the three movies in this series. It continues to follow Frank Martin but with all new story and chaacters. Great action in this movie. I specially liked the opening scene with the attempted car-jackin...g of Frank's car; a bad idea. Also of note is how they saved money on the costumes for the lead bad-girl; only Victoria's Secret. This is a must see movie!</p></body></html>

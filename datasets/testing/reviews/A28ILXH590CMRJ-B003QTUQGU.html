<meta name="summary" content="Burton delivers fun, if unoriginal WONDERLAND."></head><body><p>Ever since the first film version back in 1903, Lewis Carroll's classic surrealist tale, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, has provided fodder for many a film studio.  While these films all have their charms, they do tend to be tough going for some viewers.  Part of this stems from the fact that the original story is very episodic.  The titular heroine basically jumps from meeting one weird character to the next with no real growth until she wakes up from her "dream."  The other obstacle is the fact that Alice can sometimes come across as insufferable prig!!!  In an attempt to address these problems, Tim Burton tried not to recreate the novel itself, but to fashion a sequel of sorts featuring a now 19 year old Alice.  When she gets a marriage proposal from an insipid lord at a "surprise" engagement party., she sees a very familiar White Rabbit nearby.  She escapes the party and chases the Rabbit to the usual rabbit hole and falls into a new adventure where she not only must help her old acquaintances, but discover herself as well.<br /><br />As always, Burton has a dark sensibility that actually works with the subject material and the art direction of this film is nothing short of spectacular.  This sensitivity also extends to the varied residents as well.  Danny Elfman provides a wonderfully quirky score to match the mood.  Mia Wasikowska makes for a lovely Alice.  However, it takes her about a quarter of the film before she really becomes likable. Still, she does help ground the film with an otherwise solid performance.  Johnny Depp is always interesting to watch, and his daft Mad Hatter is no exception here.  Unfortunately, his performance is not quite on a par of such more recent roles like Sweeney Todd or Capt. Jack Sparrow.  Part of that stems from the Scottish accent in his more serious moments that seems more like a gimmick than real emotion.  Ann Hathaway's spacey White Queen doesn't fare much better.  More fun is the voice work of British comedian Stephen Fry who is a delightfully suave Cheshire Cat.  Alan Rickman and Christopher Lee do solid work as the a hookah smoking caterpillar and  the Jabberwocky respectively.  However, it is Helena Bonham Carter who steals the show with her wild over-the-top turn as the wicked Red Queen.<br /><br />The film goes at a rather leisurely pace that definitely picks up as you take in the delightful visuals.  The story starts out quite promising, but it does end with a climax that is very derivative. Despite all that, there is much to recommend for this version.  Diehard Carroll fans might howl at the liberties taken with this "sequel" but this is still a film worth seeing and recommending.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than I had expected - a couple of good hours of impossible adventure"></head><body><p>Disaster flicks were in their heyday during the 1970s.  Before the days of computerized visual effects, the big disaster films at times dazzled with what seemed to be impossible visuals and generated guffaws with some very cheesy effects.  Their fans loved all of it because they never took themselves seriously and it was more like a ride at an amusement park than anything like real life.  Even being scared was about having fun.<br /><br />This remake of the original "Poseidon Adventure" is much more serious in its intent.  Of course, the computer graphics make the images seem incredibly real and that does draw us in.  We think we feel the heat from the fires, the chill of the water, the panic of being trapped in the vents, our lungs burn for air as we swim underwater with the characters in the movie.<br /><br />We don't get the same characters that were in the first movie.  I won't discuss how the roles map or don't map onto each other, but I will say that in making all this more real, the director and writers made the people less distinguishable from each other.  Sometimes it is hard to tell who it is that is crying or screaming or whatever.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is terrific as Robert Ramsey, former fireman, former mayor of New York.  I think he is a widower, because he has no wife, but I don't remember that being explained amid all the noise.  He is on a cruise with his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and her boyfriend / fianc&eacute;e, Christian (Mike Vogel).  As always, there is tension between the father and daughter and the potential son-in-law (at the beginning of the film, the dad doesn't know how far along their intentions to get married are).<br /><br />Josh Lucas plays the mysterious Dylan Johns.  Since learning about this guys is a very interesting part of the movie, I don't want to discuss the character or what he does.  However, I do want to say that I loved seeing Andre Braugher on screen as Captain Bradford.  He plays the role with just the right amount of authority that an officer needs to lead people, especially in an incredible disaster.  Braugher also plays Bradford with enough humanity to endear him to us.<br /><br />The rest of the cast I will leave you to discover.  While they aren't as vividly drawn as they are in the first film, they are more compatible with the apparent desire to make such an impossible system seem more "real".<br /><br />While the comments I heard when the movie came out indicated to me that the film wasn't worth seeing, I think it more worthwhile than I had thought.  However, you have to take it for what it is.  It isn't "serious" (and who needs that all the time), and it isn't "real", but it is a good couple of hours of adventure.</p></body></html>

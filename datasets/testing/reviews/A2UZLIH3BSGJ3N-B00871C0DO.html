<meta name="summary" content="An American Werewolf Tears up the UK"></head><body><p>This is my second favorite werewolf film ever made.Actually,its such a close tie between this film&The Howling...it is virtually impossible to choose between the two.This film has just the right ammont of folklore,gore&scares to satisfy anyone,plus it's own added touch of dark comedy.There are a number of good funny bits in it,like waking up in the London zoo naked&stealing a little boy's ballons to make his run for it,or having coversations with his dead,rotting friend in a [...] theater.The special effects are legendary,and nothing out there between this film&The Howling have come close in recent years to my recollection.With the onslaught of cgi effects taking over in the last 10 or so,I'm hoping&waiting someone out there will resort to "the old school" and make something else as memorible as this film.This is a great movie,and if you have never seen it...you won't believe your eyes.This one is a classic,and well worth every penny.</p></body></html>

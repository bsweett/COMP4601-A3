I know of no film that stayed ENTIRELY faithful to any book! This "adaptation" was as good or better than the two films that preceded it.<br />To rank them based on their merit and entertainment value:<br /><br />1) "I Am Legend"<br />2) "The Last Man on Earth"<br />3) "The Omega Man"<br /><br />For many years, "The Last Man on Earth" was the best adaptation seen until "I Am Legend" was released ("The Omega Man" was a pale shadow compared to it's contemporaries).<br />The film is well defended. We still have a world very nearly devoid of human beings, the army of Hemocytes and all the trappings of a fortress that our protagonist Robert Neville, maintains to continue his research to find a cure.<br />The Hemocytes were effective, as there is a method to their madness. These aren't mindless zombies. They possess the intelligence to set traps. This leaves Neville with the unenviable task of second-guessing them just to stay alive (he is not entirely successful).<br /><br />WARNING!!SPOILER ALERT!!!  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X<br /><br />Neville's penchant for talking to his dog Sam, is particularly convincing, and sad. There are many of us who do this (myself included), which makes the loss of Sam heartfelt.<br />When Anna and Ethan arrive, Neville displays some strange behavior, as if he does not believe it is possible that others survived (kind of like pinching one's self to make sure it isn't a dream). Neville's argument about the plague being manmade, rather than an "act of God", bespeaks a man that has carried a mountain of guilt on his shoulders for his part in the disaster.<br /><br />X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X<br /><br />"I Am Legend" doesn't introduce anything new beyond the two previous films, but the use of CGI (which is not entirely great) makes the action introduced in the film effective. Will Smith does an EXCELLENT job. He's no Vincent Price, but he IS action-friendly, which makes the film that much more entertaining!<br /><br />There are some interesting special features: Four animated comics related to the film, and DVD-ROM features on the film, and a history on viral infections.<br /><br />A rock-solid five stars for an entertaining version of a classic novel.</p></body></html>

Every curmudgeon was once an adventurous and wide eyed child but as life takes you on its unpredictable path, you can lose sight of that and forget. Up is an adventure story of the best kind. A disillusioned old man realizes that true joy, the stuff of life, isn't about the destination but lies in meaningful companionship while on the journey. The movie has serious undertones but young Russell keeps things lively. His youthful enthusiasm initially annoys the old man who is set on reaching his life long destination spot at Paradise Falls. At the outset of their unplanned adventure together, the old man is grouchy, impatient, and sees the kid as a nuisance. Later, in the true spirit of adventure, the old man discovers that he and Russell have something in common, they need each other.</p></body></html>

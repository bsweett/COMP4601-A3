In fact, I'm not even going to tell you that it's a good &quot;caper comedy&quot; like the professional review at the top of the page does. I don't even know where that comes from. Granted, the movie has some funny lines, but it's no comedy.<p>What I AM going to tell you is that this is a good movie if you want a fast-paced action flick. It has clever heists, some amusing dialogue, a couple of great chase sequences, some very pituresque locales (the first part of the film was shot in Europe), and the players all give very solid performances. As another reviewer noted, this is a great popcorn flick.<p>Was THE ITALIAN JOB the most memorable movie of 2003? No, but the buzz surrounding it was pretty positive. That got me to go see it when it was in the theaters and I wasn't disappointed. I liked it well enough to get it when it came out on DVD. I think most other people will like it, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amadeus"></head><body><p>Amadeus was Mozart's middle name. It means "loved by God." The film studies the contrast between Mozart's genius and Salieri's mediocrity. It is really about Mozart's rival with Pinto from "Animal House" in a supporting role. Late in life, Salieri confesses to having poisoned Mozart. Scholars generally agree that Mozart died from Rheumatic fever, Another conspiracy theory debunked! Amadeus won 8 Academy Awards. Saul Zaentz is the producer, the guy who clashed with John Fogerty over rights to the songs Fogerty wrote for CCR. Zaentz headed Fantasy Records.</p></body></html>

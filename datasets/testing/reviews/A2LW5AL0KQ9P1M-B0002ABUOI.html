<meta name="summary" content="Romero Please Forgive Me!!"></head><body><p>As an academic, I'm supposed to tell you how Snyder destroyed Romero's original message about consumerism. And I'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film: when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall, Stephen replies, "Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives." Synder's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks "punch."<br /><br />But, SERIOUSLY, who cares?!! The fact of the matter is . . . I love this film! The casting was FANTASTIC!! Rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth (he portrays a stoic police officer who's brother is trapped on an infected military-base). This man is a LEGEND!! Likewise Polly and Weber add "soul" to this film about the "souless" (their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage. . . and, yes, it sounds cheesy, but it is low-key, well-done). Furthermore, Burrell's character is wonderfully unlikeable (though it is the "Apocalypse," he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege! You actually find yourself HOPING that this guy will die!!) Finally, Kelly's portrayal of CJ is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great "fifth-act conversion"!!<br /><br />What REALLY engaged me in this film was the cinematography. While a film need not have a huge budget to be a success, this film proves that it doesn't hurt either!! The film quality is top-notch!! The helicopter shots are GORGEOUS!! And the use of color is exquisite. If you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film, this is it!!<br /><br />The conclusion is disheartening (without revealing too much information). It marks a new trend in horror. Now, the "real" conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director's hesitance (and, no, it's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits). It is radically different from the 1978 ending. Some people love it . . . some hate it. (We have also seen this "problem" with Boyle's "28 Days Later" . . . in America we received the "happy" ending and weeks later, the "unhappy" ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves!!)<br /><br />Hey, even if you don't dig close-examination of film (not everyone does!!) and just want a great action movie . . . this is it!! It will not disappoint!!!</p></body></html>

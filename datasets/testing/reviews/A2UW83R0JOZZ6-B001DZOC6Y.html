For a man who insists on writing, producing and directing his own movies, he's digging an early grave for his career as a filmmaker and "The Happening" has breached the six-foot mark for his burial.  Sporting a lousy script and lousy performances to boot, Shyamalan's much talked-about first R-rated film is a travesty of filmmaking that deserves no better than a 30% rating.  If it were a tomato, it'd be pretty darn rotten.<br /><br />The film begins in the early morning hours in Central Park.  People are milling about, casually strolling, going about their business.  Two young women sit on a bench chit-chatting when one of them hears a shrill scream and turns her head in the direction of the sound.  What she begins to see after a moderate breeze blows through are people suddenly frozen in their tracks, still as statues, an act that mirrors that of a real-life coordinated event once performed in NY's own Grand Central Station (and I have to wonder whether the film was somehow conceived from that).  As she turns to her friend Claire to tell her what she sees, her friend begins mumbling incoherently and slowly removes the hairpick from her tightly wound chignon, deliberately stabbing herself in the neck.<br /><br />From there, we are taken to a construction site three blocks away at 8:39 am, only six minutes into the future from the strange occurrence at Central Park.  A body drops from a fatal height and several foremen rush to his aid, only to witness several more men fall to their death.  We are then scooted along to a small high school in Pennsylvania where science teacher Elliott Moore (Wahlberg) is giving an animated lecture at 9:45 am.  He is suddenly pulled aside by the school principal and taken to a room where the entire faculty hears of the strange events in New York.  The American media assumes at first it is some sort of biochemical terrorist attack, due to the fact that only major cities are being targeted while small towns remain safe.  This theory is quickly busted when small towns suddenly fall prey, the safe zones growing smaller and smaller as Elliott, his wife Alma (Deschanel) and fellow teacher and close friend Julian (Leguizamo) try to find a haven from this unseen and presumably unstoppable force.<br /><br />"The Happening" glows with promise in its first ten minutes but withers quickly after, leading its audience into a deep dark abyss of disappointment.  At a tight 1 hour and 30 minutes, the film is still agonizingly long, what with its laughable scientific theories and hackneyed performances.  Wahlberg and Deschanel embarrass themselves time and time again, but I have to wonder whether it's really their fault.  Is it due to Shyamalan's joke of a screenplay or his poor direction?  These actors are better than this and their other films are proof of it.  Leguizamo is the only semblance of a saving grace, making the most with what little he's got.  The rest of the cast come and go, largely unknown and largely insignificant still.<br /><br />Bottom line: There isn't much more to say about "The Happening" except that it ain't happening, if you get my drift.  Feel free to watch it and formulate your own opinion if you wish, but don't say you haven't been warned.</p></body></html>

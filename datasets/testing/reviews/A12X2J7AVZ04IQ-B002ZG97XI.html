I was only occasionally amused, but I wanted more, especially from John Cusack, whom I've admired over the years; his manic breakout role in The Sure Thing, a sweet role in Say Anything, and a great performance in Grace is Gone...I was thinking he could do no wrong. Well, I guess I just don't know what he was thinking here... Rob Corddry was amusing, as was geeky Clark Dane as the only smart one in the group. This is not Mr Pink's best film, nor would I buy it for future viewings. Back to the Future is too brilliant a film to attempt to copy. What were they thinking?</p></body></html>

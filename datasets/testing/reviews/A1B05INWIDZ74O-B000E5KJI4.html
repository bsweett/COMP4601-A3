<meta name="summary" content="Exciting movie to watch...."></head><body><p>Troy is a movie worth watching. Eric Bana does a great job on playing Hector, Prince of Troy. Hector is showed as a kind and decent man that loves his family and country. And with his performance, you will believe it. Peter O'Toole was a natural choice for playing Priam, King of Troy. The movie is centered around Achilles, Brad pits character. And he plays him well for the way the movie is written. He is shown as a self-centered man that fights for his own reasons, and does not care for the fate of Greace or their kings. What is important to Achilles, is that his name go down in history as great.<br /><br />Pitt obviously did a lot of work to get in shape and learn the great choreography of the fights. Achilles fight scene with Hector is the real star of this movie. It is a very exciting fight, starting with his moving stride across the sand as he starts the attack. Pitt does makes us feel that Achillies is the greatest warrior on that battlefield.<br /><br />Priam had negotiated a peace between Troy and Sparta's King Menelaus, played by Brendan Gleeson. But this peace is broken when Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, convinces Helen, played by Diane Kruger, to run away with him to Troy. The movie shows that Priam and Hector know that what Paris did was wrong, and yet they will risk the safety of Troy to keep Helen.<br /><br />Seeing the large Greek army array itself before Troy is impressive. And the large battle scenes are exciting. Espcially when they try to show some of the manuevers in close ups. The rest seems to just be computer animation for the large scenes. Extras must cost too mch no a days. But still fun to watch.<br /><br />The film is not true to the epic poem. But then, what movie is true to the written medium. You can not show all the true dynamics of the poem. After all the war lasted ten years. And the fact tha tthe real reason for the Greek alliance was not political as the movie shows, but it was rather a part of an oath sworn by all the princes who were suitors for Helen. And the film does take liberty not only with when certin people died during the war, like Achilles himself, but as to who even actually died. Forgetting all that, I loved this move for entertainment, but not as a history lesson.</p></body></html>

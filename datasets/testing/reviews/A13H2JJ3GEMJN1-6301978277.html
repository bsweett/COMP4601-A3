<meta name="summary" content="Classic Comedy"></head><body><p>SOME LIKE IT HOT has been called the greatest comedy movie of all time. That's a pretty big niche to fill and, let's face it, individual opinions will vary. I have several personal favorites. THE GREAT RACE, ARSENIC AND OLD LACE, HARVEY, TOOTSIE, IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD and A SHOT IN THE DARK come to mind, and I could name some others. Nor do I try to rank them in any particular order. I love them all, and this one sits right up there with them all on my shelf.<p>Individual favorites aside, this film is just very funny. Curtis and Lemmon are wonderful together as two down-on-their-luck musicians who find themselves at the wrong place at the wrong time and, disguised as women, join an all-girl band to get out of Chicago. Could these guys pull off such a stunt in real life? Probably not, but that doesn't make the situation any less humorous. Hysterical scenes and great lines abound. Monroe brings just the right amount of coquettishness and vulnerability to provide a center of gravity for all the madcap antics going on around her. At just over two hours in length, it's somewhat longer than your average comedy, but there's no reason for that to be a problem with a movie as entertaining as this one. <p>SOME LIKE IT HOT isn't my all-time favorite comedy, but it's a genuine classic and one I'm happy to have in my collection. In addition, this DVD has some nice extras, including a 30 minute interview with Curtis, the movie's only surviving star. The one drawback is that the movie was filmed in black-and-white, but for anyone who likes classic comedies, this is one DVD you want to have.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Psychology Rather Than Politics"></head><body><p>I was quite disappointed in Oliver Stone's "W."<br /><br />He does a terrific job of portraying George W. Bush as a psychological basket-case.<br /><br />And this is fine.  W. was and is a personality of feeble intellect and stunted, 7-year-old emotions.<br /><br />But that's all Stone does.<br /><br />He leaves it at that.<br /><br />Imagine if a movie were made about Hitler or Stalin and only covered their psychological problems.  No doubt they had them.  But the only reason people would care is the enormity of their crimes.<br /><br />Same here.<br /><br />SOME time should have been devoted to W's idiotic, murderous, neglectful, help-the-rich and kick-the-poor policies.<br /><br />On the other hand, Thandie Newton is terrific as Condoleeza Rice; and Richard Dreyfus is superb as Cheney.</p></body></html>

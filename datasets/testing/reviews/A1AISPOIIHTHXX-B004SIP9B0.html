<meta name="summary" content="Great performances, okay movie"></head><body><p>Sometimes it's hard to watch a movie that receives large amounts of praise. You always feel like your less-than-enthusiastic view of the film will have people proclaiming that you "didn't get it and missed the point". In the case of the Queen, I felt like it centered on an intriguing time, it had excellent performances yet at the same time, I felt it did have some issues that kept bugging me and while I will recommend the film, it just has too many aspects to it that dragged it down.<br /><br />It's the end of August 1997 and new Prime Minister Tony Blair, a kind of modernizer who wants to change some of Britain's established rules, is a kind of fish out of water when it comes to etiquette around Queen Elizabeth II. However tragedy strikes when Diana, Princess of Wales, is killed in a car crash in Paris. The country and the world mourns while the Royal Family remains in their palace without so much as public appearances or issuing statements, preferring to keep it a private matter and not sensationalizing it. The British tabloids have other ideas as they deem it insensitive and stoic so Blair tries to convince the Queen to at least do something in the public before they decide the monarchy is unneeded.<br /><br />After watching the Queen, 2 things struck me: 1) the huge scrutiny that happens in the British Press and their brutal stories that make the paper and 2) everyone acted really well but the film just didn't sit well with me. Helen Mirren is of course fabulous as the Queen and balances that line between going over-the-top primadonna and unemotional mannequin. When she finally breaks down, she's facing away from the camera as if to say even we aren't allowed to see even an actress playing the Queen cry on-screen. Another highlight was Michael Sheen, playing Tony Blair, who infuses him with a kind of real-world sensability since he's obviously clueless about mannerisms around royalty. Of course the big question is did he really want the Queen to look more favorably to the public or use it as a kind of publicity factory. Who knows. The only one I felt didn't click with me was Prince Charles, Diana's ex. He almost feels opportunistic, like he tries to make things look better in his favor. Maybe it was just me.<br /><br />The other flaw I felt it had was a sense of a pacing and repetitive tone. Of course it's a character study but in films, there's usually things characters do to bide time and make the scenes feel intriguing. Here, characters just...talk, and not the kind of meaningful talk it should've had. And after awhile you start to notice characters kind of repeat themselves too much in scenes. The Queen tries her hardest to be sympathetic without giving in to changing values, Blair is concerned at the lack of statements from the monarch while Queen's husband expresses non-supportive news in regards to Diana, her attention and what the public wants. After awhile it feels what a friend calls egg-like: whether it's sunny-side up or scrambled or over-easy, it's still egg in the end. Weird analogy I know.<br /><br />So is it worth a watch? Well many people will enjoy it but for me, I felt it was a well-made but kind of flawed film. Commence "you didn't get it" remarks.</p></body></html>

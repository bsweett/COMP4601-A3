Still, for a low-budget sequel, it is an interesting and entertaining film, an unusual mix of action, drama, comedy, and horror that actually functions on two levels: One, it is a stomach-churning study of the depths to which people will sink in order to ensure their survival; and two, it is a dark satire that takes several pokes at Western consumerism.<p>The plot of DAWN OF THE DEAD builds on the premise of its predecessor.  The world is now becoming overrun with the flesh-eating zombies, and in the United States, martial law has been declared and all survivors are required to go to state-run &quot;rescue stations&quot; for shelter and protection.  The manager of a TV station and her helicopter-pilot boyfriend decide to defy authorities and seek out their own save haven, and two police officers--friends of the helicopter pilot--decide to abandon their duties and go along with the couple.  The group eventually arrives at an abandoned shopping mall, and when they realize that the stores within contain all they need to survive--food, clothing, and weapons &amp; ammunition--they seal off the building, dispose of most of the zombies inside, and take up residence.  But when their claim on the mall and its goods is challenged by a band of motorcycle-riding marauders, the quartet is soon fighting for survival against not only the zombies, but also against their own kind.<p>Although the audience has been made to sympathize with the film's four protagonists, there is no true heroism in this world of Romero's making.  Instead, there are only different levels of self-interest and narcissism.  After the four move into their new home and start living off the &quot;fat of the mall,&quot; they quickly develop a sort of bourgeois attitude towards the comforts they now enjoy.  Of course, that is exactly the Western attitude that Romero is ridiculing--that sense of security and satisfaction one feels after amassing material goods.  And when the group's right to possession is violently challenged by outsiders, Romero clearly demonstrates just how tenuous a security based on personal possessions really is.<p>Romero is a master storyteller who knows how to manipulate the emotions of his audience.  In this film, he creates a relentless sense of unease by juxtaposing the repulsive and grotesque with the lighthearted and humorous.  For example, when the quartet of protagonists first occupies the mall, they turn on the mall-wide Muzak system to mask from the zombies the noises they make while looting the stores.  So for several scenes there is this macabre contrast between bloody, pasty-faced zombies and syrupy instrumental music.  Uncomfortably comical and humorously disturbing.<p>Creepy, bloody (FX by Tom Savini), boisterous, and constantly full of surprises, DAWN OF THE DEAD is easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies ever made.  True, it does have an underlying anti-materialism message that is none too subtle, but that doesn't detract in the least from the enjoyment of being playfully spooked and repulsed by all the zombie grotesquerie.  All in all, horror fans will have a good time watching this minor Romero masterpiece.<p>The Divimax Edition DVD from Anchor Bay offers an excellent digital transfer of the U.S. theatrical cut (often considered superior even to the director's cut), and there are lots of cool extras, too, not the least of which is a feature commentary with writer/director Romero and FX man Savini.  A worthy addition to the film collections of serious horror fans, and well worth amazon.com's very reasonable asking price.</p></body></html>

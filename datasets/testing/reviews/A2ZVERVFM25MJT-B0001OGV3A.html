Despite that sounded clich&eacute;d, it's very true were 'Crouching Tiger' is concerned.  Ang Lee revolutinises the martial arts film by making it accessible to a much wider audience.  He does this through making the plot similar to that of a thousand films these days - the feminist standpoint, love through the social classes etc.  Conventional this may be, but it's entirely absorbing and you will find yourself mesmerised by the entire spectacle of it.  The tale of love never fufilled is gorgeously played by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh (who proves that she's much more than a Bond girl).  Also impressive is the stunning photography of empty deserts, solitary mountains and lush forests.  Obviously stand-out though are the fight scenes, which are choreogrpahed by the same guy as in 'The Matrix', and it shows.  Especially impressive are the fight scenes between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh and the fight in the treetops.  Yet what is most memorable about this is the fact that it is, quite simply, cinema at its very best.  It goes all out and it delivers in style.</p></body></html>

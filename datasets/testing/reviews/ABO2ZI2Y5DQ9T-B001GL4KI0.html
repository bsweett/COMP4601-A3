<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing Sci-fi Actioner from the Director of  'Equilibrium'"></head><body><p>OK, two stars. Sorry about that if you like this film, but I cannot tell you a lie. Before you dislike my review, let me tell you that I really loved Kurt Wimmer's first film as directo `Equilibrium' and its gun-kata actions. "Silly" some say. Or "Childish." Yes, I know, but I also know that it's great fun. And Christian Bale's gun actions are sensational.<br /><br />But I should be talking about 'Ultraviolet.' Well, `Ultraviolet' starts promisingly. Shot with Sony's high definition camera, the digital touch of the opening sequences perfectly matches the futuristic city and its apocalyptic story about the battle between the two kinds of humans. The first 20 minutes are very good with gadgets and fighting, Sure, many of them look rather ridiculous like gravity-defying motorcycle, but I like the idea precisely because it is ridiculous. And the opening title sequences with the clever use of comic book are brilliant.<br /><br />Then after the secrets about the `secret weapon' are revealed, the film suddenly loses its power. Occasionally the film shows actions, but they at best are mildly interesting. The reason is simple: weakly written characters and inept editing that killed any momentum of the gun/martial actions. The action choreography needs more stylish touch, or at least some originality.<br /><br />Now, let me give you advice. If you have not seen `Equilibrium,' go and get it. Then after watching it, compare it with `Ultraviolet.' You get similar dark, futuristic world, gun actions, and super-cool hero/heroine, but which is really cool? Which editing is superior? And most importantly, which action is more exciting to see? I give you a hint: Christian Bale.<br /><br />Yes, 'Equilibrium' stars Christian Bale who as you know went on to become the Batman. Christopher Nolan's `Batman Begins' proves one thing and that is, to make a good action film, you need an actor who can act, or infuse life into the character s/he plays. `Ultraviolet' has Milla Jovovich who was terrific elsewhere (like Leeloo in `The Fifth Element'), but here she is far from her best. Her character in the Besson film was never boring a single moment while her Violet and her emoting sound completely hollow in `Ultraviolet.'<br /><br />Kurt Wimmer's `Ultraviolet' is a huge disappointment after watching his much better work `Equilibrium.' Familiar phrase is `Rent before you buy it" but in this case perhaps you should rent his debut film before this one. Not perfect fiasco, but still letdown.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The story of the unlikeliest heavyweight champion of them all"></head><body><p>I knew why they made a movie about Jim Braddock, which means I knew what was going to happen in "Cinderella Man," not only in terms of the big fight but also most of what was going to appear on the title cards at the end.  However, people who did not know anything about Jim Braddock or were not aware that this was one of those movies based on a true story could guess what the final outcome was going to be.  After all, Rocky only tried the idea that winning could be defined as going the distance as opposed to actually winning a fight once.  Did you really think Seabiscuit was going to lose to War Admiral?<br /><br />Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a successful light-heavyweight boxer who lost a titlle fight and then broke his right hand a couple of times.  He started losing more often than he won and quit boxing to work as a longshoreman.  During the Depression he ended up on relief trying to keep his family together and then got a fluke chance for a fight in which he was to be a sacrificial lamb to a top heavyweight contender.  That is where the Cinderella part of the story comes into play, ending up with a title fight with the heavyweight champion, Max Baer (Craig Bierko).<br /><br />The true story of a long shot getting a title fight is pretty compelling to begin with, but the screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth ("Too Good to Be True") and Akiva Goldsman ("A Beautiful Mind") goes out of its way to up the ante by turning Baer into a man-killer.  While the story is faithful to Braddock's character and makes it central to the story, it takes the fact that a fighter once died after being hit by Baer and makes it a major character and plot point.  Baer is a smiling brute who is perfectly willing to hit below the belt when he is not separating his opponent's brain from its connecting tissue, and everybody buys into the idea that Baer could kill Braddock in the ring to the point that Braddock's wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger) is convinced that is exactly what is going to happen.  Baer's line that "People die in fairy tales all the time," is a good one, but this all overdramatizes what is already a dramatic situation.<br /><br />Fortunately "Cinderella Man" saves most of its best moments for when Braddock is in the ring.  For me the choice moment is in the Art Lasky fight, when Braddock gets tagged so hard his mouthpiece goes flying across the ring and he is staggered.  On the verge of going down his mind flashes on images of how far down he has been.  When your wife ships your kids off to live with relatives because there is no longer any power in the house, what is a kick in the head?  Braddock turns to Lasky and smiles a him-and you know this fight is over right then and there.<br /><br />Where director Ron Howard triumphs in "Cinderella Man" in not in comparison to the "Rocky" movies or even "Seabiscuit," because he is taking aim at the Holy Grail of boxing movies, "Raging Bull."  Obviously Jim Braddock's character is pretty much the opposite of Jake LaMotta, but this is not about that or about comparing Russell Crowe to Robert De Niro.  Instead it is about Howard going up against Martin Scorcese in terms of the boxing sequences, and while I could talk about specific cinematic elements (e.g., use of flashbulbs and flashbulb effects), what I thought was most impressive was the sense of the strategic ebb and flow of the fights.  In Braddock's corner is Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), and any boxing neophyte is going to be able to understand the instructions he gives his fighter.  I do not know if these are the longest fight scenes in movie history, but they certainly seem like the most comprehensive.  We always have a sense for what is happening in each fight, and there are bonus points for Thomas Newman's understated scoring of the fights.</p></body></html>

The acting, story, directing, and music were pretty good as well. All in all I would stack it up against "Spawn" and say it is better. And it is a close run to Daredevil's level. No it isn't quite the caliber of Spiderman or Blade, but still a very good movie worth seeing. If you are not sure about buying it then rent it first. I bought a copy on a hunch that there was more to it than the ads I saw. I was right. Ron Perlman does a fine job of portraying the comic book hero Hellboy. Ron played the beast in "Beauty and the Beast" TV series and as a hunchback in the movie "The Rose". He is no stranger to playing in unusual and demanding roles. This is pretty much a film for most the family. Certainly not suited for children less than eight years old. Some scenes with blood but not nearly as gory as Spawn or some others.</p></body></html>

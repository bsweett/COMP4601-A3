<meta name="summary" content="Impressive and gripping--3.8 stars rounds to 4."></head><body><p>The producers of this film decided to change the villains from Islamic extremists to neo-nazis (after all, Nazis don't have a lobby--everyone hates them).  The producers have to be hating life post-911 since in my opinion at least this greatly detracted from the relevance of the film.  Serves them right for listening to Political Correctness rather than reality.<p>The movie is based, of course, on Tom Clancy's novel "The Sum of All Fears" and deals with the detonation by terrorists of an atomic bomb on American soil. To that extent, the movie follows the novel.  But the movie alters the villains ..., and apparently decided to cast the hero, Jack Ryan, as a much younger man evidently to enable Ben Affleck to play the part.  Afleck is OK as Jack Ryan, but only OK.  Morgan Freeman does his customary great job in the role as the CIA director, and his mentoring of Ryan is my favorite part of the movie. The chemistry between Freeman and Affleck is good, which helps to make up for, well, Affleck. The rest of the cast turns in pretty decent performances.<p>Since in the movie Ryan is a junior analyst rather than Deputy CIA Director (to enable Affleck to play Ryan) the part where Ryan prevents world war 3 is less plausible.  Readers of the book will know what I mean--spoiler omitted here.<p>Overall, the movie moves along pretty well, and tells a complicated story about as coherently as possible in the movie medium.  There is plenty of drama and action.  The special effects are good.  <p>This is not a great movie, but it is a good one.  The DVD audio and video are very good.</p></body></html>

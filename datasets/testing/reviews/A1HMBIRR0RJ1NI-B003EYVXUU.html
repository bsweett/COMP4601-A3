It is about how two misfits find each other. Owen, (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is terrorized by bullies at school, & fantasizes about revenge by playing out his fears when he is alone. His parents are divorced, & Owen just seems to not fit in anywhere, at school or at home. The other, Abby. Abby has just moved in next door, with who Owen at first thinks is her father, Richard Jenkins (who's role is called, "the Father"), who actually is not Abby's father at all, but day time protector & provider of food, namely, blood, for Abby is a Vampire. She needs someone to watch over her during the day & to go out hunting for her at night, though you'll see later in the film, that Abby is perfectly capable of hunting down her own food. So the film starts.<br /><br />"Let Me In" is a tragic horror film, the tragedy of loneliness, the tragedy of being stuck with who you are & what you are, of not fitting in. For Owen, it's loneliness, being weak, being an outcast. For Abby, it's being a Vampire & knowing she'll never stop being one. Abby will continue to live on, while one human companion after another takes care of her needs. It is the tragedy of knowing that the one person she selects as her companion will eventually die, & before he does, she'll have to find another to replace him. For her companion, it is knowing someday all this will happen, & when it does, the pain of desertion, replacement, the pain of knowing it is over. Both film's orchestrate these themes well, but I feel the remake does a better job of it. The acting, directing & editing seems to be quite a bit stronger, & the cast is perfect, but at the same time, the original film is dubbed, & that can contribute to how well a film seems acted & translates it's story to a foreign audience. In this case, the American version seems more intimate, tragic,  just by facial expressions & body language alone. This is especially evident in "the Father" character. Richard Jenkins exudes tragedy in just about every scene he is in. His eyes speak a million atrocious tragedies that he has committed. His eyes speak a great sadness in knowing his time is about over. His, is a greatly improved role & performance over the original. Same has to be said about Owen's part, Kodi Smit McPhee was born for this role. His eyes speak great sadness, but also, great fear, the fear of the world. His counterpart, "Oscar," in the original film, shows much anger, but his role & performance is nowhere as deep, as sad, as multi-dimensional as Owens. Chloe Grace Moretz, as Abby, brings more tragedy & sadness to her role than her counterpart, "Eli," in the original. This can especially be witnessed in scenes with "the Father," especially the hospital scene. Both movies had the same scene, but the American version just takes it so much deeper. You can feel their pain, you can see their pain. In the original, it seemed just like a repeated scenario for Ali. There was a little sadness, but then it was all over in a blink of an eye, without much remorse, not so with the emotional punch of the remake.<br /><br />Both films are horror films, but here, the American version has the edge again. When Abby hunts her prey, she is absolutely feral, she looks the part, due to superior make up. She moves like the part, due to superior special effects. She is the part, as she ravenously feeds on her victims. One thing though that is missing in the remake, is the more overtly sexual relationship between Ali & Oscar, where it is only hinted at in the remake, the original is fairly frank about it, especially in the scene that Ali puts on Oscar's mother's dress, & he peers in to the room, there is a quick flash of frontal nudity. There is also a scene with a long kiss between the two.  Europe has a more worldly view on sexuality between children, where America does not blink an eye seeing a child frenetically feeding off her victims, but would be uncomfortable viewing a long kiss, let alone, nudity, between the two child actors.<br /><br />Another very important part of these movies are the bullies of both Owen & Oscar. The original film bullies were just weak, as compared to the brutal masochistic nature of the American film. There is a scene where both Owen & Oscar get whipped with what looks like a metal radio antenna. In the Norwegian film, as Oscar gets whipped, it looks more like love taps when compared to the American film, as Owen gets flogged, brutally flogged, you can feel every lash of the antenna. Another is where Owen gets whipped in the face with a towel in the boys locker room after gym class. You can feel that towel whipping his face, then if that is not enough, the bullies knock him to the floor & beat on him until he urinates in his pants out of terror. Yes, there is no comparison of the bullies here between the two films, the American version wins hands down, plus Owen is terrified even to make eye contact with his foes, where Oscar seems to be oblivious of them half the time.<br /><br />Both films are very good to great additions to the horror genre, they add depth, terror, horror, sadness, & loneliness, to a rather oversaturated time for Vampire movies, that are frankly, quite lame by comparison. A drop of fresh blood, just when the Vampire movie needed it the most, in this post "Twilight" era.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for "Let Me In" is impeccable, worth picking up!</p></body></html>

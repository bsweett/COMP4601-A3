The scene involving a man running to his boat while these fast-paced zombie-like creatures chased after him was more confusing to watch than it should have been.  There was so many unnecessary rapid movements in the camera shots that I could barely tell what was going on.  After all the fast-moving shots were over, you then saw that the man finally escaped on the boat and was free.  It was really awkward.  Sometimes action scenes can move TOO fast, and this is a great example of that.<br /><br />After the 40 minutes of boredom in the beginning was over, the story finally became to pick up (and so did the action scenes).  From there, the virus that was infecting the people and making them go crazy began to become the main focal point of the story.  The actual virus was disgusting to witness, with the people quickly shooting blood all over the place as they banged their heads repeatedly against the walls.  Quite unrealistic though, and just exciting for the violence only.<br /><br />This resulted in these snipers who were on top of buildings at nighttime aiming directly for the kill shots to eliminate the creatures, and therefore, getting rid of the virus and preventing it from spreading.  This was the most interesting part of the entire movie.  Actually, just the fact the snipers were so accurate with their shots was pretty scary itself!<br /><br />None of the storytelling aspects were interesting that involved any of the main characters.  The older girl and the younger boy were both pretty forgettable.  Overall, just a decent movie for people who want to see these new and improved deadly zombies that can move as quickly as people can, and just an alright movie and nothing more.</p></body></html>

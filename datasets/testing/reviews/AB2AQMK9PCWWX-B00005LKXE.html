My chance to play director...? Goody, goody!<p>First, I would have skipped sections of Lector actually talking face to face with anyone in the early sections of the film and allowed his story to be told &quot;Roshomon&quot; like by Verger, by Barney, by Pazzi, by Florence denizens. I'd then have Lector  shown in the Florence shadows, the darkened corners, the musty street markets and have Hopkins still do the creepy voice overs, like when Clarice listens to the tapes and his reading aloud the Dante cantos, but I would not have him real-time interact with any other characters til he somehow confronts Pazzi AFTER his Dante lecture. Then Pazzi's cell phone rings and it's...Clarice.<p>Lector is supposed to be a man-myth, shrouded in mystery and danger...a bad actor infamous all over the world....like film antihero Kaiser Sose and Scott missed playing up on that. This from the man who scared the whatsis from me with &quot;Alien&quot;. I also expected a cinematic moment a la Brett and Scarlett when Lector carries Clarice from the wild boar pit. Also missing was that Clarice was supposed to start to become as nefarious as Lector...<p>Like I said, the pieces were there, but not connecting. The beautiful cinematography seemed to beg for a more masterfully told story. The music was operatic and appropriate but the libretto lacked the passion it should have delivered. In trying so hard not to become melodramatic, it ends up being melodramatic...</p></body></html>

This movie should've been categorized as a comedy because I was laughing throughout the entire thing. There were tons of cheesy lines, not to mention the chick in the movie outlives the predators. This is one of those movies where you're laughing that it's so bad, so if that's what you're looking for then go see it. I wouldn't recommend it.</p></body></html>

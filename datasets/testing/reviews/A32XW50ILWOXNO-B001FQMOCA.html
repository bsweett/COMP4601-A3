<meta name="summary" content="The Anointing of Reese."></head><body><p>"Walk the Line" is Reese Witherspoon's final ascent into movie stardom, maybe even her declaration as America's Leading Lady, seeing as Julia Roberts doesn't have much interest anymore, Gwyneth Paltrow's drifted into obscurity, Nicole Kidman, Naomi Watts and Charlize Theron were born south of the equator and Renee Zellweger just isn't very good looking.<br /><br />Spunky, cute, self-effacing, Witherspoon's made a lot of crap (and a lot of money off it), a few gems ("Election," "American Psycho"), and this OK biopic about Johnny and June Carter Cash that's a perfect vehicle for her talent - mixin it up with the boys, flirtin, mouthin off, cryin, lovin, hurtin. The Blue Plate Sally Field.<br /><br />Pedestrian director James Mangold wisely builds his movie around John(played  by Joaquin Phoenix) and June's protracted affair that begins on their first tour while they're married. That Cash-brand folk music runs underneath most scenes, but "Walk The Line," aims to be a love story, and succeeds. Phoenix and Witherspoon have the necessary chemistry, and Cash's first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) is slanted as such a grim, unhappy grinch it is a small joy when she orders John to take down a photo of June and walks out when he refuses. It's still several years before June agrees to marry John, but the way is finally clear. There's only a drug habit to kick and some self-abuse to endure.<br /><br />"Walk The Line" has a backstory for all the pain - a mean father (Robert Patrick) who blames John for his brother's death, that grim wife, the drugs, the alcohol, the tours, several bad influences (which include Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis). We assume the music is written somewhere in there; we see John on stage and at Folsom Prison, but not in the studio. Maybe rightly so - Cash was revered more as the Man In Black than as a talent; unlike "Ray," which cared about how Ray Charles created his art and survived by his business savvy, "Walk The Line" envisions Cash as little more than the guy who attends corporate meetings standing up, shades on, some country James Dean with the Holy Spirit bolting through him. Phoenix's performance addresses the legend more than the man. It's all blowups, booze and romance from the gut.<br /><br />Witherspoon does something different with June; she embodies the reluctant-yet-radiant everywoman, a tough skin, soft center, an archetype as old as Shakespeare. June starts with small questions and warm smiles inside a diner. She progresses to a scene when, in a moment of sincere affection, she tells John just what she wants to say about his talent, and what John never has heard from his father or wife. Who doesn't fall in love with that? That June finally falls too makes sense because John adores her.<br /><br />There's no mystery in Witherspoon. No hidden cards. She brings the same tomboyish, attractive skills to every movie, and for each "Walk The Line," there is a "Vanity Fair," where, regardless of her diligence, the magic is lacking. She's not a master talent like Meryl Streep or Kidman, but a punch-the-clock professional who, when she chooses wisely, can pack charm, wit and sweetness into one of the best performances of the year. Audiences like her, they really like her.</p></body></html>

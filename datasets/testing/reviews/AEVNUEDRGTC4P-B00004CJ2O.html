<meta name="summary" content="Horrible Horror Flick"></head><body><p>Friday the 13th spawned a whole new subgenre called slasher flicks. This was not a positive development for with the new sub genre came a brand new cookie cutter formula that subsequent slasher flicks have rigidly adhered to.<br /><br />Friday the 13th has an absurd premise in that it concerns the re-opening of Camp Crystal Lake 23 years after its closure. There are members of the community who are aware of evil plottings being aimed at Camp Crystal Lake and its denizens such as a truck driver and a local lunatic named "Crazy Ralph." Camp Crystal Lake opens up and it turns out that just about everyone who shows up, both counselors and campers alike, are nothing but a bunch of perverts who apparently deserve being slaughtered at the hands of a demented maniac.<br /><br />Friday the 13th is an awful flick in almost every regard.<br /><br />Unlike almost all of the pre-1980 horror movies, Friday the 13th and the slasher flick sub-genre that it spawned is not with the victims. These poor excuses for movies are with the killers and the whole point is for the audience to anticipate the next murder or killing spree. Slasher flicks like Friday the 13th are movies to avoid like the plague.</p></body></html>

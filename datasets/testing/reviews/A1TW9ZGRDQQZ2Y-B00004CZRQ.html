<meta name="summary" content="The Horror Film that Will Never Be Surpassed"></head><body><p>It is really hard to believe that this film is over 30 years old. The special effects still hold chilling value, the acting is still top notch, and the atmosphere still packs a mighty punch. What else can you say about a perfect horror film?

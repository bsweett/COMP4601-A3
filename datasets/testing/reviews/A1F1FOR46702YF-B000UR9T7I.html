Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally enjoying his life. The citizens of New York City honor Spider-Man for his heroic actions and Peter feels ready to ask sweetheart Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him. Unfortunately, new villains seek to destroy the web-slinging hero and an alien parasite has attached itself to Peter's costume and changes his personality for the worse. "Spider-Man 3" isn't the best in the popular comic book franchise but is indeed an entertaining superhero adventure that delivers plenty of humor and thrills. There are several moments when its complex storyline and too many supporting characters make this third installment feel long and sluggish. The summer blockbuster features some remarkable special effects and terrific action sequences. "Spider-Man 3" also stars James Franco, Topher Grace, Thomas Hayden Church, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris and James Cromwell.<br /><br />The Blue-Ray release of "Spider-Man 3" is a well recommended purchase. The 2007 summer blockbuster is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its crystal clear picture quality is truly excellent. This is the type of Blue-ray that you'll want to show off in your high definition television. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD sound is first-rate with great clarity and intense surround effects. There are over two hours of behind-the-scenes featurettes that focus on the film's production and visual effects. Other special features include photo galleries, Snow Patrol "Signal Fire" music video, trailers, TV spots, blooper reel and two informative audio commentaries by director Sam Raimi, cast members and production crew. Overall, "Spiderman 3" scores "B+".</p></body></html>

From the advertising, it did not look too interesting, although I love action and sci-fi.  Minority Report is magnificent.  One of the most original, thought-provoking, and entertaining movies to come along in twenty years.  This is a true classic.  <p>Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell are wonderful in their roles as Precrime Police, stopping crimes and charging &quot;criminals&quot; even though the crime has not taken place.  The Precrime Police have three empaths who provide them with information.  The empaths are suspended in water solution, and although they are not slaves, have never seen the outside world.  One of the empaths is female.  She is one of the most compelling characters, although she does not say much or get much screen time.  <p>The last scene had a few women in the theater crying.</p></body></html>

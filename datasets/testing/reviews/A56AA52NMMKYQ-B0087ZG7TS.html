<meta name="summary" content="Pseudo-Atonement...."></head><body><p>Guys -- if you sat through this with your wives or girlfriends (hopefully not both), they owe you TWO movies with exploding cars or Vin Diesel to "atone" for the experience!  Other random observations:<br /><br />James McAvoy must have a clone.  I think that one out of every three movies made nowadays stars McAvoy.  The guy must be the hardest working man in show business.  Has he figured out the cloning thing, because he seems ubiquitous.<br /><br />Cut the smoke!  If you watch Hollywood movies, you would surmise that 90% of the population smokes cigarettes.  What's up with that?  It's a lie.<br /><br />If you had not been briefed on the movie's plot, it might be very confusing.  Read up first.<br /><br />Say What?!  The velly British dialogue is hard to decipher at times.  I confess I switched on the English subtitles to help follow the dialogue.<br /><br />The movie is visually arresting.  I loved the scene on the beach evacuation (Dunkirk) when the soldiers were singing a hymn; also the later scene with Briony in the hospital wards with Debussy's "Claire de Lune" in the background.<br /><br />So writing a fictional piece is some kind of atonement for ruining the lives of the characters?  Oh please!  That is no "atonement" at all.  Writing some fanciful account of how these two lovers could have otherwise turned out does not expiate or atone for the lie perpetrated by Briony.<br /><br />That is why I view this as "Pseudo-Atonement."</p></body></html>

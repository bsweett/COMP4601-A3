<meta name="summary" content="Finally done, and done well."></head><body><p>The comic book has now officially become the mainstream in the world of film. The major companies try to get their hands on every franchise they possibly can. The real question is once there is a movie in play how will translate to the big screen and who is the fan base? Well, we all have seen what `The Dark Knight' and `Spider-Man' have done. Still, what about the no so main stream novels such as `300'? There are directors out there that don't want to make a movie in their own vision, but yet they wish to bring the book to the screen word for word, page for page. That is the film 'Watchmen'.<br /><br />'Watchmen' may be the biggest cult fan based comic book of all time. Written in an alternate reality in the 1980s, the Cold War is very much alive and all of Earth is extremely concerned about nuclear war. The heroes in this world are not ones special abilities or powers, and they are not liked by the people. Though, the costumed crusaders prevail to keep the people in line and keep order in the world. Suddenly one of them is brutally murdered and they are now the ones who fear extinction.<br /><br />I made it my business to make sure I read the graphic novel before I went to see this film and it was a wise choice. This movie no doubt tried to remain as faithful to the comic as possible. The dialogue was melancholy, they characters were well casted and while there were not as many effects as a major comic book blockbuster it was still put together in a very artsy package. Though, this movie is truly not for the mainstream movie goers. Watchmen was definitely created with the true comic book fan in mind. The director Zack Snyder like on his previous work with `300' wanted to make a movie that was just as authentic as the pages it was first concocted upon. Those who read this story would definitely enjoy it even though it is a very slow movie dragged out story. There are a few major things that are changed for cinematic purposes, but after reading this story I believe that the changes made really made the story more believable and less confusing.  The changing of the costumes was a positive thing because some of those characters really looked like pimped out hood ornaments in print. The actors chosen were not well known which is always a great thing. They each filled their roles perfectly and it really made me feel like the comic book was actually coming to life before my eyes. I believe that if you read the book definitely pick the movie up. If you are an innovative person who wants to see something different then you might enjoy it as well. But, I think if you are looking for the typical action super-hero flick let this one pass you by, you might not understand it. Alan Moore may have officially removed himself from any film that his work was to become, but I believe he needs to see this one, because it really has done him justice. Watchmen came out at the right time because Zack Snyder got it right.</p></body></html>

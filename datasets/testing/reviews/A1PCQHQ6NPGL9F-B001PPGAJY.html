<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good"></head><body><p>Usually it seems like sequels are not good compared to the first. I think this movie isn't as great as X-Men 1, but very well done.<p>The plot seems to run dry. Some guy wants to kill all mutants using cerebro, which was that machine they used to find mutants. It is completely different from X1, but that isn't why the movie is good. It is because of the action, and the characters. If you don't love the characters, you won't love the movie. My dad said the reason he didn't like starwars 2 was because of Anakin, and he is right(noone wants to listen to a whiner). All the characters in this movie you can like, Storm can be stupid at times though. I don't want to give it away, but when Jean states "Its targeting something else", Storms reply is "If its not targeting blahblah then what is it targeting?". Dude, Storm, every single person in that room understands what Jean is talking about, you are just making yourself look stupid. The action is great also. At first you think Wolverine is gonna do that thing where instead of killing people he slashes their guns in half, your wrong. He actually stabs people, for real. There isn't any blood, but its awesome. I mean he must stab 100 people. It is very cool. Storm does some stuff. Even though shes got a pretty big picture on the cover, she is not a main character at all. They have introduced some more mutants too, and it basically highlights the new recruits. Night crawler is major with his transport skill, and Colossus throws these 2 guys. Then there is Pyro. Pyro states that he is the worst mutant of them all, yet he can't even create fire, and you will see what I mean by that. One thing you may notice is that they have changed Pyro, in X1 he was the guy who made the small flame, and iceman froze it. He had blonde hair and looked alot different, they got a new guy to do him in this movie. The humor is alright, and Wolverine does most of it, but some of the people in the theatre would just not stop laughing. I mean jeez, I had to ask someone to stop talking, just because they were laughing at the most stupid things. It can be funny though if you are watching it with just your family, and don't have to sit next to people who like to make sarcastic remarks to themselves when nobody cares(you know who im talking about, that person who always does the "ooowwwwwww, that must of hurt" when it was obvious that it hurt.). So even though my theatre expeirience was bad, I enjoyed the movie, and if you like alot of action with a few boring scenes, you will like this movie.</p></body></html>

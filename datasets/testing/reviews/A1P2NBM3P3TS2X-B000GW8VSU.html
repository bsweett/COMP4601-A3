<meta name="summary" content="Decent but unexceptional."></head><body><p>Granted, the original is a hard act to follow.<br /><br />Demme's remake has its moments and a few updates relevant for the times, but it also suffers from some lazy moments that undermine the film.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that suffers on repeat viewings because some of the tiny details that are easily overlooked at first become more noticeable in later viewings.<br /><br />Here are what some might consider petty examples, but to me they represent a dismissive attitude about detail, and sometimes details really do matter:  there are several moments in the film where we see the candidates giving speeches on TV in front of large political convention crowds.  Rather than speaking loudly into the microphones to be heard over the cacophony of noises in the room, the candidates (and more Liev Schreiber's character than anyone else) speak in soft, conversational tones.  It looks like what is really was  --  not performed live but rather put together in post-production.<br /><br />In another scene at the end, a scene where the winning candidates are celebrating their election victory, the news graphic shows a two-bar graph of the voting count.  The winners received 70% of the vote, yet the bar graph shows that the one marked 70% is the shorter of the two.  That is impossible.  Any graph bar of more than 50% will be taller/higher than each and every other graph because it is the largest proportion.  If the shorter graph bar is supposed to represent 70% of the vote, what was the taller one supposed to represent? Maybe 110%?  The graph is a measure of 180% of the vote?  No wonder the voting system is so confusing.<br /><br />Did I catch these details the first time I watched the film?  The speeches, yes, the not the graphs.  There are several "false moments" like this in the film (and in a lot of films, to be fair).  But those are the moments that can "take you out of" the film, and when they draw attention to themselves you lose your interest in the story and focus more on the details that the filmmakers either were too busy to catch or hoped you wouldn't notice.<br /><br />If you are eating a meal that has a lot of stuff in it you like but one single, solitary, tiny-proportioned ingredient that you don't care for (and is cooked into the food and unable to be picked out), pretty soon that single ingredient is the only thing you taste or think about when you eat the meal.  It effectively ruins the meal for you.<br /><br />I liked this remake the first time I saw it but now I can't sit through it without the "little things" jumping out at me.<br /><br />Aside from that, however, it is a decent enough movie.  A well-cast film.</p></body></html>

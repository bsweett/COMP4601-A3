Made with "Thunderbirds" style marionettes, the plot springs from the destruction of much of Paris while pursuing terrorists, where an elite U.S. counter-terrorism group loses a member; the replacement turns out to be an actor with a boatload of emotional baggage. Before long North Korean crackpot Kim Jong-il plots world destruction with the help of the Film Actors Guild, lead by Alec Baldwin. An assortment of leftist actors sympathizes with Kim and believes everything to be America's fault. Satire can be the best indicator of reality; certainly this is one of those times as the film satirizes the arrogance, na?ve, and simplistic attitudes so prevalent in the chic Hollywood political activist circuit.<br /><br />The film is somewhat libertarian in attitude, as it mocks elements from all political factions from Derkaderkastan to Hollywood. By far most of the venom here is directed at the far left Hollywood elite, with special treatment reserved not only for Baldwin, but Michael Moore (who is referred to as a "giant socialist weasel," and who blows up Mount Rushmore), Martin Sheen and Tim Robbins (who are North Korean guards), Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon, Janeane Garofalo, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Danny Glover, Peter Jennings, and others. The actors meet fates appropriate for the film, with Glover and Penn being eaten by house cats, for instance.<br /><br />The United Nations, as impotent in this film as it is in real life, is also rightfully mocked. The U.N. sends the useless Hans Blix to inspect Kim Jong-il's property, and Hans is quickly eaten by Kim's sharks. Kim gets to sing a ballad about loneliness that is the musical highlight of the film, although I loved the battle preparation song complete with the line "we're gonna' need a montage" almost as much.<br /><br />As you might expect from Parker and Stone, the film is frequently tasteless (e.g. extensive marionette vomiting) and is very politically incorrect. I am by no means a fan of "gross out" humor, and while some of the gags could have been dispensed with, the satirical points made by Parker and Stone are completely legitimate. Unsurprisingly some of the people caricatured in the film were unhappy with the skewering they received. Penn wrote a hostile and profane letter to Parker and Stone as a result, which seemed to prove that he can dish it out but can't take it, although Clooney was more mature and claimed that he would have been insulted had he not been parodied in the movie.<br /><br />The film is refreshingly independent and did well at the box office (grossing approximately $51 million), which provides hope that more films not beholden to the uber-left Hollywood mentality will be greenlighted in the future. While "Team America" is nowhere near perfect, it does have many funny moments interspersed with the gratuitous grossness, and most importantly of all, effectively skewers its targets, which was the point in making a satire in the first place.</p></body></html>

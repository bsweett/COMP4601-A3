The movie has plenty of well done action and Salt is also well acted.<br />  However, the movie just gets silly after awhile and I found the twist of who's bad and who's good rather predictable. While the film never hooked me enough to make me say in the end "I can't wait for more!". So Salt is hardly Bourne with a woman.</p></body></html>

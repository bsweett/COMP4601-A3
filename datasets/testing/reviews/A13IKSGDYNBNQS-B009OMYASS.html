Yes there are some horrible moments but after a while you become immune to the blood and guts and really don't care about the characters. Hitchcock showed us more than fifty years ago that if you want to be frightened don't show the viewer whats behind the door. This gets a few marks purely on a gore level but for most of the time its a remarkably souless venture.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that there are rich people in eastern europe who pay for the pleasure of torturing people. The victims are lured by sex and thats it really. You get the inevitable soft-core for the lads and not much else. If you see it once you probably wont ever want to see it again. So I would rent it rather than purchase.</p></body></html>

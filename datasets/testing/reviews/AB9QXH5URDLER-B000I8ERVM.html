<meta name="summary" content="Suspense of the Hitchcock Genre"></head><body><p>Spooky, Creepy, Scary, Suspense are words that describe The Exorcism of Emily Rose.  Based on a true story this film "scares the stuffin" out of you the old fashioned way . . . with suspense.  It proves that a film need not be a slasher movie to be frightening.  Nor does a film need to be stupid.  This film, set as a courtroom drama, delivers its emotional punch while presenting the viewer with a thought provoking subject, the conflict between religion and science.  The film also manages to treat religion in a respectful manner without forcing viewers to believe.  The director does a wonderful job of completing a task that at the first seems impossible.<br /><br />The film has its problems.  It probably isn't gory enough for teens raised on slasher films.  It probably is too frightening for the youngest viewers.  Its title probably will discourage thoughtful viewers who shy away from horror flicks.  It doesn't leave the viewer with a "feel good' ending, appreciated by those who go to the movies for light escapism.<br /><br />In short, it is a good film, but might be overlooked by people conditioned toward formula films.  It attempts to be a horror film for thinking persons.  Is there a market for such a production?  Only time will tell.</p></body></html>

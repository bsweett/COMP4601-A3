<meta name="summary" content="That Kid Thing Again"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg has directed some of the biggest and best movies ever made: JAWS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br /><br />But, when kids are involved in his movies, he indulges them and spoils them--and the movies are ruined by a deadly amount of The Cutes.<br /><br />Those first truly great movies I've mentioned all have one thing in common: no cute, adorable kids as main characters.<br /><br />Watch INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, and compare it to RAIDERS and you'll see what I mean.  It's like Mr. Spielberg loses his genius-like ability to craft a film when cute kids show up on the set.  Still don't believe me?  One word: HOOK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's my major problem with JURASSIC PARK.<br /><br />Michael Crichton's original novel is a brilliant, well-oiled machine of a story.  Read it.  But although some of Crichton's excellent ethical arguments make it into the film, the menace and suspense of the original storyline are lost because Sam Neill's character has to warm up to the idea of having some cute, adorable kids himself.<br /><br />The priority of the novel was: Not To Get Eaten.<br /><br />The priority, at times, of the film appeared to be: Kids Are Just Too Darn Cute For Anyone to Resist Them.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie was also the most exciting chapter in the book: the first time we see the T-Rex tearing its way out of its pen and rampaging against the guests.<br /><br />The special effects were the real stars of this movie.  I wish they would've had more screen time.</p></body></html>

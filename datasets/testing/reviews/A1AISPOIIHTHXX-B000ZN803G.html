<meta name="summary" content="4.5; Taking a voyage to your real self"></head><body><p>For a little while, I've always thought of the idea of going out into the world and experiencing all that there is to experience before tons of mortgage payments, careers and fears of being laid off and whatnot would overwhelm. It's not so much wanting to be "free" and live life without barriers but rather to get out there and see as much as you can before you settle into a life like everyone else has. The film, based on the book of the same name, tells the story of one who wanted to be free and not dragged down by materialism and unnecessary things without realizing the most important things at the same time.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Christopher McCandless, a smart man recently graduated from university where he longs for a life that's more basic and natural than new cars and careers. After donating all of his rather extensive savings and burning the rest, abandoning his car and changing his name to "Alexander Supertramp", he goes on a 2 year journey that takes him all over America before he makes for his goal of Alaska where he spends his days in an abandoned bus and where his body was later found.<br /><br />One thing that always bugs me about these "biopics" is that the film casts the subject in such a positive light that anything negative gets dismissed or at least excused because of their "genius and influence". While I can relate to the idea of just wanting to live and not be saddled by getting a job so I can move out so I can get to university and work 20 years for a job I don't love, his reasonings and viewpoints are a little bit naive even. In one scene after being told to get a career, he says no because it's a "20th century invention" which to me sounds more like rebellion against The Man rather than something he felt his soul/spirit needed. So it's more a story you can appreciate and maybe even get inspired by but it's not let's say Gandhi in its power.<br /><br />The film though is quite gorgeous in how it was shot and a lot of its cinematography is quite picturesque and helps sell the idea of just being out there on your own. The music, supplied by Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, is also a notable mention and it wasn't as intrusive or wrong as I thought it was going to be. Another praise I got to give is to Sean Penn who, to be honest, I never liked as an actor, preferring loudness and overexaggerated movements to help sell his character. But as a director here, he's more restrained and even has a good sense of pacing which for some reason is a big problem with some directors lately.<br /><br />Like Zodiac and the Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Into the Wild was criminally overlooked by the Academy and proves not all the best films get to be the top 5 nominated. I wouldn't say this film was or is anywhere near my favorite film of last year, but I sure enjoyed it a lot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="British Gangster Film At Its Finest"></head><body><p>_Snatch_ is a hard-hitting, fast-paced, fun film.  From the opening of the film, where we are introduced to the gigantic cast of misfits (each with hilarious nicknames and wonderful rich personas), _Snatch_ takes the audience on an incredibly entertaining and hilarious adventure that is a delight to watch.  While many have criticized the film for being a copy of _Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_, or a sequel to that film, I would argue that it is exactly what we wanted.  While I would love to see Guy Ritchie extend himself beyond his current scope, I think that he does what he does really well.  I loved his first film and I loved _Snatch_.  At the end of the day, a good cockney gangster film is still a good film.  Period.<br /><br />_Snatch_ is a success because of its characters, many of whom I would love to see explored further in other films-Brad Pitt's performance as an Irish Gypsy Boxer is an obvious frontrunner of the pack.  These characters are allowed to develop and display their quirky selves, largely due to the wonderfully written script.  The dialogue in this film is stunning-both engaging and hilarious at the same time.<br /><br />Once again, I simply do not know what people are talking about when they describe the film as a difficult one.  The accents are not hard to decipher at all, with the exception of Brad Pitt's character.  In those instances where the dialogue does fall off, it seems utterly intentional on Ritchie's part and adds to the character development in the film.  Secondly, the movie's multiple storylines are spliced rather well and I do not think that the average film viewer will have trouble piecing together the plot.  As has been stated, the plot is not complicated in the least-it is simply how Ritchie spices up an old, well-traveled story.<br /><br />If you want to have a good time watching a British gangster film, give _Snatch_ a look.  You will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

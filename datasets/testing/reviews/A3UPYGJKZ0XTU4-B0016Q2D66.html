<meta name="summary" content="The Price Paid for Security and Comfort Was a Stifling Conformity."></head><body><p>"Revolutionary Road" was adapted from Richard Yates' 1961 novel about one couple's struggle with post-War middle class ideals in a picture-perfect Connecticut suburb. Set in the mid-1950s, we see the strained marriage of April and Frank Wheeler, an aspiring actress and former longshoreman who initially shared a keen sense of adventure, a vitality that has waned since they had children and moved to the suburbs. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes the train to work in New York each day with thousands of men like him. April (Kate Winslet) stays home, minds the children, chats with neighbors, and becomes increasingly frustrated with her circumscribed life. So she proposes that they give it all up, move overseas, and immerse themselves in life again. At first, Frank agrees, but then the struggle to balance security, happiness, and social pressures begins.<br /><br />The 1950s were a conformist time, an era when the American middle class ideal was defined especially narrowly. Of course, people like the Wheelers led comfortable lives, for which perhaps they should have been grateful. Comfort and security are nothing to sneeze at. On the other hand, the stifling social environment and rigid value system fashionable at the time had ugly side effects: mind-numbing boredom, shallowness, isolation, hypocrisy, and alcoholism among them. What strikes me about "Revolutionary Road" is how contemporary it is. America entered another conformist era in the 1990s, one that I estimate is more conformist than the 1950s, as the middle class is larger, careerism is taken more seriously, and rigid and often bizarre expectations are now extended to children.<br /><br />In an interesting twist, it is April, a mother of two young children, who wants to give up her comfortable home and take on a job to feel like she is still alive. But her willingness to take the situation in hand unintentionally emasculates Frank, who has slipped more easily into the constraints of middle class ambition. Or perhaps he is genuinely excited by the prospect of a promotion and higher pay. Frank has a compulsion to talk about everything, but he never says what he thinks. "Revolutionary Road" was directed by Sam Mendes and filmed on location inside a suburban Connecticut house. This is helpful, as the audience is placed in April's world, surrounded by walls, with windows overlooking the quaint yards of neighboring homes, and unruly woods out back where freedom seems to reign. Two outstanding performances by Winslet and DiCaprio are complimented by a sharp supporting cast, including Kathy Bates, Dylan Baker, and Michael Shannon.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2009): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary, one featurette, and an audio commentary. "Lives of Quiet Desperation: The Making of Revolutionary Road" (29 min) interviews the director, cast, producers, screenwriter Justin Haythe about the film's themes, production designer Kristi Zea about the office and house sets, and costume designer Albert Wolsky. The audio commentary is by director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe. They compare the final cut of the film to a preliminary cut, the film to the novel, talk about characters, filming on location, and the challenges of dramatizing Frank's interior, since his thoughts were expressed in the book. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

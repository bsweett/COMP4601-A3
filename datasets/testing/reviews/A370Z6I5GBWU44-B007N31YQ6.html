<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>Inspired from a true story (which does have a few differences from the movie), this movie is a fun one with Julia Roberts and her boss vs big corporations. The plot is well-paced and it is so much fun to see Julia Roberts mouth off - to the police, to her lawyer, to the people she is suing, and so on and so forth. If you like Julia Roberts, you'll love this movie. And if you like stories of little guys vs big, bad corporations, you'll also enjoy this.</p></body></html>

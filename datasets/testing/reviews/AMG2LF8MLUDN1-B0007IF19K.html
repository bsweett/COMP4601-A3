<meta name="summary" content="Foxx is Ray!"></head><body><p>There's no doubt about it.  Jamie Foxx is the reincarnation of Ray Charles.  Foxx has Ray Charles speech and mannerisms down cold.  The movie retells a portion of Ray's life during the period when he was hooked on drugs.  There was no struggle to remove drugs from his life because it wasn't until very much later in life that he finally decided to kick the habit.  His struggle to attain stardom in the early years is portrayed well by Foxx.  Along with drugs is his uncontrolable appetite for women and his affairs, before and after he was married, were many.  His wife put up with the affairs and the children born out of wedlock.<br /><br />At times the movie becomes tedious as we watch Foxx contort his face and body to imitate Ray.  One gets a little weary after a while even though Foxx's portrayal is flawless.  We see the loss of his only brother and his mother sending him off to the blind school even though he didn't want to be separtated from his mother.  We learn of the demons that followed and haunted Ray all of his life.<br /><br />Foxx does not sing but instead lip sincs to tracks.  A wise choice since even the best mimicks of the day have not been able to master Ray Charles voice.  Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded & The Matrix Revolutions) enters the film after Ray's success as his new manager.  Lennix seems to excel at every role he touches.  His performances are always on point.  The cast in general does a good job of portraying Ray's little circle of bandmates.  If you are a Ray Charles fan you  should see this film.  Foxx just may win the Oscar with this performance.  A true test of Foxx's talents though, will be another role in which he has to act more than imitate.  Then we'll see what kind of an actor he really is.</p></body></html>

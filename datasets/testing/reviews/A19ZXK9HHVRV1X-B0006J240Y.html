Or was he?  Despite the fact that she has pictures, videotapes and her own memories of the child, we begin to suspect that he might never have existed at all and that she is suffering from a psychotic delusion brought on by a miscarriage years earlier.  The plot becomes more complicated when she meets up with a man whose own daughter may have also perished in the same alleged accident.  Together they search for answers as to why no record remains of their children ever having existed.<br /><br />Despite having some talented performers in the cast, "The Forgotten" is a gimmicky thriller that telegraphs its solution early on.  Even Moore - who seems to be slumming a bit after all her work in high-toned features over the past several years ("Far From Heaven," "The Hours" etc.) - can't overcome all the paranoid-thriller cliches that come to dominate the screenplay:  the couple on the run from nameless terrors, the sympathetic and credulous investigator, the subsidiary characters who may be part of an elaborately worked out conspiracy and hoax.  The movie has individual moments of intrigue and suspense, but the plot holes are legion and the resolution lacks any significant wallop or punch.<br /><br />With a story as unmemorable as the one we have here, could the title actually be referring to the movie itself?</p></body></html>

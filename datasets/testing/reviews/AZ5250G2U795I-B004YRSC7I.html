<meta name="summary" content="A film you won't be able to get out of your head!"></head><body><p>As great as this movie is...it's not for everyone. <p>That being said, I'll tell you why I see it as a WOW! Christopher Nolan has created a piece that is unmatched in it's originally and is on par with 'The Usual Suspects' in terms of storytelling at it's finest. The script is tight, and the performances (Guy Pearce...if you haven't heard of him yet, trust me...you will!) are solid.<p>The fact this film is told backwards gives you an intimate 'bond' with the protagonist, in that you can't remember what happened before either, and this adds a dimension that few films can project. But, you can't 'leave' for a second. If you have to do anything, pause it, because little clues are left all throughout the movie, and the different way the story is told can also leave you feeling lost if you miss some of it.<p>This is a true gem of a film that it's a shame it didn't get more buzz early on.</p></body></html>

Well, gosh, although I slept through Geology 101 in college, I'll bet there are little more than kernels of truth in what the story contends about the Earth's electromagnetic field.  However, I must ask the obvious $60,000 question to the vociferous critics of this movie:  WHAT did you expect, exactly?<p>If you want a natural disaster movie that isn't happy-go-lucky where everyone goes on a suicide mission and miracuously all come back, then this one is worth a look.  If you want a film with some eye-candy special effects, then look no further!  <p>There have been a few movies /  cartoons in the past where an inventer would create a machine with a giant drill at the front end.  This contraption would take he and his crew to the center of the Earth, or at least far down.<p>In the present story the method of drilling is updated:  the ship uses lasers to blow its way through the Earth's mantle.  Is it believable?  Certainly not.  However, it is far more "watchable" than the giant drill-nose machine.<p>For myself, I did enjoy the allusion to Dante's DIVINE COMEDY.  The inventor of the ship names it the VIRGIL, after the Roman poet Publius Vergilius Maro. In the INFERNO it is the dead Virgil who leads Dante the Pilgrim through the lower depths of hell and up to the top of Mount Purgatory.  Nice touch.<p>The acting is decent, although I think they could have done better than the fellow they recruited to play the computer hacker nerd.  The highlight of the film is Hilary Swank.  She's certainly not hard on the eyes and also lends a nice feminine dynamic as the only non-male member of the crew.<p>All in all, this one is worth purchasing.  No, it's not scientifically accurate, but then again neither is Jules Verne's JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (yet I don't hear people shooting that one down because of its lack of credible science).  Just remember:  at the end of the day it's a MOVIE!  If you can keep that in mind, you'll be all set to begin your journey to the core.</p></body></html>

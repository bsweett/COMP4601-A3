And the true story of James J. Braddock, so wonderfully portrayed in Ron Howard's fascinating film CINDERELLA MAN, is an absolute tribute to the rugged determination of the human spirit. . .to the never-ending journey of love and fulfillment.  This movie nails human conflict, perseverance, and determination right on their collective heads, and leaves the viewer gaping in overwhelmed astonishment.<br /><br />Jim Braddock, an up-and-coming boxer from Jersey, supposedly had the world by the horns in the late 1920's, as he won bout after bout on his way to getting a shot at the heavyweight title of the world.  But Jim, like countless millions of others, would stumble and fall when the Stock Market crashed and the Great Depression hit; finding himself penniless and destitute, he was forced to move his family from a comfortable home in the suburbs to a squalid basement apartment, where a series of injuries sabotaged his boxing career to the point he could no longer compete--to the point he was decommissioned as a New York boxer.  Subsequently, Jim Braddock embarked on a desperate life of hand-to-mouth existence:  begging for jobs on the loading docks, standing by helplessly as the apartment lost its heat in the dead of winter, with his children growing sick from the relentless cold. . .until he had to apply for state relief.  Then, miraculously, his spirited manager was able to convince the Madison Square Garden promoter to allow Jim to fill in for a boxer who couldn't make an important bout versus a formidable heavyweight contender; without training a single day, hungry and disheveled, Jim wins the bout, and sets about a chain reaction of events that will have him moving steadily up the ranks of heavyweight contenders to face champion Max Baer, the most dangerous boxer of his era--a man who had already killed two men in the ring.  And while Jim began his meteoric rise through the boxing echelon, he captured the hearts and souls of a disenfranchised populace who connected with him and cheered him; Jim Braddock was their symbol, their icon that proved success could be obtained, even against overwhelming odds.<br /><br />This is riveting material, from the recreation of Depression Era Manhattan, to the depths of poverty and want, to the exceptional storytelling, and yes, the boxing scenes, which are completely believable.  But where the story ultimately triumphs, in this reviewer's opinion, is in the steadfast love and devotion of Jim and his very spirited wife, Mae (Rene Zellweger).  The film begins with Jim married to Mae, and stays the course accordingly; not one time is the love and affection between these two people ever questioned or disparaged, despite considerable obstacles.  Crowe and Zellweger exhibit flawless chemistry on screen, and it's fun and compelling to watch.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is fantastic as Joe Gould, Jim's long-suffering, loyal manager, while Craig Bierko ushers in a new dimension of rogue via his portrayal of heavyweight champ Max Baer.  Here's an interesting bit of trivia:  Baer's son, Max, Jr., went on to enjoy a very successful Hollywood career by portraying Jethro Bodine in the sitcom, "Beverly Hillbillies."  'Tis a small, small world. . .<br /><br />CINDERELLA MAN is quality, epic entertainment.  Not to be passed up, but gobbled up.  When Mae Braddock goes to her local Catholic parish to pray for her husband on the night of his long-awaited fight with Baer, she finds the church packed with other worshippers praying for the goodness of her husband.  That's good stuff, and it moved me to tears.  And so will this film.  Highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />--D. Milels, Author, WALK-ON</p></body></html>

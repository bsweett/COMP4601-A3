Very unique, very original, very wonderful!  And now with the release of this gem onto DVD, you get even more to write home to Momma about.  <p>2 Audio Commentaries - The first with Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steve Starkey and Production Designer Rick Carter is a nice mix of storytelling, special effects talk, and personal memories, while the second commentary by Producer Wendy Finerman is a more intimate setting (since she's alone), giving cute stories such as the reason why the speakers are cut off while Forrest is speaking in Washington D.C. is because no one could think of anything profound enough for him to say for real.  <p>Through The Eyes of Forrest Gump - This 30 minute documentary is one of the most famous, in that it was sold separately on video in stores all over the country...and sold well.  On the laserdisc of Forrest Gump it was included as a bonus on side 4.  So many wonderful moments from the film are discussed, including how they were able to have Tom Hanks shake hands and interact with JFK, turning Tom into a ping pong wizard, as well as making Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan) believably look as if he truly lost his legs.  This is certainly not your run of the mill &quot;making of&quot; that gets boring after a few minutes.  It instead holds your interest to the point where you're saying &quot;WOW!!  So that's how they did it!&quot;  My only complaint is that the transfer of this documentary didn't seem crisp and sharp enough.  It almost seemed like they just copied it off of a laserdisc.  I happen to own the laserdisc, so I compared the two and to me, the laser looked brighter and sharper.  But it's a minor complaint.  The film itself looks great!<p>The Magic of Makeup - A wonderful look at how the makeup in this film was so crucial to its success.  Included is makeup for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise and Sally Field.  Tom's beard growing is interesting, but watching Sally Field being transformed into an elderly woman is astonishing!<p>Through The Ears of Forrest Gump - This is the sort of thing most moviegoers take for granted...the sound of a film.  When you watch this segment you'll get a sense of just how important sound was in making scenes come alive: the sound of the bikes rolling after a young Forrest as he breaks free of his metal braces, the tracers and mortar explosions during the Vietnam sequence, creating different ways to convey the sound of the rain in Vietnam as Forrest had said rained in so many different ways, the storm at sea, and much more!  <p>Building The World of Gump - Creating the places and settings of the film, including Forrest's home in Alabama, Vietnam, and Washington D.C.  All crucial to the films believability. <p>Seeing Is Believing - 11 visual effects from the film are discussed, including 2 that didn't make the final cut.  Forrest was planned to meet Martin Luther King, Jr., a scene involving dogs being released to stop what Forrest thought was a &quot;parade&quot; of black Americans, headed by King.  But because Forrest knew all the dogs since they were puppies, he unknowingly stops the violence by getting their attention with a stick, then apologizes to Mr. King, himself (&quot;They're just dogs&quot;) - The other new scene is a ping pong match with George Bush Sr when he was the Ambassador to China and having Forrest hit him in the crotch with the ball.  Both of these scenes are winners to me, but I'm sure they may have bogged down the story some, and that's why they were cut.  Nice to have them here though.<p>Photo Gallery - Some nice still shots of the film that are definitely worth looking at.<p>Screen Tests - A total of 7, the first 3 with Michael Conner Humphrey (Young Forrest) and Hanna R. Hall (Young Jenny), 2 with Robin Wright Penn (Jenny), and 2 with Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.).  Besides witnessing these characters coming to life for the first time through the actors, it's also interesting to see Tom Hanks before he employed Micheal Humphrey's accent to his own and how this made a huge difference.<p>2 Theatrical Trailers - including the &quot;Remember...&quot; trailer, which contains no dialogue and just uses Alan Silvestri's wonderful score.<p>Get the film that gave Tom Hanks his second consecutive Oscar on DVD in a nice two disc set.  Relive the magic and the memories.  Relive Forrest Gump.<p>&quot;And that's all I have to say about that&quot;. - Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Take Down this Wall"></head><body><p>Let me start with this personal fact, I think Harrison Ford is a modern day Jimmy Stewart. He can do comedy,drama, action and mystery. Now the bad news, Ford is in the DVD Firewall and it acts like too many other films  and TV shows.<br /><br />Ford plays IT person Jack Stanfield.  Paul Bethany (from Master and Commander, A Beautiful Mind) plays a cold as ice criminal mastermind who kidnapped Stanfield's family. The film sems almost like Desperate Hours with Bogart or the remake with Anthony Hopkins. Bethany starts to pressure Jack to heist 100 million from the computer design he created. Bethany is great as the icey cold mastermind, not as good as he was in Davinci Code.<br /><br />Bethany's character harrassas Stanfield's wife (Sideways's Virginia Madsen) and his family. This is similar to Capr Fear with Gregory Peck or the remake with Nick Nolte. Madsen preformance seem to assail fear in every scream, fear in all her action and still it seem a poor man's choice in her acting.<br /><br />To get the money, he usea gizmos (like an IPOD and plastic tubing) as if MacGuvyer would. Note, I like Ford as Indiana Jones, But Richard Dean Anderson was more suited to do these things Ford does in this film (Note Box set of MacGuvyer Season six is out!-better to get that , rathefr than this film !)<br /><br />He does what asked and the family is still kidnapped, so Ford goes on a one desparation to save his family. Just like Warren Beauty's Dollars, Desparate Hours or in Ford's own Franic (rent that instead of this if yoiu want a Harrison Ford Movie).<br /><br />Ford tries to hold this film together, but fails badly...The plot folds in the action.<br /><br /> It seem like twice told tales...I give it 3 stars-One for BEthany, one for Ford and One because I got this as a gift!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz  AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

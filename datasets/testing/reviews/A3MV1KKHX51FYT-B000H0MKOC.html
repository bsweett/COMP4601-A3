Neil Naylor, a lobbyist for a tobacco company, is one of the guests. Twelve hundred people die each day from smoking tobacco. Is there a link between nicotine and cancer? [No, it's the tars and residue from the smoke.] Naylor is a "spin doctor", an advocate for his cause. Watch him work! The "St. Euthanasius" school? Lobbyists talk for living. People who tell you what to do and what to think (like newspaper columnists). "Challenging authority"? Does an "endless appeals system" make our government the greatest? Can it be proved? "If you argue correctly you are never wrong." [Can that be proven?] "That was unnecessary." Do movies sell cigarettes? [Yes.]<br /><br />Senator Ortolan Finisterre is from Vermont, he is against smoking. Big Tobacco hopes to put cigarettes in all the movies, like in the past. The conversation is comically cynical. "What motivates you?" "Population control." "California is not a safe place." Jeff McGall is a power in Hollywood. He has ideas for cigarettes. [Are multinational corporations like child murderers?] Naylor has to deliver a suitcase full of money to a man in Southern California. "Let's talk." The talk is funny. "How did you know he'd take the money?" One man calls in a threat to Naylor. What will he do? Terrorists kidnap Naylor in broad daylight from a street in Washington! Where is Homeland Security? He wakes up in a hospital. "Cigarettes saved your life." But he must quit cigarettes. "Nicotine patches are deadly." Public sympathy is on Naylor's side now. Reporter Heather Holloway has a story on Naylor: he is doing it for the money. Bad publicity! Naylor is fired because of this scandal. He is going downhill. Joey cheers him up.<br /><br />Naylor has new ideas. He has a press conference to say he will testify at the Senate Hearing. Naylor proclaims the dangers of cholesterol from the cheese of Vermont! His advocacy of "personal choice" and individual freedom trumps the idea of a skull and crossbones on each pack of cigarettes. He will be rehired as a lobbyist now. Or will he? The last scenes show what happened to the other people. "There is no direct evidence that links cell phone usage to brain cancer." [But they carry this warning label in Europe!]<br /><br />I suspect the book was better than this film. It is funny in spots as a satiric comment on advertising in society. But the humor requires a point of view to agree with the story. This film is clever in presenting situations that are ambiguous so it plays to both points of view. Big Tobacco and its lobbyists are the heroes, a Senator from Vermont is the villain. Isn't that too perverse?</p></body></html>

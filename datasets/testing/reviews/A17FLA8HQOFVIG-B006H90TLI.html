<meta name="summary" content="Slow, suspenseful and annoying.  Only a lukewarm recommendation."></head><body><p>This film is directed by the famous Coen brothers who also wrote the screenplay adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy.  It is dark and brooding story and the suspense is so thick that it kept me squirming uncomfortably in my seat throughout.  Indeed, it is a fine film, artistic in every way.  It's already won a whole bunch of awards and will certainly make it into the Oscar nominations this year.<br /><br />John Brolin plays the role of Llewelin Moss, a simple working-class welder, and occasional hunter who accidentally comes across a murder scene in the Texas desert.  The inhabitants of several trucks are all dead or dying and there is a satchel of money from what looks like a drug deal gone bad.  Llewelin grabs the money and runs and the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between him and Javia Bardem, cast as Anton Chiguh, the personification of evil itself.  Llewelin is way over his head as he matches wits with Chiguh, whose deadly weapon of choice is air gun which is usually used to kill cattle. Tommy Lee Jones is cast as the aging and wise sheriff.  He tries to stop the mayhem but is powerless against it.<br /><br />I didn't like the plot.  I want good people to win.  I want a resolution.  I want a tidy ending that I understand.  I don't like leaving the theater and feeling that the conclusion was just a cop out by the author who wrote himself into a hole and, because he couldn't figure out an ending, kills off a lot of people and then decides to let the viewers figure it all out for themselves.  O.K.  I know this is art.  I also know that I can find a book or a film satisfying either in spite of, or sometimes because of, this kind of world view.  But it the case of "No Country for Old Men", all I felt was annoyance and depression.<br /><br />I cannot say this was a bad film.  Film buffs will appreciate it.  The directing and acting were impeccable.  And even though the 122 minute-runtime seemed to move at a snail's pace, there wasn't a wasted motion or expression.  And so, even though I appreciate the artistic impulses that went into this film, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="UNRATED/EXTENDED DVD reviewed..."></head><body><p>GHOST RIDER is another comic adaptation from Marvel comics. It is in the same vein as CONSTANTINE and HELLBOY that deals with supernatural fantasy. The movie incarnation of Ghost Rider, however, feels like a hybrid of the Johnny Blaze(who uses Hellfire as his primary weapon) in the 70's and Dan Ketch(magical chain/penance stare)in the  90's.<br /><br />John Blaze is a stunt motorcycle rider, who decades ago sold his soul to Mephisto(incarnation of Satan), to save his dad from cancer. As with anyone who deals with evil, the deal has a hidden catch, his dad dies in an accident anyway and Blaze finds out that he is unable to die until Mephisto decides it is his time. It makes Blaze a phenomenal stunt rider but it also makes him empty.<br />Soon enough, Blackheart wants to de-throne Mephisto by seeking an ancient scroll with the names of the damned to grow an army. Mephisto enlists Blaze's aid by transforming him(against his will) into the "Spirit of Vengeance", Ghost Rider to stop Blackheart.<br />Sam Elliot(steals the show) as the "caretaker" is a character from Ketch's 90's  incarnation, Eva Mendes as Roxanne, who plays Blaze's love interest.<br />About the extended edition:<br />Don't go for the slightly longer un-rated cut for hope of more violence. Pretty much everything that has been restored in this version of the movie is characterization bits, which is not a minus because it does flesh out the central players a little more, but it's doubtful that any of this material was cut at the request of the MPAA, rather, it was likely deleted for pacing reasons.<br /><br />The film's EFX is well-executed and follows a darker tone like DAREDEVIL and Underworld. Although I have to say this film mostly follows the 1970 incarnation with its cartoonish sly humor. The 1980-1990's version of GR had a more serious and darker mood.<br />PICTURE: 2.40 ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN. The PQ is phenomenal, colors extremely vibrant. Some scenes are sharper than others, but I didn't see any video artifacts at all. Great transfer<br />AUDIO: The DTS track has a stronger bass but not that much different from the 5.1 DD track. Sound is very powerful.<br />Extras:<br />DISC 1:  Commentary by director M.S. Johnson w/ visual effects Steven Mack, another commentary by the producer is also here. Trailers are also here.<br />DISC 2:<br /> Documentary called Spirit Of Vengeance: The Making Of Ghost Rider which clocks in at just under 82 minutes. The first two parts cover the origin of the film and its production while the third part details post production work.<br /> Up next is Sin And Salvation which is a really interesting look at the comic book history of the title character, one section a piece dedicated to 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000's by way of some interesting interviews with the various artists and writers who have worked on the different incarnations of the Marvel Comics that the film was based on.<br /> To close it out, Sony added some cool animatics and more supplements.<br /><br />GHOST RIDER is not as bad as people think. It is a fun ride, a decent (if brainless) action movie geared towards fans of the comic genre. It didn't achieve its potential, but this unrated release w/ its extras are well worth a look. 3 ? stars!<br />RECOMMENDED!!</p></body></html>

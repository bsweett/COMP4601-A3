Woolf's Dalloway is a woman who outwardly has it together but as the story unfolds we see her slowly but surely falling apart.<br />Daldry's film of Michael Cunningham's novel is audacious in it's physical design but more importantly in it's ability and assurance when it deals with the emotions involved with being a human being whether it be 1920's England, 1950's California or 2002 New York City.<br />Even though in essence, the three women in "The Hours" are radically different in temperament, focus and style, Daldry is more interested in what makes them similar. The three women he focuses on in "The Hours": Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) are troubled in various ways but share a commonality that makes their concerns and situations Universal no matter from which era they come.<br />The acting in "The Hours" is of the highest order: natural, multi-colored and intense: Kidman, Streep and especially Moore are not only out for blood but for Truth as well. These are conflicted and conflicting characters, carefully and intelligently scripted.<br />"The Hours" is a rare movie. A movie with a palpable sense and understanding of it's own world and a commitment to its characters. It is a moving experience that is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

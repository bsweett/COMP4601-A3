<meta name="summary" content="A love story that touches your heart."></head><body><p>The story is of 2 ranch hands that work hearding sheep on Brokeback Mountain for a summer in the 60's.<br />Though homosexuality was taboo back then, Jack Twist (Jake Gylenhaal) and Enis DelMar (Heath Ledger) are drawn to each other, and become lovers this particular summer.<br /><br />When Summer is over, they must part ways, and Enis tells Jack he is about to be married to his fiance' (Michelle Williams)<br />The following summer Jack checks back in at Brokeback to see if Enis had come back again for the summer. He hasn't, So Jack Twist goes on reluctantly with his life, and he also gets married (More for financial reasons than love)  4 years pass.<br /><br />Jack writes a letter to Enis saying he will be there for a visit. When he shows, all those old feelings resurface, and they head back to Brokeback, and it continues that way throughout the years, and through the years Enis rejects the idea of settling down together as a couple because of a gay-hate killing he saw as a child.<br /><br />The movie moves along nicely, to show the ups and downs of not only thier relationship, but thier relationships to others, thier friends and families throughout the years.<br /><br />There is a very heartfelt ending to this movie that I won't give away, but it will leave you thinking about "Brokeback Mountain" long after it is over.<br /><br />The acting is phenominal, the setting is beautiful, and the directing is flawless. One of my favorite movies of all time.</p></body></html>

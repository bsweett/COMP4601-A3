The bonus features on the new DVD are already available on the DVD that is out now, excluding the remastered picture, a possibly very short 'Intro,' and the I'm sure ultra-exciting photo gallery? I'm sure the 'Making Of' feature is the same one we have already. The ONLY reason I'm even buying this one is because of the new transfer on the DVD. As for the Achiever's gift set, it should AT LEAST include a second disc full of REAL bonus features to warrant THAT price.<br /><br />For more information:<br />http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/Reviews/bigl.htm<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Big and noisey - almost more than the story can bear."></head><body><p>Hugh Jackman has to have more talent than to be in big noisy special effects pieces like this.  It isn't so much that this is a bad story as it is burdened with so much noise, hyperkinetic special effects, and the kitchen sink.  I mean everything about all monster movies is thrown into this thing including Q from the James Bond series.<br /><br />But my main gripe is that human beings cannot fall hundreds of feet and be just fine.  I mean, if you have super heroes and monsters and all that, the real humans have to stay limited to real human powers to make the monsters exceptional.  If you make the people nearly as exceptional as the monsters you diminish the whole movie.<br /><br />Anyway, it was fun in the way a 2nd rate roller-coaster ride is fun.  You know you aren't really getting to the edge of things, but if you turn off your brain, you can enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

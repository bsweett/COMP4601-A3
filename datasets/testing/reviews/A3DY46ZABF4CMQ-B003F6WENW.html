In fact, I only giggled a few times at some of the jokes and one-liners, and laughed to myself at how bad and cliched the rest of the movie was.<br /><br />Vaughn and Wilson have got to be two of the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated actors working in movies today. Crashers portrays them both as players who crash weddings to pick up girls. Their game turns on them when they crash the wedding of the Secretary of Treasury's, played by Walken, daughter. They both hit on two other daughters of the Secretary and find themselves falling in love.<br /><br />As you can see, I didn't go into details nor did I use concise plot points to discuss Wedding Crashers because I find it all a waste of my good time.<br /><br />Wedding Crashers is one of the worst films of 2005.<br /><br />Not recommended<br /><br />D</p></body></html>

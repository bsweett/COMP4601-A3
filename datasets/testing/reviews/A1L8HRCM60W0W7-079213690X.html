<meta name="summary" content="VERY WATCHABLE 'HOLLYWOOD' FLICK WITH A STRANGE WAR CRY"></head><body><p>"They can take our lives but they cannot take away our freedom". Something about this war cry suggests an anachronistic anomaly, but fortunately the rest of the film is so powerfully executed with such a satisfactory abundance of high-octane battle scenes that it makes up for every little guff.<br /><br />Why let minor trivia like historical accuracy detract you from a fabulous Hollywood action flick? If films were produced merely for accuracy, all of our films would look like The Passion. Braveheart, ironically, is a lot more passionate.</p></body></html>

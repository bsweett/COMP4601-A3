<meta name="summary" content="One of Will Smith's Best Performances"></head><body><p>Will Smith stars as scientist Robert Neville in this apocalyptic thriller about viruses and the struggle to survive.<br /><br />Dr. Neville is a military scientist charged with finding a cure for a terrible virus that has supposedly sprung from a failed cure for cancer.  The virus has a 90% kill rate, and the military is moving to evacuate people from New York City.  Neville rushes his wife and daughter to a waiting helicopter, but he remains in the city; determined to find a cure for the rabid disease.  Neville himself is immune from the virus, but most are not.  To make matters worse, the military has decided to quarantine Manhattan, and soon, bridges are being blasted to prevent infected people from escaping.  Neville only has Sam, his pet German Shepard, as a companion.<br /><br />Neville spends his days foraging and his nights working on a cure for the virus, using his own immune blood as a component to the vaccine.  He is also forced to deal with the Infected; mutated vampire-like zombies who are roaming the deserted streets of New York in search of prey.  He has also sent out radio messages trying to attract other immune people to come and join him.  He offers food, shelter, and safety to any immune person who can reach him.<br /><br />One encounter with the Infected leaves Sam near death.  Neville takes his beloved dog home to try to save him, but Sam begins exhibiting traits like the Infected.  Sadly, Neville puts Sam down himself.  However, he isn't alone for long, as a young woman and child show up unexpectedly at his house.  She explains that God brought her to Robert's house, but he is skeptical.  Meanwhile, Robert has been experimenting on one of the Infected that he managed to capture and bring back to his house.  By using his own blood, it appears that the effects of the virus are being reversed, but it might be too late for Robert and his companions, as the other Infected have tracked Robert to his home.  Soon, the others break into the house and begin searching for Robert.  Will he survive, or will the Infected succeed in disposing of him?<br /><br />This is a first-rate thriller.  Will Smith gives one of his best performances since "Independence Day" as the dedicated Dr. Neville.  The special effects are excellent as well.  It was somewhat scary looking at a deserted New York City, with weeds growing in the cracks of sidewalks and streets.  Watching lions hunt deer in the city was definitely strange, too.<br /><br />I rate this movie very highly.  The story is very good, and the acting and special effects will keep the viewer interested until the end.  Watch "I Am Legend" and experience what it might be like to be the last person on Earth.</p></body></html>

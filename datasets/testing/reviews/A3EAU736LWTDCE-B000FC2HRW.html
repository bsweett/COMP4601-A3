<meta name="summary" content="Good, but I think #2 was probably the best out of the series"></head><body><p>I really, REALLY wanted to give this 5 stars. I guess I had my expectations too high when I went to see it. I liked the second movie so much I was really hoping they could top it. Don't get me wrong, FD3 is a very good movie! I will buying it when it comes out to DVD, and I definitely would recommend going to theaters and seeing it. So, with that being said, I want to start off saying I do not think this one topped the first two movies. It does how ever offer a few deaths scenes that make it a must watch for gore lovers. I will not try to give too much away, but I will try to sum it up as best as possible: The acting isn't up to par with the first too movies. I didn't feel as attached to these characters as I did in the first too movies. It had kind of a cheesy feeling to it. Maybe like a "Scary movie" or "scream" kind of atmosphere. It was a movie that couldn't possibly scare anyone, and never seemed to take itself seriously. I think these kids were no where near as good as the kids in the other movies.<br /><br />  Next, the plot is over done. Even though I love this series and wish it would go on forever, I can easily see how the concept is getting very burnt out. The plot was overdone and lacked any surprises for those of us who have seen the first 2. I also agree with the one review who said the death scenes didn't seem as elaborate in this one. There was a lot of "splatter death" in this one: an easy horror movie effect. A horror movie example: throw a body in front of a moving vehicle, then show the blood hitting onlookers in the face. Yea, its bloody, so what? Remember in FD2, the scene with the barbed wire fence? I think it took a lot more creativity to make that scene than it does to make blood splattering against people's faces. Once again, don't get me wrong here. This movie does have it moments, and it does have about 2 scenes that might be the goriest in the trilogy, but it still did not outdo the other ones. So your left with an all to familiar plot, not so hot acting and some beautiful gore FX. In the end though, what really brought this movie down for me was the ending. Anyone could have wrote a better ending. Since this is supposed to be the last movie in the series I was really hoping for something explosive, unexpected, and extraordinary for an ending, instead it was very cheesy.<br /><br />  Verdict: they don't make too many movies this gory anymore, for that reason alone it is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of new territory here.</p></body></html>

Will Smith is always entertaining and effortlessly captivating, but this time, with the pairing of the breathtaking beauty known as Eva Mendes and the hilarious Kevin James, Smith is brought to the top of his game.  The script is sweet and refreshing, the dialog is smart and funny and the acting is top notch.  Eva Mendes is not only beautiful but charming and funny.  She keeps proving with each role no matter how thankless that she is more than a pretty face.  This role is not thankless, thankfully, but just the same she's a star.  The real standout though is Kevin James who outdoes himself.  I've always loved James' standup and his show `The King of Queens' but here he really blows me away with his natural charm and humor.<br /><br />Smith plays Alex `Hitch' Hitchens, a date doctor as it were, who helps coach men into successful relationships.  His latest project is Albert, an overweight accountant who has fallen for the rich and beautiful Allegra Cole, a woman many may consider out of his league.  With Hitch's help Albert begins to woo Allegra and a mutual attraction between the two is formed.  In the meantime Hitch himself finds he's been struck by cupids arrow, falling for columnist Sara Meles, and soon we discover that Hitch is about as helpless as the men he coaches.  Between the two couples hilarity ensues and the audience is never left bored or wanting.<br /><br />As may well be expected events line themselves up to expose Hitch and his clientele and threaten to end both sets of blossoming relationships.  All is good though and the ride is a fun and entertaining one.  The chemistry between the entire cast is fantastic.  James feeds Albert enough charm and tenderheartedness that the audience falls in love with him alongside Allegra and Mendes plays Sara with enough sass and smarts that we can easily understand why Hitch is so absorbed in her.  Smith may be the star but with a cast this impressive he gladly shares the spotlight and the praise with his co-stars.  It's fun and breezy entertainment suitable for the entire family and will go down as one of my favorite romantic comedies of late.</p></body></html>

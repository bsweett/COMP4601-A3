<meta name="summary" content="Not just for Greeks"></head><body><p>I didn't see this film when it was in the theaters, in spite of rave reviews.  It seemed to be a pretty obvious story which didn't interest me.<br />Recently I picked it up at the library (for free) and, to my surprise, I found it genuinely heartwarming and entertaining.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it is sort of a re-hash of Moonstruck, and it isn't as well done.  And yes be prepared for a lot of ethnic stereotypes--the loud Greeks with the garish taste as well as the uptight WASPS. And yes, we know from the opening scene what's going to happen.  I think that the reason the movie overcomes these flaws is the overwhelming love in it.  You can tell that it's a real story and that's what lifts it up from cliche to something genuinely touching.<br /><br />The script is smart and funny.  It moves fast.  And the cast is first rate. To some, the idea that the very homely 30-ish girl in the restaurant would stand a chance with the superbly hunky Ian Miller (played by the irrestable John Corbett) seems impossible.  But the actress is so funny, so real, and so smart, that she really does have enormous appeal.<br /><br />I am always happy to see the wonderful Laine Kazan, who makes every scene a heartwarmer.  The fellow who played the dad is perfect, too, as are all of the others.  I particulary loved the gramma!<br /><br />I recently saw Monsoon Wedding, which was also lauded and can be compared in many ways to this film.  But Monsoon Wedding nowhere touched the genuineness of this work.<br /><br />It's not the most artfully impressive film ever made, but, like the big fat family (including the newcomer,) it has plenty of heart...and that's worth a lot!</p></body></html>

In perhaps his most famous role, Dennis Quaid plays a rogue knight who, with the help of a very noble dragon, (Sean Connery, seen-but-never-heard as the voice of the winged reptillian), fights to overthrow a wicked king, (David Thewlis, who bears an uncanny resemblance to The Monkees' Peter Tork).  An absolute must for action fans, Braveheart is both a history lesson and a carnypark thrill-ride that will captivate all.</p></body></html>

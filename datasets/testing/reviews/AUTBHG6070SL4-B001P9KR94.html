That's not this movie.<br /><br />This takes any Dickensian poverty you might have imagined and brings it completely up to date. It starts with Jamal orphaned by lethal sectarian violence, his childhood friend turning to guns and violence, his cute little female friend turned into - well, you get the picture. Every event leaves its mark on him, and he learns from it. The odd smattering of stray facts earns him a place on a game show with multi-million rupee payoff. And, in a coincidence that stretches imagination, every one of the game's questions has answers in his haunted past. Almost every one ...<br /><br />I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would, largely because of the child actors. The several girls playing Latika at different ages, especially, are heart-breakingly cute - and especially heart-breaking when seen in that cesspool of poverty. The way it documents the poverty of that underclass, the "slumdogs," will outrage any thinking, feeling viewer. In an ending that's really a beginning, Jamal rises above that poverty, and above the corrupt and vicious society at the top, too.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters<br /><br />PS: Hang around through the closing credits - it offers one more light moment, as if to brighten the movie's darker imagery.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="RAY OF HOPE"></head><body><p>The best segments concerned Charles' childhood, sweeping vistas of rural Southern life brushed in the deep color tones only apparent to the young, and "Ray", although still little more than a standard Hollywood bio, escalates dramatically in the first half and sort of surrenders to the rigorous biographical schedule at hand in the second half. The music is superb and the recording sessions and live performances come alive with a fly-on-the-wall authenticity. His heroin addiction though, seemed lacking in true dramatic depth but steeped in nobility as he requests no medicinal help during withdrawl and later we're told, as it is written on the screen, "Ray Charles never did drugs again". It's not enough to say so, the movie could have continued on showing Charles' basking in the reverence finally awarded him and living the drug-free climate he apparently earned. I love Ray Charles though and I very much enjoyed this movie.</p></body></html>

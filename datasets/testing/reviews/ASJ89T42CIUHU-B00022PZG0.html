<meta name="summary" content="Rock On!!"></head><body><p>This movie is a really fun film for the entire family with lots of music and plenty of laughs.<br /><br />Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a loser; he even gets fired from his own band because he can't control his ego and wants the entire limelight. His roommate has grown past the rock and roll life to become a teacher and along with his uptight girlfriend they barrage Dewey with all sorts of negative inspiration forcing him only to withdraw. But then one day a phone call arrives that inspires Dewey into action and he finds himself employed as a substitute teacher at a reserved private school. With a class of brainy nerds awaiting direction Dewey has nothing to offer except music.....and so the story unfolds. Dewey takes this class of intellects and turns them into a great kid's band despite the watchful eyes of the school headmistress Ms. Mullins (Joan Cusack).<br /><br />Jack Black is funny just watching him exist in all that hyper energy he possesses but in this movie he gets to also show his stuff around music. Although he is sometimes irritatingly crazy most of the time he is really great in this role as a teacher that knows absolutely nothing. Joan Cusack joins Black as the comic relief in this film as the rigid school marm with a secret passion to be Stevie Nicks and flaunt herself in a rock and roll band. The kids are also great in this film in fact almost musical geniuses playing their own instruments as well as pulling off wonderful acting roles. Everyone can watch this movie and find something to enjoy and it's a great motivator for all the losers of the world who just want to play rock and roll....rock on!</p></body></html>

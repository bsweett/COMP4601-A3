<meta name="summary" content="Classic action flick"></head><body><p>A New York city cop (Bruce Willis) becomes embroiled in a fiery battle with terrorists who have taken over a Los Angeles high-rise.  This is by-the-numbers genre material all the way: invincible hero, African-American sidekicks, foreign villains, clueless superiors...if you've ever seen an action movie, you know the drill.  "Die Hard," however, does all of this so well that it emerges as great entertainment, even as we realize how derivative it is.  Also on the plus side, Willis infuses his John McClaine with a humanity and an Everyman quality that makes him more of an Indiana Jones type than a fascist, omnipotent Dirty Harry clone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Horror Films Ever - Very Original"></head><body><p>John Carpenter has a string of horror films in any fan of the genres Top 20, but sadly his latest efforts are complete hokum and he has pretty lost his touch. He should stick to what he does best - low budget original horror movies.<p>Make no mistake about it - "The Fog" has it in aces in every department by simply not trying to be more than what it is - an old fashioned ghost story. This is established within the first few moments as a fishermen tells some children a ghost story by a camp fire about a ship wreck. Then we launch into the film, about a small town by a harbor with characters preparing to celebrate the towns anniversary. It has all the feel that the town Amity had in "Jaws". Then some small strange happenings start occurring. An old book is found in the church which tells of an ancient conspiracy to sink a ship full of lepers. A strange glowing Fog is heading towards the port, a ghost ship is seen, a fishing vessel goes missing, there are strange knockings at peoples doors, an autopsy has a strange conclusion, a boy finds an old piece of drift wood with a name on it, a record player in the radio station starts to play ghostly voices.... Its got it all!<p>If you like John Carpenters work then you will love "The Fog" especially if you like his early low-budget work. The acting is quite functional for this type of story and it does scare. Watch it alone, at night to get the full effect. It is still as chilling today as it was then... those red eyes send a chill up my spine every time. The story is also highly original and very inventive in parts. It is also quite fast paced and there is never a dull moment. <p>Overall this is great horror film with a great plot and is essentially very scary. If you have not seen "The Fog" then it is about time that you get around to doing so. Get it today! You will not be disappointed. Notice that 95% of the reviews so far are above 3 stars. That says a lot!</p></body></html>

The movie is a terrific courtroom drama and a terrifying horror story of demonic possession.  The movie raises the question of the validity of demonic possession, and lets the viewer determine whether or not the possession has occurred.  Based on true events in 1976 Germany, the movie opens with a Catholic priest being charged with negligent homicide in the tragic death of young Emily Rose.  Father Moore had attempted an exorcism on the girl a few days earlier, and her death is blamed on him, as he had suggested she stop taking her medication.  Emily had been diagnosed as epileptic with resultant psychotic tendencies; Father Moore and the girl's family believed Emily to be possessed by demons.  An ambitious agnostic attorney is hired by the Archdiocese to serve as his defense, and a Methodist prosecutor is representing the state.  What truly elevates this distinguished film is its cast.  Laura Linney, one of today's best actresses, gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Erin Bruner, the hot shot defender who finds herself questioning her own beliefs during the course of the trial.  I've always admired Ms. Linney's work even in below average films (e.g. Congo) and she rises to the occasion in this riveting performance.  Equally brilliant is Tom Wilkinson, who plays the tormented priest who wants to tell Emily's story and insists he is not responsible for her death.  Nominated for an Oscar for his performance in IN THE BEDROOM, Wilkinson gives a sincere and intense picture of this good man.  Campbell Scott gives one of his most effective performance as Ethan Thomas, the churchgoing prosecutor who leaves his beliefs outside the courtroom and is determined to see Father Moore convicted.  Jennifer Carpenter is devastating as Emily, a girl tormented by demons and the destruction of her life as she knows it.  Her performance is so real it is disturbing at times to watch what happens to her.  Joshua Close as her boyfriend is also very good in a demanding supporting role.  Director Scott Derrickson keeps the movie riveting with superior timing and some really spooky scenes.<br /><br />THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is a marvelous film that asks us to question what is possible in this straight-laced world of ours, and stays with you long after you view it.</p></body></html>

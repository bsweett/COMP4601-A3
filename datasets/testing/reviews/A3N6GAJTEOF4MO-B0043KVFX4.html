Needless to say I wasn't disappointed. If you're after a popcorn "horror" flick with a difference then this is certainly the film for you.<br />I placed the word horror in quotation marks for a reason. I use the word horror in the classic context of something that is genuinely menacing, intimidating and is destined to give you nightmares e.g. The first Nightmare on Elm Street. This wasn't one of those movies that really sent the shivers down your spine, but it did have its moments where you would jump out of your skin and this is obviously something that is considered horror by todays standards.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich returns to the series as Alice who is now on the move through the desert because she has learned the Umbrella Corp can track her location by satellite. After the incident in Raccoon City in the previous installment the Umbrella Corporation was unable to contain the T-Virus. It quickly spread across the world drying up all the lakes and rivers and turning almost every living thing into a Zombie. The Umbrella Corporation seem to be the only organised group of humans not in a Zombified state. In an attempt to try and create a cure for what's left of humanity, Dr. Sam Isaacs is using Alice clones in an attempt to create a cure and help tame the zombies so as to create a viable work force.<br />All is not so sweet however as a group of roaming Raccoon City survivors lead by Claire Redfield are attacked by a huge flock of ravenous zombified crows. 5 are killed in the incident, but it could have been more if it weren't for Alice incinerating the flock by using her psionic powers which were gained from her bried imprisonment in the Umbrella facility.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good film and one of those popcorn flicks that you can enjoy with your friends. Although this isn't entirely based around the game storylines it's still a good stand alone movie and if the rumours are true, I can't wait for the fourth.</p></body></html>

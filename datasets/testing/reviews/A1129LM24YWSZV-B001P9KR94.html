All three children are orphaned in an attack on the Mumbai slum in which they live. They join forces to lead an adventurous, poverty-stricken life. Jamal and Silam become separated from Lakita in the midst of a daring escape from a gangster. For years thereafter, Jamal searches for Lakita. He finds her years later, only to be separated from her again.<br /><br />In desperation, Jamal manages to land a spot as a contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", hoping aginst hope that Latika will be watching so they can be reunited. In a twist of destiny, Jamal discovers that, due to the unique experiences growing up in the slums, he knows the answer to question after question.<br /><br />Though there are definitely some very difficult parts of this movie to watch (especially at the beginning, when the primary characters are helpless children, prey to the unsavory environments that surround them), the film is ultimately uplifting. A marvel of casting, to boot, as a gifted actor portrays each of the princpal characters in different stages of life.<br /><br />Sooooo worth seeing. I really loved it!</p></body></html>

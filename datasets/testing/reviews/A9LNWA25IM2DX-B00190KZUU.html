<meta name="summary" content="A classic Tim Burton film that deserved a better treatment (Bluray review)"></head><body><p>Based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace, Big Fish tells the story of William Bloom and his reconciliation with his dying father through the stories he used to hear from his father when he was a kid. This is without a doubt one of my favorite Burton films, filled with visual moments that follow the 'Burton formula' but with a story that goes way too far from your average Burton movie. Many reviews already exist about the film itself so I will now proceed to talk about the release and explain why I gave this only 3 stars being a favorite film of mine.<br /><br />THE MOVIE<br /><br />The movie is presented in anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Color is generally consistent and looks well in HD, but not as well as it should . It would seem a if the film has been manipulated as there is a softer look in it that I do not remember seeing at the theater; close ups that should normally look detailed look way too soft and with a 'waxy' effect. Scenes that I was looking forward to see in high detail look dull and not as they should for a Bluray release (the circus sequence, the whole arrival to Spectre or the daffodil scene are two examples that come to mind) The video quality is indeed an improvement over the existing DVD, in color at least, but there is no doubt this could have looked way better than it does in this release.<br /><br />Audio tracks included are uncompressed English PCM 5.1 (which sounds incredible in the few scenes that take advantage of an HD sound system), English and French 5.1. Subtitles included are English, English SDH, French, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai<br /><br />THE EXTRAS<br /><br />Prior to getting this, I owned the existing DVD release that included among the extras an audio commentary with director Tim Burton, some mini documentaries about the story and the characters as well as some other features hidden as 'Easter eggs'. Well, all those extras but the director commentary are gone in the Bluray disc. The hidden extras are also nowhere to be found, so the director commentary is pretty much the only extra feature included in this release. If you, like me, have heard a Tim Burton commentary before, you may already know you cannot expect great things from it nor interesting information, Burton passes most of the time silent and when he talks it is usually to make a joke or point out something that may not be relevant at all. Trailers of other feature films in BD are also included.<br /><br />Overall, an average upgrade from the DVD, if you are a person who likes to watch documentaries and extras on how a film was made, you may want to get the DVD instead or keep your copy if you already own it. Hopefully we will have a special edition Bluray some day that features a new remastered in HD that does to justice to this film,  visually speaking.</p></body></html>

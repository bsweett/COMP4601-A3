<meta name="summary" content="Exciting, riveting thriller!"></head><body><p>You're having a quiet, pleasant night, driving your taxi in Los Angeles.  You just delivered an especially pleasant fare.  Then, to disrupt your evening, an AX MURDERER asks for a ride!<br /><br />That'll change your evening in a hurry.<br /><br />Well, in Collateral, there is no ax murderer, but Tom Cruise is a contract killer with a list of people to dispatch before dawn.  Jamie Foxx is the low-key driver, who can't find a way to escape without causing more collateral damage.<br /><br />What is a taxi driver to do?<br /><br />Great acting by both of these actors, especially Foxx.</p></body></html>

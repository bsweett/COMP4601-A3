A  wonderworks of special effects and elements from 50's sci-fi films that  captured people of that generation, Independence Day moved up into the list  of top ten money grossers of all time after its release. While the  storyline remains overall trivial, it does have a certain rush to it in  many cases, especially when things begin to pick up with the invasion. A  typical day in American cities turns into a nightmare when spacecraft the  size of each city begin to blast the cities to nothing but ruin in an  attempt to exterminate the human race. Soon, it's up to a small band of  survivors, including a scientifically-gifted cable repairman (Jeff  Goldblum), an Air Force pilot (Will Smith), a drunken crop duster (Randy  Quaid), and the President (Bill Pullman), to try and figure out a way to  stop the invasion before earth is completely taken over. One thing about  this film: it never stops moving. No matter what scene you're watching, it  is either driven by emotional force or adrenaline action sequences. The  rumors are true as to the special effects as well: they ARE seamless. Using  models and computer effects, Volker Engle and Douglass Smith create images  that fool audiences moreso than any other movie in history. Performances by  all lead and supporting actors make the movie very enjoyable as well as  believable, played out with force, emotion and effort. The DVD release of  the film is superbly crafted: the video resolution displays brilliant  colors and sharp, crisp images that will be very pleasing to the eye. Sound  design immerses the viewer in a non-stop surround environment, utilizing  the rear surrounds as well as the .1 LFE in action scenes and musical  score. A hit in every way, &quot;Independence Day&quot; is an enjoyable  popcorn movie that can be watched with emotion and laughter.</p></body></html>

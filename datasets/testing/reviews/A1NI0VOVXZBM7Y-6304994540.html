<meta name="summary" content="The Big Lebowski"></head><body><p>A Movie I don't think I would watch again,despite watching it before and then a 2nd time, not because I couldn't understand it or wanted to but because I just did. I really Like John Goodman and Love his potrayal in this movie and while I am not a Jeff Bridges Fan I did like his Hippie Potrayal in this movie.(They all are smelly lazy), I also liked buscemi's role too.(Donny!)I think this movie is for those who enjoyed Fargo and those type of movies,My favorite quote though is "Say what you want about National Socialism at least it's got an Ethos.".So the movie is entertaining to an extent,I hate the smashing up of the Vette.</p></body></html>

The religious idolatry of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>, the enslavement of children in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">the Temple of Doom</a>, the father-son dynamics of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">the Last Crusade</a>.  Sure, the films were mostly about watching this sexy archeologist/professor risk his neck for posterity's sake, they chewed up the outer edges of believability with centuries-old booby traps and supernatural relics, they hammed it up with dialogue as chewy as Bazooka Joe.  They were, in a word, fluffy fun.<br /><br />But, even as they packed a wallop with their exuberance, they also made sure to tone down at the right times and to add a little soul.  Even the hotly contested TEMPLE OF DOOM, well, say what you will about its darkness, I always got a rush when those kids broke their shackles and ran free.<br /><br />I'd tell you what CRYSTAL SKULL wants its emotional backbone to be, but that would require a spoiler alert.  Let's just say that it's not hard to guess, especially when Shia LeBouf sticks his well-manicured coif into the screen and starts muttering about his poor, kidnapped mother.<br /><br />Harrison Ford seems to be enjoying himself, in spite of a script that eschews plausibility more than any other Indy film, yet.  (They don't even try, at some points, to keep the pieces together.  For instance, the circumstances surrounding Indiana's recovery of the crystal skull make absolutely no sense whatsoever, and that's big news for a movie that has a man withstand a nuclear blast from inside of a Fridgedaire.)  LeBouf's character is mostly annoying, if not grudgingly necessary.<br /><br />It's got the sort of blockbuster energy that will keep the seats filled.  And all of the Indy elements are there: a horde of nasty critters, that red line criss-crossing a map, Jones losing and regaining his hat, and even helpful monkeys.  I guess the real test would be to imagine this film coming out before any of the others and then asking if it would've inspired the same kind of hunger that RAIDERS did.<br /><br />Not likely.  Jones may look old, but he's as wry and competent as ever.  Give him a whip and a goal and he'll give you a ride, that's not in doubt.  He's still got the muscle and the wit.  Maybe what's missing is the heart.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.  That was torn out in THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  No wonder so many people hate that film.</p></body></html>

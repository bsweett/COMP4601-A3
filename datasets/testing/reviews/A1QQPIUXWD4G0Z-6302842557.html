<meta name="summary" content="The Genius of Mozart"></head><body><p>This brilliant film written by Peter Shaffer and directed by Milos Forman brings out the genius of W.A. Mozart: one of the most recognized classical composers. The film shines in all areas: cinematography, direction, acting, and costumes.<br /><br />  The film is based on the rumors that the court's royal composer, Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), brought Mozart (Tom Hulce)to an untimely death out of jealousy and spite. Although the rumors have little weight in history, they form a great foundation for a drama such as this film. Tom Hulce plays the childish Mozart to perfection with his spurts of laughter and giggles. Abraham received an Oscar for his role as the brooding Salieri. Supporting this great film is the beautiful music of Mozart performed by The Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-fields: Sir Neville Marinner conducting: one of the finest symphonic groups for Mozart's music.<br /><br />  Don't miss this breathtaking film. The drama and humor in the film are, like the music, suited for all ages. A great film for the entire family.</p></body></html>

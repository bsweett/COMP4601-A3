<meta name="summary" content="It's adapted from a comic . . . but very well done"></head><body><p>This is kind of a novelty, the adaption from a comic. I believe everyone is startled to see how X-Men, Hulk and Spidey took off. And I imagine that Hollywood will eventually keep up this new genre. If you call it that.<br /><br />Punisher, Frank Castle, is more brooding and certainly darker than most Marvel creations. He sets out to right the wrongs against his family, and of course he is not seeking justice. Rather revenge. And darn well, too.<br /><br />I did not mind the sociopathic John Travolta as Howard Saint, the syndicate boss. Barbarino brings a game oh these many years later, and his bad guys, as in Broken Arrow and Face Off come to mind, are pretty bad. And pretty believable.<br /><br />The 'revenge before justice' concept can work well . . . and it can implode. The 'Brotherhood of the Bell,' for example, years earlier, was a bomb. Vin Diesel's 'A Man Apart' got bombed, but it really shouldn't have. Conceptually it was pretty good.<br /><br />What I liked about the Vin Diesel role was less quips. What I disliked about the Tom Jane role was the presence of more humor than a man who has had his entire bloodline erradicated is entitled to have. It seems pandering, a directorial attempt to appeal to all possible emotional demographic groups. Unnecessary.<br /><br />Jane does look a little like Christopher Lambert but I think that's in the eyes. The man is well buffed.<br /><br />All in all, good acting; good photography. I hope we see more of Frank Castle and Tom Jane. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

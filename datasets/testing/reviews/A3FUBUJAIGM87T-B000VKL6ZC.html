<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining as a slasher, but FAILS to recapture the style, atmosphere and brilliance of the original."></head><body><p>When I went to see Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's immortal classic called "Halloween", I went into the theater with an open mind.  The feeling that I got after leaving the cinema was that Zombie's remake of "Halloween" would have been a decent horror movie in its own right if it had not been named "Halloween" and if it had not attempted to remake the original classic.  After having seen the director's cut as well as the theatrical version, I can say that as a horror movie in and of itself, the "Halloween" remake is not terrible (not very good either) and is actually a brutal and violent slasher film that is capable of producing some degree of horror, albeit more of the shock and disturb variety rather than actually being scary.<br /><br />With that being said, you have to come up with something more than what you get in this movie if you want to try and do a remake of one of the greatest horror movies of all-time in the original "Halloween" and call yourself an effective remake.  Otherwise, you open yourself up to a tremendous amount of criticism, and you are going to get hammered.  First, the acting in the remake was clearly inferior in every conceivable way compared to the original, most glaring was the inept performance of the actor who played Dr. Loomis in this remake.  I thought he was just AWFUL, not just compared to the brilliant Donald Pleasance, but just AWFUL.  In fact, the acting in general caused me to be unsympathetic to the characters.  There really aren't any likeable characters in this movie when you think about it, unlike the original "Halloween" in which how could one not like Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode?  These types of characters are completely missing in the remake, and that is only one reason why the remake is inferior to the original "Halloween".  Also, does every single one of Rob Zombie's characters have to be white trash?  I am not just talking about this remake either, I am talking about all of his movies.  It must some kind of neurotic obsession of Mr. Zombie's I guess.<br /><br />The next point that should be made is the degenerative family that Zombie uses to attempt to explain why Michael Myers goes mentally insane.  I think Zombie should be commended (and I have been very critical of his films-claiming he should stick to music) for trying to change things up, but he tries to explain too much of the darkness in Michael Myers and that takes away from the mystery and horror of the "Boogeyman" factor if you will.  In other words, I believe that Michael Myers is a lot scarier in the original because we do not know why he went off the way he did and killed his sister whereas the remake attempts to portray Michael Myers as a victim of a degenerative family.  Therefore, Carpenter's Myers is flat out scarier than Zombie's Myers and, no, it is not even close.  Indeed, Carpenter's Myers is the Boogeyman, and Zombie's Myers is just another violent kid with a mental problem that is infatuated with Halloween...big difference there and it shows.<br /><br />By the same token, Zombie focuses a lot more on the childhood of Michael Myers in an attempt to differentiate his remake from the classic.  From that standpoint, I somewhat admire Zombie's effort and creativity, but I just do not believe that the remake is anywhere near as effective as the original as a horror movie.  Sure, there's plenty more violence in the remake, but does that necessarily mean that it is scarier?  I would argue that it most certainly does not.<br /><br />In my opinion, Zombie is unable to present the Halloween theme anywhere near as well as Carpenter, and that is an understatement.  However, perhaps the most glaring flaw in Zombie's remake is the failure to match or even attempt to match the style, suspense and atmosphere that is so ever-present in Carpenter's original classic.  Consequently, there really is no comparison between the two because the original classic is a very scary movie whereas the remake is not.  Another very interesting difference between the two movies that should be discussed is that Zombie's focus is clearly on Myers, the person, whereas Carpenter's focus was on Myers as the "Boogeyman" and the evil night of Halloween itself.  Zombie completely fails to capture the Halloween theme here...PERIOD.  Unfortunately, we just do not have this in the remake, and that is the main reason why I believe that the remake would have been received better had it not been a remake of the immortal classic.  In other words, if Zombie had attempted to fashion this movie as a modern slasher instead of trying to create a remake of "Halloween" out of it, this movie would have been more effective, more accepted, and more of a success.  Oh, sure, the remake was a tremendous financial success, but, hell, anyone could have made a movie and called it a remake of John Carpenter's masterpiece, "Halloween", and gotten millions of dollars just off of the name of the flick, so the amount of money this remake brought in does not tell us anything.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, the remake of "Halloween" is dripping with this generation's lifestyle with a focus on these gothic and long-haired type of people, not to mention Zombie's unquestioned preference for white trash characters.  Zombie tries to be hardcore with his remake, and that is fine.  In fact, I did not see one normal looking person in the entire movie...no offense, but did anyone notice how all of the men had long hair like 80s rock stars in this movie?  I am not just talking about Michael Myers either...I am talking about Dr. Loomis.  Clearly, this was an attempt by Zombie to cater to this generation's 20-something year olds.  As a result, I fear that many people who were too young to grow up with the original "Halloween" will probably like the remake better because they can unfortunately relate to these types of characters as being part and parcel of this generation.  Oh well, to each his own.<br /><br />At any rate, I give Zombie credit for at least trying to be creative and imaginative with the remake to some extent and not copying it word for word (although he did do some copying for sure) like the remake of "Psycho".  That said, the "Halloween" remake would have been better if it had not tried to be "Halloween", but rather if it had attempted to be a modern slasher with a different name basing itself on its own individual charm because this movie could have done that.  Sure, some changes would have had to have been made, but it could have survived on its own merit without being a remake of "Halloween".  However, the fact of the matter is that this is an inferior remake of one of if not the greatest horror movie of all-time, and I cannot assign it more than two (2) stars because it is simply categorically inferior to John Carpenter's original classic masterpiece in every conceivable way.  Actually, I feel compelled to mention that when strictly compared to the original John Carpenter's "Halloween", this movie would get an utter ZERO and John Carpenter's version gets every bit of FIVE STARS and then some.  However, I am grading this movie on its own merit and not just as a comparison...thus, the TWO STARS for a somewhat entertaining slasher.<br /><br />In conclusion, the remake is different enough to stand on its own, but it lacks the spirit of the original classic, and it is simply no where near as good or as scary as the original.  However, this is par for the course for these Hollywood remakes of the classics.  I am wondering what is next?  As a matter of fact, it should be noted that the only remake, in my opinion, that has measured up to the original would be the remake of "Cape Fear" by Martin Scorcese.  Why was that successful and effective?  Surprise, it had great acting, great execution and a great director!  There is a hint Hollywood if you want to remake classic movies, but what difference does it make?  I mean, hell, Rob Zombie is laughing all the way to the bank.</p></body></html>

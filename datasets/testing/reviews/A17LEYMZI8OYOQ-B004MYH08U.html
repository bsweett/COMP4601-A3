<meta name="summary" content="Superhero Spoof"></head><body><p>I've never seen the 1940s serial version of THE GREEN HORNET and, although I'm sure I watched an episode or two of the 1960s television series with Bruce Lee, I really have no memory of it.  I also don't recall ever reading the comic book or hearing the radio show.<br /><br />Truthfully, superhero movies are not really my thing.  I may have enjoyed them thirty years ago, but I have long since outgrown that sort of entertainment.<br /><br />Thus, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I started viewing this new version of THE GREEN HORNET, primarily because it's really a spoof of the genre.  Much of the film works, but also much of it doesn't work.<br /><br />As all loyal followers of this superhero know, The Green Hornet is a masked vigilante whose real identity is multi-millionaire Britt Reid, and his trusted sidekick, Kato, assists him.<br /><br />In this version, Reid is played as a wealthy, egotistical, somewhat cowardly, schmuck who dreams of being a superhero, and it's his driver, Kato, who is really the brains and the kick-ass brawn of the duo.<br /><br />That's a very funny concept, and it works quite a bit of the time...until it becomes tired, repetitive and disintegrates into little more than a special effects/CGI action movie.  That's sad, because this picture could have become a classic lampoon, much like MEN IN BLACK was to sci-fi films.<br /><br />Seth Rogen, who co-wrote the uneven screenplay with Evan Goldberg, is quite good as Reid and Jay Chou is a perfect choice for Kato.  However, it's Christoph Waltz' amusing, low-key playing of the demented super-villain that you'll remember most in this handsomely produced film.<br /><br />Michel Gondry directed a top supporting cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos.<br /><br />?

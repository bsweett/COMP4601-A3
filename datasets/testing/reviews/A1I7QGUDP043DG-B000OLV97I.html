However, the film is entertaining on its own, though they had to revise things to fit within the time limits on the screenplay. My 16 year old son was a little disappointed that there were parts of the book left out, or even changed, but it was still a good adaptation. When a young boy named Eragon stumbles upon an egg containing a magical dragon, the lad is saddled with a responsibility that dates back years. Can he fulfill a legendary destiny, or will Eragon's stubborn nature get in his way?<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

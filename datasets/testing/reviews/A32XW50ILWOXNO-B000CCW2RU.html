<meta name="summary" content="A box office flop. And a surprisingly fun action movie."></head><body><p>"The Island" is the only box-office disaster of director Michael Bay's career.  It's also his best film.<br /><br />It includes all the Bay cinematic standards - dramatic slow-motions, incoherent close-ups of screaming faces, camera swishes and pans, a Eurotrash villain, a carnage-ridden car chase. And yet it works this time - the script isn't completely stupid or amoral, like the "Bad Boys" series, and Bay has found a movie where he doesn't have the need to endlessly objectify women.<br /><br />Unlike Steven Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence" or "Minority Report," "The Island" isn't precisely a thinkpiece. It's more thoughtful than a superhero movie, though. "Batman Begins," for its many strengths, is ultimately forgettable. "The Island" will have a little more staying power with me.<br /><br />The movie opens in the near future, at a giant complex housing the last living humans to survive the nuclear contamination outside, although, strangely, they keep finding survivors. The people work on assembly lines injecting vitamins into tubes leading through the walls. Then - who knows where they go?<br /><br />All of the workers await their invitation to the island, the last remaining contamination free zone in the world.<br /><br />One of the survivors, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), has questions. Why must he always wear white? Why can't he have bacon at breakfast instead of oatmeal? Why isn't he allowed to have "too much proximity" to women, specifically Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson). What are these dreams he has of a boat? And dreams he has of being strangled?<br /><br />There are answers, and they involve the real nature of the "people" living in the complex: They're clones waiting to be used by their owners out in the real world, should they ever need them. The owners have been told by the doctor (Sean Bean) who runs the complex the clones live in amniotic fluid, and never reach consciousness. But when their organs were harvested, they failed. Thus the clones must eat, breathe, run around, live. Thus the illusion. An invite to the island is really the clone's death, revealed in a graphic scene involving a recent winner (Michael Clarke Duncan) whose liver is needed for his football-star owner in the real world.<br /><br />Lincoln Six Echo finds out, hatches an escape with Jordan Two Delta, and the second act of "The Island" shifts into a action movie, about 45 minutes of top-shelf mayhem.  The car chase involves a bounty hunter (Djimon Hounsou) and his crew,  a semi truck, an armored truck, about  ten futuristic Pontiacs and two hovercraft motorcycles out of "Return of the Jedi." It's the best of its kind since "The Matrix Reloaded." Act three involves finding the owner of Lincoln Six Echo, also played by McGregor, and returning to the underground complex.<br /><br />The logic of "The Island" is a bit creaky - given what we know about the clones at the end of the film, it seems unlikely that just one would have his doubts about the whole system. Mixing the genders seems pointless, too - since it's unimportant for to mix for medical purposes. But you can deconstruct most science fiction flicks. "The Island" passes the essential action test: Does it work in the moment? Is it cool? Is it loud and burly? Does it have a little bit of humor?<br /><br />McGregor and Johansson - who has never and probably never will again look this good - aren't A-list stars, and that may have dimmed the box office returns, but they make the transition from mildly content clones to fear-for-their-life to passionate rebels about as well as could be expected. Bean is appropriately smarmy and English and Hounsou, tabbed to be cooler than everyone in the movie, is.<br /><br />Bay shows what, for Bay, is restraint. After the absolute nightmare that was "Bad Boys II" - that nihilistic, racist junk made $200 million - and the equally brutal, Bay-produced "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," this is a surprise. And, given the returns, a disappointment. That "The Island" fell flat with critics proves some of them are getting a little tough to please; that it fell flat with audiences proves there is something the 2005 moviegoing water.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best of its genre"></head><body><p>A group of hired theives get set up while doing a hit on a jewellery store and they suspect its one of them. A very black and clever movie with fantastic acting from the entire cast and brilliant scripting and directing  from Tarantino. Beware that the movie has quite a bit of content that some  might find very disturbing. Not nearly as funny or enjoyable as Pulp  Fiction.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great fun, but with some plot inconsistencies"></head><body><p>Just about every Alfred Hitchcock film involved an innocent and everyday man caught up in some plot where he doesn't know what is going on or how to save himself from it.  The Bourne Identity modernises this method.  There's more action, and instead of an everyman in the lead role, we instead have a deadly assassin who doesn't know what he is because he has amnesia as a result of being shot and left for dead.  We follow Jason Bourne as he tries to figure out who and what he is while simultaneously trying to stay alive.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about this film.  The mystery is interesting - we know more about Jason than he does himself, because we see his (former) employers at work, but that only helps keep the plot moving.  I especially like how the action scenes leap out of nowhere - the film turns from exposition or mystery solving to violent, brutish action in seconds.  Finally, the acting and characterisation by the main characters is great - Matt Damon is good as always.  He has a Harrison Ford-like quality of being able to appear frightened and highly competent simultaneously.  He is joined by Franka Potente (little known in America except from "Run Lola Run") who does a very good job in the thankless role of the innocent girl caught up for the ride.<br /><br />The film straddles the line between mystery-thriller and action film.  The two parts blend seamlessly.  Unfortunately, there are a number of little things that pull the film's overall enjoyability down.  Most annoying is the plot surrounding the assassination attempts on an ex-dictator.  Firstly, the dictator is portrayed as a scenery-mashing, bug-eyed monster in a performance that is jarringly out of place in a film of subtlety.  Secondly, there is confusion surrounding the second assassination attempt.  We see in the newspaper the next day that it was successful, but we know (because we saw it) that it wasn't.  What's the dictator's game?  Is he faking his death to escape further attempts?  Is there a cut scene later on where we would have seen him assassinated?  The story leaves this dangling, and it's annoying.  Secondly, when Bourne bribes an official, he uses American money.  Since the action takes place in Paris, why doesn't he use Euros?  Because some people in an American audience wouldn't recognise them?  In a movie that prides itself on being smart, this is a glaring error.  Thirdly, there seems to be no rationale for the CIA to be trying to assassinate Bourne (as opposed to capturing him to find out what happened).<br /><br />While you're watching the film, most would not notice these problems, but upon thinking about it afterwards, you feel like the film was only good and not great.  Another example - if the car chase had taken place in New York instead of Paris, and had Bourne's car been a Lincoln Towncar instead of a Mini, the car chase would not be very interesting.  But it's only on hindsight that these questions arise.  All-in-all, it's a fun and interesting movie, of high quality, as evidenced in the performances of Damon and Potente.<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras like deleted scenes and a director's commentary.  The sound and video are good (as expected).</p></body></html>

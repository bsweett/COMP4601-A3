<meta name="summary" content="It really is more about Charlie than Willie Wonka this time around"></head><body><p>Willie Wonka, Willie Wonka,<br /><br />The amazing chocolatier.<br /><br />Willie Wonka, Willie Wonka,<br /><br />Everybody give a cheer.<br /><br />He's modest, clever and so smart<br /><br />He barely can restrain it<br /><br />With so much generosity<br /><br />There is no way to contain it!<br /><br />To contain it,<br /><br />To contain, to contain, to contain!<br /><br />Hooray!<br /><br />For those of us that grew up with "Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" it is hard to approach "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and not start doing the Oompa Loompa song from the former every time the computer cloned Deep Roy shows up in the latter.  I must admit to having not yet read Roald Dahl's original book to include it in the mix as well, and while I am sure that makes a difference to the millions who have, I would not be one of that number (although certainly I am curious as to how this movie will imprint on young children for whom this is their first cinematic trip to the Chocolate Factory).<br /><br />The justification for "remaking" the classic Gene Wilder film is established in the title, which indicates that this time the story is more about Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) than it is about Willie Wonka (Johnny Depp).  That things will be different this time is not do so much that despite the above ditty and the Oompa Loompa's singing commentary on the demises of each of the other children this is not a musical, but that Tim Burton is the director.  As soon as you see the sorry state of the Bucket's shack it is clear this is one of his films, and the Teutonic architecture of the Chocolate Factory and the gardens of earthly delights inside is only more evidence for the inevitable conclusion that Burton is the perfect director for Dahl's story.<br /><br />Actually I liked the parts of this 2005 that took place outside the Chocolate Factory more than the trip inside, which is partially because basically the same things happen to the other kids that happened in the other film (and, I believe I can safely presume, in Dahl's book).  Before the journey inside Charlie's grandparents keep trying to steal all of the scenes inside the shack, but there is something endearing about a poor but happy family (think the Cratchits with another generation thrown into the mix, albeit all in one bed).  However, the best part of the film comes at the end when we go beyond the happy ending of the original film, and not just because it is something different.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore provides the same sort of simple, naturalistic performance he did in "Finding Neverland."  Consequently he makes Charlie a rather ordinary good kid, so that he comes out ahead on his own and not simply by default because the other children are such brats.  I found Johnny Depp's peculiar way of speaking as Willie Wonka to be pretty effective (clearly he is in his own little world) and commiserate with the focus this time around on Charlie rather than the chocolate maker.  As for the idea that Depp's performance is based on Michael Jackson, I have to say that I do not see it.  The pale skin is because Willie Wonka never goes outside into the sun and if such pigmentation was enough to invoke the new man without a country then Burton's "The Corpse Bride" represents Jacko-mania.  Depp's Wonka is a strange little man, who is not particularly endearing, which is exactly what is required for most of the proceedings.</p></body></html>

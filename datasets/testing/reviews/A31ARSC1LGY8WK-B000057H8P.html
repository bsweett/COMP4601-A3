<meta name="summary" content="A monument to Gene Kelly and the great Arthur Freed unit at MGM"></head><body><p>"Singin' in the Rain" is one of the all time great films.<br /><br />It stands as a monument to the talents of producer Arthur Freed, the MGM musical unit he ran, and above all the great Gene Kelly.<br /><br />Period songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown are brilliantly interwoven into a story of the coming of sound to Hollywood.<br /><br />The Studio system had its faults but it also allowed films such as this to be made - and we should all be grateful for that.</p></body></html>

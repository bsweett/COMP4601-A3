His ridiculous cutaways, speed-ups, distorted angles, strange lighting and COMPLETELY unnecessary subtitles might seem cool to the inexperienced, but if you are a true film fan, you soon realize that none of it adds anything to the film other than make it harder to watch. Denzel, Walken, Fanning, Mickey and even Anthony turn in good performances. The others are just kind of there. As far as the plot goes, it's OK. (Warning! Possible spoiler ahead). A lot of it seems retread from a lot of other revenge films, and I have just one question: with all the other firepower he bought, did Creasy ever hear of bulletproof vests? Duh....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black is Funny but cant quite carry film into great hights."></head><body><p>The Producers of "Napolean Dynamite" bring their newest and 2nd film "Nacho Libre" into the Ring.<br /><br />Jack Black stars as Nacho an Half Mexican Half White "Servant Of God" who dreams of one day becoming a Professional Wrestler, When Nacho finds out that there are tag-team wrestling matches that he can compete in he joins up with Esqueleto played quite well by H&eacute;ctor Jim&eacute;nez, together they embark on their dream to be proffesional wrestlers, though they lose they're first match pretty badly the crowd grows a liking to them resulting in the owners of the establishment paying them a pretty hefty sum of cash to come entertain the crowd and lose. Esqueleto then reveals to Nacho the amazing power that Eagle eggs contain, he tells the gullible Nacho that if he eats an Eagle egg that he would posess the power of the Eagle, never lose a wrestling match and become the best wrestler in the world, even greater than the infamous Ramses. Nacho soon gets the oppertunity to use his eagle powers in the 2nd tag team loss, as I am sure you guessed, Nachos "Eagle Powers" were not aparent in the match and Nacho finnaly concludes after several more matches (all losses), that the "Eagle Egg Powers" were a complete joke as well as a scam.<br /><br />Soon Nacho gets the oppertunity to fight against 6 or so other men, all 6 of the men will fight against eachother at the same time, the last man standing will have the chance to fight Ramses for the wrestling title. Nacho fairs rather well but comes in 2nd place in the runner-up position. Extremely dissapointed in himself and his 2nd place finish, Nacho runs off to live in the wilderness and vanish from his home at the Orphanage/church forever. We soon find out that the wilderness for Nacho is actually just about 50-75 feet up on a hill away from the town, Esquelito easily finds him and reveals to Nacho the the Winner of the last match was hurt and would not be able to fight and that Nacho, coming in the runner-up position would now have the oppertunity to play against the Great Ramses. Nacho tells the Orphans and his girl-crush @ the Convent that he will fight and beat Ramses and use all of the money that he wins fighting, on the Orphans (feild trips, presents ect:). Though Nacho does not start off the fight against Ramses well he soon changes as he sees that his crush and the orphans have come to see him fight and cheer him on, he obviously finds a new strength within him and to finish Ramses off, he uses a sort of eagle jump which I cannot rightfully explain. Of course he wins and uses the money as he said he would and they all live happily ever after.<br /><br />You can easily tell that "Nacho Libre" was made by the same people that made "Napolean Dynamite", the colors & Visuals are quite a bit alike, they both haave the same kind of pitiful yet laugh out loud humor and all around they both have that pointless feel about them, but unlike "Dynamite", "Libre" does not have that same kind of ridiculously funny humor. All around the screenplay for the movie is just not as funny as "Napolean Dynamite", the only thing that really keeps the film afloat is the hysterical and well done acting of Jack Black playing Nacho as well as Hector Jiminez's performance as Esquelito who delivers that same kind of performance that the guy that played Pedro had in "Dynamite".<br /><br />Nacho Libre's first 15 minutes were actually very bad but as time goes by the film's pace qickens bit by bit and manages to be decent. Even though this movie was made on a 25 million dollar budget AND advertising it couldnt be a scab on "Napolean Dynamites" butt.<br /><br />If you didnt like "Napolean Dynamite" than you most definatly will not like this and if you liked or loved "Napolean Dynamite" like I do then trust me when I say that going into this movie, dont have expectations to high or you will certainly be dissapointed because it really is a big step down from "Dynamite"<br /><br />Grade: C</p></body></html>

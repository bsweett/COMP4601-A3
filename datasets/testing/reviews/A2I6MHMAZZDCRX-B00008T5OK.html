She truly wants to devote her life to God, but struggles with the rules.  When the Mother Abbess sends her to take care of Captain von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, she gets more then she bargained for.  The children are in desperate need of love, and she and the captain begin to fall in love as well.  Meanwhile, Austria is in danger from the advancing Nazi threat.<p>"The Sound of Music" is one of those feel good films.  I smile the entire way through it.  In my mind, it's Rogers and Hammerstein's best musical.  All the songs are easily singable and memorable.  Who doesn't know "My Favorite Things," "Do-Re-Mi," or even the title song?  Yet these songs are set into a fun love story against an interesting back drop.  The movie does loose a little steam in the second act, but my only real disappointment is the cutting of two songs from the play.  "How Can Love Survive?" and "No Way to Stop It" add some fun and help flesh out the character of the Baroness.  In spite of these things, I still love the movie version, however.<p>The two disc set is a wonderful way to own this classic movie.  The picture and sound are wonderful, and the disc is packed with information.  I especially enjoyed the documentary on the second disc because it includes information on the real von Trapps.<p>If you haven't seen this classic piece of American cinema, don't hesitate.  If you're looking for the perfect disc to own, this is it.  It may be harder to track down the two disc edition, but in my mind, it's well worth it.</p></body></html>

Brett Ratner, a favorite from "The Family Man", succeeded brilliantly with the film.  It's great to have fans who have not read the books get the idea of how Lechter was captured in the first place, and Hopkins sparkles in the role -- you can see that his antagonism with Will Graham (Norton...a surprise for me; terrific as the agent!) is even stronger than with Clarice.  In adding to Lechter's role, the screenwriters and Ratner not only capitalized on the character's fame and Hopkins' brilliance, they gave us footage that was crucial to understanding the triangle between the three men.<p>Ralph Fiennes is disturbing as Dolarhyde, and the house in which he lives is even creepier than in the book. Emily Watson is delightful as the "foil" for his strangeness.  The tattoo was done masterfully.<p>One of the chief positives for me was the wonderful score by the greatest name in movie music, Danny Elfman.  Alternatively brooding and menacing, with soaring leaps of action, the music deserves its own awards.<p>Outstanding, all the way around!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No Doubt."></head><body><p>Doubt (2008) tries to pass itself off as being about a morally ambiguous situation in which a conflict arises between an old nun and a young priest and there is simply insufficient information to determine who is the real wrongdoer.  However, what this film is really about is such questions as those of faith and certainty and doubt - the kinds of questions that plague philosophers.<br /><br />For a movie about a moral problem with insufficient information the movie fails for failing to take a clear unequivocal stance in comdemning a clear wrong - either the clear wrong of a man preying on young children or the clear wrong of gossiping about those you know and damaging their reputations.  There is no "doubt" about this matter.  Both are clear wrongs and it must be one or the other.<br /><br />As a philosophical movie that calls into question the nature of faith, the movie also fails in providing no termination point to the endless succession of generating doubts other than the apparent fact that absolute skepticism is self-refuting.  As such, the movie ends up wallowing in doubt which ultimately will lead to despair.  The movie does nothing to rectify this situation, offers no way out of this dreaded impasse, and leaves us in the midst of the mental meltdown of the old nun afflicted with this disease.  For failing to offer us hope and a foundation upon which one can build one's faith, this movie fails as well choosing instead to leave us dangling right over the abyss.<br /><br />The movie also tries to address Catholic issues, showing the apparent conflict between the old-pre-Vatican II church and the changes made post-Vatican II.  The movie considers the "old church" to be one based on discipline and ethically rooted in the notion of virtue, which the modernist priest seeks to replace with "kindness".  The well-meaning and idealistic young nun is certainly a likeable character in her innocence; however, it causes her to become so na?ve that she cannot even recognize that members of her own class are not listening or misbehaving until the old nun tips her off.  (Also, she thinks that FDR, Lincoln, and JFK were the three greatest presidents and states this pronouncement ex-cathedra coming straight from the chair of the self-appointed historical experts we all apparently know and look up to.)  Fortunately, the young nun learns that in order to control her class she must enforce some form of discipline, although she is not a harsh disciplinarian and apologizes once for being too harsh.  The old nun supposedly represents the pre-Vatican II church and places a portrait of Pope Pius XII above the board.  What is odd in this movie is how much power this woman has over a priest.  Further, she does not go to the proper channels, legal and hierarchical, but rather confronts the man himself, making a very awkward situation.  Ultimately however we simply do not have enough information to make a proper judgment as to who the guilty party is.  But we do know that we must unequivocally condemn them for either preying on young boys or for ruining the reputation of a good man.  The old nun appears to suffer from scrupulosity and is haunted by doubts and fears of sin in her own life and the lives of others.  She is a sympathetic character once we begin to understand the illness that afflicts her.  Unfortunately, the movie gives us nowhere to go from here.  It offers this woman no way to make redress, no way to ease her fears, no way to quash her doubts, and no foundation on which to build her faith.  As such, the movie creates a deplorable situation where everything becomes ambiguous and then wallows in its own doubt and moral relativism.  The movie of course will say that it is designed to make one think and that it is not meant to be "anti-Catholic", but ultimately it does neither and seems to serve largely as the all-too-familiar charges leveled against the church concerning pedophile priests, intolerant and strict old nuns, and a failing faith plagued by nagging doubts in a society in which doubt has been turned into a virtue.  As such, I feel that this film is positively harmful and its message is extremely negative and dissatisfying.  In the last scene, one searches for some hope but finds none.  Only further and further doubt persists.  Much as today's culture finds itself in.  A lack of fundamental trust where paranoia, fear, and mistrust run rampant.  A situation where it is possible to denounce those you know and work with for various crimes, real and imaginary.  And a general cloud of ambiguity that covers the whole thing making us believe that there are no moral absolutes anymore.  Thus, we see the real rot that has sank in as moral relativism inflicts its harm upon our culture and society and as doubt develops and lack of trust and paranoia ensues.<br /><br />--  a Catholic reviewer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than I expected"></head><body><p>It took me quite a few months after buying this to actually watch it - I seem to be getting worse & worse for needing to watch a film in the right mind frame, or when it's "appropriate". Plus, I've been told this film isn't that great.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised how scared I was watching this film. You'd think after a while you would be desensitised after watching a lot of horror films, but I jumped loads, and after it had finished, insisted on switching on all the lights in the house. And then I was too scared to go to sleep. Never has a film affected me as badly as this did.<br /><br />I'm not much of a fan of Harrison Ford, but loving Michelle Pfeffer. She is such an amazing actress, and I noticed it most in this film. It's all in the eyes with her in this, especially in the bathtub scenes. She manages to portray so much just through her eyes, and it's brilliant. Most actresses would probably fail miserably at this, but she does it well.<br /><br />The film severely drags in the middle however, and for me, this stopped me giving it a higher rating. It starts well, it ends well, it doesn't work so well in the middle. Robert Zemeckis could have easily trimmed this by half an hour, and made it a much better movie. Nothing much happens in the middle, apart from some boring stuff with an Ouija board, and that's about it.<br /><br />It's not up to scratch as some of the other movies that Robert Zemeckis has done, including the fabulous Back To The Future trilogy, Castaway (this was entirely filmed during on the break on the film) and Who Filmed Roger Rabbit being some of his best.<br /><br />If you can, pick up this film for cheap (which you should be able to now), cos you'll regret it. It's one of those films you will watch once, and never watch again, but I've definitely found, it's a film that sticks with you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Effecitve Formula Comedy that you can't help but enjoy!"></head><body><p>OK...so Dodgeball relies on alot of formula tricks...ball to the groin, stupified underdogs...you name it.  But this is a downright funny film that can hold it's own and make you laugh.<br /><br />Essentially, a group of slacking underdogs is going up against the big corporate machine...and the battlefield is a dodgeball court.  But the quality casting (Stephen Root proves he can handle any script thrown at him and has an extremely memorable role in this film) and smart directing (The film NEVER takes itself too seriously or tries too hard for the laughs) make this a worthwhile flick.<br /><br />Terrific gift for most anyone.</p></body></html>

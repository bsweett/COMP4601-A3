<meta name="summary" content="Whirlwind Film-making"></head><body><p>The movie begins with a bang (literally and figuratively), and the viewer is immediately sucked in to the story, which, for the most part, works its way backwards in small segments, giving the viewer brief moments of continuity so that the viewer has some sense of chronology in this tale told in reverse.<p>This was my first experience with Guy Pearce in a leading role, and he was impressive, accurately portraying Leonard Shelby's sense of hopeful but frustrated determination to overcome his short-term memory loss.  Unlike Dory in Finding Nemo, however, Shelby's condition is not used for comic relief.  Instead, the story weaves its way in and out of Shelby's in-the-moment sense of reality, bringing him into contact with a variety of interesting characters, most of whom viciously manipulate him.<p>Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss (of Matrix fame) both play supporting roles, as does CSI/ER veteran Jorja Fox.  But the story primarily focuses on Pearce's Shelby, and his desperate attempts to find his wife's killer...and himself.<p>Although I have only watched it once, it would probably be as interesting to view again now that I know what to look for.  Not sure I would want to own it, but a very interesting story that compels you to follow it to completion.</p></body></html>

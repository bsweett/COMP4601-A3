Of course, the Presley estate would never allow actual Elvis music to used in this film (it would probably cost five times what went into the film in the first place), so, as far as I'm concerned, ANY film about Elvis without his voice suffers.  That's what made him the King.<br />You could have Elvis battling a mummy AND Martians and, if he sang, people would believe it.  Look at his movies!  The public bought just about all of them when they were released.  Letting Elvis sing would allow anyone watching the film to understand why he was who he was.  (But I can't blame the filmmakers for that because this is a very low-budget film).<p>In the extras, the writer/director admits that, trying to submit BUBBA HOTEP in festivals, he didn't know which genre to label his film.  That's another major problem: it never really decides what it wants to do.  It's never particularly funny and it's never scary.<br />It's not hard to see Bruce Campbell as Elvis and a lot of screen time goes into explaining how the King ended up in a Texas nursing home, but too little time is spent trying to convince us that the great Ossie Davis is JFK.<p>By the time it was over, it felt like a dry curiosity, not a camp classic.<br />And I really wanted it to be camp classic.</p></body></html>

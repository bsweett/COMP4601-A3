<meta name="summary" content="(Something) of the Dead"></head><body><p>Positive: It did have a nice flow to it with good control over the increasing tension as the virus type organism went through it's infectious protocol however predictable it was going to be.<br />Negatives:<br />(1.) The horror consisted of the usual sharp object though body; usual closeup gun shot appliances; typical "buy at any costume & display" Halloween supply store type appliances for zombie style facial changes.<br />(2.) Louisiana bayou swamps don't belong in Iowa. Fire pots in the streets, broken glass and a few turned-over cars with trunk/hood lids up to represent looting and chaos is cheap and really really old. Tall chain link fences used by the military to control a hundred people in a confined area just doesn't work anymore and wouldn't work anyway (my rabbit could push it over). Another cutesy ambiguous ending following the usual atomic bomb dropped on city visual.<br />(3.) Overall not very creative especially when relying on a medical text for concepts and visuals of infectious diseases.<br />(4.) Writers, producers & directors why don't you try working your butts off and come up with something really unique. Serving the same meal day after day may keep you alive (or is it dead?) but there is more to living you know.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="20th anniversary edition"></head><body><p>Some extra features on the making of the film with Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, etc.  Still a wild ride of a film all these years later.  Alot of Phil Tippets stop-motion effects would be CGI today.  This edition contains both the original theatrical edition and the extended unrated version.  The later is considerably more violent -- particularly in the scene where Boddicker's men shoot up Murphy.  Nice performances by Weller (who is now a professor of Roman history at the University of Syracuse, NY), Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith (Red on THAT 70'S SHOW) as the utterly vile Clarence Boddicker, Ray Wise, Ronny Cox -- in the first several coporate villain roles he would play like TOTAL RECALL -- and Miguel Ferrer.</p></body></html>

Previous incarnations included a movie-only edition spread over two sides of a single disc and an extras-packed two DVD set, part of the Oliver Stone Collection that came out a few years ago. What's new on this one? Aside from all the extras from the last version, only a feature-length documentary and that's it.<p>All of the extras on the previous edition are included as is one new addition, a 90-minute documentary entitled, "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy." It uses Stone's film as a jumping off point in which to revisit the events of and surrounding the assassination and examine the cult of conspiracy theorists. There is some fantastic on the set footage of Stone in action and interviews with most of the star-studded cast. Detractors of the film (Walter Cronkite and a film critic from The New York Times) and its supporters (Robert MacNeil from the MacNeil/Lehr Report) are interviewed, providing an excellent snapshot of the controversy that swirled around the film at the time. This is an excellent, in-depth documentary that even includes interviews with Marina Oswald and fascinating archival footage of the real Oswald, including his infamous death on live TV at the hands of Jack Ruby.<p>For casual fans of the film who already own the Oliver Stone Collection version, buying this new one probably isn't really worth it. For hardcore fans of JFK and Stone, the inclusion of this impressive documentary is worth the price of purchase. For completists, however, one glaring omission is AMC's excellent episode of Backstory that was done on the making of the film. Perhaps this will be included on yet another future edition of this film. That being said, this is a solid two DVD set for a landmark film. JFK is essential viewing for any fan of cinema.</p></body></html>

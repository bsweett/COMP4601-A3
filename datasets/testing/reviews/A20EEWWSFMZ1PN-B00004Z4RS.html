So I did not have any preconception or know if any of the charters are important or known.<br />The story is clear. You can tell the bad guys from the good. They do not try to mask anything and did an excellent job of telling the back-story. They picked the right actors for the parts and the actors did not over shadow the characters they played. You have to stretch your imagination a bit but it is worth it. The only drawback was the morals of you get what you ask for in spades.<br /><br />Bottom line is it is worth watching once to say you saw it.</p></body></html>

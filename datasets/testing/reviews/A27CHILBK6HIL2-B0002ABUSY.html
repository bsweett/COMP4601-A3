His little trilogy spawned hundreds of similar like movies and even created a video game phenomenon. Let's look at zombies, the central idea behind them. The living dead is a frightening subject. Think about it, other human's walking and eating others, while dead! The idea of "zombies" without a doubt came from an actual human practice, cannibalism. This is why it is so frightening, at least the idea of it. The movie on the other hand while it does provide its jumps and jolts does not provide "out of your seat" moments.  I did enjoy some of those tense moments though that build up, but was disappointed when they led nowhere! I was expecting a big jolt with a dash of loud music to accompany it but, nope! The movie is entertaining though, and is worth a look at. The original is a classic because it utilized a satirical undertone to the story, and while this movie tries to capture these contemporary satires of human behavior it fails and all we get are a few cheap laughs that feel forced. Yes, the movie does try to use humor but it's literal, not like the original where the humor was more non-direct. I'll tell you though, for first time director Zack Snyder, this movie was not a bad effort.  It has style all over it.  It's just in the end it turns out cliched, and unfortunately does not close the story, so expect a sequel or pre-quel if this one gets a good turnout at the box office.<p>ACTING: The cast is very well put together and they balance each other out. The cast is likeable because it's not composed of dumbfounded teens with chiseled facial features and bouncy breasts in tight tees. Ving Rhames is probably the only person average moviegoers will recognize, and he is the strong point in the ensemble, but in the end the cast's connection is weak.  Mekhi Phifer's relationship with his pregnant wife is horrible because the audience sees no emotion between them, and in the end you feel that he was just using her for incubation. Fun cast, no emotional connection, but looking at them individually will show more strengths rather than looking at them as an ensemble, which is really what the script should of focused on.<p>BOTTOM LINE: I was only pleased because this movie captivated more suspense than action. I'm a big Resident Evil fan, and I know where the game got its creepy claustrophobic environments, creepy music, great characters, and zombie madness from . . . this movie (the original). The film adaptation of Resident Evil was just action madness, this movie is a big improvement that I wish Resident Evil had. I would also like to see `28 Days Later' and compare, because I heard that was more of a sophisticated horror film rather than one aimed at teens, which this one surely is. The original movie was a classic in the same way that `Kill Bill' will become one. A movie that was shockingly gory and fruitless to a point where it's satire. The remake tried to take itself too seriously and try to be too funny at the same time, big mistake. Also, the zombies in this movie were able to run, jump, climb, and do many other physical actions. Zombies are "brainless" beings, they moan, not hiss and growl, they limp around, not sprint, and they cannot think. The zombies in this movie are some kind of hybrid, an ugly one. I like the zombies you find in Resident Evil games, you think of them as harmless stupid things, but yet they are frightening. See this one for a good time, not for a good movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too Much Budget"></head><body><p>Ang Lee's visual pyrotechnics were stupendous.  They would have made a movie on their own.  But the TV/comic strip Hulk was a fairly modest creation.  An ordinary guy grows into a green muscle man when angered. A smaller effort might have been a more intimate, lovable film.  But as it is, this Hulk has an embarrassing amount of baggage.<p>Bruce's (Eric Bana) brilliant scientist father who worked for the military pushed the boundaries of genetics and was banned from his laboratory. A huge explosion occurs and Bruce is left a 4-year-old orphan. Fast forward to Bruce 34, a brilliant scientist, a loner with a beautiful scientist ex-girl friend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connolly--truly lovely).  He has a history of terrible headaches and nightmares.  Coincidence: Betty and her father, 4-star general Ross (Sam Elliott who could have played this role in his sleep) were at the same army base as Bruce when the terrible explosion occurred. Bruce's experiments are being taken over by corporate interests in the slick persona of Talbot (charming villain Josh Lucas). Coincidence #2:  a new janitor arrives at the lab (Nick Nolte who looks and acts positively feral) who is really Bruce's long, lost father. Bruce is taken off his project.  Bruce gets very angry.  Gets large and green.  Destroys lab, and we are off on a worldwide manhunt. <p>The Hulk in all his green glory is too long acoming.  It seems like half the movie is over before he even shows himself. (Unfortunately, this is not true.)  It is a private irritation with me why it seems to be a rule that all these comic book heroes (exception Batman) must be played by bland, banal types with totally unlived in faces?  I think their stressful childhoods or their awesome powers should entitle them to a few character lines or some manly ruggedness.  But no.  They look like uninteresting, passive choirboys.  The movie has many split screens, framing and curious dissolves that I found irritating and distracting.  Also we were treated to both medium and extra-large Hulks which confused me.  Why in one scene was Hulk barely able to restrain three vicious dogs and in another quell an entire army while destroying mountains?  Answer: the madder he got, the bigger and stronger he got.  <p>I thought the best visual trick was making him back into an ordinary mortal before your eyes.  Also, would like to go on record that I liked the ending. It was funny and clever.  Overall, I would recommend seeing this on the big screen if you intend to see it at all.  When Ang Lee is given full rein with his imagery, it is magic.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer</p></body></html>

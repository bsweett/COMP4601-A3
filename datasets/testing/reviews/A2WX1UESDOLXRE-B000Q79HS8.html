<meta name="summary" content="Bourne is Back!"></head><body><p>Sequels generally tend to be a bit of a let down, but not The Bourne Supremacy. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne, and this time around, Bourne is really angry. The CIA is after Bourne again, this time thinking that he has killed two operatives in Berlin. Bourne was actually 4,000 miles away in India at the time and living with his girlfriend Marie.<br /><br />There are lots of chase and fight scenes, all choreographed perfectly, though the camera was incredibly jolted throughout and too many closeups make it confusing during hand to hand fight scenes. I overheard several theater-goers complaining of motion sickness afterward. It didn't bother me, I liked it-- it only added to the overall tone of the film, which is one of chaos, confusion, and lots of running.<br /><br />Great perfomances by Matt Damon, Joan Allen, and Julia Stiles (who truly looked absolutely terrified when Bourne put a gun to her head). This is definitely a thrill ride, one that's fantastic to see on the big screen, unless you get queezy easily. It's not really too important to see the first film either before you see this one. It would no doubt help you get to know the character better though.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</p></body></html>

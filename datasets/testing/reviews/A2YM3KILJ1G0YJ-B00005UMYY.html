<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly unique movie"></head><body><p>The reason Memento is so amazing is that it's told in reverse.  It's completely unique, a trend-setting idea.  There are small tidbits at a time, just enough to give a clue about what happened.  It's a truly amazing idea that keeps a viewer slightly off-center the entire movie.  Memento is truly ground-breaking when it comes to the movie-making aspect and story-telling style in cinema.<br /><br />The basic story of Memento is about revenge.  When someone wrongs someone you love, to what lengths would you go to avenge their death?  Now, throw in a slight road-block: you have no short-term memory.<br /><br />Leonard (Guy Pierce) wakes up unaware of anything.  The only clues he has are tattooed all over his body.  On his arms, on his chest, everywhere there is a patch of skin he has notes to himself.  The only thing he knows is that all his tattoos, and several polaroid photos, are clues towards the mystery that is his wife's rape and murder.<br /><br />The wide-reaching impact of short-term memory loss is immense.  A person could never go to school, learn a new language, quote a recent conversation, or visit an interesting site that was just happened upon.  And, depending on when the memory lapse hit, a person could forget something a simple as wiping after going to the bathroom.<br /><br />Of course, that could come in handy if someone happened to have a dreadful one night stand; they'd never have to own up to it.  Maybe they have a favorite book; each time it would be the best book ever.  Each surprise movie ending would be the same time and again (would really help when watching movies like Sixth Sense).<br /><br />Either way, the movie is incredibly well made, and a unique idea amidst a sea of retread garbage typically put out by major Hollywood productions.</p></body></html>

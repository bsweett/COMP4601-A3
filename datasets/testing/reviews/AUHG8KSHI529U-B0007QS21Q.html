<meta name="summary" content="Think Marvel Hero more than Asimov and it works better"></head><body><p>I think Will Smith is great on the screen.  Right off the bat, however, he does not need all the profanity his characters are spewing in the past several films.  That aside, this is pretty decent action film.  If you start thinking about Asimov because of the title and the three laws, you will likely hate the film.  However, if you can switch to Marvel Action Hero mode, then this film will seem superior.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Del Spooner who is a troubled soul (like a Marvel Hero, right?).  He has a recurring dream that is increasingly revealed to us throughout the film and he hates robots.  He is almost a Luddite in his attitude towards technology and its effects on human work (the Luddites were 19th century workers from Leicestershire who destroyed the machinery that made them redundant and thereby demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of economic well being and increased productivity - but that is another topic).  For some reason he is close to the supreme scientist of robotics at U.S. Robotics.  He is called in when that doctor apparently commits suicide.  The detective story unfolds from there and the action continually increases in pace.<br /><br />I do not want to reveal any more of the story because I think you will enjoy picking up the details for yourself.  Bridget Moynahan is pretty effective as the very closed robotics scientist, Susan Calvin.  And Alan Tudyk does a fine job voicing Sonny.  Tudyk was the pirate in Dodgeball and making the connection between the two roles is a testimony to his skills as a character actor.  Also, I want to single out Chi McBride. He is an excellent character actor who brings great presence and humanity to the roles he plays.  Here he plays Del Spooner's boss, Lt. John Bergin.  He is an important balance, protector, and foil for Spooner's extreme views and actions.  I mean everyone knows that Robots never commit crimes or hurt humans, right?<br /><br />The animation of the robots is not as effective as it could be.  At certain points they look like so many computerized ants.  However, when you get past that, the movie does work pretty well.  Just remember, think Marvel, not Asimov, and you will enjoy it more.</p></body></html>

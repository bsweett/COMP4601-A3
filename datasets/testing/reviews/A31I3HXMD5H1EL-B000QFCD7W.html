<meta name="summary" content="Great Cast, Disappointing Comedy..."></head><body><p>With John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy as the leads, Walt Becker's "Wild Hogs" should have been a first-rate comedy; instead, it is 'by-the-numbers', and surprisingly flat, relying on stereotypes and old gags in place of originality.<br /><br />The concept of middle-aged men hoping to recapture a zest for life on a cross-country trip has always been ripe with storytelling potential (from "Deliverance" to "About Schmidt"), and making the trek on motorcycles was a terrific variation; but from the outset, something just seemed out of kilter. Travolta's cocky failure lacks any warmth, as does Allen's paunchy dentist (wasting Jill Hennessy, in the clich&eacute;d 'wise wife' role); Martin Lawrence fares better, as a plumber taking a year-long sabbatical to write, surrounded by a houseful of sharp-tongued women, but his introduction feels more like a TV sitcom than a feature film; only Macy's portrayal of a likable geek rises above his material (who would have believed he'd be funnier than Allen or Lawrence?)<br /><br />Relying heavily on classic rock tunes of the seventies and eighties to provide atmosphere, the film quickly introduces the stereotypical gay cop (John C. McGinley, who is making a career out of these roles), in a camping scene so ripe with homosexual innuendos that you may want to send the kids out; of course, the guys run afoul of a 'real' biker gang (headed by a superb Ray Liotta, who, with Macy, gives the best performances of the film), and eventually, they end up in a small town, where Macy finally finds love with the always terrific Marisa Tomei (why she immediately falls for him is another plot-hole in a film that is rampant with them).<br /><br />The film's climax, as the Hogs takes on Liotta's gang, in the town, again offers comic potential, but, other than a terrific verbal exchange between Liotta and Macy ("Shoot his legs!" "I'm a computer programmer, I don't need legs" "Shoot his hands!"), it is completely predictable (even a surprise cameo isn't really much of a surprise). Worst of all, the film's resolution doesn't show any improvement in the lives of the four friends (even Macy returns to Cincinnati, amazingly enough).<br /><br />Director Becker, in the Special Features, said that he bought and sold Harleys to pay his way through college, so the script was a 'natural' for him, and that he let the cast improvise, extensively, since they were such 'pros'...I wish he'd demonstrated some of that Harley expertise in the film, and had asserted more control directing his cast...it might have made for a better film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of Carpenter's best films and a classic scifi-horror"></head><body><p>In what has to be his best film --- even better than Halloween and Escape from New York --- Carpenter does a remake of Howard Hawke's classic 50's scifi The Thing and actually surpasses the original. Carpenter drops the Cold War-paranoia of the original and instead uses the original Campbell short story's theme of paranoia within an isolated Arctic station's group of scientists and soldiers. Where the original had an alien that was onscreen very quickly, Carpenter's alien follows the short story's version and hides itself by killing and copying members of the arctic team. Throughout the film Carpenter effectively uses this plot device to make each character distrust the other members of the team. Any one of them could be an alien in disguise as one of them. It is only during the most extreme situation will the creature reveal itself.<br /><br />The special effects used in the film is top notch even now. Now CGI was used --- this was the early 80's and CGI was still a decade away. Rob Bottin's animatronics, puppets and buckets of blood is still a high achievement for its day and still studied by students looking to enter the film effects field. One special scene where his effects are used well is a scene involving a kennel of huskie sled dogs and one alien impersonating as one of the canines.<br /><br />The acting from Kurt Russell and Keith David (voice of Goliath from the cartoon series Gargoyles) are top-notch. The acting overall for the entire ensemble cast is very good. The ensemble's gradual descent into paranoia as they realize just exactly what they've got hunting them in their compound is near perfect in its execution. Mid-way through the film, the audience has put alot in stock in caring for these characters. There's not one throwaway character in the cast and that is rare in an ensemble-suspense film.<br /><br />The music score is still one of my favorites to this day. Ennio Morricone's simple bass and synthesizer compositions are simple, yet adds a palpable sense of tension, paranoia and terror as the film moves forward. Considering that Carpenter always scores his own films, it seemed like a gamble giving over the reins of scoring this film to another. The end result shows that Carpenter gambled correctly.<br /><br />People who are not big fans of very gory scenes and violence this film is something that they should avoid, but for those who are fans of great filmmaking, this is a must-see. Film students would do well to see a master at work. Now if he can only get back to making films just like this instead of what the studio is handing to him, I think Carpenter still has alot left in him other than more Ghosts of Mars.</p></body></html>

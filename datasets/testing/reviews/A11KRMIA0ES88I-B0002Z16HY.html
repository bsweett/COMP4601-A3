<meta name="summary" content="Downfall"></head><body><p>Downfall dramatizes Adolf Hitler's life from his 56th birthday until he and his mistress, Eva Braun, commit suicide. The film comes from Germany and has subtitles. It treats Hitler as a human being. He is portrayed as charming and charismatic as well as brutal. Bruno Ganz is the Fuhrer. The fall of Berlin is seen through the eyes of his secretary. We get a sense of chaos and madness. There is partying and suicide as the Russians surround the city. We feel the claustrophobia of Hitler's bunker. Swastikas have been used by various cultures for 3,000 years.</p></body></html>

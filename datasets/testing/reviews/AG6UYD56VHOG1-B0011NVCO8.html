<meta name="summary" content="HD Review"></head><body><p>I guess the guy above me didn't read my review. HD DVD is all done. It's Dead. Case Closed!!!!<br />I was going to buy this on HD DVD but the extended cut is not in HD. What a joke for a DVD Format that may soon be dead. I own both HD and Blu-Ray players and I will only buy movies that have extras on them. After all, they are supposed to be able to hold much more than regular DVD.<br />News Update!!!!!!!!!2/19/2008 The battle is over. After a few unconvincing denials of reports about the failure of the HD DVD format, Japanese electronics firm Toshiba announced on Tuesday at 5 p.m. local time (9 a.m. CET) that the HD DVD format it supported had failed to establish itself on the market.<br />Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Toshiba Corp. abandoned its HD DVD technology, surrendering the high-definition video market to Sony Corp.'s Blu-ray in the entertainment industry's largest format war since VHS beat Betamax in the 1980s.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better then what I was expecting too see."></head><body><p>I, unlike other people, did not find this movie to be a disappointment.  I never got to see this movie in the theater and recently got a chance to see the uncut edition. Honestly my very first impression of the movie was "this is cool". Honestly if this movie would have been called "UAC Marines", "Viral Apocalypse" or something else random, this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a sci-fi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission to Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC; this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard sci-fi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment.<br /><br />The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fan boys (girls?) out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a (about 5-10 minute) segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective. Which having never seen this EVER done in a film was really neat. A bit out of place where they chose to do it in my opinion but good nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something that's a 100% identical too its source material (Doom 3) then I'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell. Other than that it's a lot better then what I was expecting too see</p></body></html>

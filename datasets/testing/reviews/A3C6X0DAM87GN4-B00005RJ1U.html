<meta name="summary" content=""Jeepers Creepers"! Did I Actually Watch This?"></head><body><p>"Jeepers Creepers" is a movie I remember hearing a lot of mixed buzz about. Some people\critics hailed it as one of the scariest movies ever! While others said it ranks among the worst ever made. I had wanted to see "Jeepers Creepers" when it was firsted released,but, just never got around to it. Then, one day I just decided to rent it, since I'm a fan of the genre.<p> "Jeepers Creepers" is a movie I think that does have some suspenseful moments. I also think the film's first half bour is brilliant. And by that I mean, it's set-up is wonderful. The suspense slowly builds up because we don't know what kind of movie we are in for. We have no way of knowing where this plot will take us. As for dialogue well, the film suffers, and the movie has too many loop holes that don't bring the movie together, plus, it just gets plan silly. But, I'm getting ahead of myself here.<p> "Jeepers Creepers" starts off as a brother and sister Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving home from school. Soon they encounter a strange driver on the road who nearly runs them right off the road. As they drive on, they see him again, this time, he's off the road, and they see him throwing bodies down a pipe. Now, all of this believe it or not works. But, what happens inbetween this, doesn't work.<p> First of all, the two kids start talking about their mother. Okay, what about her? I don't know. They say that she's change, that she;s not herself anymore. OK, why? Does she have a physical problem? Is she breaking up with her husband? Did her husband die? Or is she just lonely? We never know. Information is given to us, but, it's never completed. We know Trish (Gina Philips) breaks up with her boyfriend, why? The writers were just trying to make this characters have a conversation for the film doesn't become boring until the action happens. But, why make the characters talk about things that won't have anything to do with the movie. We don't want to hear it. Why not try writing USEFUL dialogue?<p> After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it. We find out something about the driver in the begining of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it). And then we start to second guess our opinion of why we rented this in the first place. So now, the film just becomes silly. Here's an example, the kids are soon told they whenever they hear the Harry Warren song "Jeepers Creepers" expect trouble. Never in all my life would I have expected the song "Jeepers Creepers" to represent evil! Also, we are told that the "crepper" attacks ever 23 years! And the funny thing is, no one else knows about this. That leads to another question. Exactly how long has this been going on?<p> Director Victor Salva is not a talentless director I feel. He might be able to actually make a good, scary horror flick one of these days. He just needs to prepare himself better. That's what really breaks this film. The elements are there for a good movie, but, they just weren't used properly. Maybe "Jeepers Creepers 2" will be better. Who knows. I personally would advise you not to watch this movie. If you like the teen horror genre I prefer "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", and "The Glass House".<p> Bottom-line: Suspensefull, but ultimately silly horror film that just doesn't scare us enough but makes us think of what could of been. Decent acting, so-so scrpit.</p></body></html>

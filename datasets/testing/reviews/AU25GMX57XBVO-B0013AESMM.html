<meta name="summary" content="Very Powerful Film"></head><body><p>I am not a big Jodie Foster fan but I have to say this movie I really liked, her role & the movie.  It has the 3 things I look for in a movie; keep my attention from beginning to end, take something away from the movie or can personally relate to it and a good, appropriate ending.  I don't want to spoil it for people who have not seen it, but the ending was great.  Sometimes an ending in my opinion can make or break a film.  Try this movie out, think you will like it.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

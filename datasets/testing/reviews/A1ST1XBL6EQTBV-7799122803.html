<meta name="summary" content="Another Brilliant Stroke Of Creativity For Tim Burton, Johnny Depp & Co.!!"></head><body><p>Tim Burton has a unique conceptual vision as well as visual sense that just stands<br />out above the rest!  The man's work is instantly recognizable and is usually<br />associated with quality. Add to that, since the early 90's, he has found a<br />fellow bizarre bretheren and muse in Johnny Depp, who is arguably one of the<br />most versatile and original actors in the latter 20th Century or early 21st Century.<br />The two are simply magic together!<br />This project, the re-telling of the classic children's story of<br />"Alice In Wonderland", shows no lag in their magic and in fact,<br />adds new dimension to it. (-:<br />An ingenious mix of computer animation and live real time acting,<br />it really takes Tim Burton's already unique vision to another level!<br />The whole cast, including Helena Bonham-Carter (Burton's wife),<br />Ann Hathaway, the legendary Christopher Lee and others, all played<br />their roles magnificently! I dare say it, but this film is an instant classic<br />and will remain as the standard-bearer for future generations of children who<br />will watch it and become engrossed in the story, the special effects,<br />the costuming, the performances, etc., in the same way that the baby-boomers<br />who grew up with "The Wizard Of Oz" were.<br />I enjoyed watching this just as much as my little niece,<br />who I took to the theatre to see this did!<br />It's Thoroughly Entertaining & Timeless!</p></body></html>

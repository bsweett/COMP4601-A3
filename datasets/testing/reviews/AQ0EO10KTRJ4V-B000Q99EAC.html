<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect  "Book-end" for the Rocky Series"></head><body><p>Stallone deserves praise for taking the time and effort to see that the ROCKY series ends on a proper note and comes "full circle" instead of having an American Icon fade away in disgrace as would have been the case if we had been left with Rocky 5.<br /><br />In many ways this film is a "mirror" or an "opposite book-end" to Rocky I as we basically see a man who has come full circle in life with the similiar challenges only made different by the passage of time.<br /><br />Unrelated to the movie itself, Stallone also deserves credit for showing that "60 is the new 40" in today's society for people who are dedicated enough to diet and exercise.<br /><br />Not only does he look great for 60 in this film, he looks better than 50% of the population in their 30s.<br /><br />I also see a "need" for this film in todays' American society.<br /><br />In 1976-1977, when the first Rocky came out, America was at a lowpoint in terms of image, self-esteem, respect, etc....<br /><br />Much of this of course is due to one of our worst Presidents ever.... Jimmy Carter.<br /><br />Rocky became a mobilizing icon to remind Americans about dedication, hard work, sacrifice, and "never giving up".<br /><br />Thru the 80s, America refound itself, Reagan ended the Cold War, the Berlin Wall was torn down, etc...<br /><br />In other words, instead of being negative, America made things happen in the world !<br /><br />Now in late 2006, we have a similiar situation.<br /><br />Much of America has grown soft, fat, lazy, happy and stupid as a result<br /><br />of having it too good for too long.<br /><br />People criticize those trying to take action to protect this Country from an impending crisis.<br /><br />(apparently 50% of our society has no knowledge of history or they would clearly see the importance of action TODAY in the Middle East before we get to the point England, France and Germany are facing already today).<br /><br />Getting to the point.... too many Americans today are apathetic, soft and are trying to rationalize "no action" as a way to live their lives in "cushy" ignorance of reality.<br /><br />Perhaps if we are fortunate, the film ROCKY BALBOA can do for us today  what it did for America in 1977................. namely, get people to remember what hard work, sacrfice, duty, standing for principles and "never giving up" really means.<br /><br />Hopefully this current generation can recapture at lease a glimmer of what made the WW2 generation so strong.<br /><br />Only then can we get back on track and remake America great again as opposed to the disentrgrating cesspool of decadence it is becoming now (like a repeat of the Roman Empire 400AD).<br /><br />"Yo, Aint so bad... hit me again"</p></body></html>

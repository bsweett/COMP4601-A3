<meta name="summary" content="The Critics Didnt Like This Film Cause It Sucked"></head><body><p>Im reading reviews here that say the critics didnt like this film cause it had Ashton Kutcher in it or this n that. They didnt like this film cause it was bad, Truly BAD. I read the rave reviews on this site and purchased it full price thinking it was going to be good so Id take a chance. What a mistake. A bunch of convuluted mixed up crap. Starring Ashton Kutcher who I think should stick to TV and shows like ( That 70s show ) instead of trying to be a film actor because he just dosent cut it. Hes better at comedy. He dosent give a good performance as a serious actor nor did i buy it. Amy Smart was mediocre in this role. The whole film was mediocre at best, barely watchable. Long tedious and boring. Ashton Kutcher stars as a college kid who keeps revisiting his past and going back in time through a notebook he kept when he was younger. The movie is basically about what would happen if he did somthing diffrent in his past and what would happen if he could change it and the situations it would lead to and how it would affect peoples lives. No matter how he changes it the outcome always seems to be bad. Him and his mother encounter a fortune teller during the movie that says something to the extent of you were never meant to be born or you dont have a soul. It all comes together at the end of the film. During all this nonsense he keeps re reading his notebook and starts to go into a transe and his nose starts bleeding. Very lame. I cant even get into all the details of this film- to mixed up to describe. I would recomend you rent this first before purchasing then decide. See if you can take it or even sit through it. 2.5 stars</p></body></html>

So how do we sift truth from belief? ... How do we penetrate years, centuries of historical distortion to find original truth? Tonight this will be our quest."<br /><br />Jacques Sauni&egrave;re (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is killed for a secret. He leaves a mysterious message for Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks). Langdon and Sauni&egrave;re's granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) become partners in a hunt for the Holy Grail. But time is running out for them as they are being hunted down by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) for murder. Whom can they turn to for help? Maybe Sir Leigh Teabing (Brilliantly played by Ian McKellen.)<br /><br />This film relies heavily on the viewer reading the book before viewing.  Sometimes they go out of their way to follow the story. At other times, we get a Ron Howard interpretation of Dr. Robert Langdon and his amazingly distracting hairstyle. Other than that, it is better than not having a movie at all. And as with all formula stories, it is always the last person you would suspect.<br /><br />The extra features can get a little boring as they keep repeating the same thing overt and over in sound-bite form. They keep talking about people that never made it on the film but never say that these people are or show their tryouts.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385504209">The Da Vinci Code</a><br /><br />Angels and Demons [Blu-ray]</p></body></html>

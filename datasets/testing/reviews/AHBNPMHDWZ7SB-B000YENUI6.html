It felt to me like a Russian Goodfellas, or Godfather in essence, of course without the scale and grandiose of those classic mafia films. Maybe it could have been if there were more time devoted to the Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), and not more than half of the movie devoted to the prostitute Tatiana and her daughter. I understand that's what the story was about, and I'm basically complaining about the main plot of the story, but I loved Nikolai's character so much that I wanted to see much more of him. That truly is more of a testiment to Mortensen's performance than it is a criticism of the film. If there were a little more depth to the story (it's only an hour and a half), I wouldn't mind it so much. I just felt like every time I would get sucked into Nikolai's world, the baby subplot pulled me out a little more than I would have liked. I will say though, I really liked how the story came full circle and connected the multiple dots in a very interesting way.<br /><br />This is, like I said, a fantastic film. It has possibly the tensest fight scene that I have ever seen. Major respect goes to Viggo for doing it fully nude. I'm sure thousands of Lord of the Rings chicks lost their marbles after that one. That scene is superb enough for me to recommend this movie to everyone. But as a part of your collection, I am not sure it's for everyone. I enjoy it enough to own it, but I recommend it as a rental first for each to decide for themselves. The transfer iv quite qell done. It's one of Universal's better efforts.</p></body></html>

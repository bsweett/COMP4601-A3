I found that it wasn't terribly disappointing either. The child actors they chose for the pivotal roles did a fine job, and Liam Neeson provides an excellent voice to Aslan. The HD version is very well shot and looks amazing. If you have children, they won't be able to help loving this movie.</p></body></html>

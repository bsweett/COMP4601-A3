<meta name="summary" content="Reality and fairytales creates a special realm"></head><body><p>"Pan's Labyrinth" is a dark-fantasy genre film set in 1944 during the latter stages of World War II in Spain.<br /><br />The blend of reality and fantasy presents the viewer with a unique narrative from the perspective of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who is the protagonist. The world she lives in is extremely harsh with senseless violence all around her, yet it is the vision of an underworld that provides a concurrent existence for her, which highly values her as a princess.<br /><br />The movie does present a few scenes of rancorous violence and this may not sit well with some viewers. However, it represents the brutality that was present during the early Francoist period.<br /><br />Despite the darkness of the plot it is a finely crafted story of personal sacrifice.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

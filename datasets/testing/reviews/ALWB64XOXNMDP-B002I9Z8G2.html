<meta name="summary" content="This movie could be called &quot;Best of Both Worlds Part 2&quot;"></head><body><p>One of the best Next Gen Movies to hit the Silver Screen; this one takes the mystery of the Borg a step further. The producers throw out the hive mind concept and introduce the Borg Queen. It's Trek like it should be. Not all the actors get equal screen time but it a rollercoster ride from start to finish.  If you like the galactic space battle scenes this one is for you.</p></body></html>

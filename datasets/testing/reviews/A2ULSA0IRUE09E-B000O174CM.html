<meta name="summary" content="The Weakest Musical Motion Picture in Recent Memory"></head><body><p>A few notes on this film and the DVD release to help you make your purchase:<br /><br />THE PERFORMANCES:<br /><br />1. Beyonce Knowles : Obviously modelled on Diana Ross, Beyonce flits in and out of this movie, holding us only with her beauty. This woman has no acting ability, lets face it, and her singing is only barely tolerable.<br /><br />2. Jennifer Hudson : A very overrated performance, in my opinion. She sings her heart out, but to me it seemed like a whole lot of nothing. At the most, it seemed like a young woman who wanted people to notice her performance and therefore went over-the-top. I didn't like this performance.<br /><br />3. Eddie Murphy : Adequate, but badly scripted. This role could have been done by any black actor of that age group, and Eddie does not add anything special to the role.<br /><br />THE DIRECTION & FEEL<br /><br />I loved the direction, the sets and the orchestrated choreographed dance and song numbers. It all felt a bit overblown and HEARTLESS but hey thats just me. You'd probably love it more than I did.<br /><br />THE MUSIC<br /><br />We all know this was the weakest aspect of this movie. Even Hudsons' showstopper number (am I the only one waiting for her to shut up?) had no melody really. And other than "Listen" by Beyonce, I don't see anything here worth humming.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />My only sensation after watching this was "What Happened to the Great American Musical?". What happened to classics like "The Sound of Music", "Carousel" and "State Fair"? Those were real musicals. "Dreamgirls" felt like a gigantic ornamental pom-pom stuffed in my face, and I just couldn't bring myself to like it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this movie, sorry. I just have to say that I love musicals, and this was NOT a musical. It disrespects what a musical ought to be.<br /><br />Note to directors : Please do not cast Beyonce in the lead role in films anymore. Its a total waste of precious film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="STILL LIFE IN BONDAGE"></head><body><p>Who would have dreamed in 1963 that Dr. No would be the first of twenty James Bond films?  There have been some misses in those 20 films (Moonraker, Octopussy, to name two), but overall the series has aged quite well, and moves into the 21st century quite adroitly.<br />While ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE remains my favorite Bond film, Pierce Brosnan has done well in his Bond role.  He's dashing but vulnerable, and he is a good actor.  He's joined in this technological brouhaha by the talented Halle Berry.  While this is certainly not Halle's best performance, she shows the versatility and dedication that eventually led to her Oscar win in MONSTER'S BALL.  She's a beautiful woman and she holds her own in the fight game too!  Rosamund Pike is delightful as Ms. Frost, the double agent who battles Halle in the climax.  Toby Stephens does a good job as Graves, but he's not the most memorable of the Bond villains.  The action sequences and effects are stunning, except for the obvious blue screen used when Bond escapes from the supercar.  And the laser in the sky threat has been used twice before in Bond movies:  You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.  John Cleese is cool as Q; Madonna is silly in her cameo, and DIE ANOTHER DAY is one of the worst themes of any Bond movie.  No one will ever replace John Barry as the master of the Bond themes.  And it wouldn't hurt to see Judi Dench soften a little in her role as M.  Nice touch in having B movie actor Michael Masden as the American NSA chief.<br />All in all, a worthy entry in the Bond series; if Brosnan and crew can keep up this kind of pace, we may see Bond hit 50!!!</p></body></html>

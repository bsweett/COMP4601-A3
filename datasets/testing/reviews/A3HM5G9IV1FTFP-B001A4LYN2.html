<meta name="summary" content="Tragedy"></head><body><p>The central character in "There Will Be Blood", oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (played by thoroughbred thespian Daniel Day-Lewis) is a fascinatingly repugnant character. He's greedy, ruthless, cruel, and shamelessly manipulative, to be sure ... but it's really the touch of humanity he occasionally displays that truly makes him tragic, because you can see that beneath all his contempt is a sad, broken-hearted man. Although capable of affection, whenever Daniel feels abandoned or betrayed he reacts viciously and often violently, destroying any possibility of authentic relationships.<br /><br />Throughout the movie his character's fate is tied to that of Eli Sunday, a theatrical minister who, despite superficial differences, is as ruthlessly ambitious as Plainview is. Sunday is Plainview's nemesis and mirror ... their mutual hatred is due to the fact that they surely see all of their own loathsome qualities reflected in the other. Throughout the film the two characters spar, compete, play mind games and torture each other.<br /><br />Although the film ends with a final confrontation between the two characters in which one apparently "wins", powerhouse director P.T. Anderson makes it clear that there are no real winners in this film, just empty characters who sold their souls to the devil long ago. "There Will Be Blood" is an indictment of human nature, the destructiveness of anger and greed, and the American Dream gone horrible awry.</p></body></html>

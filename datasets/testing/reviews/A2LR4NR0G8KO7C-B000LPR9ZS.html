<meta name="summary" content="From cult movie into a display of sadism"></head><body><p>Even being just a little bit better than Saw 2, number 3 should be the end of the Saw series. Jigsaw's cruel games have now about reached their creativity limits. The deadly traps were the only reason to watch the second episode, but the story has now become too hard to believe.<br /><br />How have all these brilliant sadistic traps been constructed by a 70 year old guy and his small sized assistent Amanda? How the hell is such a couple capable in kidnapping grown men? Shame the great Saw movie has been turned from cult horror movie into a display of sadism. (SARR)</p></body></html>

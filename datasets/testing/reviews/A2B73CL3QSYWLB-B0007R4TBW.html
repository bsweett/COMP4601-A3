I thought when the film started off it was a little too quirky for it's own good.  It had kind of a sitcom feel to it which I found a little inappropriate for a film about a young man returning home for his mother's funeral.  The film got it's legs when Natalie Portman's character enters the fray as the epileptic love interest to Braff's psychologically damaged actor.  The chemistry between these two is palpable and unforced.  The film's main strength is when it focuses on their relationship.  Peter Sarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Braff's gravedigger buddy.  In smaller roles some older actors shine:  Ian Holm as Braff's father, Ron Liebman as a doctor, and Jean Smart as Sarsgaard's mother.  By no means a classic but I can envision this film developing a devoted cult following.</p></body></html>

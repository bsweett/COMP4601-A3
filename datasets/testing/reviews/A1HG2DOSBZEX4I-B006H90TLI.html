No Country For Old Men is one of those rare films that pulls its viewers in and makes them think about what they have seen when the film is over.<br /><br />One of the questions I have about the film is into just what genre does it fall. It could be called a thriller, it could be called a modern western it may also fit as extremely dark comedy. The film has some of the best lines I have heard in a film in many years. If I had to place the film in a niche I would call it a reflection on the randomness of violence and its aftermath. The film is also an analysis on the new trends and types of violence that are emerging in modern America.<br /><br />The film follows the arcs of its three main characters. Moss (Josh Brolin) is a welder and Vietnam veteren living in Texas who comes upon a grim crime scene in the desert involving a drug deal gone wrong. Anton Chirgurh (Javier Bardem) is a phychopathic killer after Moss to recover the money found at the crinme scene. Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is an aging lawman who does not understand or like how the world is changing around him.<br /><br />I will not go into details of the plot because this is one of thoses films that must be seen to be truly appreciated. It is enough to know that the Coen Brothers (working from their own adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel) twist the suspense to a level that Hitchcock would have been proud of. The cinematography by Roger Deakins shows off the Texas desrt perfectly.<br /><br />The Bluray disc has very few special features. Included is a 24 minute making of feature and two shorter features dealing with working with the Coen Brothers.<br /><br />This film should not be missed.</p></body></html>

Depending on how you see it, we either feel cheated about such a bizarre, seemingly impossible ending, or amazed at the curve ball thrown at us, under our noses the entire time. We may even wonder if this ending is proper etiquette, or "fair game, for a suspense to employ. Some may have seen it coming, but to those who didn't, it makes for one great surprise.<br /><br />As odd as it may sound, I don't think that you can judge this movie on acting alone. Sure, Kevin Spacey does an exceptional job as Verbal Kint, who is interrogated by Detective Kujan. And Gabriel Byrnne does a commendable performance as Keating, a corrupt cop supposedly trying to steer right, but who gets back into the mix. Some of the performances aren't fantastic, but this is one time where I don't think they have to be. The method of getting to the story's climax is what "makes" this suspense fantastic. With the use of going back in forth in time, from the present in the detective's office where Kint is telling his story, to the past, where we not only learn about the five thugs who decide to the take the big job for Keyser Soze, to learning about each one of the five. There are some plot events that you will naturally look back to as "aha" moments. You can credit the screen writers for coming up with this; a creative job of making this work, which usually doesn't work in movies, or ends up sloppy.<br /><br />In many respects, the mystery surrounding Keyser Soze is what makes this puzzle a little more than the average mystery. As you watch the film, it is actually this character, real or fake, that derives much of the motivation for actions of the thieves, such as their decision to take the big job on the boat. Soze is one of the worst villains of the film, and yet, much of the film you are trying to figure out if the infamous killer is more man or more myth. The mystery surrounding this diabolical character's whereabouts, and his association with evil, seems to give the film's final moments even more significance and tenseness.<br /><br />Smart writing carries this film, albeit with a superfluity of profanity spewed about. Its plot is its main strength, and this is the kind of film you can watch again and pick up on things you missed before. Watch this film remembering to take note of all that is seen, and remembering that sometimes things aren't always what they seem.</p></body></html>

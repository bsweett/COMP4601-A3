<meta name="summary" content="BRILLIANT FILM"></head><body><p>there are no words to describe how good this film is. this film depicts 80s excess and insanity like ive never seen it before!christian bale gives a amazing performance as patrick bateman. patrick has everything going for him, he's young, rich and ceo of company and has it all but you would never know how crazy he was and what was really going on inside his head. the film is set in 1987 and patrick depicts everything about the rich yupies of that era. but theres a deeper side to the film you have to really watch it to know what im talking about. at first you think the guy is just crazy but he is a serial killer but as you watch the film and as it gets towards the end you have to ask yourself was he really a serial killer or is it only in his head? id recomend this film to anyone who loves the 80s or a good suspense movie or black comedy. this is 5 stars!</p></body></html>

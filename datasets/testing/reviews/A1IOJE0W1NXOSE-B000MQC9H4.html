They both want to get away and manage to do this by swapping houses.  Diaz has a mansion in L.A. whereas Winslet lives in a quaint English cottage.  When they arrive at their vacation homes, they both find romance, but not without some complications.  Both women show a nice flair for comedy and they are both likeable heroines.  This is a pleasant movie which will probably appeal to the women in the audience more than to the men.</p></body></html>

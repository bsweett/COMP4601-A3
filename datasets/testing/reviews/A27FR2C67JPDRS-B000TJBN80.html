<meta name="summary" content="The virus returns!"></head><body><p>I'm always weary of horror sequels...they usually just don't cut the mustard (Loved "The Ring" but its sequel was miserably bad!).  This sequel lives up to its entertaining predecessor and may actually be better than the first!<br /><br />The story picks up six months after the virus ravaged London, with a couple (played by Catherine McCormack and the talented Robert Carlyle) who are living with a group of survivors in a boarded up home.  Soon, however, their quiet hideaway is attacked by a group of blood thirsty "ragers" and Carlyle's character shows his true cowardly nature, leaving behind his wife to be killed and saving himself, above all others.<br /><br />When we next see (Carlyle) he is being reunited with his children in an area sanctioned off by the US government and Nato.  With snipers set up to watch the safe zone and giving complete medical exams to clear the returning citizens, the project looks to be a successful attempt to eradicate the virus infected zombies and the virus itself.  But when the couple's two children escape the safe zone, return to their old home and find their mother, still very much alive, the virus returns.  Though the mother doesn't exhibit the signs of the zombies, she carries the disease and can still transfer it, setting a course for the return of the blood spewing zombies.  However, the mother, because she is genetically immune to the symptoms (and possibly her children as well) is an important key in fighting the virus and the chance of truely stopping it from spreading.<br /><br />Juan Carlos Fresnadillo does a good job of following the lead of the first director but upping the action a bit for the second go around. Robert Carlyle does a great job as a very flawed man who will do anything to survive, including turning his back on his own family.  This is a great horror movie, a good summer action movie and definitely worth seeing!  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

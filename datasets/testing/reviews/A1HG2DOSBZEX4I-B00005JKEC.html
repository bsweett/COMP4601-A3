<meta name="summary" content="Bad Day on the Streets"></head><body><p>Antoine Fuqua has made an excellent film for those who are looking for pure action. If your goal is more intelligent fare this may not be for you.<p>The story involves a day in the life of LAPD rookie officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)as he attempts to join an elite narcotics division led by decorated officer Alonzo Harris( Denzel Washington) What Hoyt does not realize is that Harris is not as good a cop as he is made out to be. Denzel Washington (in his Oscar winning role) plays the bad cop with gusto. While it may not be his best performance it certainly is not his worst. Washington comes across as a kind of police version of Tony Montana and the end of the film becomes sort of cartoonish.<p>Hawke does a good job playing the rookie who makes bad choices throughout the film Fuqua says that these choices are all related to ambition and I will buy into that theory to some extent.<p>This is essentially a two character film and both leads acquit themselves quite well. Support is offered by Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Dr. Dre as a member of Alonzo's unit and Snoop Dogg as another dealer on the streets. Los Angeles is portrayed to great effect and the texture is suitably gritty. Fuqua shot the film in parts of the city that most tourists don't see and the viewer feels the pulse of the streets.<p>I will admit that I liked the film more after a second viewing with Fuqua's audio commentary. The disc provides a featurette and trailer plus two music videos.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'W' as in Weak movie about a Weak man"></head><body><p>When those little arm band looking black "W The President" stickers were ubiquitous on SUVs and over-sized pickup trucks and luxury cars in my mind "w" just stood for wrong. But don't get me wrong, Dubya wasn't all bad. He made many better understand and appreciate America it seems to me. But I'll not get into why I say that. Just think about it.<br /><br />Not one of the director's best. (I've extended this review to add a couple things originally left out.) Maybe about as good as ALEXANDER. Geez it always goes back to mommy and daddy with these guys whether it be Alexander the Great or Dubya. Well I like a little bit more exploration of forces other than Poppa (and mother, but oddly enough Barbra gets off very light here! Weird) that create our political figures... I want more than these Oliver Stone flicks give. How media, pr firms, the political parties and operatives and creatures like Karl Rove and most importantly the American people create Dubya is what interests me most. I for one didn't care that much for Brolin as Bush. He's a talented actor but just doesn't look like Bush. Actually I'm not sure why I rented this movie because Bush is out of the White House finally and I'm not interested in him. Colin Powell is presented as the voice of reason, the "moderate" or whatever. As for as I'm concerned he's the worst out of them all for not resigning in protest IF the portrait presented by Stone is accurate. Also, what up with the accent Jeffrey Wright gives Colin Powell? Lol. Look, the movie is somewhat entertaining. A highlight was the portrayal of Condoleezza Rice. A nice little loyal lapdog. Shame on them all.</p></body></html>

Director Christopher Nolan skillfully directs his cast through a fascinating plot abounding with unpredictable twists which he and his brother Jonathan collaborated on.  The artfully designed sets accurately represented Victorian England.<br /><br />Bale playing Alfred Borden and Jackman playing Robert Angier were friends and associates working under a popular magician of the time and also working on their own routines.  A mishap during a water escape trick performed by Jackman's wife Julia played by Piper Perabo caused her unfortunate drowning.  Allegedly Bale had tied a knot around her wrists that she was unable to undo.  Jackman blamed Bale and would seek vengeance.<br /><br />As they launched their careers each man would attempt to sabotage the efforts of the other.  This culminated in the loss of two of Bale's fingers during a bullet catching trick hampered by Jackman.  Bale, however, the superior magician, persevered and found immense fame with his unprecedented trick "The Transported Man".  Jackman tried to copy the ruse but could never perform it as well.  He became obsessed with stealing Bale's diary which would reveal the details of the trick.  Using his alluring assistant Olivia played by Scarlett Johansson, he tried to pilfer Bale's secrets.  His plans were thwarted as Johansson and Bale became lovers.<br /><br />Jackman finally coerced Bale into revealing that eminent physicist Nikola Tesla played by an intense, fearsome looking David Bowie, had invented a machine which juxtaposed science and magic and was the key to "Ther Transporting Man" illusion.  Michael Caine playing Cutter, the architect of Jackman's illusions, had his doubts.  Jackman nonetheless made his way to Tesla's lab in Colorado Springs, no easy feat at that time travelling from Europe.<br /><br />Jackman investerd hoardes of money into Tesla's creation to top the efforts of Bale.  Their cutthroat competition caused hardship for both men as the film concludes in an incalculable finale that concudes the flick on a soaring high note.</p></body></html>

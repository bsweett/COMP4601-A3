<meta name="summary" content="Wrong Turn is a right choice."></head><body><p>Have you seen WRONG TURN? Here is a pop quiz.. (multiple choice) The psycho's in question are? A. They are inbreed. B. They are insane. C. They store body parts in the fridge. D. They have a junkyard of past victims cars. (or) E. All of the above. If you picked E you're right! The filmmakers in the commentary compare the film to "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" & "DELIVERANCE", another movie it reminded me of was the 70's horror classic "THE HILLS HAVE EYES". Which I encorage you to check out if you haven't seen it. Something must also be said about the remarkable FX that are on display here. Make-up FX are top-notch thanks to Stan Winston Studios. Also there are computer FX that I wasn't aware of 'till I watched the featurettes, they are amazing as well. "WRONG TURN" is worth your time ..pick it up as your next purchase. Horror fans will be pleased.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="We Watch It EVERY X-Mas!"></head><body><p>To insist that The Nightmare Before Christmas is an animation classic is an understatement but I'd also like to go one step further and state that I believe it also to be a holiday classic that works just as well on Christmas as it does on Halloween, at least, for me and my family it does! We watch this film every X-mas alongside such classics as The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, A Christmas Story and Black Christmas...well...I usually end up watching the last one alone. Anyhow...The Nightmare Before Christmas is an animation classic suitable for ALMOST all ages and definitely all seasons; it's endearing, intelligent and cuter than a pile of bunny bodies.<br /><br />If you've never seen The Nightmare Before Christmas, I know some of you haven't, than what are you waiting for? This features top-of-the-line stop-motion animation, humorous and heartwarming songs, lovable characters and a world of dark imagination just waiting to keep you and your family company. In my opinion Tim Burton is a cinematic genius, a macabre artiste with unlimited creativity and style and this film certainly embodies all of that and much more. If you haven't taken the time to see this film, you're simply missing out on an amazingly entertaining experience, one that demands to be enjoyed year after year, holiday after holiday.</p></body></html>

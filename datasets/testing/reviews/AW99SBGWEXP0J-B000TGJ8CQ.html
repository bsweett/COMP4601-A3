His gift also lets him look more than two minutes ahead into the life of Liz (Biel), a woman he has never met.  While he is searching her out, FBI agent Callie Ferris (Moore) is tracking him.  She knows what he can do, and needs his help to stop a nuclear bomb from destroying Los Angeles.<br /><br />"Next" could have been so much better.  In fact, for the most part, it is better.  The twist in the last ten minutes of the film and the abrupt ending thereafter works to undermine all the good stuff that has gone on before.  In fact, without those last ten minutes, this probably would have been a 3 ? star review.  People generally like or hate Nicholas Cage, with little grey area.  I fall into the former category, and appreciate his off the wall take on most characters he plays.  He is good as Cris, a man haunted by what could happen.  Jessica Biel is adequate as the love interest, and Julianne Moore gives her usual good performance.  The problem with the movie is its attempt to be clever at the end.  While not cheating, it establishes the character of Liz as a mere plot device and robs the audience of a satisfying colclusion.  I recommend waiting for DVD to see "Next".</p></body></html>

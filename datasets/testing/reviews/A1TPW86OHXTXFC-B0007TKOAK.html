According to Thomas Hayden Church it intrigued everyone and was talked about freely on the set of the movie. Hayden Church said, "The title of the movie is open to interpretation. We talked about it often. You go through a door sideways. Or the little roads that go off to the wineries in the Santa Ynez valley are sideways of the 101. But it's also these little portals that open up, and the experience. These guys are at such a crossroads in their lives."<br /><br />Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti) is  recently divorced teacher. He is having difficulty moving on with his life. He wants to take his best friend, Jack, (Thomas Hayden Church), about to be married, on a week's trip to the wine country. Miles loves the wine country and knows it well, as he does wine. Their first stop is one of his favorite wineries, Sanford Winery, located in the Santa Rita Hills. Miles says "Let's hit Sanford First. These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara County."<br /><br />The wine-appreciation theme of this movie made such an impression on its fans in the US, sales of Pinot Noir wines rose by more than 20% over the Christmas/New Year period 2004,, compared to the same period the previous year. Sanford Pinot Noir is very difficult to come by now and everyone makes Sanford Wineries their first stop in wine country.<br /><br />As they wind their way through wine country, Miles stops at his favorite bar/restaurant. Here they meet, Maya, (Virginia Masden) a waitress, and according to Jack, "some looker". It becomes pretty obvious that Jack is out for a last fling, and Paul is shocked and dismayed to find his wine tasting tour may turn into a "love nest".  At one of the wineries Jack becomes smitten with Stephanie, (Sandra Oh) and asks her out. She knows Maya and a dinner date for all four of them occurs that night.  The simple week for two friends has turned into a search and discussion of relationships and what do we want from life?<br /><br />Paul and Jack are buddies. Each is middle aged and searching for themselves and what is missing in their lives. "Sideways".  Paul, Jack, Maya and Stephanie are all in a search. In search of wine. In search of love. In search of themselves. This is a buddy movie that at times is hilarious and serious. Highly recommedned. prisrob</p></body></html>

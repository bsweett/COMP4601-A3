(Watch the sketchbook.)<br /><br />What's not: Sane plot, Cameron Diaz, acting like a grownup. I mean, all those things are great in themselves, but they're just not used in this flick. (Diaz is under-used to a baffling degree - this could have been just her kind of flick, if they let it be.)<br /><br />Seth Rogen, in his role as the spoiled rich kid, is simply obnoxious. Except for the hefty paycheck, I can't think of a reason in the world for Kato to hang around and take the abuse. In fact, that abuse flows out of the screen and onto the audience. If that's what you want, humor a cut above jokes about passing gas, have fun. I shouldn't have bothered.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters<br /><br />PS: The recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG99QS">Tron</a> movie also has the "son inherits father's commercial empire" aspect, but that movie takes the premise and runs with it. This one's panting, out of breath, and reaching for a beer after the first few steps.</p></body></html>

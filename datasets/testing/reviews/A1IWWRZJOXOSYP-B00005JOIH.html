The DVD doesn't offer much extra in the one disc version other than brief comments by Steven Spielberg about the film's relation to the history.  To me, the film was a psychological thriller more than an action picture.<br /><br />Australian actor Eric Bana who started out in comedy & became known for pictures like "Black Hawk Down" & "Troy" does a good job as Avner, the Mossad agent who is given the task of eliminating those who planned the Munich Olympic games massacre.  His breakdown into near madness and paranoia as the film progresses is well done, but seems to occur suddenly without really seeing him unravel.  I guess the discovery of Carl's nude corpse in the hotel room was supposed to send him over the edge.  It'll be interesting to see him as a gambler in "Lucky You" with Drew Barrymore & Robert Duval.<br /><br />Australian actor Geoffrey Rush won his Oscar for "Shine" in 1996 and was twice more nominated for "Shakespeare in Love" & "Quills."  As Ephraim, he's the counter-intelligence mastermind who coordinates all these activities.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, after numerous films like "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider," "The Jacket," & "Layer Cake," finally became known as Double-O-7 James Bond in "Casino Royale," for which he received a Best Actor nomination from the British Academy Awards.  As Steve, he does a good job of making it all the way through the movie, flying into action mode when required.  His blue eyes exude an intensity and focus that lifts the film.<br /><br />Mathieu Kossovitz plays Robert the bomb maker who can never quite get the charges right.  First they're not strong enough; next too strong.  He won a Best Supporting Actor award for "Munich" from the National Association of Film Critics.  He is also known as a director.  He directed "Gothika" with Halle Berry and won the Cannes Best Director Award for "La haine" (Hate).  As an actor, he's played in films like "Amelie" and "Birthday Girl" with Nicole Kidman.  He does a nice job as the klutzy often-berated toy maker who has been tapped to be the bomber.<br /><br />Irish Actor Ciran Hinds has a diverse number of films under his belt from "The Weight of Water" (which I reviewed as "The Weight of Editing") to "Oscar & Lucinda" & "Miami Vice."  He also played in "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" with Daniel Craig.  As Carl, he wears glasses and voices skepticism about the project and the authenticity of the intelligence on which they are acting.  His demise is a turning point in the film as we learn that the hunters are now also the hunted.<br /><br />Other roles are also nicely done.  Hanns Ziscler appears as Hans in his 69th film.  Ayelet Zurer as Avner's wife Daphna does a nice job of being the brave mother & spouse.  Lynn Cohen, whose first film was Woody Allen's "Manhattan Murder Mystery," does a convincing and controlled portrayal of Golda Meir.  Israeli actress Gila Almazor who won the Silver Bear Best Actress Award from the Berlin International Film Festival for "The Summer of Avia" in 1989 & does a good job as Avner's mother who urges him to avenge the villains for all of their ancestors.  French actors Michael Lonsdale who was in the first "Day of the Jackal" (1973) & another film I like very much, "Ronin," does a good job as the wise Papa who trades information to feed his family.  Mathieu Amalric plays his son Louis who acts as the go-between with Avner.<br /><br />"Munich" won the Best Picture Award from the American Film Institute.  It was nominated for 5 Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director & Best Editing.  While it is a long film, it is one that pulls me in and keeps me glued to the screen.  It was a moving cinematic adventure.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

The story had the promise of galactic scope and great import to the audience. But there aren't nearly enough true character moments or Star Trek level humor to carry this one off in the minds of the viewers. True, Picard and Data have a lot of "character moments" where they get introspective and philosophical, but since those moments are brought out merely as the story forces them to re-evaluate their lives, they are more plot element than character points.<br /><br />One of the elements that contributes to the problems with this movie is the fact that it is directed by Stuart Baird, a film editor and a Star Trek neophyte. Granted, this is not the first time Star Trek has used "less experienced" directors. Star Treks III, V, Generations, and First Contact were all directed by people who were doing their first ever feature film, and Star Trek II was only Nicholas Meyer's second directorial outing ever. So lack of directorial experience is not necessarily insurmountable, but it is not encouraging.<br /><br />Also, Nicholas Meyer too was a Star Trek neophyte when brought on to direct II. However he delved into Star Trek to better understand it and realistically portray it on screen. In contrast, Baird reportedly reveled in his lack of Star Trek knowledge and insisted on simply making the movie he wanted.<br /><br />The script was written by John Logan, a Star Trek fan and the writer of the screenplays for "Gladiator", "Any Given Sunday" and "The Aviator". So the story should have worked better than it ultimately does. There is a great movie to be made here out of this story. But it just doesn't satisfy like it should. (Me, I blame the director.)<br /><br />If you want to watch a Star Trek movie, go with II, VI or First Contact. Only watch this one if you want an action movie with a Star Trek theme.</p></body></html>

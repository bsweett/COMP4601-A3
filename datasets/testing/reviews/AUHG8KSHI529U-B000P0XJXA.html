<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly good movie for one I didn't know existed"></head><body><p>This is a movie that I completely missed when it was briefly in theaters.  I am not sure why it didn't do well because I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Maybe it was when it came out and what it was competing against.  Maybe it was marketed badly.  I don't know, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Val Kilmer does a great job as Scott or whatever the hero's name really is.  Scott is a nameless man of action who works for the government in some undefined role doing things that can't legally be done, but need to get done.  In this story it is to get back the daughter of the President - although they never come right out and say it.  The girl's kidnappers may or may not know who she really is, but if it hits the papers it is unlikely to end well for her.  Things move fast.<br /><br />Scott also trains new special ops folks and a couple ends up with him in this assignment in various ways.  Derek Luke (from Antwone Fisher) does a fine job as Curtis who is doing his best at whatever Scott wants him to do, but his newness shows.  At times Scott should take him more seriously than he does.  Tia Texada is also fine as the earnest and capable Jackie Black.<br /><br />William H. Macy and Ed O'Neill are government types who will move heaven and earth to support the man they work for (the unstated President).  Their actions and the resources they have at their disposal all add to the behind the curtain suspicions the movie tries to raise in us regarding our government.<br /><br />David Mamet's writing style is unique and personal to him.  I appreciated that the F word quotient is way down here, but there are still more than are really needed for effect.  Some people say that the word adds realism.  Maybe in some circles, but it isn't common where I live and work.<br /><br />The commentary track by Kilmer adds some interesting insights, but wanders a bit too much and seems like a bit of a tossed off assignment rather than wanting to actually share anything much with the viewer, but he does politely thank us for watching the movie at the end.<br /><br />All in all this disk was a pretty good experience and much better than I had anticipated for something that I didn't even know existed.</p></body></html>

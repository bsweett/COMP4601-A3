<meta name="summary" content="Good Action, Bad Story."></head><body><p>There are very good special effects and plenty of action. However, there is a disconnect with Hulk, the first movie. There are new actors, and a changed recap of part 1. This movie's story does not develop along, but it meanders, taking a toll on the overall movie experience. Last, the ending is less than satisfactory.</p></body></html>

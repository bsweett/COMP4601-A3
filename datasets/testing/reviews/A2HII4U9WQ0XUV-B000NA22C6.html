The famous novelist (played effortlessly by Johnny Depp, who earns this wreck its single star) is holed up in his Maine retreat, reeling from his wife's adultery, on the cusp of a brutal divorce, and battling one Grendel of a writer's block.<br /><br />And don't you know, when it rains, it pours: right in the middle of his nap, a furious stranger in a broad-brimmed hat comes rap-rap-rapping at his Chamber Door, accusing the befuddled novelist of "stealing his story". Would I sit through this shipwreck of a snorefest again? Quoth John Shooter: "Nevermore".<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to this flick; it had all of the promising ingredients for a spooky little potboiler. It's based on the Stephen King's novella "Secret Window, Secret Garden", which is an intimate and nasty tale of obsession and madness and one of the juiciest in King's "Four Past Midnight". It has Johnny Depp, who can charm the camera with a quirky frown, and John Turturro, equally adept at eccentric roles.<br /><br />Director David Koepp made his directorial debut with the stylish "Stir of Echoes", while Director of Photography Fred Murphy obviously knows how to wield a camera: he turned out the masterfully moody camera-work in "Mothman Prophecies". "Secret Window" even has Philip Glass doing the stress-inducing soundtrack.<br /><br />And certainly the movie starts on the right note: we see Johnny Depp hunched in the driver's seat of a car, toboggan pulled down over his maniac locks, scowling face a-twitch, a snowstorm howling outside the car window.<br /><br />All good stuff, made even more tantalizing when we shift forward six months after the intro's wicked little revelation: now we're holed up in a spooky cabin on equally spooky lake, with a devoted dog, tormented writer, disintegrating marriage, and crazy on the doorstep.<br /><br />What's not to love? Nearly everything.<br /><br />If the synopsis I've given you sounds intriguing, then pick up a copy of Stephen King's "Four Past Midnight" and read the very creepy story. Unless you're a hardcore Depp fanatic, a masochist, or an insomniac, you'll get no pleasure from this one-way ticket to Dullsville.<br /><br />Koepp gives us no suspense, no tension, no momentum, no scares, certainly no horror. "Secret Window" is strictly by the numbers, and twenty minutes into the thing it felt like all hands aboard the project---with the exception of the inventive Depp---had lost interest.<br /><br />The direction is dull, the pace plodding, the camerawork listless and strictly point-and-shoot, and worse still, the film's aimlessness seems to infect the actors.<br /><br />The usually interesting Timothy Hutton's (adulterer Teddy) mystifying inclusion merely serves as a reminder of just how good---relatively speaking---the similarly themed "The Dark Half" really was.<br /><br />The charismatic Charles Dutton (Ken Karsch) is wasted in a role (big, bearish, overconfident P.I.)that was stale back in "Thinner" and "Cape Fear": he goes through the motions and cashes a check. Maria Bello (Amy) does her best work accompanied by a side order of corn. John Turturro (Shooter)lets the hat do the acting.<br /><br />It's not that "Secret Window" is a howlingly horrible movie---if Koepp had taken some chances, played with the movie, let Depp's natural charisma percolate through the rest of this mummified corpse of a movie, the thing might have had some quirky cult appeal. No hope for the patient, alas: the film is delivered on the slab smelling of formaldehyde and stinking of rot.<br /><br />That said, at the very least, "Secret Window" really made me empathize with poor crazy old John Shooter. Shooter claimed Rainey had stolen his story, he wanted it back, and he was out for blood. Same with me: "Secret Window" stole my 90 minutes, I want it back, and I'm out for blood.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

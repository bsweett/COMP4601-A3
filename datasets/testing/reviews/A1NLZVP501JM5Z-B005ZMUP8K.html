<meta name="summary" content="A movie that is fun as heck to watch...."></head><body><p>I'm not one of the people that scream, "ITS ORLANDO BLOOM!!!!!!!!!"  Actually I would be screaming, "KEIRA KNIGHTLEY IS HOT!"  But anyways I know that this movie is a set up and that it doesn't take the plot anywhere really, BUT this movie is just too much fun.  Johnny Depp is amazing as Sparrow(Some complained that his act got old)he is just as funny as he was in the first one. Bill Nighy is awesome as Davey Jones, somehow he manages to act even though he is entirely CG(great CG work in this film)I honestly cannot wait to see Geoffry Rush coming back.<br /><br />The direction is once again top notch, again some critics have said that this movie was too long, BUT I could care less about watching a long movie if I'm having a great time and while watching POTC 2 I was having an awesome time.<br /><br />Overall this is a movie that is good old classic fun.  If your looking for a great plot and a story that will make you think get a drama movie.  Pirates is a fun, rousing, adventure tale that lets you grab a bowl of popcorn, sit back with some friends and have a heck of a time watching it.<br /><br />Is this as good as the original?  I say yes because both films transport you to the Carribbean and make you believe once again in magic.....</p></body></html>

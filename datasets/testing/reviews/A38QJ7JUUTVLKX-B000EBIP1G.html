<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good. 4.5 stars"></head><body><p>This film is almost exactly like the book. While the acting is a little "fake," I know that they will get better over time. My only complaint really is that the movie seemed rushed. Like the actors sometimes seemed to do their lines very fast. I'm not sure what it was, but something about the movie didn't sit right with me. I guess I was spoiled by the radio drama by Focus on the Family, which every Narnia fan should hear. While not as good as I was hoping, there are many pluses. The battle scenes are spectacular, and the resurrection scene, while semmingly rushed, is done very well. The opening is truly original and gives a good foundation for two of the four main characters. The humor in the film, even the added dialogue to add more humor, is great. Take the kids and go out and see classical story telling.</p></body></html>

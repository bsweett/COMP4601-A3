It is a period film that takes place in the mid-1950s and follows two US Marshalls played by Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio, as they make their way to an island off the coast of Massachusetts that houses and attempts to rehabilitate the very worst criminally insane patients.  Scorcese uses both intense personal drama and the story's winding and mysterious premise to create a remarkable and intriguing suspense that feels like a hybrid of Hitchcock and some of Stanley Kubrick's later films.  It is a movie that will go over the heads of most of its audience during the first viewing, but to its core it is a psychological thriller that not only displays madness in a palpable frame but does so with astounding cinematic flair, and goes even further in making a commentary on the great flaws of violent men.<br /><br />Funny how some of the most savvy film critics have derided Shutter Island for lacking some of the elements I've already praised, but I can't help thinking they were preparing their judgments well in advance simply because of the film's delayed and altogether unconventional release date for an esteemed veteran filmmaker like Scorsese, who like anyone else at or near his level should release their films in the fall, just so everyone knows what movies to give awards to.  This actually might be one of my favorite Scorcese films, not only because it is one of his few movies that deviates from being simple gangster glorification, but because it is not a genre film at all.  I had a hard time pigeon-holing this movie as a horror film or just a general suspenseful drama when its means are far greater than just giving us a puzzle or scaring the hell out of us.  Either way it blows The Departed out of the water in my humble view, but then again my favorite Scorcese movies are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX8S">The Age of Innocence</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1559409037">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>, so take that for what it is.  We all have our opinions I suppose.<br /><br />Scorcese is a great director but not necessarily because he makes great stories and creates cutting edge films.  It is because at times he takes already great stories and makes them into shiny and exciting films, and also because he possesses his actors so well that they almost always get the credit that he might often deserve.  For years it was Robert De Niro, who outside of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y08MY">The Godfather part II</a> has only been truly great under Scorcese.  The same can be said for the way that Scorcese has contained the frenzied method acting of Daniel Day Lewis.  But now, and perhaps in the future surpassing both aforementioned actors, is Leonardo DiCaprio, who in my view might deliver his most touching and satisfying performance to date.  This is a guy who simply should not care whether or not the Oscars of 2010 remember his movie, because it is just another highlight in what might possibly turn out to be the greatest Hollywood career of his generation.  Neither should the rest of the cast that includes great work from Max Von Sydow, Ruffalo, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, and Ted Levine.<br /><br />Shutter Island also captures New England in a way that few films have and growing up there myself certainly helps my appreciation of that.  Its cinematography is what we've come to expect from Scorcese's films but that doesn't mean it shouldn't go without specific praise.  The movie is visual perfection in addition to being a challenging, perplexing, and powerful motion picture. Despite a curious release date, and one that keeps it from competing in a 2009 Oscar awards ceremony that it would likely do quite well in, this is a layered commentary and an impeccably well-made production, and I must give it my highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

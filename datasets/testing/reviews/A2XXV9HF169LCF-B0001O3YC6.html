The acting isn't perfect, but hey... <p>Ship transporting a whole bunch of not-so-rich people, one rich preson going the scenic route, and one psycho prisoner with guard crashes on the nearest survivable planet after being holed by an asteroid. The planet was once colonized and hasn't been explored since (one gets the feeling space travel & colonization arn't really controlled or coordinated by any single government in this universe). There are aliens, and they arn't really intelligent or friendly. <p>Cool bits? The lighting in the movie has been altered to show that other planets probably would not have a sun with the same visable light spectrum as earth. The aliens don't look like people at all. And there's a good bit where you ... ok, I won't give all the good bits away. But it's really cool. And is has Vin Deisel, acting waaaaay better than in anything else I've seen him in... and looking yummy...</p></body></html>

(I understand Alan Moore dismissed it, no surprise there.)<br /><br />I watched the documentary first, Freedom.  In it, one of the speakers says that the film is a cross between Alien and 1984.  Yes, definitely Orwellian.  Alien?  Well, not really.<br /><br />"V" wants revenge for what was done to him -- he was one of many experimented on by a woman doctor who thought she was doing viral research and could not understand why the patients (i.e., prisoners, undesirables, etc.) would ignore her.  Talk about being in denial!  Lakehill Sanitarium developed a virus that was let loose on the country, which helped bring The High Chancellor to power.  And power he has.<br /><br />The surveillance trucks listening in on all conversation; the curfew police who have no problem attempting rape on any girls who happen to pass by.  The USA is into its Second Civil War, and so on.  Quite a society!<br /><br />In the midst of this is "V", who wants to pick up where 17th Century anarchist Guy Fawkes left off.  So with a Fawkes-like mask, he intends to create anarchy.<br /><br />The film revolves around several premises -- Natalie Portman  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012QE4Q2">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECYW84">Star Wars Natalie Portman Padme 16x20 Color Photo</a> as the victim, the love interest, the person whose parents were killed by the government; the symbology, and breaking symbols -- the media with the idea that "we only report the news -- fabricating the news is the job of government."  Loved that line.<br /><br />Everyone in the film tries to put a spin on the violence let loose by "V".  Building explosion?  Oh, that was a demolition, here are the bribed witnesses who say so.  Get the picture?<br /><br />Natalie's portrayal as a prison victim, getting her head shaved, being dragged by her feet, hot scalding water torture -- not unlike a post-9/11 Gitmo prison, eh?<br /><br />Recommended film -- not so much for its political message which gets pounded in like a sledge hammer -- but for the developing romance between "V" and Evie.  Good show.</p></body></html>

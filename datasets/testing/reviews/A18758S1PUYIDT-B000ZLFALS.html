<meta name="summary" content="Decent enough; the soundtrack might be preferable"></head><body><p>Perhaps it's lost something on the transfer to the small screen.  At any rate, Julie Taymor's latest feels overwrought in the way that only movie musicals can feel.  Visually stunning? Yes, but it's obvious that the story was painfully forced into shape by cobbling together various Beatles songs.<br />For what that's worth, the renditions of the songs are quite listenable. Bono in particular does a great job with "I am the walrus," while the "Come Together" sequence is both fun and scary to behold.<br />Take away the silliness of the scenes and you have a fantastic soundtrack.  In fact, I'd probably recommend that in the end.</p></body></html>

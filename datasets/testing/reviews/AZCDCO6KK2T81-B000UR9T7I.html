<meta name="summary" content="Lower Your Expectations A Bit and Then Have a Blast!"></head><body><p>This film had awfully big shoes to fill with the highly successful Spider-Man 2 which is arguably the best comic-book film of all time.  One can't fault the spidey team for trying to be ambitious here, but they just can't exceed, let alone match, their previous effort.  This film is extremely satsifying and deserves to be the blockbuster that it is with its record setting $148 million opening weekend, outdoing Pirates 2 the previous opening weekend champ.  Pirates 3 just missed outperforming Spidey 3 by about 10 million recently; therefore, Spidey 3 reigns champ for now on opening box-office revenue.<br /><br />One has to consider the pressure on this team to continue a story in which they obviously have great affection and in addition to living up to great expectations, these folks also had to heavily consider that this could be the last Spider-Man film as both Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have made it very clear that they want to move on past Spider-Man before it wrecks their careers like the superhero actors of the past.  This may explain the overly complex storyline, the introduction of Gwen Stacey (for future romance should Dunst walk), multiple villains (under the notion that more is always better), and the over-reliance on special effects (which are outstanding).  It's all a bit too much even though it is all entertaining, but if this is to be the last Spidey film, they wanted to give it all they had.  Too bad it just isn't as good as their last effort, but it is still an outstanding film and great popcorn fun.  You will have a blast with this film if you lower your expectations just a bit.  I left the theater very satisfied.<br /><br />Some Strengths: The Sandman effects are outstanding and manage to emote great sympathy for this character who is skillfully played by Thomas Haden Church of TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELIZZM">Wings</a> and the hit film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VZB7E">Sideways</a>.  The black blob effects are really spooky.  Kudos to James (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6IOD4">Annapolis</a>) Franco as Parker's best friend.  He was outstanding and believable the entire time.<br /><br />Some Weaknesses: Too ambitious and too contrived.  Spidey being taken over by the black blob wanders back and forth from weird and haunting to sensationally funny to the point of looking like a Saturday Night Live parody of Saturday Night Fever.  It became laughably distracting to an otherwise good storyline.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Riveting Remake of A Classic Movie"></head><body><p>I have seen the original THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE since I saw this remake, but I must say this film was very different from anything I have seen before at the time. I found THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE to be an interesting movie but a little confusing and lethargic. I found it primarily interesting because of the enigmatic performance by Liev Schreiber as Sgt. Raymond Shaw. Denzel Washington as Major Marco, the main character looked dazed and confused throughout the entire film and was a rather static hero. However, Schreiber's performance managed to gain more sympathy. Raymond Shaw is the most tragic character in the film and Schreiber brilliantly underplayed this role. Playing a character that basically shows no emotion throughout the entire film Schreiber's performance full of little nuances here and there brings the catharsis of this tragic figure to an emotional finale. It is only then that it becomes apparent that Denzel Washington as Major Marco must live with his demons. This film is still riveting in its own way.</p></body></html>

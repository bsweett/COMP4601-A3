<meta name="summary" content="Awesome New Version Of The Halloween Legend"></head><body><p>When you're doing a remake of a movie that was done right the first time, you have to differentiate it, take the same premise and go down some different paths than the first one took.  The 2007 Halloween remake does this, and it helps make it one of the best horror remakes ever done.<br /><br />  The most obvious deviation from the original line of films is that Michael Myers now has an origin.  A large part of what made the original work was the very lack of a reason behind the character's malevolence: Michael was a perfectly normal little kid who, for no discernible reason, picks up a kitchen knife one October 31 and butchers his sister, beginning a years-long cycle as a mute, endlessly killing, boogeyman.  This time there's nothing normal about Michael to begin with.  He was born with psychotic tendencies and then grew up in an envirornment of abuse and torment; either of these factors - the nature or the nurture - could have resulted in a murderer, but coming together they create what Sam Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell in the role Donald Pleasance originally made famous) calls a 'perfect storm', that creates the monsterous killing machine Myers becomes.  It was a big risk to change the core of the character from an eerily blank slate to the more human monster we have in this version, but it worked great, and Myers (played by Tyler Mane as an adult and Daeg Faerch as a ten year-old) is menacing enough to leave just that little glimmer that Maybe there's even more at play behind that white mask than the aforementioned factors.<br /><br />  The other big change is the time frame.  The 1978 original opens with Myers as a child but that takes up only a few minutes - 95% of the movie occurs on the Halloween day and night fifteen years later when Michael returns to his hometown of Haddonfield.  Here, the movie starts some time before the night Michael becomes a killer and continues through the years that follow, including his incarceration at a mental hospital and his eventual, devastating escape and return to Haddonfield.  We see the evolution of the monster in full, and by the time he's back home on Halloween night Myers is a tremendous, truly frightening force.<br /><br />  Everything from the acting to the direction and the special effects, musical score, etc. is extremely high caliber and in addition to being scary and, at times, surprisingly moving, it's also one of the sexiest horror movies out there thanks to a cast of great looking actresses including Danielle Harris, Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Hanna Hall and Sheri Moon Zombie.  Also of interest on the acting front are appearances by Bill Mosely and Danny Trejo (both from director Rob Zombie's Firefly films - "The House Of 1,000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects") and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky from the "Child's Play" movies).  Effective use of music and a number of hugely memorable visual images are also worth noting.<br /><br />  The 2007 Halloween doesn't take the place of the original series, nor does it set out to; it extablishes itself as a great, Different take on the original concept and characters, and manages to match anything from the original series.  A horror essential.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AS SYNDROME POINTS OUT, "YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT THIS IS COOL!""></head><body><p>What a fascinating break from Pixar's usual jig of toys and furry creatures and the pat themes of parenting. This is all grown-up stuff but told with wit tighter than the spandex on our lovable Parrs family.<br /><br />The setups are clearly a throwback to older cartoons I've seen reruns of: Marvel Comics, Johnny Quest, Thunderbirds, even a welcome dose of James Bond.<br /><br />But it goes far beyond in musing over the private and often troubled lives of heroes once they shed their skin-tight robes and resume their secret identities. They talk like us, bleed like us, love like us, and you could almost imagine these heroes as next-door neighbors going off to their daily chores, which often involved saving the world from Armageddon.<br /><br />The film's production values are topnotch. The CGI is slick yet life-like, and the imagination behind some of the superheroic ruses is uncanny.<br /><br />The humor is sharp even when it flirts with comic book conventions without insulting them. For instance, a hilarious joke comes from a fashion designer who costumes superheroes but rants against capes as accessories. There's a funny montage of superhero mishaps that illustrate her point.<br /><br />The background score recreates the sound of 1960s spy music so rousingly one could mistake it for a lost John Barry Bond soundtrack.<br /><br />Barring a minor slow patch three-quarters into the movie when we slack off to discover the normal lives of our heroes, this is a gut-busting, heartwarming tale, as perfect a family film as any in the last decade. Must-own DVD.</p></body></html>

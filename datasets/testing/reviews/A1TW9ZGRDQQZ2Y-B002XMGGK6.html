I'll be the first to admit that this is not a great movie by any means, but for pure entertainment value, this one gets my vote.<br /><br />The acting by Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx is above average, even pretty good at times. I feared that both would be just showing up for a paycheck here. Gerard Butler seemed to be having fun and I really enjoyed his character. I also liked how the perception of the two lead characters changed as the movie progressed. You start off favoring Gerard over Jamie, but then it switches and the good guy is now the villain.<br /><br />On the negative side of things. There are a couple of scenes that aren't believable and it reminded me of the SAW series on more than one occasion. The ending felt really rushed, but some things did catch me by surprise. I do wish they would have done a little more of those mini creative traps, like the spiked gun handle full of poison or the controlled cell phone explosion. While this film is very violent, most of it is implied. Don't get me wrong, there is a good amount of gore, but not nearly as much as I expected.<br /><br />Worth a rental or a buy at this cheap price. I watched the regular DVD version, but the Blu-ray is the only way you can see the Unrated Director's Cut, complete with some more blood and a few extra scenes.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

Though few Egyptologists gave any credence to Mr. von D&auml;niken's idea, his concept may have inspired Roland Emmerich to direct a very entertaining sci-fi film in 1994 that was entitled "Stargate" that he also co-wrote with Dean Devlin.<br /><br />The film begins in the early part of the twentieth century on the Giza Plateau in Egypt where archeologists uncover a very unusual object: a large circular stone with never-before-seen symbols engraved upon it.  Beneath the circular stone was an even more puzzling object: a circular wheel with the same unknown symbols engraved throughout its circumference.  One of the archeologist's daughters, a teenaged girl named Catherine Langford (Kelly Vint) finds a gold necklace with a pendant that contains an etching of the eye of the Egyptian god Ra, which she keeps.  The film then moves back into the present where a eccentric language expert named Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is attempting to give a presentation to a less-than-receptive audience.  As the members of the audience leave shortly after he begun his presentation, an older woman waits towards the back of the room to speak with him.  The woman is Catherine Langford (played by Viveca Lindfors, 1920-1995), who had earned a Ph.D. of her own, and presents Dr. Jackson with an interesting proposal to make some much-needed money to translate some mysterious symbols.  He accepts the offer and is whisked away by the U.S. military to an underground military base in Colorado.  There, Dr. Jackson quickly impresses everyone by successfully translating a message written in ancient Egyptian that contains the mysterious name "stargate".  He is then presented with the large circular cover stone and given the task of translating the symbols.  At first, he has no idea what the symbols are, but upon seeing some zodiacal star drawings from a newspaper, Dr. Jackson quickly realizes that the mysterious symbols represent star constellations.  Apparently, other Ph.D.'s that include Barbara Shore (Rae Allen) and Gary Meyers (Richard Kind), had already figured out the same thing; but they were missing the translation of one particular symbol and they needed a total of seven.  Since the project was controlled by the U.S. military and required top secret security clearance, Dr. Jackson had no knowledge of the actual stargate's existence, but had already understood from the cornerstone that a total of seven symbols were required to travel: six that identify the destination and one that identifies the point of origin.  The military commander, Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell), then tells the others to show Dr. Jackson the device and he quickly shows them what they had all been waiting for: the seventh symbol.  Upon entering all seven symbols, which the stargate rotates to lock into place, a massive wormhole resembling a sideways whirlpool is created.  Where the wormhole goes to no one knows, but the U.S. military intends to find out.  However, there's just one problem: who would be able to translate the symbols on the presumed stargate on the other side of the wormhole?  Dr. Jackson says that he can.  With that, he, Col. O'Neil and a group of soldiers venture into the wormhole and emerge on the opposite side of the Universe on an alien planet.  There, they will discover things that had been unknown to humanity for many thousands of years; but what they discover may also be very dangerous.  Will activating the stargate threaten Earth?  If so, can Earth be protected and from what?  Will the travelers even be able to return to Earth at all?  You'll just have to watch this truly imaginative film to find out!<br /><br />With a combination of good dialog, an interesting plot, a creative way to expound upon ancient mythologies, mostly engaging characters and good special effects, "Stargate" is a very entertaining film.  Other important characters in the film include Skaara (Alexis Cruz), Sha'uri (Mili Avital), Lieutenant Kawalsky (John Diehl), Anubis (Carlos Lauchu), 'Good Father' Kasuf (Erick Avari), Nabeh (Gianin Loffler) and the leading alien known as Ra (Jaye Davidson), whom ancient humans thought was a god. The film did fairly well in theaters when it was released in 1994, and the Sci-Fi Channel began production of a TV series based upon the film and named "Stargate: SG1" three years later.  In 2004, another TV series based upon the original "Stargate" film and the "Stargate: SG1" TV series was unveiled on the Sci-Fi Channel and named "Stargate: Atlantis".  Both "Stargate: SG1" and "Stargate: Atlantis" have greatly expanded upon the storyline that was created in this original film that I give an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  Other films that Roland Emmerlich directed include "Universal Soldier" (1992) and "Independence Day" (1996, which he also co-wrote again with Dean Devlin).</p></body></html>

I think everything is perfect and it is now in a very short list of amazing films that is filled with all talk and never bores you. The film is about a 14-year-old girl named Hayley played by Ellen Page. The film goes right into the base of its story when Hayley meets up with a 32 year old man named Jeff whom she met in a chat room. Already you can tell that this girl is a little different from any 14 year old you know.<br /><br />She tries to show Jeff her intelligence right off the bat by using big words and telling him about stuff she learned from books that she reads. He just takes this as her being a teen who thinks she knows it all but you'll find out that she actually does. The entire time that they're chatting in the cafe Jeff doesn't realize that he is the victim and not Hayley. Hayley is sure that Jeff is a pedofile and was involved in a missing child's murder so she uses herself as bait to get inside his home and take over so she can find the evidence she needs.<br /><br />The acting is amazing even though the cast really only consist of two people. The first movie I saw Ellen in was X Men the last stand but the role was so small that I really didn't pay attention to her. Her performance in this is out of this world and she makes this movie what it is. The cinematography was on point, it showed a rugged picture when needed. It had to show the actors fear, frustration, and confusion. I would never think that a story like this could be pulled off but the right cast was picked and it was written and paced perfectly. It may actually remind you of "Phone Booth" or even "SAW" so if your the impatient type and don't like a suspense buildup then this movie might irk you.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about this film and how could you when this little girl is doing something that most people could never do. I am sad to see some reviews on Hard Candy from people that see it as a movie with no meaning at all. I understand that it's just a movie and a little farfetched because it's a 14 year old carrying out punishment and trying to bring justice to a girl that could've been herself. I think about parent's who's children have been missing for years and they still don't know where their kids are and how they might wish for a person that would do this. I know it's a fictional story but it still has a moral to it that should stick with everyone. To be honest I'm not even sure if Haley is really 14 in the movie or just looks like one and uses it. Hard Candy is a great movie with a great twist to it that shows a lot of courage and I think it's perfect in every aspect.</p></body></html>

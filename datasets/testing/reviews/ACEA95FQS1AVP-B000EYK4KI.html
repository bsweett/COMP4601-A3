<meta name="summary" content="Great movie!"></head><body><p>I agree with the other reviewers that the studios are just screwing the fans when they release a "special" edition less than 6 months after a previous bare bones release, which most of us bought.  At least New Line had some decency when they let fans know there would be two editions of LOTR.<br /><br />However, I don't want potential movie buyers to get the wrong impression based on the starred reviews.  THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT FILM.  A good bit of tongue in cheek humor, action and explosions, and Pitt and Jolie sizzle on screen together.  If you don't already own this--get it now with all the extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quietly involving"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />This story of a jaded middle-aged man (Bill Murray) visiting various ex-girlfriends to see if he sired a child with one of them has no romance or excitement but it's a good character study from Jarmusch and a fine film; if you're interested in the new Bill Murray (who, as in Lost in Translation, eschews sarcasm for weariness) or the director then by all means rent Broken Flowers.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

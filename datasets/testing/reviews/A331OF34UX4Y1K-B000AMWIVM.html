It catches you attention by means of a clever and intelligent first act, then goes to unlimited plot twists and clever editing that makes your brain gets numb and you will feel that you are watching a great movie, that you are being entertained. Then, some minutes after the movie ends you suddenly ask yourself: "What the heck...?" The next affirmative is: "This is the new champion of plot holes". Then comes the sad conclusion: "What an awful movie! How could I be fooled this way?!" And then you will wnat your money back, but it's too late.</p></body></html>

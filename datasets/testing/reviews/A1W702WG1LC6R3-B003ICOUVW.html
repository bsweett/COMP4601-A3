<meta name="summary" content=""Good Horror Remake!""></head><body><p>Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins and Emily Blunt<br />star in this 2010 horror remake of the 1941 classic.<br />A man becomes cursed with the mark of the beast.<br />Benicio looks a little like Lon Chaney Jr. and Rick<br />Baker did a terrific make-up job as usual. This dvd<br />not only has nice picture and sound, but rated and<br />unrated versions plus deleted scenes. I recommend<br />this good horror remake.</p></body></html>

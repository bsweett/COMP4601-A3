I did like the way 2 of the iron men suits were moving and the special effects. I have a feeling that Scarlett had a significant role in this movie. As a sexy, unbeatable agent. Lol I had seen what Hollywood did to her moves, she didn't blink even once(script don't allow that because in Hollywood we are the heroes and we set the rules. And rules are:America as a world dominator, world saviour,world's best bla bla bla they have the sexiest women on earth with no American descent in real life, plastic surgery, lots of make up, even more added sexiness with special effects to already pretty women and they should know at least 9 languages, marshall arts,be special agents and they should in the end win over the bad guys easily, whatever, you name it). And her moves so ummm ''very realistic''. I swear when I saw her moves in the air and all that, I was looking for defects in the movie like a cable or cord around her waist that allowed her to move freely. I don't do that usually. It was the first time that I recall when I was laughing over all these things. And then she just had to train all her moves and repeat them until it goes flawlessly. And remember real American hero kicks ass and does not blink and it all shall be paced within 1 minute. LOL. What next? Downey is not one of my favorite characters. In the first Iron man he was a lot better. But in Iron Man 2 he is so arrogant and boring I was hoping for a bad guys to kick his ***. His relationship with his lover is looking cheap, similar to other movies, where if it worked in one movie, the other ten movies will destroy it by copying all the things that once made it fun to watch. And which we loved. This movie has money, special effects but no story whatsoever, plot is terrible. Some actors could have been better. If there should be Iron Man 3, I wish it to be something set in the far far future where it has nothing to do with Downey and previous suits or actors. Like as if it is another suit by design with other upgrades. And please no rubbish. Special effects put here and there and everywhere will not go well with a bad story and characters which some of us can't and don't want to see anymore. And for the last. It is very typical of Hollywood to show off Russians like that. And who was that actor who played Russian? Mickey Rourke. I didn't like nothing about what they've done. It's just a Hollywood standards. Directors get paid, people eat this rubbish and so they think they are the most supreme race in the world? Oh please. When will there be done a real good movie by Hollywood that will not include all this ****? I'm sick and tired of all the same things.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All atmosphere with a wispy, murky plot"></head><body><p>This movie is a fictionalized oral history of the genesis of the CIA, from its early days as the "Office of Strategic Services" through the Bay of Pigs debacle.  Its real story is the sacrifice that its protagonist "Edward Wilson" (Matt Damon) makes in order to serve the agency.  The Wilson character is a loose fictionalization of real-life former CIA Deputy Director for Counterintelligence James Jesus Angleton.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, and it is full of atmosphere, good dialog, and interesting historical background. There are lots of minor appearances by big stars such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, William Hurt, and others. What this film sorely lacks is a solid plot.  There simply isn't one, which is surprising.  Essentially the film takes the Wilson character at about the Bay of Pigs time frame, into a series of flashbacks, as we see how his entire life has centered around his devotion to the CIA to the exclusion of all else.  The "plot" if there is one, is simply this theme: that Wilson sacrifices all, family, fatherhood, his marriage, to serve the CIA.  During World War II and its aftermath, he simply disappears to his new wife for six years, and when he abruptly returns, he is not surprisingly a stranger to her.  This indifference to family in favor of career and devotion to duty is the real theme of this film.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film for its atmosphere and subject matter, but the lack of a plot is impossible not to miss and regret, because this could have been a great movie.  Cold War espionage offers limitless possibilities for telling a solid story (i.e. one with a plot and solid storyline) and the story of James Jesus Angleton is a fascinating one that would make for a superb film, properly done. This piece, however, does not succeed in being that film. That is truly unfortunate.<br /><br />Angleton fought for years to prevent KGB infiltration of the CIA, and this caused an awesome amount of turmoil within the Agency.  After Angleton left as head of Counter-intelligence, a series of catastrophes ensued within the CIA.  We were treated to the Walker spy scandals, Aldrich Aimes, the Hansen betrayal, and other counterintelligence debacles of the type that Angleton prevented during his watch.  He truly was "The Good Shephard."  Unfortunately, this film fails to really tell this story, and leaves the viewer wishing for more plot and less atmosphere.</p></body></html>

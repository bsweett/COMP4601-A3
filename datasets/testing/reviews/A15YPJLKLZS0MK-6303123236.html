The mirror proclaims Snow White the fairest of all and must flee into the forest where she befriends the seven dwarfs. The Queen turns into a hag witch near the end, trying to poison Snow White with an apple. She falls under the witch's spell and is presumed dead, until a prince saves her. Billed as "the greatesr animated film of all time," it stands the test of time to this day and beyond. There is some messed up stuff going on in Disney films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Penguins Show Humans how to Parent"></head><body><p>March of the Penguins plays like an overlong version of one of those irresistible nature shows in which you find yourself enthralled on a Sunday afternoon.  The film depicts an entire year cycle of the Emperor Penguin, from ocean to land and back to ocean again.  Their "march" takes them to the coldest point in the world, a spot that will remain frozen through the summer months, thus providing the necessary solid ground for rearing young.<br /><br />Their story is a journey, one of the unquenchable thirst within animals to continue their species through all forms of adversity...and they face more than their share.  While most births in nature seem to be the products of almost miraculous powers,  the successful birth of an Emperor Penguin bests almost all others for the challenges it must overcome.  And while many fall (predators, hunger, extreme conditions), others succeed.<br /><br />Life finds a way.<br /><br />An overwhelming feeling I received while watching the film concerns mankind's relationship to penguins and all other animals who share the earth with us.  As we have evolved, it seems we have grown apart from our animal brethren in how we view the responsibilities of parenthood.  We see in the penguins a group of animals who sacrifice entire seasons for a chance at one egg, risking their own health and safety every waddling step of the way.  Once the lucky penguins see their dreams manifested in the form of a tiny chick, the risks and sacrifices continue.  The lives of the adults are devoted exclusively to protecting, teaching and feeding their children.  It's hard not to admire these parents and wish we had more of their ilk raising our own children.  A good question for parents to ask themselves is, "Am I a better parent than a penguin?"<br /><br />Sadly, the answer for many is NO.<br /><br />March of the Penguins deserves to be watched, but I have a hard time justifying its cinematic release.  The story of the penguins is no more exciting than similar shows I have seen on badgers, monkeys of even yellow jackets.  When viewing a documentary, I want to see the dialogue on a subject expanded; I want to be overwhelmed with what I learned, and if the documentary is shown as a theatrical film, I expect even more.  March of the Penguins is nothing more than a top notch National Geographic special (which is a very rewarding experience, but is it worth eight dollars?)</p></body></html>

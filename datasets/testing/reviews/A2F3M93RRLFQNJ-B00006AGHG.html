<meta name="summary" content="Just above average"></head><body><p>Most movies have good guys and bad guys, or at the very least, protagonists and antagonists.  You watch the film and you understand who to root for.  This movie does not fit into that category.  The characters alternate between being heroes and villains and you're never quite certain who to sympathize with; done properly, this can be compelling, but here, it is a mixed success at best.<p>The two principal characters are as similar as they are different.  Affleck plays a lawyer who has pawned his conscience for a beautiful wife and a nice car; Jackson is an insurance salesman whose alcoholism masks his true problem of a vicious temper.  Both are flawed characters and not very likeable, so it is hard to care about either of them.  In addition, if either of the characters practiced anything approached true civility, they could have defused the situation (and of course ended the movie).<p>Affleck's character alternates between minor evil and minor good, while Jackson is more extreme on both ends.  It is a creative device, but it only partially works, and if there was enough to have kept me watching, there wasn't enough to really make me care.</p></body></html>

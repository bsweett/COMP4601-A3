My wife requested this one as we walked through the New Release aisles.  I really love Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and was glad to see them reunited once again, as lovers.  The story was a tiny bit confusing, but that is okay, and I thought the cinematography was stunning.  I watched this on a very good computer monitor, up close, and thought the picturesque scenes were still wonderful (I normally watch it on my 55 inch HD screen.)<br /><br />I wish they had better character development of some of the side characters, but I think this was the director's intention.  I enjoyed seeing that one dude from Nip Tuck.  I'd like to see him in more big movies.<br /><br />I give this a rousing 5 stars, but round up form 4.5.<br /><br />MC White said:  Very good!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An average translation of a great book"></head><body><p>Hostage is a gritty movie starring Bruce Willis as hostage negotiator Jeff Talley.  The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Crais.  The plot of the movie follows the book pretty closely, except some of the moments that make the book special is lost in the translation and I can't say I blame the movie.  The story follows a short 2-day period when 3 thugs try and steal a car.  They choose the wrong house.  The house they choose is heavily secured, because the man of the house has some unsavory connections.  The hostages are quickly surrounded by cops and find themselves in a horrible situation.  Talley then is faced with his own hostage situation when his wife and daughter are kidnapped.  He has to retrieve a DVD out of the house and deliver it to thugs or they will die.<br /><br />The book really explores the life of Mars, the bad guy in the movie, and the two brothers Dennis and Kevin.  Kevin is the foolish younger brother who blindly follows and worships his older brother despite the trouble they get into.  This is a gritty movie with a lot of tense action and violence.  Willis is good in this film.  I recommend it to action fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE DARK OF NIGHT"></head><body><p>M. Night Shamalayan burst on to the scene with the incredible SIXTH SENSE.  He is obviously a young director/writer with a vivid imagination, and perhaps a little bit too much belief in his artistry.  His third film, &quot;Signs&quot; wasn't all that great, and this middle entry, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; suffers from too much artistic input.  Now that may sound crazy, but in watching the special feature in which Night discusses his deleted scenes, and especially in the inclusion of his first home movie, I felt that his ego is a little too much considering this movie.<br />I think the plot is very intriguing, and there are some wonderful shots, including the use of comic book colors to heighten the sense of unreality.  Bruce Willis and Spencer Treat Clark do a fantastic job in their roles; Willis is a lot better actor than many people credit him for.  Clark is an uncanny little actor, who can be seen in this year's excellent &quot;Mystic River.&quot;  I found three major problems:  first, Shamalayan over-utilized his &quot;from a distance&quot; shots.  There were too many of them where all this activity is going on in front of the leading characters and it served no purpose to me other than artistic experimentation.  The other two things wrong with this movie, for me, were the lackluster performances of both Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn.  Jackson has yet to enthrall me with his acting (having watched &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Deep Blue&quot; recently.  Penn on the other hand has done some good work, but in this one, she seems unattached and disinterested.<br />&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is an entertaining movie, and it's ending is quite surprising, but pulling a punch at the end doesn't rescue this movie from its other flaws.</p></body></html>

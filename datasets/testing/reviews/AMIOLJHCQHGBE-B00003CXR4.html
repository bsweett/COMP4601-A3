<meta name="summary" content="There is Magic in this film"></head><body><p>I loved the Matrix. It was incredible.  But this film, filled with heroes flying across rooftops, selfish princesses stealing legendary swords (the Green Destiny), and ageless revenge, stole my heart with it's undertows of lost love, Chow Yun Fat's and Michelle Yeoh's Jackie Chan martial arts moves, and honor bound caste situations. Anyone who has read my reviews knows I believe cinematography and soundtrack are huge for me. Director Ang Lee has poured both into the senses. The darkness of Peking's  alleyways to the brilliant greens of the bamboo forests create moods of mystery, and the walking on treetops reinforces the magic of the moment. This movie is touching, filled with action, and envelopes you. Watch this movie in the English version the first time. This way, you can enjoy the color and story of a legendary hero, his true love he cannot confess to, and the devestation that is wrought by a selfish girl bent on elevating herself above all for the sake of her own ego. The trailers did great justice to this movie. Not only did they expose the fantastic effects, they gave you the feeling of the entrapment involved in the ancient Chinese caste system. I will NOT ruin this movie by disclosing the dual `love lost' theme. Anyone who writes a review and gives away the plot of the movie should be hung. This film needs to be experienced without expectation. The atmosphere is completely mystical. The characters, a legendary swordsman, a female anti-hero who studied the martial arts for the goal of self destruction, a selfish princess and her lover from the past, are all the reader need know. Any more steals from the flow of the film. Recommendation of CTHD has to be taken on trust. The reward at the end is such sadness yet blessed with understanding. There is a quality about this film that is truly lacking in American movies. Watch this movie the first time, and you will understand. Watch it the second time, and your heart will be broken. This question I will leave you with...does she fly to her doom, or to the redemption of others? Trust me. I know this review is sparce, but I did it on purpose. This film is magic. Rent this, or own it, and you will learn to trust me. I am nver wrong.</p></body></html>

Tautou was great in her role.  I enjoyed the film along the lines of an updated Indiana Jones, though with a bit more charged content. Who would have thought that the Magdalen would feature in an action film?  I just remain impressed that such a heretical concept is now front and center in the collective consciousness, even for those who don't believe it.  Impressive, really.</p></body></html>

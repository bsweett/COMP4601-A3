<meta name="summary" content="Stylish and slick modern caper flick"></head><body><p>Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron continue to cement themselves as great modern film stars in &quot;The Italian Job,&quot; and are ably supported by a quality cast -- including Seth Green's best non-Buffy role to date -- in this remake.<p>Like all great caper flicks, the film puts an emphasis on cleverness, and the tricks and twists are all top-notch, with even the signature use of the new Mini Coopers being both incredibly plausible and, yes, very clever. When things go wrong, they go wrong because of human fallibility and bad luck, instead of cumbersome and artifical plot complications.<p>With the surprising exception of Donald Sutherland, the cast all are at the top of their respective games in this, and ego-driven scenery chewing is almost entirely absent, and even the hints of romance are nicely underplayed, taking a logical second place to the revenge-driven caper itself.<p>The film rates only 4 stars due to direction that sometimes fails to keep the film as tense and taught as it perhaps ought to, but it still ranks as one of the smartest and most charming action/adventure movies in years.<p>Strongly recommended for fans of &quot;The Sting,&quot; &quot;Ocean's 11&quot; and fans of Seth Green.</p></body></html>

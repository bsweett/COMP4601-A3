But don't expect "whodunnit" to be the main issue; that is disclosed fairly early on. It's more who is going to find out, what are going to be the consequences, and how are the various characters going to get themselves out of the fine mess they've gotten into.<br /><br />Al Pacino play Detective Will Dormer, invited to a small town in northern Alaska to help with a murder and also to get him out of LA, where an Internal Affairs investigation is cooking. His partner Hap is with him, and explains that he is going to have to make a deal with IA to save his own skin and protect his family. He says Dormer won't be dragged into the mess, but Dormer insists he will be. (We find out later why.)<br /><br />Dormer and Hap are met by an attractive young female local detective who is to work with them. She's smart, and she idolizes Dormer. She did her case study at the academy on one of his most famous cases. The local police chief is a friend of Dormer's, and it was undoubtedly he who asked for Dormer to come and assist.<br /><br />The case is the brutal murder of an 18-yea-old girl whose body was found naked in the garbage dump. Dormer immediately notices some unusual features about the body, and finds some useful evidence at the girl's home. (Nah, not going to tell you what.) He and the local cops interview the girl's boyfriend, but Dormer is convinced he was not the killer. (Not going to tell you why, either.)<br /><br />The primary suspect turns out to be a mystery writer who lives about 15 miles away (Robin Williams) who has befriended the girl because she wanted to be a writer, and because she needed someone to talk to. He's very smooth, this one; after all he's a writer of murder mysteries, and knows how police operate.<br /><br />The title refers to the fact that it is high summer, and the sun basically never goes down. Dormer can't sleep, and he is tormented by, among other things, phone calls from the writer in the wee small hours of the morning because he can't sleep either. Eventually, Dormer is so in need of sleep that he's going really nuts. Practically gets himself killed falling asleep while driving, and eventually begins having hallucinations. He's determined to crack the case before he cracks up, and he does. In a way.<br /><br />Watch it; you'll be glad I didn't tell you too much.</p></body></html>

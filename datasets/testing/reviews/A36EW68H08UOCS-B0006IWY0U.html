This one is a good one.<p>Peter Weir has collected all his available resources - a good story, CGI, other special effects, skilled cinematographers and set designers and a great cast and crew to put us to sea with a mighty hearty seagoin' adventure.<p>Crowe's "Lucky" Jack Aubrey is intelligent and seasoned, and clearly cares about his men individually as well as the ship and crew as a whole.  In his character we get to see the weight of momentous decisions he must make - sacrificing the life of an overboard sailor to save the entire ship, as well as bringing his overgunned and outmanned HMS Surprise right up to the speedy French Acheron and letting his crew have at it, knowing that many lives on both sides will be lost.<p>We get to see that the Captain is not always right, and he occasionally has to accept the consequences of his wrong actions or decisions.  But we also get to see that often effective leadership means taking decisive action and implementing an imperfect plan because a team that is committed to a wrong plan will accomplish more than a crew paralyzed because leadership has come up with no plan at all.<p>There is no love story artificially superimposed upon this rousing good tale, and the performances are fine and memorable.<p>I recommend this one highly for anyone looking for an intelligent action adventure.</p></body></html>

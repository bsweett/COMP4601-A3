In many ways, EP reminded me of "A History of Violence" with a touch of "The Godfather." The plot took some strange turns and it ends kind of abruptly (but at least it avoided the typical clich&eacute;s). EP isn't a great movie but I thought it was very interesting on a more subtle level. There's a twist, of course (but I won't spoil it) but then there's a twist to the twist as well. I really liked it.<br /><br />Recommended</p></body></html>

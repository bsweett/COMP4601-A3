Poor Hilary Swank - from that movie where she was a boy to this in a few short years.  Of course, her fall wasn't as steep as Cuba Gooding's (from Jerry Maguire to Boat Trip in one movie) or Jamie Foxx's (from Ray to Stealth in one movie).  She looks like Jolene Blalock - T'Pol from TV's Star Trek Enterprise, and it wasn't until the credits that I realized it was actually Swank and not Blalock in the movie.  Perhaps Swank was trying to camouflage herself.<br /><br />The movie begins with a space shuttle landing in the LA River, which is interesting, but has nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.  Next thing you know, the valiant pilot is recruited to some mission to drill to the center of the earth to restart the core, which got some spyware or something and stopped working.  As a result, the Coliseum and the Golden Gate Bridge get wiped out by lightning.  Don't ask.  The Feds then assemble a team to take a magic vehicle to the core, drop some nukes, and reboot the earth.<br /><br />We learn some interesting things on the way, such as: Molten rock is completely clear.  There are really unconvincing sets with big fake crystals deep inside the earth.  And, if you're a jerk, you'll get killed by rolling nuclear weapons and then repent.<br /><br />You can guess how it ends.  It's not great art, but it's dumb fun on a rainy day.</p></body></html>

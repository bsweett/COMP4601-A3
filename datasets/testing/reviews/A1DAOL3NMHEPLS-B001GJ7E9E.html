<meta name="summary" content="A reasonably successful blend of two genres"></head><body><p>"Mr. & Mrs. Smith" blends two genres -- high-speed action and bickering couple movie -- with fair success. Is it even remotely plausible?  Of course not. Is it great cinema. Nope. Is it fun to watch, if you don't mind a lot of cartoonish violence?  Yes.  Brad and Angelina work well together, and the script has occasional flashes of wit, so if you don't mind suspending your disbelief a lot for two hours, this is passable entertainment.</p></body></html>

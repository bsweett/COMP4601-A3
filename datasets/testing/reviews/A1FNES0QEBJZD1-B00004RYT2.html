<meta name="summary" content="Apollo 13 on Blu Ray-Universal's 15th anniversary release"></head><body><p>I have seen where others have had some problems with loading and the menu.  I didn't have any issues at all.  Perhaps the loading was a touch slower than normal but I have seen much worse.  This is a great movie that really stands up to the test of time; it has legs.  I prefer to focus on the quality of the remastered release rather than plot summary and my opinions on acting(which was great all around).<br /><br />The video transfer to Blu Ray on this release shows just what can be done if those in charge of the transfers put their minds to it.  The picture quality couldn't get any better with beautiful colors and deep details throughout the entire movie.  At no point did I see any grain, aliasing or artifacts of any kind.  The video is completely demo disc worthy for those who have the system that can show it.  I think that sometimes people complain about a disc simply because they are using cheapo blu ray players or who have sound systems that are simply not up to par.  For me, it was like seeing the movie on a brand new master shown for the very first time in the theater. Never the less, the video quality of the Blu Ray is a huge jump from my previously owned Standard Def DVD.<br /><br />The audio transfer, DTSHD 5.1 MA,  also shows what a good transfer and proper audio editing can achieve.  Hope you have a good sound system as it will certainly get a strong workout in many parts of film.  Your subwoofer will have its boundaries explored both during the early music score as well as in many areas of foley effects.  There is great use of the discreet channels with, when appropriate, marvelous directionality and panning around the front and rear sound stages.  Even small foley fx are clearly delineated to their correct audio channels.  All audio is precise, properly leveled and enveloping when you should be enveloped.<br /><br />While I haven't watched them all, there are some very interesting and historical extras and footage in addition to the Standard Def extra DVD for your tablet or computer and the regular commentary which accompanies most movies on disc.  Thank god there weren't a dozen previews of upcoming movies and advertisements that we see on so many discs taking up room on the DVD.<br /><br />For my part, this is one transfer to blu ray that makes having a hi end system worth having.  A great addition.<br />Hope this review is of help to you, and if so, please check the 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right path with these reviews.</p></body></html>

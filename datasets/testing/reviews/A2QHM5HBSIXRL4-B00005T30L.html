<meta name="summary" content="Like nothing else you've ever seen...and hilarious, too."></head><body><p>Actually, I don't know what was more fun - watching Thora Birch's excellent acting in this movie, or reading the one-star reviews posted here on amazon[.com] from people who didn't like the film.  I agree that 'Ghost World' is an acquired taste.<p>The one scene that sticks in my head is the series of encounters Birch's Enid has when she decides to give it go as counter help at a movie concession stand.  Her snarky, jaded look at the world results in a series of hilarious "customer friendly" interactions.  And...she's out of there.  It's a perfect set of takes by Birch.</p></body></html>

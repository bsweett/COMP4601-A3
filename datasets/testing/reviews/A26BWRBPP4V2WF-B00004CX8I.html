<meta name="summary" content="Good movie on a terrible DVD"></head><body><p>First a quick synopsis of the movie - a criminal (in a marvelous performance by Jack Nicholson) &quot;pretends&quot; to be insane to get out of prison and spend his sentence in a mental hospital.  When he discovers that he's stuck in the hospital until he's certified sane by his doctors (rather than the length of his sentence) he plans to break out, with the help of selected fellow patients.  Along the way, his acts of rebellion against authority become a type of therapy for the patients, much more effective than that delivered by the medical staff. <p>This movie won a number of awards, and seems brilliant and refreshing today, given the claptrap Hollywood is currently producing.  While I do not think Louise Fletcher's performance is great, most would disagree, including the Academy.  The other performances are all brilliant, starting with Nicholson, and moving right down the list through the supporting characters.<p>The movie, while brilliant, is not always entertaining.  It's not perfect, and there are parts that are even mundane, which lowers its score slightly from the 5-star level.  The quality of the DVD drops it to three stars.  The sound and picture are both not very good - I have 1950's B-grade movies with higher quality.  The extras are non-existent.  Surely a movie with such a pedigree and of such importance artistically deserves better!  At least the price reflects this, but let's hope they come out with a better DVD version of this film.</p></body></html>

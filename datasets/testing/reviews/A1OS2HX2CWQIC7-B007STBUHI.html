<meta name="summary" content="Universal 25th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD review"></head><body><p>I needn't evaluate the merits of the first great summer blockbuster; Jaws is a tremendous film, far superior to most of the extravagant productions that Hollywood studios produce for general audiences these days. I'm happy to see that this edition looks and sounds so good. Its print is clean, but by no discharge of grain - it looks like film, and not as though it were shot yesterday. Colors are vibrant and the contrast is distinguished by those lovely natural hues that only good film stock can reproduce. The soundtrack is fine, also: I played this through tiny television speakers, my estimable stereo and a friend's absurdly expensive surround sound array, and it sounds great on all.<br /><br />The ominous expanse of the ocean - and the clanging buoy that marks the location of the story's first feeding - serve as the background of the main menu. Scene selections via menu are what you'd expect, nothing more or less. Captions for the hearing impaired are available in English, as are French subtitles. However, no Spanish subtitles are available, which seems a rather severe omission in my opinion.<br /><br />Spotlight on Location featurettes are produced for inclusion on many of Universal's DVDs, but they're rarely as long or detailed as this one. Interviews with the principle cast and crew, exclusive footage of deleted scenes and a wealth of photographs all yield more than a few intriguing stories pertaining to Benchley's book, the trials involved with the film's grueling and technically demanding shoot and its record-breaking reception. One of the most interesting aspects of the screenwriting process involved Quint's unforgettable U.S.S. Indianapolis monologue, which was first scripted by Howard Sackler as a short paragraph, extended by John Milius and finally revised extensively by Robert Shaw shortly before he performed it. I usually don't care for behind-the-scenes featurettes, but this one is so well-edited and provided so much substantial information that I found myself enjoying it.<br /><br />Despite a few embarrassing exceptions, most of the deleted and alternate scenes are as ably shot and acted as anything retained for the theatrical cut. In a particularly humorous sequence, Robert Shaw harasses a young musician in an instrument retailer with the most overbearing variety of encouragement. As good as many of them are (a few provide some new perspective), the lot are ultimately extraneous, especially considering how lean the movie is at just over two hours. A couple of inadvertently amusing outtakes from two crucial scenes are also included.<br /><br />Absolutely enormous, this disc's production photo gallery is comprised of literally hundreds of photos of the cast and crew, equipment, settings and boats, as well as film stills, promotional photographs, advertisements, movie posters, lobby cards, book covers, articles concerning the film and quite a lot more. Most of these pictures are interesting, but their gallery's lack of navigational controls is a major flaw. That viewers can't scroll back and forth as they please is annoying, but we're also prohibited from fast-forwarding or rewinding through the selections. The gallery proceeds at a sluggish pace and will loop infinitely until the 'menu' button on your remote control is pressed. With a flexible interface, this feature could have been so much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Negligible though they are, the rest of this edition's features are pleasant enough. A cute trivia game allows the player to view footage from the film to aid them in selecting multiple-choice answers, and Shark World serves as a primer for basic information about the species. Oddly enough, the special features listed on the keep case's paper sleeve include theatrical trailers and a screen saver, both of which are absent.<br /><br /> Overall, this is quite a good DVD. I'd like to think that its few flaws were attended to for the production of the 30th Anniversary disc, but I haven't seen it. If not, maybe they'll get around to that when they release a 40th Anniversary Deluxe Edition. I'm not really joking.</p></body></html>

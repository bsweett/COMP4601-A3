I had recently picked up Rob Zombie's greatest hits the other day after becoming aware of him with the Living Dead Girl era.  When I saw his name attached to this film I was intrigued to see how he'd handle a 70's gore-fest homage after seeing a bunch of his videos on the greatest hits cd/dvd.  While never causing any feelings of fear or dread that accompanied my initial viewings of Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in the day, this film was pretty artsy schlock.  That is to say it was Corman level in its camp but executed with higher production values.  Heh.  It never aspires beyond its station and has fun w/ its cartoony gore.  Two couples are attacked and locked up in a house of horrors with a freaker family.  Yes, it's an overused contrived plot at this point in horror cinema history, but it was an amusing hour and half.</p></body></html>

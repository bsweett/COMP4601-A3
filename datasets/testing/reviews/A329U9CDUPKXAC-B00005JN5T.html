<meta name="summary" content="The Fockers were great!"></head><body><p>The Fockers were great! And by the Fockers I mean Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. Not Ben Stiller though. He remains unfunny as usual. I try to avoid Stiller's movies but I was forced to see this one because of the amazing chemistry Streisand and Hoffman share. They really should do another movie together where they are the stars. 'Meet The Fockers' was an alright movie. The poopy and pee pee jokes might be funny to 10 year olds but I prefer intelligent comedy. I give the movie 3 stars for the excellent casting.</p></body></html>

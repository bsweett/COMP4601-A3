It's long and interesting and has great pictures of far away exotic places, and although I wouldn't want to read the Britanica cover to cover, I'd advise anyone to subject themselves to Oliver Stone's historical biography. This is a play-by-play review of the DVD. Preliminary thoughts include feeling as though I am boarding the Titanic as I sit down to watch this notoriously criticized film, and there is a nagging doubt that it is somewhat shameful for a director to approve a modified version of his product with "Faster-paced Action", like it was a new improved laundry detergent. ... Already I don't know what I hate more; the stuffy history lesson narrative, or the shiny, young Greek protege child actors with British accents, ...Much time has passed, (or so it seems, I'm not yet through the first hour), I don't think I can make it to the end. Colin Farrell (Alexander), looks like a bunny rabbit in shock, like that last living look of a soon to be road kill on a country highway. Alexander has conquered half of Asia and I keep thinking of other things I might be doing with my time, like cleaning my apartment or starting a stamp collection. As I write, Alexander and his buddies are discussing the dangers of homosexuality. Mind you, they're all in skirts. The battle marching scenes are stunning, the actual battles; so-so, with sweeping aerial scenes of thousands warring, intercut with ridiculous close-ups of swords piercing a foot, and facial reactions to injuries like being bopped on the head by The Three Stooges. The subtitles are absurd. "MACEDONIAN LEFT", means nothing to me. It's hard to tell who's winning the battle but the charging camels win best float in the parade, (I've yet to see the earth-shaking stampeding Indian elephants), ...Hell, Bush would have conquered Asia in half this time, ...There's a "Gone With The Wind" dead battlefield nod. Nice. ...I'm in Persia now. Alexander is falling in love  ... with everybody. Nothing like a little Greek debauchery. Better lock up the camels and snakes. ... Damn, I hit the wrong button on the remote and I'm back to the beginning. Babylonian Twilight Zone. Was I in Persia or India?, it all looks like an ancient Asian opium room, ... I'm through the first hour. Not bad. Not bad at all. It has a youthful and adventurous "Jason and The Argonauts" appeal, and a philosophical world domination theme, and epic cinematic proportions of ancient global vistas and artistic design. What the producer's of this DVD need to do now is offer a secret Alexander decoder ring in every package. ... After nearly three hours, it's over, and the verdict is, it's long and complicated, and the ill-chronological order doesn't help matters, but it's a great film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Bond movie--5 stars, poor extras 2 stars (This review is for the 2007 remastered edition)"></head><body><p>The five stars above is for the movie and this clear, digitally cleaned up transfer only. MGM has chosen to keep the second disc of extras for the boxed set ONLY. While I would normally appreciate that if the boxed sets had been broken up either chronologically or by star, I'm a bit frustrated as there are many films I don't want in the boxed set (they were randomly assigned to force fans to buy all the sets to get all the Connery films or Bronsnan, etc.). That's great marketing but lousy customer service.<br /><br />The good news--To the film itself--"Goldfinger" has never looked this good on DVD. While we do get the commentary track ported over from the previous release, we don't any of the extras there nor the new extras (as mentioned) produced for the new boxed set. I suspect a double dip will be down the line once MGM decides to release this to Blu-Ray. It's sad really because, of all the Bond films, this one and "From Russia With Love" deserve the deluxe treatment. While I like "Dr. No", "Goldfinger" really established the Bond personna in full mode while "From Russia with Love" gave us Bond with minimal gadgets and lots of suspense. Personally, I love all the Connery films (well, except "Never Say Never" which isn't "canon" Bond)but the least they could do would be to focus their efforts on providing additional extras for some of the best in the series.<br /><br />The commentary track featuring director Guy Hamilton and members of the crew(if my memory serves here I kept skipping around between regular audio and the commentary) is quite good and filled with some wonderful bits of trivia about shooting the movie. On the other hand, I would have liked to see some featurettes on the development of the Bond films. Oh well I guess we can't have it all.<br /><br />That said, you can't go wrong with this film (even if the extras leaving you wanting more). I would also like to see a featurette on some point discussing how Hitchcock's films like "North by Northwest" influenced the Bond series. I recommend this release but with reservations because of the lack of extras. If you just want the film, this is a fine release.</p></body></html>

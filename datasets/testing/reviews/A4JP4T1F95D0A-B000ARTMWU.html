I had seen some reviews on web sites and the packaging proclaiming this to be the horror movie of the year.  I was also under the impression that this was a very low budget affair, but doing some research I found that this film had a 2 million dollar budget.  While that is not a high number, it is a decent budget for a horror.  The movie is French, and the dubbing is pretty bad.  It is also imcomplete as many places they still speak in French.  It is probably better to use the subtitles.  The story itself is pretty effective, though I was able to figure out the twist long before the movie revealed it.  The blood flows heavily on the unrated version.  As the movie progresses, the fx killings get better and more realistic.  I think this is worth a watch, but probably not a buy in my opinion.</p></body></html>

Flawless in both story and execution, MI is a treat for old and young alike. I watched it with my son and we both loved every minute! Billy Crystal &amp; John Goodman are great as Mike and Sully (basically, the Laurel and Hardy of Monstropolis). They are as good as Woody and Buzz were in TOY STORY! Here we have an alternate monster universe, filled with interesting and hilarious creatures. Mike and Sully work together (and live together) at the Monsters Inc plant, where children's screams are turned into energy for the city. Monsters known as &quot;scarers&quot; go through doors into the closets of unsuspecting tots, making them scream in terror. This fills a tank back at the plant. Sully accidentally brings a little girl back with him, throwing everything into chaos. Will this tiny toddler of doom destroy all of Monstropolis? Can she be stopped? What is the horrible secret behind the scenes at Monsters Inc? Watch and find out...</p></body></html>

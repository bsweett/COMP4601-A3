<meta name="summary" content="Yet Another Awesome Superhero Movie!"></head><body><p>X-Men has delivered the first time, then again, and again!  This time out they push the envelope even further, and keep you glued to your seat watching enthusiastically wondering what is going to happen next!  I loved the previous 2 X-Men movies, and bought them up quick.  I guarantee I will be buying the third for my collection as well.  The effects are top-notch, and this movie was full of emotions.  It had action, intrigue, sorrow, romance, suspense, everything a moviegoer could want.  I won't ruin the ending for you, but can say that a few important questions get answered in this movie, and it is very powerful all the way to the end.  If you are a comic book fan or an action movie fan, buying this movie is a no-brainer.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant remake!"></head><body><p>In the small town of Ogden Marsh in a nearby swamp, there was an airplane that crash lands in it contaminating the town's water supply with chemicals. The people who drink from the water turn into homicidal maniacs who look like zombies as it seems some government contamination unites are blocking the town, Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) with pregnant wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) including Deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) and Becca (Danielle Panabaker) are escaping the town to get to the major city for a new home unless they can get out alive.<br /><br />Terrifying and brilliant remake of the obscure George Romero cult fave, this Sci-fi horror thriller is better than one of Romero's weaker efforts (Dawn of the Dead with Night and Day were better including martin). This is a fantastic reimagining that will rank with "The Thing", "The Fly", "Dawn of the Dead", "The Blob", "King Kong" etc in terms of great genre remakes. The acting is just superb and the action is plentiful, George A. Romero executive produced this one here which makes it an A on my list.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives the viewer that theatrical experience through flawless picture and sound that skyrockets to the roof. The extras are terrific such as audio commentary, featurettes, storyboards, 2 motion comics, photo gallery and teasers to trailers.<br /><br />A must have for Sci-fi/horror fanatics.</p></body></html>

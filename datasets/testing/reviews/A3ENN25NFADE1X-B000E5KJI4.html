Brad Pitt(Fight Club) is a great actor, but the demension he tries to ad to his character Achillies, the more he fails. What we don't know is that Achillies was in love with his cousin, and when his cousin dies, Brad show's no emotion, he just wimps. Orlando Bloom doesn't really do anything, in fact his whole career is not doing anything. In "Lord Of The Ring" he doesn't do anything, but he showed that he cared for his friends, and the girls loved him. But there is no acting in this movie, just action, action, mindless action, to be honest with you, the real actors are Peter O, Toole and Eric Banner. But thats not saying much, but Peter does save the film in some odd way.<br /><br />"Troy" has ended up like "The Alamo", same situation, and with the same outcome, the audience is sick and tired of war films, especially with no accurate details of what happened. In "Lawrence Of Arabia", the film is driven by silence, acting and beauty, but then again David Lean was a genius, and Wolfgang Peterson did only one good film(The Perfect Storm). And the battle scenes are terrible, and repentative. I was very dissapointed. Hail to "Gladiator."</p></body></html>

Many canidates spend a lot of time on it, rightfully so. You can't really swallow Mike Moore whole however. He plays the right notes to touch your emotions & indignation. Americans just like us who have inadequate health insurance, have been cheated or simply denied health care are highlighted in an informative & entertaining manner. HMO's, who have no intention of paying benefits, hire legions of people whose sole job is to deny benefits. They are the biggest demon in this documentary. He takes pains to poke a stick in the eye of the United States over things that most of us hate such as socialism (read communism) universal health care & the French. We really love to hate the French<br />mostly for no good reason. I'd really be jealous of the Canadians, English & French if what he presents is true, especially in France. They basically have nanny-care for everyone, cradle to grave courtesy of the the national government. My favorite is mandatory five weeks paid vacation for all workers. He treads very lightly on the massive tax load on citizens of these countries. But when your health bills are all paid for & your stress level goes down & it doesn't seem like such a bad trade off. Countries with universal health care generally have healthier life styles & live longer. We have a lot of socialist<br />tendencies right here when you think of it, public schools, a cheap postal system, Amtrak, food stamps etc. Univeral health coverage when seen through Mike Moore's lens seems to make sense.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Justice Served..."></head><body><p>SIN CITY is one of those miraculous movies that seems to come along every once in a while. Filled w/ violence, gore, insanity and murder, this is the hideous underbelly of hell on earth! Robert Rodriguez / Frank Miller have fashioned the perfect comic book on film. The overblown characters and impossible action take place in the netherworld of their combined imaginations, leaving us w/ a masterwork of incredible, explosive entertainment. Every evil person is a nightmarish ghoul or demon, embodied so well by the silent, stealthy, cannibalistic Kevin (Elija Wood). Every anti-hero is a darkened, jaded soul w/ one last shot at redemption. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen are the grand trinity of retribution and cold, hard justice. Their characters dole out the vengeance, and pay dearly for their trouble. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, and Rosario Dawson are just three of the many idealized, ultra-hot females worth killing and dying for. SIN CITY is a bleak universe soaked in corruption and death. It's police (Benicio Del Toro), it's politicians (Powers Boothe), and it's clergy / church (Rutger Hauer) are all rotting, stinking institutions, held together by greed, perversion, and terror. If you like your stories hard-boiled, bloody, and downright nasty, then SC should be your next destination...</p></body></html>

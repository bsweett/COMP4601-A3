<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>Really thoughful storyline.  Strong religious overtones -- basically a futuristic tale about how the Bible becomes the most sought after book on earth after a war which leads to the destruction of most of humankind.<br /><br />As usual, Denzel Washington is great as the star with Gary Oldman cast as the perfect authoritarian villain.  The future is not pretty as cannibalism, rape, rampant crime, gangs, dominate the new world that emerges after the war.  But the movie ends on a hopeful note.  Better than I expected.</p></body></html>

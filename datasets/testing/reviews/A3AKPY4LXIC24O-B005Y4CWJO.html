<meta name="summary" content="PAIN AND PLEASURE INDIVISIBLE"></head><body><p>Clive Barker's deranged and brilliant imagination brings to life a story of the darkest recesses of Hell.  The gates are opened with a puzzle box key, letting loose the denizens of the Outer Regions of the Universe, the Cenobites.  Creatures whose sole existence is to bring pain to those who summon them.  <p>Gore-laden special effects and the first film appearance of the now Horror film staple, PinHead, make this a must for Horror fans.  The story of dark seduction, murder and betrayal and the terrible price to be paid is classic Barker!  The torturous designs of the Cenobites and their malicious glee in bringing pain are some of the most disturbing images ever brought to a world wide theater going audience.  Essential viewing for every Horror fan.  Written and Directed by Clive Barker.  &quot;No tears please, it's such a waste of good suffering&quot;.</p></body></html>

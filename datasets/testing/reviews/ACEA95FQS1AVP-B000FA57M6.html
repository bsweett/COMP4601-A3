<meta name="summary" content="Very entertaining.."></head><body><p>Sometimes I marvel that so many people and movie critics expect every film to be Oscar material! Lots of action, fast paced, cool special effects--Doom is a solid, entertaining movie.  The Rock and Karl Urban carried the story forward (and provided some nice eye candy to boot).<br /><br />Are you going to find deep philosophical meaning in it?  Only if you're drunk.  Can you sit back and let go for a couple of hours? Definitely.  Bottom line is if you're a fan of action movies, add this movie to the roster.</p></body></html>

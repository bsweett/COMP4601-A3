<meta name="summary" content="Roger Moore would be proud"></head><body><p>In a marketing no-brainer, MGM  Home Entertainment has dove-tailed a new version of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; with the video debut of that suspense classic's controversial sequel, &quot;Hannibal.&quot; The film, directed by Ridley Scott, transports upscale villain Hannibal Lecter from the hills of the Eastern U.S. to the mopeds and Michelangelos of Florence, Italy. While &quot;Lambs&quot; was awash in algae green, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is cast in pale blues. Colors on the disc are often flat but fine. There is at least one instance of speckling. The DTS and Dolby Digital audio mixes are a great improvement on &quot;Lambs,&quot; but remain subdued by action-picture standards. Julianne Moore plays FBI veteran Clarice Starling as a  weary centurion, one used to the violence of the streets, but still affected by it. She aptly renders the clipped speech Jodie Foster used in the original, making it more naturalistic and beliveable. Scott, in his mostly focused director's commentary, notes that Moore's great talent is to be &quot;always different in films she does.&quot; Hopkins delivers a cartoon take on his aging Lecter, single-handedly bringing to mind the 007 transition from Sean Connery to Roger Moore. &quot;Hannibal's&quot; notoriety, of course, is based on its final scenes, in which any veneer of seriousness is stripped away. &quot;This has got to be funny,&quot; Scott observes, calling the cannibalism sequence &quot;the outrageous target at  the end of the film.&quot; A &quot;very amused&quot; medical specialist was present on the set to ensure plausibility at the dinner table, says Scott, who tells more than you'd ever want to know about brain surgery (&quot;The brain bleeds like a pig&quot;). The filmmakers struggled with three possible endings, two of which were shot. One alternative ending -- included among the disc's 20 minutes of deleted scenes -- eliminates the bloody handcuff twist. Another scene, never shot, provided a James Bond-style ending, Scott reveals. The deleted scenes are far better than usual. One elegaic Florence scene features Hopkins/Hannibal playing a haunting original composition on piano. Other extras include a surreal but unused title sequence, an interactive breakdown of key scenes offering multiple camera angles, a series of making-of featurettes, and the usual photo galleries and TV spots.</p></body></html>

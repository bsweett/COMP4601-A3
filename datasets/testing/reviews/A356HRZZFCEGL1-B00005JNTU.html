<meta name="summary" content=""Fantastic Four"'s Only True Shortcoming is - Shortness"></head><body><p>***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />Although I am a reasonably avid Fantastic Four fan, I continually procrastinated in attending a theater viewing because of the negatively vehement disappointment "professional" critics and mere mortals have been heaping on it. However,  I finally plucked up enough resolve to go see it. The verdict? My trepidation was basically groundless.<br /><br />The "Fantastic Four" (hereafter FF) possesses and displays most of the ingredients for an engrossing "superhero" motion picture: involving story, appealing and sympathetic characters, lavish and largely convincing special effects and set-pieces, an appropriately sinister and amoral antagonist, a complex but nimble plot, and refreshing humor. No, it is not a brooding, tortured, haunted movie in the overwrought "Batman" mode.  The FF doesn't roll that way. Apparently Tim Story decided to adhere to the spirit and tone of the original 60's manifestation of the comic book: an exploration of the ultimate nuclear family. The FF's predominant theme is not the power/responsibility inter-dynamic(like Spiderman), or a psychotic obsession with vengeful crimefighting (like Batman). Instead, FF engagingly unites "Lilo and Stitch"'s and Sister Sledge's themes of "We are family, where nobody gets left behind."<br /><br />Furthermore, despite its light approach, FF is actually a sensible movie. If cosmic storm energy reconfigured your DNA, you wouldn't (or shouldn't) go running off immediately to fight crime. As our colorful quartet, and even Victor von Doom (aka Dr. Doom) wisely do, they medically analyze their new conditions and powers to see if any potentially harmful side effects may occur. For example, even the brash and impulsive Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) observes, and I paraphrase, "Ben seems to be the only one who can't turn his power on and off. What if that happens to us?" Of course, such introspection can be taken to an extreme, as the pensive Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic) (Ioan Gruffudd) fully demonstrates in the movie, as he quarantines his partners and himself in a desperate attempt to reverse the storm's effects. But such cerebral caution characterizes Reed. Anyway, the FF movie provides counterpoint to the foursome's seclusion with Johnny's impetuous and successful desire to "bust out" and enjoy his incendiary new powers.<br /><br />The FF movie also plausibly and poignantly details the anguish, frustration, and shocked despair Benjamin Jacob Grimm (aka Thing)(Michael Chiklis) endures. If you found yourself imprisoned in a granite exoskeleton, wouldn't you do what Ben does - literally break out of the hospital facility, conceal your identity, and cautiously attempt to reconnect with your fianc&eacute;e? Wouldn't you swim in sullen self-pity? Ben does these things, but unlike most of us, who would probably go on an insane rampage or attempt to commit suicide, he possesses enough resiliency (Mr. Fantastic isn't the only one) and nobility to try to come to grips with his grotesque fate, even using a little grim (no pun intended) humor to cope. The saving of the bridge jumper's, the trucker's and the New York fire department's lives help illuminate this "brute"'s soul of gold. Victor's unhinged horror at his own parallel titanium transformation further reflects positively on Ben's tenacity and courage. Chiklis embraces the Thing's character and owns it. A movie with him alone would still definitely be the price of admission.<br /><br />Admittedly, the FF does deviate from realistic behavior. For example, I would agree that Susan Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) (Jessica Alba) is not a conventional idea of a genetic scientist, but she is no flighty bimbo either. She is an alluring but sweet, shy, and caring individual. As another example, the New York public warm up to the super-powered quartet a little too rapidly and unambiguously. After all, shouldn't they be a bit disturbed at the Brooklyn bridge accident, even if it was accidental? Maybe Ben's rescue of the FDNY firefighters (symbols of 9/11 heroism) helped sway public opinion. Finally, Ben's erstwhile fianc&eacute;, I don't think, would be so callous as to unceremoniously leave his engagement ring on the bridge after his heroic act. If she really cared for Ben, wouldn't she more discreetly mail it back to him. Finally (spoiler here), how did Ben Grimm, after requiring Victor's electrical boost in the simulation chamber to revert to normal, find the same power in Victor's absence to transform back to the Thing in a -yes- self-sacrificing act to help his friends? It seems a bit too abrupt.<br /><br />Yet, as my summary indicates, abruptness, as I see it, is the FF movie's only true weakness. The movie is a bit too breezy at times. For example, Ben's encounter with the blind but discerning Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) could have been developed more at length. Ditto with Reed and Sue's reconciliation. Victor's Anankin-like descent to brooding, Darth Vader-like evil needed a bit more room to grow. Both the bridge sequence and the climactic battle against Doom were a bit truncated. Nevertheless, these are minor criticisms.<br /><br />The FF is solidly rousing, accessible, uplifting entertainment.  In some ways, the movie compares to the original 1978 movie "Superman", which, as you recall, also had its share of adapting to stark social and superpower changes, goofy action sequences, wholesome humor, and broad, cartoonish villains. FF remains faithful to its origins while simultaneously blazing its own comic cinema trail. It has successfully introduced its inimitable clan to the movie world.<br /><br />Now, in the comic, the FF is not only concerned with family, but also with galactic cosmic concerns, a la Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Watchers, the Skrulls, et al. The FF sequels, and I hope there are a few, should address some of these universal themes. "The Trial of Galactus" storyline would be ideal, and perhaps satisfy the pretentiously persnickety critics who complain that comic themes are too superficial. If FF can correct its "shortness" problem in subsequent films, it should dramatically prove those critics wrong.<br /><br />As Stan Lee (mailman Willie Lumpkin in the movie) would say:<br /><br />Excelsior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S.:  I guess somebody listened to my suggestion.  The FF sequel introduces the Silver Surfer and Galactus.  However, to me the sequel was a precipitous disappointment.  But that is for another review.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unnecessary."></head><body><p>Calling 28 Weeks Later a story is, frankly, stretching things.  Think of it more as a sequence of scenes, some frenetically frightening and deeply disturbing, some marginally gross in a puerile way, others genuinely boring -- as characters trudge from point to point in search of a ride on an Apache helicopter.<br /><br />Of the characters, only one is sufficiently unique or engaging to grab the audience, and she, the mother of the family at the center of the film, dies early.  The most interesting stab at character and plot development -- a father's lie to his children about the fate of their mother -- seems full of promise, but ends shortly after take off with a crashing, blood-soaked, and, finally, charred finish. Rather than employing the time-honored idea of a character arc (in which, perhaps, the father ultimately redeems himself through some act of heroism), the father becomes this incredibly controlled killing machine (unlike all of the other infected), which then leads to random, semi-plausible people being chased from one place to the next and dying here and there, all the while haunted a foreshadowed ending that, early in Act I, hits you between the eyes (literally) like a two-by-four.<br /><br />Let me be very clear, however. 28 Weeks Later has some incredibly scary moments that will stick with you, courtesy of some terrific cinematography and post-production. The "zombies" in the film seem real, ravenous, and frightening. The opening sequences of the film are terrific for all of these reasons. And, if that's what floats your boat, and you don't really need much more, you'll likely enjoy this film. Frankly, I found it more oppressive and, at times, boring than genuinely engaging.<br /><br />I, too, am a life long horror (but not slasher) movie lover, and, in particular, a fan of apocalyptic films like this. But I prefer my horror films to be intelligent and plot-driven, not merely a bag of frights (no matter how effective). In the end, 28 Days Later was superior to this sequel in just about every way.</p></body></html>

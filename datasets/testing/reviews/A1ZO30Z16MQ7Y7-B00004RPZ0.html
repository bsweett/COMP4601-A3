Anyway, this movie was<br />great. I think this is Bruce Campbells best movie. If they remade this(with Bruce Campbell still as Ash)with better special<br />effects it would be the best moment in movie history.This movie<br />is a horror/comedy,like Scary Movie? No, this is nothing like scary movie becouse it makes up it's own comedy instead of taking<br />sceanes from other movies. The plot is about Ash(Bruce Campbell)<br />who get the book of the Dead and is sent back in time were he brings back an undead army. the only bad  thing is Ashes cach phares like &quot;Groovey&quot; this DVD is really good</p></body></html>

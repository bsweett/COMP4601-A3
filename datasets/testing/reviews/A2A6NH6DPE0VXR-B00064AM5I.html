<meta name="summary" content="Possibly the funniest movie of 2004"></head><body><p>Vince Vaughn (Old School) and Ben Stiller (There's Something About Mary) have fun here in Dodgeball. I always loved playing it as a kid in gym class and have wished it was a real sport because it's the funnest. However this movie has fun making fun of it and shows how easy it is to make fun of it. Besides Stiller and Vaughn having fun in there roles. Rip Torn is great as the manager of Vaugn's team. He has a few screws loose and tells the players if they can dodge a wrench or...on-going traffic they can dodge a dodgeball..lol. Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) also has fun as a dorky commentator. Chuck Norris and David Hasslehoff "or however u spell it" also show up in funny cameos. Anyway this movie is full of funny lines and interesting unusual characters and it's hard not to be entertained by it.</p></body></html>

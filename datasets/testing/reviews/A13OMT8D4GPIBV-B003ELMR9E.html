<meta name="summary" content="A first rate thriller from Christopher Nolan"></head><body><p>Christopher Nolan's third feature film (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F3CD">Following</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640SA">Memento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition)</a>) is as good as his first two.  A great thriller among the best in the genre.<br /><br />Will Dormier (Al Pacino) goes to Alaska to investigate the murder of a 17 year old girl.<br /><br />The movie stars not only one Oscar winner in Al Pacino, but two others in Hilary Swank and Robin Williams.  The rest of the cast is also excellent.<br /><br />A highly recommended movie for all Nolan, Pacino, Swank, and Williams fans.  And for all fans of suspense thrillers.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Be sure to also check out:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a></p></body></html>

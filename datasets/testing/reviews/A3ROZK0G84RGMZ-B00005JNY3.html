This movie is good.  I never expected it to be a spooky type of movie and it was'nt.  It was just an old style thriller with great atmosphere and great acting.  Gena Rowlands is excellent.  The story line is original and very interesting.  I hope a sequel will follow......It's time for my remedies!!!!!</p></body></html>

The storyline could have been a bit blasphemous for certain christians, but the acting and computer graphics fits perfectly with the time. The supporting cast also helped keep the story interesting. You can expect a bit of "the exorcist" in the film. I enjoyed this movie and think outside the box.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I liked it."></head><body><p>Man, this is one scary, action-packed movie.  Zombie-o-rama, with a relentless pace from the film's first scene on... Fans of the original George Romero films will not be disappointed... The script, the acting, the action are all first-rate.  Finally -- a scary monster-slasher film where the protagonist's motivations and and actions all make sense, and the kitsch is kept to a minimum.  This is one of the best, bleakest horror movies you'll ever see... and make sure you sit through the credits once the film is "over."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is No Pitch Black"></head><body><p>I was very suprised that this film really strayed from "Pitch Black."  That film was exciting, scary, and really fun.  I thought another film with Riddick might be fun, but it wasn't a lot of fun.  This is an overlong, overexposed, and over narrative sci fi yarn that looked good, but was empty inside.  The film made little sense, and took itself far too seriously.  Judi Densch must have lost a bet to stay in this dribble that is only saved by some well staged fight scenes and some brisk direction in spots to move it along.  The acting is wooden, and the screenplay introduces a lot of new characters, but fails to develop them, nor make them likable enough that we care what happens to them.  Only die hard sci fi fans will enjoy, otherwise it still is worth renting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Tense, Well Performed Suspense/Intrigue Summer Flick"></head><body><p>THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a fast paced, tension riddled, timely, well-performed and well-directed summer audience-geared action movie.  Leave it at that and you have plenty of reasons to escape the heat by sitting in an air-conditioned theater to watch the heat!  Meryl Streep continues to prove she can take any part and make it her own; Denzel Washington is once again Denzel Washington - and that is a good thing, just not monumental;  Liev Schreiber fills the shoes of his role with delicacy and aplomb.  But where is the original novel and film that have become icons?  Not much of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE  remains: the story has been so very updated and mechanized and futurized and manipulated and distorted that only the seed idea remains. Not a bad reason to remake a good film - to "make it relevant to today's political and global environmental squalor" -but don't expect the sub rosa subtleties  of the original, the suggestion of a deeper relationship between Marco and Shaw, the far more terrifying aspects of mind manipulation from the time of the Cold War to the MATRIX mentality and gadgetry of 2004.  For those, buy the original DVD or book.  But given the absence of these values, this CANDIDATE is worth your time as it touts some wonderful performances.  Too bad these same gimmicks are used so often the entire summer movie genre that they, by themselves, are growing stale.</p></body></html>

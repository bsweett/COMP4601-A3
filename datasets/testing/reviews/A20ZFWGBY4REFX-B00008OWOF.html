<meta name="summary" content="Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks....What a team!!"></head><body><p>About a few days ago, I finally managed to see director Steven Spielberg's ("Minority Report") anticipated "Catch Me If You Can". I have to admit that the film was kind of long (that is what you would expect from a Steven Spielberg film), but it really didn't matter just as long as the film was good, and man was it ever! The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio ("Titanic") and 2-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks ("Cast Away") just couldn't be better! The true-life story of "Catch Me If You Can" focuses on Frank Abagnale, Jr. (DiCaprio), a teen growing up outside of New York. His father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken in an outstanding performance) is being investigated by the IRS for maybe some back taxes and such. And the lives of Frank Jr., Frank Sr., and Frank's mother/Frank's wife, Paula (Nathalie Baye) take a turn for the worse. When Frank Jr. finds out that his whole life is in a bit of a shambles, he does the unthinkable...he embarks on a journey of impersonation and fraud by becoming a doctor, a lawyer, and an airline pilot. Not to mention that Frank has also cashed some fraudulent checks, in which the banks lost $4 million in the process...and he did it all before his 19th birthday. This case has attracted the attention of an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who is determined to bring Frank to justice...if he can catch Frank first! The direction of Steven Spielberg was just as outstanding as when he directed "Minority Report" and the "Indiana Jones" films! The scenes in "Catch Me If You Can" were hilarious, especially the scenes when Leo's character outsmarts Hanks' character throughout the film, such as when Frank hires some "stewardesses" to escort him throughout the airport without being caught by Frank and his FBI boys. In conclusion, "Catch Me If You Can" has great performances from 2 celebrated actors, a great supporting cast (Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Nathalie Baye, James Brolin, and Jennifer Garner), lots of humor, powerful storytelling, and a great soundtrack! Whenever people see "Catch Me If You Can", I just hope that they can get by with Tom Hanks' JFK-like accent in the movie, I know that I did! "Catch Me If You Can" is a great DVD addition to any Steven Spielberg collection! This is, without a doubt, Leonardo DiCaprio's best film since "Titanic" and Tom Hanks' best film since "Sleepless in Seattle"!</p></body></html>

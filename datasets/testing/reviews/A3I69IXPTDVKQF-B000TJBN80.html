And thus what we have here is one of the greatest zombie movies ever made, a horrifying, apocalyptic, well-made, character-rich movie that succeeds brilliantly in both the explosive, action-packed scenes and the character driven, story-building ones.  Twenty-eight weeks after the conclusion of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a> (I should stop now to point out that if you haven't seen the first one yet, you might not want to read this or any other review of the sequel until you have), the infected hordes in the quarantined United Kingdom have long since perished from hunger and general 'burn-out'.  Plans have been carefully made to begin reintroducing some of the millions of refugees back into England.  A multinational military effort spearheaded by the United States takes charge of clearing out safe zones, transporting the first waves back in, and guarding the 'safe' section of London against the as-yet unsecured rest of the country.  Unbeknownst to anybody, not far from the safe zone, a peculiar survivor remains, one who doesn't seem to be infected....at least not in the way the others were.<br /><br />  When a series of unforseen events, involving - among other things - a previously unknown variant of the infection, results in a breach of the safe zone, things very quickly go from bad to worse, and the military command responds with a shockingly ruthless decision that prompts some of its soldiers to turn and take matters into their own hands to try and save some of London's newly re-introduced inhabitants, who now have multiple problems to worry about.<br /><br />  There's a lot more to it than that, but I'm trying to avoid giving too much of it away, or too much towards the end.  That's the basic scenario, and blurring the lines between the good guys and the bad guys is one of the things that makes "28 Weeks Later" work so well.  Things unfold in unexpected ways, there are some very innovative scenes, and overall it feels very fresh and unpredictable in spite of the 1,273 other zombie movies out there (that's an exageration, but maybe not by much).  Now a lot of those movies are very good (and some are pretty bad) but this is one of the ones that really stands out from the pack. Some have said that the movie's other elements - the extended time before the breakout, the military prescence itself, etc. - took away too much time from the zombies themselves, but I'd disagree.  That was a bit of a problem with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JO16">Land of the Dead (Unrated Edition)</a> (still a good movie) but here they got the balance and the pacing just right, in my opinion.<br /><br />  The ending is a memorable shocker, a should-have-seen-it-coming-but-didn't moment, and casts the whole film in a new light.  Well-acted with great effects and a terrific musical score, 28 Weeks Later succeeds on all levels.<br /><br />If you're looking for more like this, there are lots of great ones out there; among the best are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y6Y2">Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)</a> (from 1968), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TO">Night of the Living Dead</a> (the 1990 Remake) and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a> (2004).</p></body></html>

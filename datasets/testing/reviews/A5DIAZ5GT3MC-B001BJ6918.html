<meta name="summary" content="Second "Bill" is violent fun!"></head><body><p>The second half of Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" saga follows the continued journey of Uma Thurman's "The Bride" on her revenge mission against her former employer as well as the remaining members of her former hit squad. It's been more than a half-year between the two films and even though, the first volume was released on video the Tuesday before the second's premiere, that is still a lot of time to pass. One might liken it to the television cliffhangers but with both VHS and summer re-runs, it is far easier to stay up to date between the time. Here is where "Volume Two" suffers.<p>"Volume Two" opens with Uma's Bride on her way to finish off her boss, Bill. Before she gets there however we flash back to where it all happened: a bloody slaughter at a chappel in Texas. From there, she continues on her hit list to Bill's alchoholic brother, Budd (Michael Madsen) and her subsequent replacement, Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah). Her battle with Driver is one of the most disgusting, exciting, and violent fights ever captured on film. This all leads to a showdown with Bill. David Carradine gives a top-notch performance. A character who was more or less confined to a "villian in the shadows" in the first film really finds his voice in this one. Perhaps the most entertaining scenes in the film revolve around The Bride training with a martial arts master named Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). Michael Parks, also gives a solid performance, showing up again, doing his Heston in "Touch Of Evil" as one of Bill's father figures, a Columbian pimp.  <p>As promised, "Volume Two" puts more of an emphasis on Tarantino's trademark dialouge. There is still plenty of action going on but those who complained about the lack of hip conversation in "Volume One" may find this one more to your liking. A scene in which Bill speaks about his favorite superheroes is particulary cool and smacks of classic Tarantino. The second film is just as unapologeticly violent though at times, it is far less cartoonish about it. There are several scenes that involve torture and violent humiliation but it's all done in a somewhat tounge-in-cheek manner.<p>The biggest problem with the overall product is the splitting of the film. It seems that both volumes are missing key ingredients from the other. While "Volume 2" is a quality piece in itself, it doesn't seem to stand well on its own. People who didn't see "Volume 1", may have little to no interest in seeing the second half. While I suppose it could work on its own, the interest by this demographic doesn't look too promising. Miramax comes out the real winner though as they stand to make three times as much money on splitting the movie into two halves. Artistically, the film suffers somewhat because of it but in the end of the day, money talks. "Volume 2" will entertain anyone who loved the first but it's not gonna win over any new viewers. It's good old-fashioned violent fun at its worst.</p></body></html>

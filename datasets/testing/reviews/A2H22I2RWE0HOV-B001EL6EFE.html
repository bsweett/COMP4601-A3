Kewel...  I never got the chance to see it, so when the DVD came out yesterday I snatched it up, of course.  Well, my children and I watched it first thing when I got home from work and I gotta say... it was not hysterically funny.  In fact, it seemed really pushed and formulaic.  I like Ben Stiller most of the time and Chris Rock and David Scwimmer was perfet for the hypochodriac giraffe, but it seemed forced.  The penguins were funny...as were the lemurs.  It just felt middle-of-the-road for me.  I usually enjoy animated movies with my kids (we own every Disney DVD) and I did enjoy this one, just not that much.  Kind of a disappointment.  See for yourself.  Maybe I was just tired, but I doubt that.  I know funny and it did garner a few chuckles from me, but this is not knock-down-drag-out funny.  (See Monty Python's Holy Grail for that or Spinal Tap or The Emperor's New Groove for that matter....)  Overall...bland.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

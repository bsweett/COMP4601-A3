<meta name="summary" content="MG tries to update "Braveheart" for 1776..."></head><body><p>Ben Martin ("Mel Gibson") is a scarred vet of the French and Indian War who resists and then enters the revolutionary war in this movie that seems at times an update of  the superior "Braveheart".<br /><br />A happily settled widower in Carolina, Martin stays aloof of the revolutionary cause, mostly because of his distaste for any government (serving a tyrant 3000 miles away beats serving one ruling from down the block) but also because he's still haunted by the brutalities of the older war. The war comes to him, hot on the heels of his fiery son-turned Continental soldier. Although the British forces in the Carolinas are led by sage and otherwise humane general Cornwallis, the Tories' brutal side is embodied by one charachter - the sadistic Colonel Tavington. In his first confrontation with the colonel, Martin's eldest son is captured, while the youngest is cruelly shot. Martin joins the revolutionary effort, amassing a scraggly horde of swamp fighters who pick the redcoats off from behind trees while the Continentals' army struggles vainly out in the open against the superior might of the redcoats. The revolution's only hope is to keep the enemy forces in Carolina - which has numbers, weapons and Cornwallis on its side - from linking up to the British Army in NY and choking Washington into defeat. The French have promised a blockade and their own military support, but nothing materializes quickly. Martin doesn't play by British rules, refusing to line up his meager and swampy forces as cannon fodder for the British. Martin's early successes galvanize the Colonial's hopes, but also rouse the British, and soon invite more personal tragedy for Martin and his family. Col. Tavington doesn't play by the rules either. Realizing his military tactics (which include annihilating whole towns suspected of abetting the Continentals' guerrilas) will prevent him from returning to England, he sets on a path that will give him his own fiefdom in America ("let's talk about....Ohio"). With the Continental's position improving and becoming more desperate at the same time, the stage is set for a climactic battle where Martin will face Tavington and the might of the British Empire without a swamp to hide behind.<br /><br />Historically, the flick is suspect.  There are no rich slave owners (Martin's slaves were released and remain as his tenants), and white soldiers erase their prejudice against black patriots as soon as the two have shared a battle.  As for the flick's nominal villain, it's hard to take the evil Tavingotn at face value: were there as evil a character as Tavington fighting in the colonies, would the script have had to invent a fictional composite?<br /><br />"The Patriot" follows "Braveheart" very closely, but the story does go its own direction at times, and there's more of a story to the bit players - tough guerrila soldiers who find themselves quite emotionally vulnerable when their families are victimized, or other white soldiers who learn that black soldiers can be just as valiant as themselves and should be free. The British aren't the uniformly snearing and evil crew that faced the scots in that older film. While patriotism is upfront, the film doesn't come off jingoistic.  Unlike "Braveheart", Gibson's character here tends to embody a cause more often than a person who just happens to be critical to the cause.  All-in-all, good for a night when you're in the mood for an epic, but nothing great is on.</p></body></html>

All I could think of was his many years of insane comedic roles. Then, I heard that ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND had a sci-fi angle, and I figured it would have to be a total disaster. I was wrong. Winslet and Carrey's Clementine and Joel are absolutely endearing and believable. They go together like bread and butter, easily convincing me that these damaged characters truly love each other. The whole memory-erasure thing is well done and adds a nice, bizarre twist to the procedings. If you look at my reviews, you'll see very few love stories, but this one is a masterpiece of comedy, romance, and a completely off-kilter atmosphere. If you enjoy movies like SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE or 12 MONKEYS, and a bit of romance doesn't terrify you, then ESOTSM will satisfy. Highest recommendation...</p></body></html>

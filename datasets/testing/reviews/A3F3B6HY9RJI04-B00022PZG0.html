The kids were cute, yes, and Joan Cusack did a fantastic job, yes, but that was as good as the movie got.  Oh, and the jam session during the closing credits was pretty good as well.<p>First off, Jack's character (Dewey) was just unlikable.  There was nothing that had me rooting for the guy.  He was deceitful, greedy, and unloving.  Worst off, he just wasn't all that funny.  There was one scene that actually made me laugh out loud... but I laugh easily so this isn't saying much.  And it is most definitely not a reason to keep handing this guy lead roles.  Supporting cast... yeah, he does great there.  But lead role?  He is not of that caliber.  Leave that to the pros.<p>Second, the story was too unbelievable.  I can handle a little bit of make-believe, but this had you saying, "Yeah, right!!" throughout most of the movie.  Basically because you've got an IDIOT who dupes a school of geniouses into thinking he is the real thing.  If the top private schools were this easily dupes I would never have served detention in the public schools I attended.<p>If you are a Jack Black fan, then see this movie.  It is very typical of his other roles.  If you cringed through Shallow Hal, don't waste your time/money/patience on this movie.</p></body></html>

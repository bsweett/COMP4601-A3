<meta name="summary" content="Way to long, decent acting, but just not a great story."></head><body><p>I just didn't like this movie all that much.  I knew some details about the Zodiac killer before I saw the movie, essentially that the killer had never been found.  I wondered how they could make a film out of an unsolved crime. And that question is the essential flaw of this film.  One, the film is 157 minutes long...and the conclusion is as I knew it when I started, No Killer found.  So they built the drama and action in the movie around who it "could be".  Eh, who cares, catch me a killer. And somewhere about halfway through, I just didn't care what Gyllenhaal's character did...I just thought the guy was stupid for wrecking his marraige for nothing...he accomplishes nothing. Am I suppose to feel sorry for him giving up his life to find a killer and failing.  Oh well, I guess if I didn't know the history, this may have been interesting, but I did, so this movie was long, and ended just as expected, very blah. rent this one.</p></body></html>

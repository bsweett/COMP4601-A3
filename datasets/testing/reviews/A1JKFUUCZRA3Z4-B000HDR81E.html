<meta name="summary" content="Why is it all his fault?"></head><body><p>This movie has it's good points and not so good points regarding (1) the main characters, (2) the supporting characters and (3) the overall storyline.<br /><br />1 -- the main characters<br /><br />Vince Vaughn -- this is the funniest I've seen Vaughn (second best was his role in Swingers).  I especially loved the scene where his girlfriend accuses him of being bitter that her brother kicked his a**.  The look on his face as well as his response just cracked me up.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston -- on the show Friends, I thought Aniston was the funniest female character (and, therefore, couldn't understand why Lisa Kudrow kept winning awards).  But I've noticed that in movies, she doesn't bring the same sparkle she brought to Friends.  Instead, her performances falls flat.  This movie is no exception.  Her acting here is very lethargic.<br /><br />2 -- the supporting characters<br /><br />Jon Favreau -- loved him in Swingers and in this movie as well.  The scene at the end where he's giving Vaughn advice on how to handle Aniston's new love interest is the funniest part in the movie.<br /><br />Cole Hauser -- Hauser normally plays serious roles, but in this movie, proves he can also do comedy.  The scene where he hits on these two women is both creepy and hilarious.<br /><br />Jason Bateman -- I'm a big fan of Bateman.  He's just a natural comedian.  His role in this movie is small, but he still manages to make those scenes funny, too.<br /><br />Justin Long -- I think Long has a very natural, very believable acting style.  In this movie, however, his talents are underused.  Instead, he relies on a weird hairdo and costume to provide all the gags, but they're not even funny.<br /><br />Vincent D'onofrio -- D'onofrio is the only person in this film who seemed really out of place.  His attempts at trying to be funny only made me cringe and feel sorry for him.  He should stick to drama.<br /><br />3 -- the overall storyline<br /><br />This movie definitely has it's funny moments, however, I have a gripe about the overall storyline.  What bothered me was that the fault of the breakup seemed to rest solely with Vaughn's character.  But I think they were both at fault.<br /><br />Towards the end, when Aniston is blaming him for not giving enough to the relationship, Vaughn makes an important point that he's not a mind reader.  I agree.  Based on his apology at the end, I think had she spoken up, he would've done anything to make her happy.<br />I mean, I could see if she asked him to change and he refused, but she didn't even ask.  Instead she expected him to read her mind and when he failed to do that (because he doesn't have any magical powers), she let her resentment fester to the point where she broke up with him.<br />This seemed really unfair to me and not a good message for women to walk away with.<br /><br />I think a better message would be for Aniston to apologize as well, saying she wished she had spoken up earlier about her unmet needs and because she didn't, it caused her resentment to reach it's boiling point.<br />That would've been refreshing to see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the quintessential action films of all time"></head><body><p>This is the film that would influence hundreds of action films for years to come, made director John McTiernan a household name, and made a global superstar out of Bruce Willis.  Willis stars as New York Detective John McClaine, who goes to Los Angeles to see his wife (Bonnie Bedilia) and family, but finds himself running and gunning for his life when a group of terrorists take over the Nakatomi building holding hostages (including his wife), and only McClaine can stop them.  As the Amazon review says, Die Hard would set the stage for action films for years to come such as Under Siege, Passenger 57, and Executive Decision; but none of those films could ever match the intense action (possibly some of McTiernan's best directing in his career), engaging cinematography (courtesy of Jan de Bont who would later helm another action masterpiece with Speed), and fantastic performances from Willis (his wisecracking one liners would also set the stage for future big screen heroes) and Alan Rickman as the nefarious head terrorist Hans Gruber.  This Five Star edition of the film is great and is undoubtadly one of 20th Century Fox's best produced DVD's on the market.  The great picture transfer allows us to see the brilliance of the film, and the commentary from McTiernan is worth the price of admission alone.  The branching scenes don't add much to the film, but they themselves are a nice extra.  This blockbuster would also spawn an inferior (but nonetheless action packed and fun) sequel that was directed by Renny Harlin, and McTiernan would return to the helm for the third and in my opinion best installment, Die Hard With A Vengeance.  All in all, consider this essential viewing if you've ever called yourself an action film fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The O'Connells are back and so is Imhotep"></head><body><p>Ten years after their original bout with Imhotep, Rick (Fraser) and Evelyn (Weisz) O'Connell have settled down and have an eight-year-old son, Alex.  Imhotep's safely behind them and locked away in the British museum, when another evil comes into play. It's up to the couple to save the world--and their incorrigible son--once more.<br /><br />This episode has all the facets of the original "Mummy" coupled with an enduring love and an endearing little boy who literally steals the show from both good and bad guys.  This is more slash and burn style archeology without the gore of an Indiana Jones film.  Some of the effects in this show were a little too much--in particular, the pygmy mummies were a real stretch of suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, August 2008</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="stealing from a casino....crazy!"></head><body><p>George Clooney plays Danny Ocean.  Danny just got out of prison for a mistake he made 5 years ago.  Along with that mistake, he lost his wife.  Coming out of prison doesn't deter him from crime.  He immediately rounds up 10 men to help him steal from a vault that stores money from 3 casinos.  This is a big and dangerous mission.  There has been 3 attempts to rob the casinos and none of them have been successful.<br /><br />In the midst of their planning and training, an tidbit of information comes to light.  The owner of these casinos is Terry Benedict (Garcia).  That's not the important part.  The important part is that Terry's current girlfriend is Tess (Roberts).  Tess is Danny's ex-wife.  So the question is...is Danny doing this for the money or is he doing this for his ex-wife?  Of course, the gang is upset as it puts the mission in jeopardy.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the mission continues with some adjustments.  The question is will Ocean and his gang succeed with the mission?<br /><br />I have to say that *Ocean's Eleven* is one of the best heist film that I've seen in recent years.  I may not have agreed with the selection of actors but I do have to say that the chemistry between them was great.</p></body></html>

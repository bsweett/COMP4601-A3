<meta name="summary" content="The Quintessential Jack Nicholson performance"></head><body><p>Ken Kesey's brilliant novel is perfectly adapted to the screen and expertly directed by Milos Forman.  Within these friendly confines Jack Nicholson gave the performance by which I measure all his others.  Randall Patrick McMurphy is a rebel.  He's anti-establishment.  He likes women and to have a drink and to watch baseball.  In some ways he represents the absolute worst of men, yet at the same time he also represents much of the best in men, and at ALL times he is definitely a &quot;man's man&quot;.<p>He has been sent to prison for statutory rape, but he's not particularly remorseful about it because the girl looked and acted older and wanted it.  We should be appalled by McMurphy's attitude, yet Nicholson plays him pretty much the way Kesey wrote him, and we sympathize with him.<p>McMurphy has earned a trip to the state mental hospital by acting &quot;a little nuts&quot; and you recognize by watching that McMurphy is the kind of guy who would not hesitate to &quot;act a little nuts&quot; to get off of the hard manual labor of a state pen chain-gang.  But at this mental hospital McMurphy runs up against his worst nightmare: Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched.<p>Louise Fletcher earned her best actress Oscar in one of the most methodically unsympathetic roles in silver screen history.  Nurse Ratched pretends to have the best interests of the patients in mind, yet she is obviously subtly manipulating not only the patients, but also the remainder of the hospital staff to maintain an iron rod of control over her little corner of the universe. Crossing Nurse Ratched is a certain path to disaster for those who are in her sphere.<p>McMurphy and Ratched cross swords over and over.  It could have become boring or depressing, but we are entertained repeatedly by McMurphy's ingenious or bravura attempts to one-up Nurse Ratched.  Yet SHE is the one who has the power in this universe, and I could only marvel at her as she cold-heartedly crushes the life from McMurphy and the other patients.  <p>If ever Academy Awards were given out for &quot;Best Supporting Cast&quot;, this one would have taken that one as well.<br />A film for the ages.</p></body></html>

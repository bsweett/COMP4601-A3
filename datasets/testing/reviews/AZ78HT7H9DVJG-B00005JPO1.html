Heck, I didn't even know there had been talks of making another Indiana Jones.  So, this was a surprise for me.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull dealt with a particular topic that I would have never guess that Indiana would explore.  I guess it only makes sense with him being an archeologist/adventurer as well with the time frame.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and his band of friends race against the Soviet agents to acquire the crystal skull that is believed to be originated from the Mayans.  The lead Soviet agent believes the crystal skull holds psychic powers.  Indiana fights to save the crystal skull from falling into the wrong hands.  However, his attempts are deflected as he faces capture, betrayal, chases, shoot-outs and, of course, surprising revelations.  Ah, the good ol' Indy movies!<br /><br />Despite some erroneous facts, such as the siafu ants, and some not quite-up-to-par stunt works, Indy remains capable of capturing my attention throughout.  I'd see it again!</p></body></html>

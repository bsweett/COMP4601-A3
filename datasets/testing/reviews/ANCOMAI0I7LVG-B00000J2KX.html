<meta name="summary" content="One of the smartest horror films of all time..."></head><body><p>There are few films that can deliver the same chills and feeling of eminent dread that `The Shining' manages to bestow upon the viewer each and every time it is watched.  Just about every frame is perfectly crafted to entice genuine feelings of misery, fear and anguish.  This is one of those rare films that can stop your heart dead cold while simultaneously causing it to beat louder and faster than it has every beaten before.  `The Shining' is, in all honesty, one of the most effective horror films every filmed.<br /><br />But, thankfully, it's also one of the smartest.<br /><br />Yes, `The Shining', helmed at the capable hands of Stanley Kubrick, proves to be far more than a slew of cheap thrills but in the end becomes a fascinating film, one with enough `hidden' messages and meanings to keep the audience guessing long after the film has wrapped.  I love films that move you to ponder the vision behind it, and Kubrick has always been known as the supreme visionary.  `The Shining' is no exception.  When you look at Kubrick's work you can see his ability to make something deeply disturbing and ultimately `important'.  Just look at `A Clockwork Orange', `Eyes Wide Shut' and the obvious `2001: A Space Odyssey' and you'll see that Kubrick is far from a `simple' director.  So then `The Shining' would no doubt be far from a `simple' horror film.  When you watch and dissect all of the clues and tricks Kubrick places throughout the film (there are whole websites dedicated to this film and that very purpose) then you will begin to see this film in a whole new light entirely.<br /><br />Couple Kubrick with the intensity that is Stephen King and you have the potential for greatness.<br /><br />What I think happened here, sadly, is that many `horror' fans were expecting to see King's novel transported onto the screen; nothing more, nothing less.  Kubrick is not that simple.  If you look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' (although he did stay `truer' to that work than this) you can see that Kubrick always makes his films his own.  The same is true with `The Shining', but to a greater extreme.  Stanley Kubrick gave us his interpretation of the novel.  I admire this, adore this even.  Kubrick was a fascinating director who took chances and risks and they almost always paid off.  This is a masterful example of those risks working wonders for the finished product.<br /><br />The film follows the Torrance family; Jack, Wendy and their son Danny.  Jack and his wife have been asked to care for the `OutLook Hotel' for the winter and they are more than looking forward to the task.  It doesn't take long though for this task to turn into a burden when strange things start taking place and Jack begins to descend into the darkness of insanity.<br /><br />I don't really want to say much more about the plot or the events that unfold.  This is a film you really must see to fully appreciate.  What helps elevate this film is Jack Nicholson's flawless performance as Jack Torrance.  I'm going to broach the same subject I jostled around when reviewing Tim Burton's `Batman'.  Jack Nicholson always plays a variation of himself; and I adore this about him.  He's one of our greatest actors ever even if his range is slightly jilted by his overpowering demeanor.  I am the one person in all humanity who disliked his turn as The Joker.  I just thought it was too much.  It was an example of Jack playing Jack poorly (in my opinion)...but Jack Torrance is the supreme example of Jack playing Jack masterfully.  All his eccentricities are here in fullest form and they add so much to the fear permeating the film.  Any other actor would have fallen flat in my opinion for no one else can play Jack like Jack.  `The Shining' may be a smart film, but without Jack it would lose a lot of its chill-factor.<br /><br />When you take a flawless director and take a flawless actor and give them free reign with a flawless script you have a flawless film; no way around it.<br /><br />The other actors in the film have their ups and downs.  Danny Lloyd us very, very effective as Danny Torrance.  Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.  They work off one another brilliantly, and Lloyd effectively carries one of the most spine-chilling scenes in the film (`redrum') and manages to stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.  Shelley Duvall is less effective (thus the Razzie nomination).  Her whiney annoyance is a little much to take at times, especially towards the films conclusion.  I won't give her too much flak though for she does prove to be frantically stimulating (especially in that bathroom scene) at times.  When every other facet of the film is perfect you tend to forgive effortlessly the minor faults.<br /><br />In the end I must say that `The Shining' is in a league all its own.  As far as horror films go, there really is no better place to look.  Unfairly snubbed by every awards body at the time, `The Shining' is seriously one of the finest films ever made.  Kubrick was a master of the lens, and this is a superlative example of that very fact.</p></body></html>

I mean, it stars the Rock and it's based of a video game.  The Rock, mind you, is a terrible actor if I've ever seen one and his choice in films is rediculous.  I have to say that through most of the movie I was thinking 'the acting may suck but the MOVIE itself isn't terrible' which may only come because I had NO INTEREST IN SEEING IT WHATSOEVER...I was actually dragged there through guilt since I forced my friend to see Saw II against his will and so I saw this against mine.  The graphics are okay, nothing major, the scares are there, but not very often and the gore is there but not a whole lot of it really.  The best scene in the entire film is the last one, the fight between Reaper and Sarge.  As I said the Rock is a terrible actor, but when you consider he started as a wrestler than you know the highlight of any of his films will of course be the fight scene.  Oh yeah, and I thought the whole movie was going to be first-person...NO, only about 3 minutes at the very end...and to clarify my TITLE to my review...when you play a video game, much like Doom, you are estatic to find the BFG, that Big F#$%ing Gun youve been searching for...when you watch a movie, that same BFG becomes RFD...Really F@#$ing Dumb...it's a movie...not a video game...remember that...to hear the Rock stare in awe at a gun suspended in air and mutter crap like "wow" and "cool" is just stupid...</p></body></html>

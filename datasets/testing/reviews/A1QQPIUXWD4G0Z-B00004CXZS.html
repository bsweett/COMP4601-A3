<meta name="summary" content="The Best Of The Star Trek Motion Pictures"></head><body><p>A good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) Taken all together, this is the best Star Trek to be released on motion picture. It offers a pleasant recap of unfinished business presented in the original TV series and, it has all the requirements for a great film in terms of direction, script, and cinematography.<br /><br />  The film addresses the uncertain fate of Kahn (Ricardo Montalban) and his minions who first appeared in the original episode titled 'Space Seed.' Kahn is a product of the past when the Earth was embroyled in a eugenic war. Kahn and his followers were banished from Earth and sent to roam empty space in their ship, The Botany Bay, in cryogenic freeze. After running into the Enterprise and coming out of his slumber, Kahn sought to take over Kirk's ship but his plot was foiled: Kahn and his crew were placed on the uninhabited planet of City Alpha 5 to spend the rest of their days in exile. The film starts at a much later period where Federation men accidentally run into Kahn's colony. Kahn escapes and seeks vengeance on Kirk for having abandoned him on a desolate planet. With guile and cruelty, Kahn seizes a new machine that can be transformed into the most destructive weapon the Federation has ever seen. Will Kirk and his crew stop him in time?<br /><br />  Ricardo Montalban is definitely the shining star in this movie. His expressions of rage and obsession are quite impressive. The rest of the cast (Shatner, Kelley, Nimoy, etc.) perform their usual Enterprise routine pretty well. The film has a fast-moving plot with a good script and great special effects. This is truly the gem of all Star Trek motion picture films.</p></body></html>

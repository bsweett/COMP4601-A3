When I first saw the trailer, it revealed a comedy that took place in Vegas, had a couple moments worthy of smirking about, and a cameo by Mike Tyson. It didn't appear to be anything special and I expected it to be moderate box-office success, mildly funny, but unmemorable. I was wrong...The Hangover is not without its generic moments, but it's a fresh, hilarious comedy that is still funny even after seeing it several times.<br /><br />Phillips opens his film in the middle of the story with Phil (Bradley Cooper) telling a woman over the telephone that he can't find Doug and she won't be getting married in the next few hours. Hours earlier, Doug (Justin Bartha) left for Las Vegas with Phil, Stu (Ed Helms), and his soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis) for his bachelor party. While the night starts off well, the next morning everyone awakens in their destroyed hotel suite to find that not only is Doug missing...But there's a tiger in the bathroom. Of course, the rest of the film is about the three hung-over friends trying to find Doug before his wedding and the ridiculous (yet hilarious) situations they find themselves in.<br /><br />What immediately separates this movie from the typical idiotic comedy is the characters, particularly the three leads. These are not generic, stock-characters; they have their own established personalities and are all likeable for their own reason. Phil is a school-teacher, married with a child, looking forward to getting away from his boring life; Stu is a dentist, whose over-bearing girlfriend beats him; Alan is an awkward, inept man-child. The chemistry of these three actors, whose varied styles of humor complement each other and make for an even funnier film, is the main reason why this film works, while credit must also must be given to the writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (as well as Todd Phillips and Jeremy Garelick, who are uncredited). The actors are given material to work with that has some of the contrivances of other, less memorable comedies but has better characterization, a little more originality, and never seems to strain for laughs. Even the Mike Tyson-cameo, which I expected to just be a typical unnecessary celebrity cameo, is actually pretty funny.<br /><br />There's hardly a minute of this film that isn't hilarious and it's filled with memorable, quotable dialogue. While it's almost a clich&eacute; to mention now, try keeping a straight-face during Alan's "wolf-pack" speech. The hilarity doesn't end when the credits begin to roll either, as you'll see. I've seen The Hangover four times and what has impressed me even more about this film is how it's gotten better and funnier on each viewing, while I expected the opposite. The Hangover is a surprising success in more ways than one and while it's reached a level of success that has caused many people to shout "it's overrated," you will likely embrace this movie the way most of the world has. If you're looking for an all-out, laugh-a-minute comedy you shouldn't be disappointed by this. Despite its enduring popularity, I can't say for sure if this film will go down in comedy history, but I didn't expect it to become the highest grossing R-rated comedy in United States box-office history either.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

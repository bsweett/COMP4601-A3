<meta name="summary" content="One of the Coen Bros. best!"></head><body><p>This was one of the weirdest movies that I have ever seen! It was also one of the best Coen brothers movies that I have ever seen. There is a very simplistic storyline revolving around this guy named "the Dude". His real name is Jeff Lebowski, and one day he comes home to find these thugs at his house asking him for money that he obviously dosent have. You see, there is another Jeff Lebowsky that lives in the neighborhood. He is a wheelchair bound millionaire who lives in a mansion. The thugs finally realize this, get mad, and ruin the Dudes oriental rug that is in his living room. It was the rug that "tied the whole room together" as the Dude says. So, the next day, the Dude sets off to the millionaires house to complain and get a new rug. He eventually gets caught up in a lot of stuff that happens later on, like whenever the millionaire's young wife gets "kidnapped", and they ask the Dude to drop off the ransom. <p>Lots of other crazy stuff happens from there on out, and I'm not giving away anymore, so if you haven't seen it, SEE IT! Its absolutly goofy and fun to watch! <p>The only problem that I had with the film was the unnecessary, pervasive language. Definitly not for children.</p></body></html>

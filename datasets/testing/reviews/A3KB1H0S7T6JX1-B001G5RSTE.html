<meta name="summary" content=""All Hail the New York Giants!""></head><body><p>A WONDERFUL animated comedy, Madagascar, brings to the screen the story of four animals who escape from the zoo in NYC and the "sheltered life" they had been living there only to end up in the wilderness on the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa, with all the ups and downs that that entails!<br /><br />Madagascar is a film about friendship, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, integrity and inner strength.<br /><br />Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT!<br /><br />In short, Madagascar is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek movies, Antz, and Monsters Inc.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Julia Roberts has outdone herself!"></head><body><p>Julia Roberts is known for her romantic comedies. Even though she hasn't exactly been typecast, films like Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway  Bride stand out in her film r&eacute;sum&eacute;. However, she has proven that her acting  is definitely worthy of an Oscar with Erin Brockovich. <p>This is a true  story about a struggling single mother whose only wish is to have some  financial security for her three children. Having suffered a minor car  accident, she persuades her lawyer into hiring her. She begins to take  interest in a particular case. Several families have suffered from diseases  because their water is contaminated with chromium -- the Multi-billionaire  Company responsible has offered to buy their homes for a lot less than the  market value. The lawsuit, of course, is a big one for such a small law  firm, but neither Erin nor Ed (Albert Finney) has given up on the fact that  the company must be punished. <p>Julia Roberts has brought a dynamic  heroine to life. Her acting is quite impressive in this film. I highly  recommend</p></body></html>

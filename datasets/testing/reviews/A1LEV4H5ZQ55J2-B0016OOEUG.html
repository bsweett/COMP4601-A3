<meta name="summary" content="A ROMANTIC WHO DUN' IT"></head><body><p>Laura is played by Gene Tierney, a lady with a compelling personality and the embodiment of unattainable beauty.<br /><br />In "Laura" she plays a Park Avenue advertising executive and becomes introduced to Waldo Lydecker as a potential source to endorse customer products. The film is set in New York City among the most elegant and sophisticated office, apartment and restaurant scenes.<br /><br />Albeit, the opening scenes reveal that Laura is dead, and a police detective, played by Dana Andrews, investigates the crime. The single most important clue is that all the men in Laura's life were in love with her, and that includes Waldo (Clifton Webb), a powerful radio commentator that eventually tried to lure Laura with his influence and charm her with worldly possessions. Vincent Price was in love with Laura too, but we learn that he quite regularly falls in love, since he is broke, unable to stoop to a job, so requires the company of at least a working girl.<br /><br />This movie is a well made romantic drama, a film noir in its day and even until now has the strength to entertain well. Shock scenes build the suspense as the conclusion comes with a surprise. And I will  not spoil it!<br /><br />The theme music "Laura" was very popular and remains so to this day.<br /><br />A great movie and treasured ever since I first saw it as a school boy in a local theater.</p></body></html>

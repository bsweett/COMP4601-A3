<meta name="summary" content="Jet Li good"></head><body><p>For those accustomed to seeing Jet Li in campy (if entertaining) American movies like Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, Hero may come as a bit of a shock at first.  Directed by Zhang Yimou, who's apparently a pretty big deal in China, Hero is an epic morality tale writ large, filled with outsized emotions and political intrigue that just goes to show you not much has changed in the past 2000 years or so.  On its face, it concerns the king of Qin's campaign to unite the seven states of China, but there's a lot more going on beneath the surface.  What starts out as a story of a humble civil servant doing his duty for his king eventually turns into an operatic tale of vengeance, honor, and conflicting values, with plenty of breaks for the kind of rousing martial-arts action that made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon so legendary.<br /><br />The quote that opens the film states that in any war there are heroes on both sides, and indeed Hero more than anything else is an examination of the idea of heroism.  The most important idea to be taken from this movie (in this writer's humble opinion, of course), is that of idealism, more specifically how it serves to motivate people.  Nameless is obviously an example of how people's ideals can evolve over time, as his motivations shift from a narrow desire for revenge to a broader concern for the greater good of his people (whether his actions are the best way to achieve the greater good is debatable, but beside the point).  Similarly, we see how Broken Sword and Snow quarrel over the wisdom of assassinating the Emperor, even though both have noble intentions, or at least think they do.  Even the Emperor himself is a paragon of moral ambiguity, as he relentlessly pursues his goal in spite of his awareness of the cost in human lives (incidentally, if you want to see this subject explored from a decidedly different angle, check out the even better film The Emperor and the Assassin).  In the end, whether explicitly or not, each major character has statement to make (actually, Zhang Ziyi's Moon is somewhat extraneous, but I'm willing to let it slide because she's hot).<br /><br />Of course, this being a Jet Li movie and all, much attention is going to be focused on the fight scenes, and none of them fail to disappoint, whether Li is involved in them or not.  It's movies like this one for which the term "poetry in motion" was invented.  And if you think there aren't enough swordfights in film these days, you should check this movie out at the earliest possible moment.  Just about every battle here is tense, precisely choreographed and shot, and at times even emotional. While there's plenty (maybe a bit too much) of the expected high-flying, intricate action, the scenery ends up becoming more of a focus since it's just so damn stunning.  As many have noted, each fight scene showcases a predominant color, be it red, green, or white, but what's more important is the attention to detail that Yimou put into filming them.  Everything has some significance, from swirling leaves to falling drops of water to the string music that plays during the early battle between Nameless and Sky.  This is the rare movie that can consistently engage your senses without overloading them.<br /><br />It's not just the combat scenes that provide some major eye candy, though: visually, this whole movie is a stunner.  The cinematography gives some idea of the vastness of the Chinese landscape, with awe-inspiring shots of steppes, deserts, and forests, and the scenes involving massed Chinese armies are among the most foreboding and impressive I've seen anywhere.  The arrow attack on the calligraphy school, in addition to being rather poignant in its own way, is particularly impressive in its use of perspective, with shots that do for arrows what John Woo's direction has done for bullets.  In a similar vein, although it's a minor detail, the scene where Nameless sticks his sword through the middle of an arrow shaft is just about the coolest thing in martial-arts movie history.<br /><br />Since so much has been said on the subject, I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't throw in my two cents about the political implications of Hero.  Personally, I find the accusations that this movie is an apology for communism or totalitarianism to be exaggerated if not utterly baseless.  Yes, we all know China is a communist country, and communists do all kinds of naughty things, but this movie hardly goes out of its way to endorse any particular ideology.  It's really more about such themes as unity, sacrifice, and patriotism, which countless filmmakers the world over have explored without mentioning communism.  More to the point, with the exception of the postscript that appears on the screen after the action has already ended, the movie doesn't endorse the actions of Nameless or anyone else; it merely demonstrates that different people have different notions of what constitutes "doing the right thing."  While viewers are certainly going to draw their own political messages from this movie, the ideas explored here are far more eternal and universal than any ephemeral debate over systems of governance or the virtues of centralized power.  People need to just watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is, not start inferring messages that don't exist.</p></body></html>

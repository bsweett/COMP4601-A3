<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was pretty good. Travolta was good in the villianous role of Saint. Thomas Jane was good as The Punisher. It had a lot of good action and a lot of the scenes were right out of the comic. I wish they would have kept it dark and seedy and in New York or wherever and it irks me that they felt the need to change little things like that and putting it in Florida for no reason was stupid. Rebecca Romijin was and is always pretty hot but she is not a very good actress. They had a bit too much good feeling stuff with the other people who lived in the building who were trying to make Frank feel good and be part of their family. But I am the kind of person that likes Frank Castle to be a bitter, burt out killing machine. But hey at least they didn't have a happy ending where he runs into the super model next door neighbors arms ( come on! I mean they live in a slum and why the hell is Rebecca Romijin living there and still looking like a super model?). I thought this movie got kind of a bad rap. It wasn't that bad.</p></body></html>

Even after you see the whole movie, you wonder if you really understand what happens in the movie. The movie makes me question my notions of truth and reality, perception and emotion, love and trust.<br /><br />The acting is good. The primary and secondary actors performed their roles well. Everybody is believable. The editing and sets were not great, but the story is what draws you in.<br /><br />The main twist of the movie is the main character does not have short term memory. The technique of telling the story backwards draws the veiwer into the main character's confusion and frustration. The story gradually unfolds not only the mystery, but the protaganist's dismal and painful life. However, the protagonist keeps his sense of humor. It is an amazing experience.<br /><br />The movie is an unique experience and well worth watching.</p></body></html>

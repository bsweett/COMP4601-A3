This is Johnny Blayze millenium version of Ghost Rider played by Nick Cage. A lot of action violence and plays almost like a horror film. This is one of the more off beat of the entries found in the 2000s trend for comic book super hero movies because Ghost Rider is like a demon avenger on a motorcycle and made a deal with Zarathos, an unholy devil. I liked it. I'm a fan of the 90s Dan Ketch incarnation of Ghost Rider and this holds up pretty well to fans of the comic.</p></body></html>

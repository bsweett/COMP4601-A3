<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing Yet Very Powerful"></head><body><p>Edward Norton is a fabulous actor, yet his portrayal as an angry, hate-filled skinhead in AMERICAN HISTORY X may be his best, most powerful performance.  Norton so immerses himself in the role of a young man feeling disenfranchised from his culture and society that his racist rants take on a surreal logic all their own; one of the primary reasons this is such a disturbing film.<br /><br />The interracial interaction and tension is as volatile as it is believable, making the first half of the film extremely uncomfortable to watch.  Stacy Keach playing a cold, cunning, calculating mentor to the skinhead gang is extremely effective, and Edward Furlong is compelling as Norton's impressionable younger brother.  The brothers come from a highly dysfunctional family, matriarched by a frightened, unstable mother (Beverly D'Angelo).  Once Norton's character is sent to prison for gunning down two African Americans, AMERICAN HISTORY X takes a decided turn, as the protagonist experiences a reawakening--and a very ironic friendship.<br /><br />Upon his release our main character has a much different outlook on life, yet cannot turn his younger brother away from years of indoctrinated hate, and the film moves relentlessly toward its hopelessly tragic (and horrific) conclusion.  One does indeed reap what one sows--a powerful lesson to take from AMERICAN HISTORY X, a compelling, engrossing, yet disturbing film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

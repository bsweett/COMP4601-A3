<meta name="summary" content="Mission Accomplished!"></head><body><p>With the first `Mission Impossible' film, Cruise and DePalma created a smart thriller that made us think more than anything else...With the second `Mission Impossible' film, Woo did what he does best and created a high octane thrill ride with stunt after stunt and fight after fight, but with the third installment J.J. Abrams does a one up on both previous directors and delivers a solid mix of BOTH, giving us an intelligent and thought provoking plot coupled with some great action sequences.<br /><br />Here Cruise reprises his signature role as Ethan Hunt, except Ethan is no longer working as a spy but is now retired and recently engaged to the beautiful Julia (Monaghan) who has no idea of Hunt's past.  Hunt however is suddenly thrown back into the life he left behind when he's dispatched on a rescue mission for his former student Lindsay (Russell) who has been taken hostage by International Weapons provider Owen Davian (Hoffman).  This mission itself ends up forcing Hunt to come out of retirement and places not only himself and his team, but also his fianc&eacute; in serious danger.<br /><br />The acting in this bunch is probably the best of the three films...for while every film had adequate acting neither of the predecessors had any villain that could compare to Hoffman's Davian.  Hoffman becomes the perfect villain, unmercifully evil and full of hate and rage and that arrogance that is evident in most of Hoffman's performances.  Ving Rhames is back as Ethan's friend and teammate, and new additions to the team include Maggie Q as Zhen and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (building quite a nice resume for himself) as Declan.<br /><br />`Mission Impossible: 3' delivers all the excitement and intelligence we would expect from a film of its nature and proves to be the most enjoyable and deserving installment in the franchise.  Props to the entire cast, even Cruise, as well as Abrams for creating a worthy addition to our DVD library.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Robin Williams's creppiest hour."></head><body><p>One critic wrote that "One Hour Photo" will "Do for photo developing what 'Psycho' did for showers". It is a creppy and somewhat demented film, with an amazing performance by Robin Williams, but is flawed by a script that falters towards the end of the movie. <p>Williams plays Sy Parrish, a photo developer at a Savmart (a department store similar to ...) who takes special pride in the prints he produces. To him, developing is an underappreciated art form. His life revolves around his job, and for good reason, he has no real life to speak of outside of his work. He was never married, has no real friends or relations, and we learn very little about his past. What we know of his present situation is bleak and depressing. But Sy has taken a special liking to a suburban family, with a successful husband, a pretty wife, and a beautiful son. Domestic bliss personified. He, in his lonely state, becomes obsessed with the family, and longs for something he can never have. This pushes him to the brink of near insanity.<p>I will not give away any more than I already have, but I will say that the ending lets down the whole movie. The movie begins as a fascinating character study, and ends as a hollywood cliche (a diet version, if you will). While the creppiness and the quality of the acting keeps "One Hour Photo" entertaining, you feel unsatasfied in the end. Similar to movies like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", the characters are more interesting before the go over the edge. <p>The movie is the perfect starring vehicle for Williams, who is proving that his move from comedy to drama in his later years is indeed a good idea. The script, while meandering at times, is smartly written and doesn't turn the movie into a Hannibal-type affair. Williams is a lonely man who seeks love and attention, and only finds it out of his reality and in the photos he develops. He nailed the character perfectly.<p>While it's not Oscar material, it is definitely worth checking out. Most people will love Robin Williams's darker side, while others will like the unique story.</p></body></html>

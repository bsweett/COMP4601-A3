<meta name="summary" content="Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale could not be better!!"></head><body><p>Two of my favorite screen talents, Hugh Jackman (The &quot;X-Men&quot; films) and Kate Beckinsale (&quot;Underworld&quot;) team up in the thrilling box-office extravaganza, &quot;Van Helsing&quot;! I saw the movie about a couple of days after it was released, and to me, the film was nothing short of extraordinary! Like portraying Wolverine in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films, Hugh Jackman brings a sheer intensity into the role of Van Helsing. Surely, Jackman's best since &quot;Swordfish&quot; and &quot;X-Men 1 and 2&quot;! Kate Beckinsale's performance, however, was dynamic and brilliant! Basically, her flawless performance in this film, which is her best performance since &quot;Underworld&quot;, shows us once again why she is Kate Beckinsale! The direction of Stephen Sommers (&quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;) was intense and utterly magnificent!<br /><br /> &quot;Van Helsing&quot; takes place in 1887 and focuses on famed monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman). After hunting down Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde in the streets of London, Van Helsing is assigned to travel to Transylvania, a mysterious region that is overrun with dangerous creatures like werewolves and vampires. Joining Van Helsing is his bumbling assistant, Carl (David Wenham, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films). Once there, Van Helsing must fight the tyrannical ruler, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;), his blood-sucking brides (Elena Anaya, Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca), and the Wolf Man (Will Kemp). During the mission, Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (Beckinsale), a woman whose royal family is suffering under an age-old curse that can only be broken when the infamous count is put to death. Van Helsing also forms an alliance with Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to prevent Dracula from hatching his bat-winged progeny, thus wreaking havoc all over the world!<br /><br /> With &quot;Van Helsing&quot; having so much good-humored action, suspense at every twist and turn, a great cast, and mesmerizing special effects, you're guaranteed to be both thrilled and exhausted by the time the 10-minute end credits roll at the film's end! The film is loud, obnoxious, and filled with revisionist horror folklore (especially with the fact that Universal is paying homage to the classic horror monsters, including Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and The Wolf Man). Nevertheless, this colossal monster mash (including Mr. Hyde, just for kicks) will never, ever bore you. All I have to say is bring on &quot;Van Helsing 2&quot;! In conclusion, if you are a avid horror fan, or just a big Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale fan, like I am, then look no further than &quot;Van Helsing&quot;! A DVD must-have when released!</p></body></html>

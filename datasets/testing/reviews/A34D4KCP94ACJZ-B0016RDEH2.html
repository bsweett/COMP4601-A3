It manages to capture the essence of being a child appropriately enough to serve as nostalgia for its adult audience.  In other words, you really don't have to be a fantasy geek to appreciate this.  It is smaller than many of the larger epic fantasies we have grown accustomed to seeing on the big screen over the last few years (i.e. Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter movies) but in many ways it is more lucid, and it is certainly less diluted by oceans of CGI. There are great effects though; puppets, CGI, makeup, set design and costumes.  However, I would say that more effort than money was put into these elements and creating a pure vision was certainly the priority, as opposed to creating a large box-office draw. Del Toro also has the advantage of placing the fantasy into the eyes of a child, while the rest of story is told in the miserable reality of 1944 post civil war Spain.  That dichotomy alone makes the film both remarkably authentic and the fantasy elements that much more rewarding.  What child wouldn't want to escape that existence?<br /><br />As the film opens we are introduced to a fairy tale about Princess Moanna from the underworld.  The Princess decides to see the world above her and when she does she forgets about her royal existence and eventually becomes mortal and dies.  Her father, the king, believes her spirit will return.  After this we go to 1944 Spain after the Francoists have taken power.  We are introduced to Ofelia (Ivan Baquero), a young girl whose pregnant mother has brought Ofelia to meet her new stepfather (Sergi L&oacute;pez), a fascist captain assigned to control and destroy the Spanish Maquis in that region.  He is also the father to Ofelia's unborn brother.  Ofelia meets an insect who she feels represents a fairy.  The insect leads Ofelia to the labyrinth.  This spirals into Ofelia's eventual interaction with a faun who declares that Ofelia is Princess Moanna and in order to ensure that her essence as princess of the underworld is intact, she must accomplish three specific tasks.  The story goes from there with astounding visuals and sequences that range from shocking and suspenseful, to beautiful and beaming with hope.<br /><br />In a year of mediocre cinema, Pan's Labyrinth was one of the few stand-out productions for me.  Obviously it was heavily acclaimed and rewarded for its visuals, but the writing and direction deserve accolades as well.  This is one of best original screenplays to come along in the last few years.<br /><br />The acting was also great. Ivana Baquero is a wonderful new find and Maribel Verd&uacute; (Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n) was also fantastic as one of the captain's maids and a rebel mole.  I also believe that Captain Vidal was probably the best villain of the year.  Part of it was Sergi L&oacute;pez's performance but it was also the way his actions shocked us.  Without his violent outbursts and constant cutthroat disposition I think this would've been a lesser movie, but it also may have received a more profitable PG-13 rating.  In other words, it took some courage and sacrifice in making this villain as brutal as he was and I salute Del Toro for not even giving that perspective consideration.  Again, it's artistic substance as the priority.<br /><br />Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is the kind of effort that reminds me of why I love cinema, and I have no doubt that Del Toro and his crew feel that a story like this is the very reason they make movies in the first place.  Obviously, I highly recommend this.</p></body></html>

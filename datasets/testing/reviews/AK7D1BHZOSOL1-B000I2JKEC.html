Every superhero movie that has come afterward, from Blade to X-men has tried to obtain the absolute perfection achieved in this movie.  Chis Reeve is incredible as superman, paired against the always excellent Gene Hackmen as his enemy Lex Luthor. <p> If you are one of the few who has never seen this movie what are you waiting for?  Go rent it now!!</p></body></html>

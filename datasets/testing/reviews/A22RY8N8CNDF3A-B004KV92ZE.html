Great choice to have a laugh, enjoy the great voice cast and well written story of a sweet panda destined for greatness.<br /><br />Set in old China it has beautiful artwork as part of the appeal.  The story is great, flows well and the characters are exquisitely funny and bright.</p></body></html>

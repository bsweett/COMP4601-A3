<meta name="summary" content="Harrison Ford at His Best"></head><body><p>Harrison Ford is better known for his roles as Han Solo or Indiana Jones, but he does an excellent job as Dr. Richard Kimble in this exciting movie based on the 1960s television series by the same name.  Richard returns home from a fund-raiser to find that his wife has been brutally murdered, and a man is still in his house.  Richard, who soon discovers that the assailant has a mechanical arm, struggle, but the man escapes.  Meanwhile, as she lay dying, Helen Kimble (Sela Ward) makes a 911 phone call that appears to implicate Richard.<br /><br />Richard is tried and convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection.  Richard is to be transferred to a maximum security prison along with three other inmates.  Once on the prison bus, one inmate fakes a seizure and stabs a security guard.  Another guard begins randomly firing a shotgun and hits the bus driver by mistake.  The bus careens off the road, falls down a hill, and comes to rest on a set of railroad tracks.  Battered and shaken, Richard tries to free the wounded guard, but an ominous noise makes him stop; a train is approaching!!<br /><br />The next scenes are some of the best movie footage I've seen as Richard barely escapes before the train slams into the bus.  The engine comes uncoupled from the train and hurtles out of control, while Richard can barely move in his leg shakles.  He manages to get out of the way as the train flys past.<br /><br />U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard, played superbly by Tommy Lee Jones, soon has his men hunting for Richard. aided by his sidekick Cosmo Renfro (Joe Pantoliano), Sam is determined to find Richard and bring him to justice.<br /><br />Richard eludes the Marshalls for the time being, but Sam soon catches up to him on a dam of all places.  Cornered, Richard does the only thing he can think of; he jumps.  Dumbfounded, Sam can only watch as Richard plummets over the side of the dam.  Sam doesn't believe that Richard died during the fall, so he sets out on his chase again.<br /><br />This is one of the best action/thrillers that I've seen.  Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford give Oscar-caliber performances, and the supporting cast of Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano, and Jereen Krabbe turn in fine performances as well.  The special effects, including the eye-popping train scene and Ford's plunge from the dam are excellent as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.  The acting is first rate, and the twists and turns will keep you guessing throughout.  Watch and see Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones at their absolute best.</p></body></html>

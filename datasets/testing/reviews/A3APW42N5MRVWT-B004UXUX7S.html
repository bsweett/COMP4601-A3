<meta name="summary" content="Finding your way back to life"></head><body><p>A story about being set adrift and trying to find your way back to life. Fine performances across the board with some characters developing unanticipated connections and unexpected depth. Not tremendous depth, but more than is apparent at first meeting. Still, the movie treads a lot of familiar territory with only slight diversions that don't go too far astray from the expected and with a few slightly exotic problems - just right for making a holiday movie-going crowd feel like they were challenged but safe while still delivering an above average film and a great cast for those who want more than safe holiday fare.</p></body></html>

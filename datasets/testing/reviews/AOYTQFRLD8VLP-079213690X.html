These include, the beautiful mountain scenery of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, the struggle for independance from England and/or the violent death of the title character featured in &quot;Gandhi&quot; and &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, the rivalry between an older member of the Establishment and a younger rougue in his thirties, as well as the eventual undoing of the work of the elder character featured in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, and there is even a poignant look about the character at the moment of death in which his blue-eyed gaze falls upon the face of his wife that was also featured in &quot;Amadeus&quot;, where a cute, lop-sided grin from a beautiful mouth leaves an audience with reassurance that the character is not defeated. Gibson unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of Mozart in the latter film a decade earlier, but that he has come full circle since then, winning two Oscars with &quot;Braveheart&quot;, speaks volumes about the possibility that he just might be over that rejection. Gibson is at his energetic and vengeful best as Scottish warrior William Wallace, who has seen the English destroy everything and everyone he's held dear since childhood. In a fine, charismatic performance, he woos, wins, and loses his childhood sweetheart, played by Catherine McCormack who gives the character a sweet Scottish soul, rouses an army against the English, defeats them at Sterling, is defeated by them at Falkirk, and along the way recives a knighthood, and support from an unexpected source, Longshank's daughter-in-law, played by tall and willowy Sophie Marceau, who looks like she stepped out of a Rossetti painting. In reality, Isabella of France never met Wallace, much less had a child with him, and has nothing more in common with Wallace besides the date of her death--August 23,1358--exactly 53 years to the day of Wallace's execution. But in the film, she does a great job comforting a grieving widower, whose lonliness and lack of love in his life can, like hers, be attributed to Longshanks. Patrick MacGoohan's Longshanks is sinister to the core as he uses every evil device to bring Scotland to its knees. The film strikes a chord with me for the same reason &quot;Gandhi&quot; did. My parents, who are from Barbados, grew up under British rule, and have some familiarity with English injustices. Robert the Bruce, as played by Angus McFadyen, is a troubled nobleman with a lot of unfulfilled potential,forced to make compromises to keep order in the country he would one day rule. The late Ian Bannen as his leperous father is the mastermind behind Bruce's every decision. I could feel the cold damp climate of the British Isles from just watching this movie. But the ashen bluish light veiling Gibson's face and complimenting his trademark eyes at certain points was a masterstroke of cinematography. Mel proves he is still in fine form and as ready for action as ever, and he is aided by a childhood friend with brawn to match his brains, and a psychotic but effective fellow from Ireland. I could never say enough about the intensity of his performance or of the film in general. It's a typical Gibson film in terms of venegefulness, sensuality, and the justfication for killing his adversaries. It's a bit too graphic for young children, but could be recommended to anyone who was at least 15 or older.In the end, there are feelings of such reverance as well as elation from watching this film, for which James Horner wrote a score that fills one with a sense of both triumph and solemnity....And the tapering sound of a lone bagpipe in the distance, faintly reminiscent of those that might have been played by any of Scotland's warrior poets of that distant era.</p></body></html>

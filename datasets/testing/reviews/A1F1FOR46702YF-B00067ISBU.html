Since World War II, the secretive Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense exists to protect the world from the forces of darkness. When the mad wizard Rasputin (Karl Roden) plots to bring about the end of the world, the Bureau's most powerful agent, Hellboy (Ron Perlman), leads the fight to save humanity. "Hellboy" is an exciting action-packed adaptation of the popular Dark Horse Comics that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date. Its fast-paced story is quite engaging and its "colorful" characters are certainly interesting. This stylized comic book adventure features some witty humor, thrilling action sequences and cool eye-popping special effects. Ron Perlman's energetic performance of the title character is quite marvelous. The cast also includes Selma Blair, John Hurt, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor and Emmy Award winner David Hyde Pierce as the voice of aquatic Abe Sapien.<br /><br />"Hellboy" 2-Disc Special Edition is positively one of this year's best DVDs. The comic book adventure is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its picture quality is simply outstanding with excellent sharpness. Its dynamic Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is fantastic. The DVD also features a short introduction by director Guillermo del Toro, two separate audio commentaries by filmmakers and cast members, eight DVD comics by creator Mike Mignola, the informative "Hellboy: The Seeds of Creation" behind-the-scenes documentary, three deleted scenes with optional audio commentary track, in-depth animated storyboards, TV spots and theatrical trailers. The DVD menus look great. Overall, "Hellboy" contains a top-notch DVD presentation and scores a surprising "A-".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Overall good, but mundane as opposed to divine"></head><body><p>Angels and Demons is the second of Dan Brown's books to hit the big screen. This time Professor Langdon is called to the Vatican to investigate the resurgence of the mysterious Illuminati; a Catholic faction that opposed the Church's persecution of scientists during the Scientific Revolution, and was crushed as a result.<br />Tom Hanks does a great job in his respective role (as he always does), however, the rest of the cast's performance (including Ewan McGregor's) is nothing to write home about, especially Ayelet Zurer who seemed very much out of place (and was rather annoying too). Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, the action, and the music are quite decent.<br />In short, though not a masterpiece, the film will provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></body></html>

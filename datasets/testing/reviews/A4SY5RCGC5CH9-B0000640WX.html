<meta name="summary" content="A great movie, although quite violent and very sad"></head><body><p>All Stallone haters should see the first Rocky and the first Rambo. Both movies are great and although Rocky is better, Rambo is almost as good. Stallone is of course not a Shakespearian actor, but here he is really in his element - John Rambo is after all a devastated, battlescarred veteran, who clearly was not great in social contacts (or great verbal communication) even before the Vietnam War, but who now is really close to a human wreck, with autistic tendancies.<br /><br />In fact, this movie is about a lonely, impoverished, homeless and deeply depressed man who at one moment turns back and bites the bullies in police uniforms who (really sadistically) abuse him, just because he wanted to buy something to eat in the wrong little town. When it finally appears how dangerous he is, he becomes the target of a manhunt, which ultimately gets totally out of proportion.<br /><br />There will be no more details - if you didn't see it yet, you desserve to be surprised. The only thing I am ready to reveal is that the National Guard is providing one of the (few) humorous moments in the movie... Stallone gives a very good performance, and Brian Dennehy (the "redneck" sheriff) and Richard Crenna (colonel of Green Berets) are even better. I always liked this movie and always felt a great pity for the main character.<br /><br />Oh, and also you will be surprised by the bodycount - although maybe not in the way you would expect...</p></body></html>

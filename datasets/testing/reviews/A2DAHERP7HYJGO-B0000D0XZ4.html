<meta name="summary" content="PURPLE PANTS STILL REFUSE TO SPLIT"></head><body><p>Yes, the Incredible Hulk, that monstrous, green apparition that became the rage in comics in the early sixties and television icon in the seventies is back on screen. And although a normal man still grows in size enough to split his shoes and shirt, his pants remain made of some elasticized material that never breaks. Those of us on the heavier side are still seeking out this material as I write.<br /><br />HULK made its way to the big screen in the biggest way possible. It was being touted as the next best thing since sliced bread before it even arrived. Directed by Ang Lee who was coming off of his art house AND theatrical hit CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, many were making predictions that this film would combine the pop culture found in comics with the artistic integrity found in this director. Face it, it was a no win situation for critics everywhere.<br /><br />But for audiences it was different. The hype surrounding the movie was as enormous as the Hulk himself. Anyone who blindly accepted that this movie would be the best movie ever made had no choice but to walk away disappointed. But those who went in looking for nothing more than a good movie, a movie that would capture the essence and imagination found in the pages of those brightly inked comics of the past were delighted.<br /><br />Story time. The story begins in the past when David Banner is researching DNA and trying his best to make a human that will renew its own body cells when harmed or injured. When the military doesn't allow him to try this on humans instead of animals, he infects himself. Not long after, he and his wife have a child. Recognizing that his son's DNA contains cells that were affected, he begins to search for a solution to change him back. Stopped by the military when they discover what he has been up to, he blows up the base and heads home. This portion of the film takes up the first minutes and is told in quick fashion, ending with David's son Bruce not recalling all that happened and waking from this nightmare.<br /><br />Moving forward, Bruce (Eric Bana) has grown into a young scientist himself, researching much of the same ideas his birth father had. At his side in this research is Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly), his now ex-girlfriend. All of their attempts to replicate the adaptive powers of amphibians, their ability to renew cells when damaged, have ended in short term success and long term failure. The frogs blow up. An accident in the lab exposes Bruce to the same nanomites and gamma radiation the frogs were hit with. But instead of blowing up, he changes. The experiment works on him, recharging his body.<br /><br />The down side is revealed that night when Bruce's nightmares awake an anger, a rage, within. That rage changes him as well. The passive Bruce Banner finds his body physically altering until he becomes the primal essence of man, of himself. He turns into the overpowering Hulk.<br /><br />Green skinned, standing well over 9 feet tall, body formed of hyper increased muscles, Hulk leaves the hospital bed Banner was sleeping in. And as he makes his way into the world, everyone is well aware that the military will take notice and track him down.<br /><br />Part of what change Bruce while in that bed was a visit by the night janitor. It turns out that he is very familiar with Bruce since he is in fact his father David (Nick Nolte). Revealing himself and portions of what happened in Bruce's past (since Bruce was raised by adoptive parents and never told the truth), he is the catalyst that invokes the rage inside if Bruce.<br /><br />A multiple cat and mouse game follows with Betty trying to help Bruce, her ex-beau Talbot (Josh Lucas) trying to steal the program they were working on and eliminate Bruce as a competitor for Betty's affections. Betty's father, General Ross (Sam Elliott) tries to save his daughter from a man he fears (knowing all about Bruce's past) and sets out to gather the results of this experiment for military purposes at the same time. Bruce's father David attempts to harness the power and change from Bruce by using DNA samples found in hair left behind and applying them to his dogs and later on to himself. And through it all, Bruce is left to sort out each event on his own, with no help from anyone save Betty who realizes just how much he truly means to her.<br /><br />This story could be called a simple retelling of Beauty and the Beast. But it goes beyond that. It talks about the rage that we all keep in check, never saying the things that we would love to say from complaining about low wages to flipping off the bad driver on the highway. It talks about the inner beauty of a person overcoming the surface that is visible. And it talks about the abuse of power, of scientist willing to risk their souls because perhaps they don't believe in them anymore. But most of all, this movie brings alive the pages that we once read so long ago and makes them real.<br /><br />The standout in this movie, the make or break necessary to pull it off, is of course the visualization of the Hulk himself. Lee decided not to follow in the footsteps of the television series and instead opt for complete CGI (computer generated image). And the folks behind the special effects here have made the Hulk seem more real than any CGI images we have seen before. The rampaging Hulk would have been the easiest thing to do, with quick cuts and motion galore. But the passive Hulk, the one with facial expressions and emotion, that is where they truly shine. And the fact that he actually DOES resemble Bana is remarkable.<br /><br />No easy sell as was SPIDER-MAN, this movie is entertaining throughout. Don't go in looking for the television series. You won't find it. Instead, go in looking for a return to the original story. Go in looking for a visual feast in special effects. Go in without unreasonable expectations. If you do so, you will find that this movie delivers on all counts.<br /><br />For die hard fans, the DVD comes with a glut of extras, everything from a look at how the Hulk was made on film to interpretations of various scenes if they were drawn by some of the top artists working in comics today. All of the extras make this DVD one worth owning.</p></body></html>

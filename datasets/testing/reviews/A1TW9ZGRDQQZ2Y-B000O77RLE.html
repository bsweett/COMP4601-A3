<meta name="summary" content="Way Better Than Flags of Our Fathers"></head><body><p>This is the only war film Clint Eastwood should have released, though I think this film helps make the lackluster Flags of Our Fathers a little better. The acting is very good, especially the great Ken Wantanabe as the general in charge of defending this doomed island. I wouldn't go as far to say that it is a great film, but it deserves a spot on my top ten war films ever made list.</p></body></html>

Maybe it was the fact that I really didn't know the story behind each character; that was certainly one of the issues I had with this film.  Granted, my encounters with the X-Men have been few and far between, but I've just never seen much of anything behind any of the characters other than Dr. Charles Xavier and Wolverine.  I followed Wolverine during the first couple of years of his first solo comic, largely because he was a complicated, mysterious, deadly character with great depth and passion, a man still trying to discover what he truly was.  Despite his mutant powers, Wolverine always comes across as a human being, with all the positives and negatives that implies.  Without him, I can't connect with any of the other mutants, so I think the filmmakers definitely had the right idea when they used Wolverine as their cinematic conduit to the viewing public.<br /><br />This is a rather unusual film, in that it was obviously written with sequels in mind - there's not a very big sense of completion to this film at all.  Not only does it refrain from supplying some important answers, it doesn't even get around to asking all of the questions yet.  The first half of the movie basically serves to introduce us to all the major players.  Even still, I feel like I know next to nothing about Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden); in actuality, I can't work up much of a reason to even care about those two very much.  I have to wonder, though, if Cyclops is supposed to be so annoyingly prissy; Marsden seems to be channeling a Footloose-era Tom Cruise, which made it impossible for me to like his character.  I can't complain about the two heavyweights in this particular arena, though.  Patrick Stewart adds an important air of believability to a story that could have easily stumbled down the road toward campiness, while Ian McKellan - a rather surprising choice to play Magneto, I feel - actually brings gravitas to a role that seems quite beneath him.  The special effects are quite impressive, and the story is interesting enough, but I'm not sure this film would have worked without Stewart and McKellan.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I tend to look upon this (for the most part) as Wolverine's movie.  Hugh Jackman pretty much nails his character, in terms of both the look and the attitude.  Despite his personal preference for solitude, Wolverine's the one who helps Rogue out when she's trying to find her bearings; most of what we learn about Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) and Cyclops are a direct result of the connection he makes with Grey; he is the one who draws the most important information out of Dr. Xavier, etc.  The movie doesn't really bring this out, but Wolverine also has a special rivalry with Sabretooth (Tyler Mane, who doesn't do the character a whole lot of justice to my eyes).<br /><br />In terms of the plot, you basically watch Logan and Rogue slowly make a place for themselves among the X-Men, eventually coming together with Grey, Cyclops, and Storm to prevent Xavier's old, wayward buddy Magneto from succeeding in his dastardly plan to establish the dominance of mutants over human society - even if it means inciting a war between humans and mutants.  Honestly, it isn't the most impressive script I've ever seen, basically putting the ultimate fate of the film in the hands of the actors and actresses bringing the story to life.  Some darn good casting really saved the day here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Billed as thriller, but really wasn't"></head><body><p>The story occurs in a series of flash-forwards and flash-backs moving play by play like a chess game over many years.  If you miss a caption, you're struggling to figure out just where and when you are.  The film's an interesting bit of history, but hardly worth the thriller designation.  For the most part, it just ground on.</p></body></html>

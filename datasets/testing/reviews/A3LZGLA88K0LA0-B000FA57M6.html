<meta name="summary" content="ROCK CANDY"></head><body><p>No, the Rock can't act...it doesn't take a Razzie nomination to understand that.  But The Rock IS a commanding physical presence and at least he doesn't have an Austrian accent.  And DOOM is one of the best movies made from a video game.  While certainly not the classic that ALIENS is, the movie borrows a lot of that movie's dark atmosphere and it has a great sequence in which you become the shooter; it's just like a video game.<br /><br />DOOM's standard plot focuses on the planet Mars, where a genetic experiment gone wrong (do they ever go right?) unleashes some frightening monsters.  The action is fast and furious; the special effects are great; and there's lots of gore and violence as one would expect from this kind of film.  Karl Urban (LORD OF THE RINGS) gets to be the hero in this one and he's sufficiently macho and controlled; Rosamund Pike is effective as his sister; and Richard Brake is a nasty sex-craved soldier.  If you like your movies adrenaline-charged and fast paced, DOOM delivers--in spite of the Rock!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Phoenix Rises"></head><body><p>Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon channels the spirits of Johnny and June Cash. If you don't believe me, watch this film and see<br /><br />This story is about a  young punkish Cash...the one with a drug problem, emotion problems and groweing up problem. He is the  rebel with a  musdical cause. Phoenix does not just play the younger Cash, he dominates the vocals as  well. You can debate if he should have won the Oscar.  I am sorry he didn't but it still is an amazing performance. If you like this, catch him in the  movie Buffallo Soldiers or Ladder 49.<br /><br />And now to the Lady Reese, she is June Carter Cash.  Like Sissy Specek, Ms Witherspoon transformed into June. Her Oscar winning performance was earned and not handed out lightly. Now she can do Legally Blonde three without worrying!<br /><br />X-Files's Robert Patrick is great as Cash's Father ray. He is a stand out in this emsemble cast<br /><br />Do I think this film is a classic? NO, far from it.<br /><br /> However this film is a great piece of  bio filmmaking in the cinema of reality with such films like Ray, Capote, Miracles, and the Great Escape<br /><br />Well worth getting, all the performances are so well done<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

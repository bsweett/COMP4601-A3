<meta name="summary" content="awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>ok 1st let me thank the makers of this flick for adding in some of the unused mutants i mentioned  in my earlier reviews on x-men 1 and 2.there are still a  number of them left out but they did use some cool ones like the sentinal,dark phoenix,juggernaut and angel,the beast and collossus.there are still a long list of unused mutants however.mostly from the future or simply overlooked.they dont have to stop just because there are 3 parts.theres the whole story about which x-man would betray them in the furure.id also like to mention killspree and halloween jack.both awesome characters.this movie is what the  1st 2 have been leading up to.a breakdown in the system and an all out war between mutants and bad mutants and the humans.like a 3 way dance.the visual effects are awesome!its my favorite of the 3.any true x-men fan knows the story is way longer.i could see at least 2 more great movies in the set.the one i mentioned above and the one where magneto rips out wolverines admantium skeleton.there are a lot of old faces too like pyro,ice man,wolverine,rogue,jean grey and magneto .its a great movie and you should own it.</p></body></html>

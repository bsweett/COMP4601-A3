No, thankfully...Entertaining? It is, I enjoyed it. Nice work Mr. Tarantino, I got it. I think if you are a fan of his other movies and understand he beats to a different drum you'll also like this movie. A blend of comedy, drama, & action set in the early 40's w/ some cool camera angles. Only thing I didn't like was the subtitles b/c I found myself pausing the movie a lot to read them, however the german & french dialog does add to the authentic setting of the movie. A to the point ending, excellent acting from the German SS Col. played by Christoph Waltz. "Soouund Goood!?"</p></body></html>

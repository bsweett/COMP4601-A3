<meta name="summary" content="A depressing feel good story"></head><body><p>Will Smith stars as struggling salesman Chris Gardner in an overwrought rags to riches inspirational story that highlights the strong bond existent between Gardner and his young son Chris played by star of the show and Smith's real life son Jaden.<br /><br />Times are tough for Smith in 1981 San Francisco where he's barely scratching out a meager existence as a salesman of bone density scanners.  His wife Linda played by Thandie Newton is becoming disillusioned working a double shift and still fighting to keep the wolf away from the door.  Frustrated she checks out of the marriage in little more than a cameo role and without much protest leaves Smith to care for their son.<br /><br />Smith, a naturally bright guy without the benefit of a college education gets an opportunity to vie for an internship as a stock broker for Dean Witter Reynolds.  As the competitive internship is unsalaried, Smith literally kills himself trying to make ends meet, winding up in a homeless shelter.<br /><br />His perseverance fueled by his deeply emotional relationship with his son, ultimately and thankfully pays off as he attains his goal.<br /><br />For an uplifting story I found that the plot was far too heavy in the depressing details of Smith's striving to succeed which made the film seem needlessly long.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="not as good as Volume 1"></head><body><p>There is less action in this volume than in the first, which makes it more tedious.  To be fair this is just the wrap up of Volume 1, but I found the second installment to be quite boring at times.  There are several scenes that could have been cut from both volumes and they should have been combined into a single movie.  Splitting the movie was a cheap grab for more money and this ploy should not be tolerated in the future.  Worth a rent if you've already seen Volume 1 and need closure. Otherwise skip it.</p></body></html>

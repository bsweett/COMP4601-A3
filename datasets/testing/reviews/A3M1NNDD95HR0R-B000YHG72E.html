<meta name="summary" content="A Well Done Will Ferrell Holiday Comedy"></head><body><p>In this movie Will Ferrell plays Buddy, a man raised by elves.  He eventually goes on to seek and find his birth father in New York City.  He finds him, but at first his birth father (the gruff Walter Hobbs played by James Caan) thinks he is looney and it's some kind of joke.  It is somewhat understandable when you take into account the clothes Buddy is wearing (his elf outfit).  Very cute, but a bit out of place.<br /><br />The real charm of the movie lies in Buddy's child-like innocence.  It is hilarious to see him get into situations that probably would not be exceptional if someone more "normal" was involved.  He is truly one of a kind and his personality shines throughout the entire movie.  Additionally, he is something of a master decorator and snowball thrower, after getting lots of practice at the North Pole no doubt.  This movie is really fun and funny and suitable for children as well.  A perfect holiday movie if you want to laugh out loud.  This may be Will Ferrell's best movie.</p></body></html>

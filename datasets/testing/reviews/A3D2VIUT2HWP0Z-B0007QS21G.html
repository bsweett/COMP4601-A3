<meta name="summary" content="Immense  Fun"></head><body><p>It's a Popcorn film. It's big, it's blustery, and it's a way to while away some time with some great "gosh-golly-gee-whiz" views and FX.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed Ian Holm, his performance, as well as various others were typically excellent.<br />I absolutely love the Cheney clone, and the dig at the view about the "Kyoto" accord. But if the best that people who claim to be conservatives can say is that it is "liberal rubbish" ... what I want to know is ... Why do you watch this material ??<br />If you have a surround sound system, crank up the levels, and this DVD is absolutely great. An absolutely superb ride.<br /><br />Worth every penny ( Especially at Wally Worlds Prices :-)<br /><br />AFTER SEEING ALL THE MATERIAL  AGAIN:<br /><br />How anyone could approach this film as a "message"  film is beyond me.<br />The Special  effects are brilliant, and work superbly. And eveything works around the FX. The commentarys do a brilliant job of illuminating how this work came together, and whilst there are elements of a "message", it is so hidden, as to be irrelevant. There are even notional political elements, but once again, if you watch this movie for some sort of political pot shots, you should really go in for analysis. Its pure ( or, "impure") entertainment, and thats where it excels  better than most disaster type films that Roland  Emmerich  does. Its not that the Emmerich family can't do decent pieces which have some depth ( FREQUENCY for example), it's just that when a film is done on this scale, they obviously want to make a BIG lot of dollars, so its lowest common denominator time, and its a  rare  film that can do both message, and mega-dollar  deals. This is another of the grand popcorn films. There are sequences in this film that are just eye popping in visual stuns, but if you want illumination about what the world of humans is doing to the planet, search elsewhere... this is a vacation from reality, not a reality tour-de-force.<br />Anyway, its Damn fine fun, and brilliant at that.</p></body></html>

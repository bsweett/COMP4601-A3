<meta name="summary" content="Mysterious Psychological Thriller turns down Sci Fi Avenue"></head><body><p>In The Forgotten, Julian Moore plays a woman with desperate issues.  She has lost her son in a plane crash with several other children.  We come in on the movie some time later as she is seeing a therapist and still dealing with the loss.  She constantly revisits photos, toys, baseball paraphernalia and books that her son had in order to keep remembering him.  His room is still just as it was and she can't seem to let go of his memory long enough to get back to her real life.<br /><br />When she suddenly starts to see evidence of her son missing, thinking it's her husbands doing in order to help her let go, she gets angry and is told by her therapist (Gary Sinese) that she never had a son, that she had made it up in her head.  She finds a fellow parent (Dominic West) who also lost his daughter in the crash but doesn't believe she ever existed.  Together they begin putting together pieces of the puzzle that lead to a striking revelation.<br /><br />Many people may think the shift to Science Fiction in the middle may be a cop out, but to try explaining it any other way would be ludicrous.  Juliana Moore gives a strong performance as always in another one of her mediocre choices of movies.  The movie is dark and creepy with washed out color and overcast outdoor shots, making the film look bleak.  The mystery of the disappearance is pushing for this Hitchcock feel but it never quite reaches that point.  Overall, it is still an entertaining movie if you like Sci-Fi/Thriller films in the X-Files genre.</p></body></html>

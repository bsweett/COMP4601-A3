Jerry Goldsmith is the first. Never let it be said &quot;sound doesn't matter much&quot;. Because it does. In fact this may be the best enhancement yet a movie has received from a quality sound track, this side of Halloween. The second reason this movie hits on all cylinders is Maurice Evans. His work as Dr. Zaius lends such an antagonistic credibility as to be UNFORGETTABLE, one for the ages. You can never have dramatic moments unless you have believable characters and though the entire cast IS stellar, it is Evans who I believe is the most noteworthy here. <p>In conclusion, I would like to thank FOX for including the trailers for the other Ape movies. If ever there was doubt that I should have purchased the whole box set, I can watch the trailers and know the balance of the Ape movies are rubbish. Sure, I would have liked to have the bonue disc, but I wouldn't want it at the expense of sacrificing this movies intengrity by purchasing the whole set. I feel I would be supporting ridiculous sequels, and I would rather have my self respect than a 2 hour documentry. The Lost World? UGH! Episode 1: The Phantom Menace? BAH! Few series get better as the series progresses and the Apes saga is but one of many casualties on a road to greatness. If you don't have The Planet Of Apes and you love sci-fi, you will appreciate the loving hand of the first movie, but the rest are like a menacing backhand.</p></body></html>

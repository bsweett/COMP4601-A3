<meta name="summary" content="Excellent use of foreshadowing - Reeves & Bullock ought to make a film together more often."></head><body><p>It's been a rough summer for movie going.  Normally I attend one or two films a week, but nothing in this summer's fare has really held my interest.  The exception is this film, "The Lake House".  Having seen trailers, I was puzzled by the plot, which needs to evolve over time.  It's complex to describe.  And when you are playing with "the past is the past, and the future is now...."  Well, you have to see the film.  Possibly, a mailbox plays a more central role in this film than it ever will in any other.<br /><br />The art direction, the low key acting, the total romance of "The Lake House" have made the film memorable to me, always in instant recall, just like "The Notebook".  Notwithstanding that I am not a Keanu Reeves fan, I believe that the coupling of Reeves with Bullock in this film was more than just a casting stunt.  I believe they have an immediate chemistry on film together that Reeves doesn't get with anyone else, and Sandra doesn't quite achieve with other partners.  With other leading men, notably Hugh Grant and Bill Pullman (her partner in one of the all time great romances, "While You Were Sleeping"), Bullock reverts to romantic comedy.  Here, the romance is in earnest, her feelings more real than sparkly;  the message is about relationships, and the humanity involved in maintaining them.<br /><br />An excellent, quiet film...not to be missed!</p></body></html>

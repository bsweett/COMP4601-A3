<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining and larger than life"></head><body><p>Featuring professional wrestler `The Rock' in the lead role of Beck, a professional bounty hunter, this is an action comedy film that's not about intellectual stimulation, but sure is ideal for pure entertainment and eye candy.  Beck heads to Brazil in order to retrieve his boss's son, Travis Walker, from a small town and mine run by the bad guy Hatcher.  But Travis isn't too cooperative because he first wants to find an ancient golden artifact, and Hatcher isn't keen to let him go, not least because he wouldn't mind the artifact for himself.  Add Travis' barmaid friend Mariana to the mix, some rebel forces, and you're all set for some action packed drama.  Beck stars in his role, and as a hero figure who doesn't like guns, he comes across almost as respectable rather than vindictive, and its evident that when he needs to resort to violence it's only because he has to rather than that he wants to.<br /><br />While the plot isn't always plausible, and the characters don't have any real depth, the film never has any illusions about being serious - it's deliberately larger than life, and all about fun entertainment. The stunts and fights may seem silly and far-fetched at times, but that's partly the point.  The violence isn't gratuitous or gory, and while there's enough of it to make it unsuitable for younger kids, for the most part it's an innocuous and fun ride, with some good cinematography and extended fight scenes with special effects.  Aside from a couple of incidences of blasphemy, the film is also relatively free of the foul language, sexual content or other objectionable material that can sometimes plague films of this sort (although there is one `bathroom humor' scene involving urination and another making crude reference to it, and some minor profanities on occasion).  In the final analysis, The Rundown is a solid success for The Rock, and can be appreciated as half-decent escapist entertainment for mature viewers. - GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

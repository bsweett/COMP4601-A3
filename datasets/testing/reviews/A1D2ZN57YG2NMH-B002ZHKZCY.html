It begins with an assassination attempt on Bourne's life, the death of Marie, and the framing of Bourne for the murder of two agents.<br /><br />This movie makes you see Jason in a new light. He is now a little more angry, and a little more guilty. This film unfolds yet another chapter in the journey of Jason Bourne.</p></body></html>

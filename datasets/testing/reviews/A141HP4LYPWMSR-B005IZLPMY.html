<meta name="summary" content=""Geez, Somebody Get That Kid A Sandwich" ~ American Tenacity Vs. Nazi Extremism"></head><body><p>For me the long awaited film `Captain America: The First Avenger' about one of my favorite childhood comic book superheroes turned out to be a somewhat bittersweet experience. I probably shouldn't have expected anything less since ones expectations always surpass what one ultimately receives. You see I wanted nothing less than total immersion into an imaginary world where good and evil are plainly marked, heroes and villains wear memorable garb and the action and adventure comes at you non-stop.  Now that I think of it, a little bit of na?ve idealism, justified revenge and romance should be thrown in just to spice things up even more.<br /><br />From a technical point of view the film meets or excels all my expectations, I honestly can't find any fault with the final on-screen product. The visuals are superior, storyline solid, soundtrack memorable and the overall aura of a WWII America comingling with a surreal occult, Nazi universe is just short of miraculous. Yea, I guess I liked it. And what about the cast you ask? No problems here either. Who wouldn't love Chris Evans in the role of Captain America and immediately fall in love with Hayley Atwell in the role of the Captain's love interest Peggy Carter. Then of course there's the incredible Hugo Weaving in the role of Johann Schmidt (aka: Red Skull), Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (Iron Man's father). There's definitely loads of quality talent throughout.<br /><br />At this point you might be wondering why I described my initial viewing experience as "somewhat bittersweet" since I've had only positive things to say about the movie. The reason is that the film disappoints on one level which for me is the most important of all. I like to call it the repeatability factor. For me the most important quality in a film is its ability to instill within the viewer the unquenchable desire to watch it over and over again. It has to be able to `click' with the audience in such a way that always leaves one panting for yet another viewing. For me `Captain America: The First Avenger' just doesn't connect with me on that level. It does however cause me to look forward to the next screen appearance of the good Captain, maybe that was the filmmaker's prime intention all along.</p></body></html>

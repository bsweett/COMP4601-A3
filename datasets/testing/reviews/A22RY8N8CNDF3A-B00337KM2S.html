It also wasn't funny watching a sophomoric approach to firing people - especially by gutless managers that couldn't do it themselves. (I've never heard of that in reality.) Finally, the movie would have been more credible if George Clooney had been fired in the end, after his associates' "Go To Meeting" Internet no-travel approach had been institutionalized. At least she had the sense to move on with her life, leaving Clooney to return to being a lonely drag on society. I can't believe this movie is being considered for an award!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Trek flick..."></head><body><p>Hey, I proudly call myself a Trekkie, but some of the reviewers here take this stuff WAY too seriously. It's only a movie, folks, and I suggest if you are so upset that Zefrem Cochrane is a drunken lout, that you should really find something better to do with your time. <p>This is a fun Trek back in time to, oh, about 50 years from now, after World War III but before Warp Drive. The Borg are trying to wipe out The Federation before they even exist (like most Trek time-travel shows, it's best to not think too hard about the science or even the plausibility of the plot, just accept it and you'll enjoy it far more).<p>The key interactions here are between Picard, who is bent on revenge and redemption owing from the time of his captivity with the Borg, and the Borg Queen. Data also features prominently, and well. There is plenty of Trek humor too.<p>Add in a decent ending and you've got a great Trek flick. Still only 4 stars because no Trek flick is worth 5 stars. (Although I did give 5 stars to &quot;All Good Things...&quot; TNG's 2-episode finale.)<p>Enjoy!</p></body></html>

Jennifer Garner plays Elektra and she is awesome and georgeous in her outfit. Collin Ferlle Plays Draedevils Main Nemisesse Bullseye and he rocks and Michael Clark Duncan Plays the Most Dangerous and powerful Villian in the marvel universe The Kingpin. Though the Kingpins is White i still don't think you could of picked a better actor to play The Kingpin but Michael Clark Duncan. and when are they going to Make Dredevil 2. I hope they keep all of the original actors if they do make a sequel. This movie is awesome. The action is awesome the costumes are awesome and so is the story and actors.  If you have not seen this movie then you should</p></body></html>

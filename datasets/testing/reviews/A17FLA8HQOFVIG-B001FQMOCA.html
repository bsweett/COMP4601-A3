<meta name="summary" content="Slow and predictable. Stories like this have been done before"></head><body><p>This is another one of those big films that I was supposed to love.  After all, I really do love country music.  And Johnny Cash is one of my favorites.  But Joaquin Phoenix doesn't look like him and that bothered me during the whole film.  And Reese Witherspoon, cast has his lady-love June Carter did a good acting job, but I never really could relate to her.  Yes, there is chemistry between these two actors.  But this film needed more than that to really hold my interest.<br /><br />One of the problems with the story is that its all been done before.  A musician with a humble background who made good in the music industry, has a deep relationship with someone other than his wife, and who turns to alcohol or drugs because he can't escape blaming himself because of the death of a sibling.  The film "Ray" was all about that and was a better film.  "Walk the Line" seemed like a weak remake.<br /><br />I liked the music of course.  That was good.  But the story was slow and predictable.  The film did have its good parts but I just couldn't get into it and can therefore only give it a lukewarm recommendation.</p></body></html>

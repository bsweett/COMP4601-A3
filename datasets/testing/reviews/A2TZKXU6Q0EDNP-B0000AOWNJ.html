<meta name="summary" content="Instant classic: a story from the other side"></head><body><p>A couple of notes before my thoughts about the film:<p>1. There's an ongoing barrage of comments in the reviews here in Amazon with people saying that the original Japanese version (Ringu) is better or more subtle and that you &quot;should see that one first&quot; or that the American version is inferior etc. etc. etc. Sorry people, but this is totally besides the point. What matters is whether this version works or not(in my opinion it totally does) and not whow it fares in comparison. <p>2. Lots of reviewers talk about plotholes and unanswered questions (most of them without mentioning even where these plotholes are and why they consider them &quot;holes&quot; to begin with)...Uhm, sorry again, but maybe you didn't notice that this is a film about the paranormal???? And, as such, it is by definition &quot;allowed&quot; NOT to follow your understanding of reality??? If it did, it would then have to do with something other than the peranormal! Comprende?<p>Ok, onto the film then. Needless to tell more about the story, it's been written in full detail by many others.<br />The Ring is the first thriller-horror film in a long while that has a superb storyline, a brilliant script, and very good to stunning acting performances as well as a great directorial effort.<br />Even though there have been recent great films in the genre (notably The Sixth Sense and The Others) the Ring goes one step further because of its frantic pace that doesnt let up for a single minute. That's a paradox really, and simoultaneously the Ring's claim to greatness because as you see it creates the impression that it's rather slow, but, there's constantly clues added as you watch, constantly the story evolves and the film doesnt sag at all at any given point.<br />On top of that, there are so many ingenius ideas that work to the benefit of the whole plot (the fly that comes alive through the screen, the tape lacking a number print, and of course the fact that it's a paranormal story which finds its outlet through modern technology).<p>The doom-ladden atmosphere is devoid of banality, particualarly the island setting in the film and the brilliant use of the murky weather backround, but overall the director has seriously worked on intimidating the viewers without resorting to cheap &quot;boo!&quot; tactics.<br />Sequences like the one on the ferry with the horse that goes wild will stay on peoples' minds for a long time but the Ring is actually full of disturbing optics that you keep with you long after you've exited the movie theater. The curse-carrying tape on its own is nothing short of an art-piece, surely one that will (hopefully) inspire more films in that direction.<p>Extra kudos for the casting of the film: the kid is a return to the 60s faces in the genre with its almost possesed look in his eyes, as is the girl herself with her tragic grimace, but where the film could have blown it and -thankfully- didn't is with the use of the &quot;beautiful blonde&quot; but she does an admittedly very good job in her part and contribution as does everybody in the Ring in general.<p>Not since the Shining (and that over 2 decades ago) have i come across a thriller that kept me edged throughout as this one did. That, i think, is a heavy compliment to this flick. The Ring is not to be missed by fans of the horror-thriller scene or by viewers who like intelligent well made films no matter what the genre.<br />Another thing that should be pointed out, is that Ring is also an allegory on television, or rather, becomes one whether it's intended to or not. At one point the reporter is standing on her balcony having a panoramic view in other apartment buldings and what their inhabitants are doing inside and sees everywhere a switched on television set. That, along with the fact that evil chooses to use the TV set as its entrance to our world is indicative of what i mean. But, it's not merely indicative, unless you -somehow- think that TV is NOT evil.....<br />Instant classic.</p></body></html>

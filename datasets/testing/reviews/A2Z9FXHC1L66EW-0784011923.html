It's not enough that Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly cast in the title role, but his unrelenting coldness is even more explained to us through the stories and flashbacks of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese (&quot;You still don't get it, do you? He'll find her. That's what he does! That's all he does!!&quot;) Biehn's performance grabs me every time I see it, just as Arnold's agressive coldblooded behavior also draws my attention. And in the middle is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who sees her normal life slip away in a matter of hours, (&quot;Come on, do I look like the Mother of the future? I mean am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook&quot;)yet is still able to draw strength from her pain and loss and fight to stay alive. It doesn't get much better than this, folks.<p>I wish people would stop being so hard on the special effects of this film. You can't compare it to T2. The Terminator had a shoestring budget of $6 million, while T2's budget was something like $80 million. Of course the special effects are better in the sequel...especialy when you've got an extra $74 million to spend this time around. Instead, people should be commending the hard work Stan Winston and company gave on The Terminator effects. Sure, that's not Arnold's face when he takes his eye out, but hey,...not bad. In fact it doesn't even look half bad when he puts his glasses back on just before the real Arnold is put back on camera wearing his glasses. The arm surgery is very impressive. I remember as a kid I couldn't watch that scene because you can see a vein wrapped around the metel skeleton while he's working on fixing his fingers. Looks pretty realistic to me. Take these things into consideration the next time you want to take pot shots at the visual effects of the film.<p>With the new 5.1 Surround Sound Mix newly created on this DVD, there's a lot to talk about. First off, the remixed sounds of most of the guns and explosions have been changed. The 44 Longslide with laser sighting sounds completely different when Arnold fires it. Same goes for the Oozie 9MM, Reese's shotgun, the whole ball of wax. At first you might be destracted by the changes since we're so use to the mono version. And since this DVD also includes the mono version, you can go back and forth and listen to the differences. The explosions, such as the giant armored machines of the future being destroyed, sound terrific. They really put a lot of work into making these explosions even more memorable. It almost reminds me of how George Lucas redid the explosion of the first Death Star for the special edition of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, except we don't get any additional visual effects to go along with it, just better sound. <p>Yes, it's true that you don't get as many extra features like you do on T2, (here in the USA, both T1 &amp; T2 are on one disc with one side used for the film and the other side used for the extras) but still, it's nice to have them. I think most would say that the deleted scenes are the best asset. The only shot of Arnold that was deleted was after he killed the other Sarah Connor, you see him go back to his car very slowly..not in a hurry..and drive away. Very very creepy. The other scenes range from Lt. Traxler (Paul Winfield) beginning to believe Kyle's story is true, to scenes with Kyle &amp; Sarah fighting over doing something to the Cyberdyne Company as we witness Kyle breaking down because it's so hard for him to look at the green grass and the trees, because in his world it's all gone. Director James Cameron explains that it is a good scene but decided that he didn't want Reese breaking down more than once and he already does that right before the love scene, which could not be cut. And of course, there is the deleted scene of discovering that the factory that the Terminator was destroyed in was actually Cyperdyne Systems. We see one man find the CPU chip and put it in his pocket, but it was better to cut all this out and use it to better advantage for the sequel. Throw in a few trailers &amp; TV spots(the teaser trailer reveals that the original title was just &quot;Terminator&quot;, not &quot;The Terminator&quot;), some short retrospective documentaries (although the original &quot;making of&quot; that's been out on video is not present), storyboards, script ect...and you've got a pretty well rounded special edition.  But wait!  There's more! <p>There are also some hidden features on the disc, located on Side 1. Just go to the Special Features section and then choose DVD-ROM Features. Once there, take your remote control and type in the following numbers (very slowly): 5, 1, 2, 8, 4, &amp; 1. (These numbers stand for the date of the Terminator and Kyle Reese's arrival (May 12, 1984) You'll be taken to a special hidden 2 page section, with about 29 different topic interviews done by James Cameron, Michael Biehn and others.  The interviews are done with slide pictures and not real video.  The topics range from how two kids actually played the part of the little boy who takes Sarah's picture for $4, Hemdales lack of faith in the picture, technical aspects, deleted scenes, to comaparisons to T2 ect.  Very interesting stuff.  Plus, on page 2 there is some reading material on a topic called &quot;Chrono-Surfing: A Brief History of Time Travel&quot;, written by Randall Frakes (co-author of The Terminator novelization).  So those of you scoffing about the lack of extras should check this material out.  It's a very nice &quot;Easter Egg&quot; find.  Plus, get the DVD soon and receive a fancy lithograph cover case of Arnold.<p>The Terminator...A Sci-Fi Classic!<p>&quot;I'll be back&quot; - Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Just A Movie...Have Some Fun"></head><body><p>Sometimes a movie is just a movie - meant to entertain.  I saw the previews and this film looked SO bad, I thought I would never see it.  When you expect nothing from a movie, you won't be disappointed, but to be honest, it was far better than I anticipated.  Sure, throw together Frankenstein, the Wolfman, Dracula, the Hunchback, Egor and all of Dracula's nasty flying brides and you are sure to have a howler.  I mean, I almost expected to see Abbott & Costello!?  The `cgi' effects were average, but seriously, they were on par with most that are going on in film these days and I doubt Lucas Film could have done much better.  The reason this movie was enjoyable at all was the truly funny dialogue by director Stephen Sommers.  He knows that no one in their right mind is going to take this movie seriously - it's just for fun.  Some of the best remarks come from Van Helsing's side-kick Friar.  Many come from the monsters themselves and there's a great one from Egor.  He is overheard mumbling and complaining, "Egor get this, Egor get that!" Or the good Transylvania princess who tells one of Dracula's brides just before she kills her, "If you're going to kill someone, stop talking about it and just do it!"  If you want serious good action movies, you won't find it here, but you'll never be bored.  The dialogue keeps right up with the action and there are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained.  After all, Sommers only limit was his imagination and he lets all hell break loose.</p></body></html>

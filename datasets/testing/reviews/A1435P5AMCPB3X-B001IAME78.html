<meta name="summary" content="Dissapointed since they negated "Hulk", But entertaining"></head><body><p>This movie re-tells the tale of "Hulk" with new cast of characters.  Ed Norton plays Bruce, Liv Tyler plays Betty, and William Hurt as "The General".  They pick up in Brazil where Banner was at the end of the last "Hulk" movie, and negate the whole storyline of David banner passing on the "Hulk" gene to Bruce, who unlocks it in a lab accident. Then the rest of the movie develops around how the general is going to capture the Hulk back for the military use.<br />Why three stars from me on this movie, and four for "Hulk"?<br />Here, they montage the creation of the hulk together in the opening credits by showing banner self experimenting and getting gamma poisoning and having a bad reaction with the test chemicals, unleashing the hulk.  This is what happened on the TV show and in the comics, but I thought it was too discounted and poor form to do underneath the opening credits.  That brought my rating down a bit.  Also, this animated version of the hulk i didn't care for as much as the "HULK" movie.  The details were just to overdrawn, to many ripples and textures. Finally, having Ed Norton play hulk and Liv Tyler play betty was like having Ben Affleck play DareDevil, bad casting.  I kept quoting Fight Club and Armaggeddon throughout the movie.  Too much actor baggage to bring along to characters who need to develop on their own.  They needed to keep Eric Bana, who brings fresher acting skills, like Tobey Mcguire did to Spiderman.  Overall, if marvel would have just had this movie made first, or made a sequel to Hulk to tie in the Avengers, it would have been better.<br /><br />I still recommend this movie, just not stongly. The Blu Ray format is excellent here with all the action and details, and worth picking up.<br /><br />FYI: The Alternate Opening is nothing to look forward to, a good choice to go with the montage, even though I didn't care for it, the lesser of two evils.</p></body></html>

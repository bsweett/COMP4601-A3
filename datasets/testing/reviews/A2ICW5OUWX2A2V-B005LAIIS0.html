<meta name="summary" content="Like Jaws, but with wolves, and in a forest"></head><body><p>Survival movies seem to be pretty rare these days, which makes each new one a treat to see, especially when they feature grade A stars (Liam Neeson in this instance) taking on the title theme monster or element (in this case, vicious wolves).  And while the film may veer into some cliches we've seen many times before, it manages to be an effective thriller that grips you until the very end.<br /><br />"The Grey" follows Ottway, a hunter tasked with keeping Alaskan pipeline workers safe from hostile wildlife.  It's a lonely, hard job, and things only get worse, for while flying out to another job, Ottway is caught up in a plane crash that leaves him and a few other survivors deep in the frozen heart of Alaska.  Now he must rally the others, and fight to survive not only the elements, but a pack of wolves hell-bent on taking them out as well.<br /><br />What struck me most about "The Grey" is how grim it is.  This isn't an uplifting story of people banding together to overcome adversity; this is a film about desperate men out of their element, where death can strike at any time, and they're the ones at the bottom of the food chain.  And while it seems to make for a very despair-filled film, it works.  You're sucked into a situation that feels completely real, from the bare minimum use of CGI (when Neeson is freezing out in the snow-filled plains, it's real, and not a studio), to the danger of the ever-present wolves, and the way the survivors react.  In fact, a nice surprise of the film is the little character moments that pop up throughout the film, such as a hate-filled rant against God, to a moving scene at the side of a river that I won't ruin here.  Neeson himself turns in a fantastic performance of a world-weary man who is forced to take charge of a bad situation, with only his knowledge of the wild to help him.  He's not an action hero, or a macho-body builder, but an ordinary, middle-aged man who's tired of life, and it works wonderfully.<br /><br />But while "The Grey" works very well on all fronts, it does fall into the standard cliche of "picking off the survivors one by one," which leads the viewer to wonder if the film will defy the stereotype of having one lone survivor by the end of the film.  In addition, it's disappointing that, for having such a strong and gripping story, the film has a very weak ending that made me feel cheated.<br /><br />Still, despite it's two flaws, "The Grey" is a gripping survival film that feels completely realistic in every way: not once are you asked to suspend your disbelief, because the need never arises.  The characters are strong and believable, and the film has a visceral punch that grabs hold, and doesn't let go.  For fans of survival films, "The Grey" comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Oh, and one last thing: be sure to stay through the credits, as there's a scene afterwards.</p></body></html>

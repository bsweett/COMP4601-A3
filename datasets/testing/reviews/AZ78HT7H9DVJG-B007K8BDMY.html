<meta name="summary" content="definitely not Goldilock's bears"></head><body><p>Initially, I wanted to trash this documentary because Tim Treadwell was just reckless with his life and his girlfriend's with these dangerous encounters with the grizzly bears.  And what's with this "13 summers" with the bears.  As if his survival from these 13 summers is a validation for his reason for exploring on dangerous territories.<br /><br />But then I think, how is Treadwell different from the likes of Steve Irwins and other animal behaviorists, scientists, etc.?  Don't they all risk their lives when exploring animals, especially those who are exotic, territorial and/or menacing?<br /><br />The thing about *The Grizzly Man* was that I found it to be boring and redundant.  Initially, about the first half-hour, it was interesting as we  see Treadwell educating us about the lives of these bears.  After that, it went downhill.  How many times can you replay the death scenario as well as drag it on and on?<br /><br />This could have simply been made an half-hour special on PBS or the Animal Planet channel.</p></body></html>

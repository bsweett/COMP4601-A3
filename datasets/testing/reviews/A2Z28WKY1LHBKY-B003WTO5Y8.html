There is certainly fascination and suspense; some good dialogue, some twists and turns, some red herrings, some curious psychology, some puzzles, some strange scenarios. But I have to agree with those critics who found a lot to complain about. It really doesn't hang together, although you don't fully realise it until after it's all over. The whole thing is pretty damned implausible --- although, again, this didn't seem to matter while you were watching. Where did Hannibal get his face mask from during the unbelievable escape sequence? (Now I get it: he skinned the dead cop's face and put it over his own. Credible?)  How did he manage to nick the warden's propelling pencil? I didn't think Buffalo Bill was too convincing --- rather hammy, imho. Jodie was good, Hopkins was good. Strange kind of patchwork; powerful scenes thrown randomly together. We might have been shown the charming Hannibal having dinner off his old friend the warden somewhere in some steamy Caribbean nightspot at the end.</p></body></html>

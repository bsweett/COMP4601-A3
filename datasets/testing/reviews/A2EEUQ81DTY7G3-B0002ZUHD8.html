The dignified Arthur, played with understated grace by Clive Owen, is a part Roman; part Anglo knight, conflicted in his duty to Rome. He's an idealistic high commander in the Roman army, which is in the midst of abandoning Britannia as a protectorate. <p>Everything Arthur does is for the church and for Rome, although throughout the movie he's constantly questioning this motivation. His moral inclinations are to free his people from oppression. Arthur also wants to give his fellow knights - Sarmatian soldiers reluctantly bound to imperial service - freedom so that they can travel anywhere throughout the Roman Empire. In order to achieve this, Arthur and his knights are asked to go on one last mission into Saxon territory to rescue a rich Roman family living beyond Hadrian's Wall.  They must defend the family and their farm workers against invading hoards of barbarian Saxons from the north. <p>Along the way they realize that their religion isn't Rome's religion, and they save Guinevere, spunkily played by the beautiful Kira Knightley, from near starvation and death at the hands of the obnoxious Roman landowner. After Guinevere makes a remarkably quick recovery, she helps the knights make friends with her forest-dwelling and strangely blue-tinted clan of warriors led by a non-magic and rather dull Merlin, played by Stephen Dillane. His part is so reduced that if you blink, you'll miss him. <p>Bruckheimer has obviously maligned a legend. He does go for historical accuracy, by setting the story in the appropriate time period, but any similarity to the legend of King Arthur that we know and love finishes there. The romantic entanglement between Arthur and Guinevere is reduced to just one hasty and rushed sex scene, and there's absolutely no love triangle with Lancelot at all. Instead we have lots of fiery and spectacular explosions, and not very bloody G rated sword fights, complete with an overly embellished and inflated music score. Some of the battle scenes, photographed in that annoyingly trite slow motion, do spark some interest, and it is nice to see that the CGI effects are not overwhelming the action. But most of these scenes are so badly shot and edited that they become a mixed-up visual whirl. I was also surprised how little blood was actually spilled, considering the ferociousness of the battle scenes. <p>There's a lot of overly sentimental and dull preaching about freedom and equality, with people having a right to choose their own identities. And it is obvious from the outset that Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere are fighting for a cause that is beyond anyone's understanding. Of course, like any conflicted hero, Arthur finally realizes, through sacrifice and battle that the freedom they seek is within them, not in some far off distant land such as Rome. <p>The performances are generally passable. As the warrior princess, Kira Knightly looks kind of ridiculous, dressed in some kind of leather, paint-streaked get up in the action scenes, but she does get to kick some serious butt which is fun to watch. The appealing Ioan Gruffudd is absolutely wasted as Lancelot, and he's given almost nothing heroic to do. Clive Owen does his best, but he just can't rise above the pedestrian material. He does look terrific though, with his three-day growth, his swarthy manner and his oily, black locks of hair. There's also some nice warrior beefcake, but overall King Arthur is a rather dull, and tedious exercise in historical mediocrity. Mike Leonard July 04.</p></body></html>

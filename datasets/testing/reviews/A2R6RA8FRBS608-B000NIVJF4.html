This is a story that deserves to be told so that the world will always know the ruthlessness and brutal violence perpetrated by Idi Amin and his regime while Amin was in power in Uganda during the 1970s. Even though I had a fairly good idea of how it all would play out after the first thirty minutes or so, I remained glued to the screen by the acting and the overall story line being played out so very well. Forest Whitaker's performance as Idi Amin lacks nothing; he deserved both the Oscar and the Golden Globe awards that he won for his performance. Equally convincing and special is the fine acting work of James McAvoy as the young doctor Nicholas Garrigan. Kerry Washington turns in a stunning performance, too. The cinematography and the choreography are wonderful and the musical score enhances the movie even more.<br /><br />When the action starts at the beginning of the 1970s, we meet young doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) who, fresh out of medical school, travels to Uganda to help the poor and needy who don't have access to doctors there. However, Nicholas is rather na?ve; the extreme paucity of medical care shocks him and he feels overwhelmed. Nicholas and his boss' wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson) attend a speech given by new Uganda leader Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker). Although Sarah remains unconvinced that Amin will be anything different from his far less than admirable predecessors, Nicholas falls for Amin's charm and optimistically enjoys the event. Unexpectedly, on the way back from the rally Nicholas is called to help Amin who has hurt his hand in a car accident; and it isn't long before Idi Amin invites Nicholas to his presidential home in Kampala where Amin alternately insists and sweet-talks Nicholas into becoming his personal physician.<br /><br />Nicholas is swept up into Amin's world and for a while he enjoys the benefits of his new position and power--Amin buys him expensive suits, a Mercedes and introduces him to VIPS at social parties and government events. Amin even asks Nicholas to take his place at a meeting where he must pick a design for a new building in Kampala! Nicholas is particularly struck by one of Idi Amin's beautiful wives Kay (Kerry Washington); Nicholas is something of a womanizer and the attraction between Kay and Nicholas becomes part of the plot.<br /><br />It also isn't long before Nicholas begins to realize that Idi Amin might not be such a wonderful man. Nicholas eventually discovers that Amin orders hits on people who oppose him politically; and there's even one occasion in which Nicholas himself accidentally becomes a catalyst for someone being killed. Once he realizes that Idi Amin is inhumane and vicious to say the least, Nicholas wants to leave Uganda to return to his native Scotland; but Amin refuses to let Nicholas go! There is also some racial tension building as the movie progresses; Nicholas is increasingly seen as "the white man" even though he harbors no hate toward Ugandans.<br /><br />I've left out some of the plot so as not to spoil it for you; and I won't say much more about what happens during the rest of the movie in case you do not know where all this leads. Suffice it to say that there are a few interesting plot twists and you will be fascinated by the action. However, there are also a few grisly scenes especially near the end of the movie so I certainly wouldn't recommend this film for young children or anyone else who might be sensitive to this.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras: an optional running commentary by director Kevin Macdonald; deleted scenes; a bonus entitled "Capturing Idi Amin;" "Forest Whitaker `Idi Amin'" and more!<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland" showcases spectacular performances by Forest Whitaker, Kerry Washington and James McAvoy; it's an essential film for fans of these actors. At the same time, of course, the film tells the story of just how brutal and inhumane Idi Amin was during his reign of power; this is a story of a mad dictator that deserves to be told and remembered for all time.</p></body></html>

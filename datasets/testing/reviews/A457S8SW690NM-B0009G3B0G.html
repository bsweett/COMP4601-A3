That's exactly what I got, but it was different than I had expected. If you watched the theatrical trailer (there's one on the DVD), this movie looks like it's going to be highly freaky and maybe even a horror movie. But the movie actually is a drama with suspensful moments. Adrien Brody gives an amazing perfromance as Jack Starks, a man that had a highly awful life besides the times where he was with the beautiful Jackie played by Keira Knightley. The movie opens with Starks getting shot in the head while in Iraq. Afterwards, he fixes the car of a drunk mother named Jane and her adorable daughter named Jackie. Jack leaves and gives his dogtags to Jackie. Following this, he's picked up by a driver as it's freezing out (winter). But, then, he finds himself in a mental institution. What happened was that the driver shot a cop and Jack and left the gun next to Jack's body before leaving. Jack though says that he already died in Iraq which lands himself in a mental institution. There, he's shoved in a straight jacket and put in a "drawer" where they leave him for a very long time. The doctors also drug him. When Jack is there, the movie is the most interesting, as you see his fear. He screams, cries, and sees scenes from the past. But, then, he basically time travels to the future while inside the straight jacket and inside the drawer. There, he is in the year 2007 where he is picked up by a lady named Jackie who's troubled, depressed, smokes, and drinks. While at her house, he finds his dogtags, and freaks out. He tells her that he's Jack Starks, and that she was the little girl for whom he had fixed her mom's car but she also freaks and tells him that Jack Starks died in 1993. She then tells him to leave. Jack then goes back to the present where he realizes that he must go back in that jacket to prevent his death, with Jackie's help. The movie itself is brilliantly ade, from the times where Jack's in the institution, to the times where he's in the future. The movie is depressing and disturbing because what is done to Jack is horrid. It made me very mad and sad to see such things done to a human being. This movie also has a beautiful ending which I really liked. (It wasn't your ordinary ending that you see in most movies) If you think that you'll be scared after watching the preview, you won't because it isn't scary, but the straight jacket thing probably will make you mad and sad. If you're hoping to watch lots of action, there barely is any. The movie is very well made and you'll probably think about the ending and certain points in the movie. It's really neat to see Jack in the future, seeing doctors and friends from the present, even though they're 15 years older, while he's still at the same age. Well, enough said, and by now I hope that I have encouraged everyone to see this remarquable masterpiece.</p></body></html>

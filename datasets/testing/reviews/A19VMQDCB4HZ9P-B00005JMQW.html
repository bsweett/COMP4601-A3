<meta name="summary" content="One of the best comic-book films..."></head><body><p>I enjoyed the first film and just like X2 I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel even more. The effects were much improved from the first film. It seems that John Dykstra and crew have fine-tuned the CGI Spider-Man not to look too cartoony.<br /><br /> Maguire's seem to have grown into the role of Peter Parker and looks more comfortable in all his scenes. The rest of the cast were more than adequate enough in the roles they had to play. The stand-outs other than Maguire have to be Alfred Molina's Dr. Otto Octavius. Molina's humanizing take on Doc Ock raises the character from just your ordinary power-mad supervillain into a tragic figure driven mad by circumstances beyond his control. Unlike Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Molina doesn't chew up the scenery but instead takes a more understated approach in portraying Spidey's nemesis. Kudos must also go to J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson. His scenes were some of the funniest in the film and accurately brings to life the character from the comics. Some of his lines are straight from the comics themselves.<br /><br /> As some may have mentioned the script and some of the dialogue can be weak and corny. I have to admit that they are at that, but the script overall wasn't as bad as some may have pointed out. The overall tone of the film and its script has the feel of a comic book. This is a comic book film and as such I went into it thinking of it as one. Some of the dialogue are bad and to be honest the dialogue in the comic itself can be bad. But the effect some of the corny dialogue had on me wasn't enough for me to thoroughly enjoy the whole film. Alvin Sargent's (two-time Oscar winning screenwriter) may have had his hands full trying to convey the feel of the Spider-Man comics in 2 hours. I think Michael Chabon's (Pulitzer-prize winning author of The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay: a novel about comic books)help in doctoring the script may have helped save the enitre tone of the film from becoming too corny. I hope they hire him to write the third film instead of just helping on it.<br /><br /> One thing, I like to point out is the effects used for Dock Ock's mechanical tentacles. As I watched the film the first time then a second time a few days later, I still couldn't tell when the CGI tentacles and the animatronic tentacles were on-screen. The effects work on Ock's helpers has to be some of the best FX work I have seen. The tentacles themselves seem to have individual personalities as they came to life.<br /><br /> And for all Evil Dead fans, Raimi was generous enough to bring in Bruce &quot;He is God&quot; Campbell to make a cameo in one of the funnier scenes in the film. Raimi also brings abit of a Evil Dead vibe to the hospital scene w/ Octavius pre-Dock Ock.<br /><br /> For a summer blockbuster and comic book superhero film, I recommend this film. It's not Citizen Kane and when taken for the whole of its parts Spider-Man 2 succeeds and entertains.</p></body></html>

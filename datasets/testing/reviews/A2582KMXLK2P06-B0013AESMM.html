Instead it was a merely good enough film that offered just enough action and excitement to give it a passable rating.<br /><br />What was a bit odd was how the action scenes just sort of appeared out of nowhere.  Suddenly, Jodie would find herself in a situation where she had to use her nifty little gun that she bought for a high dollar price, to fire off some shots at the bad guys who'd come into the picture and mess with her.  Now, if she had to use the gun as often in real life as she did here, I'd strongly consider moving out of that dangerous city.  It wasn't believable in that sense.<br /><br />I think another thing I didn't like was the whole "radio show" bits that would creep in every now and then.  Whenever Jodie interviewed someone for her show, that would almost immediately take away all the excitement from the story and make it as boring as possible.<br /><br />But, we can't deny Jodie's performance was really good, like always.  She's one of the best actresses doing movies.  Always has been, in fact.  Some pacing issues aside, along with some storyline bits that make us question reality, it was a good movie</p></body></html>

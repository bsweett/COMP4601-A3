No Country for Old Men is a thriller that delivers brilliant levels of suspense, fear and apprehension whilst simultaneously disposing of the genre's preconceived conventions. The cinematography on show unashamedly harks back to the Coens debut Blood Simple (1983) and with their regular Cinematographer at the helm, Roger A. Deakins, it is no surprise that No Country for Old Men has been nominated for an Oscar in this category. The films score is so subtle that it aids the tension by unwittingly achieving an omnipotent silence recognizable only through an assortment of wind noises which have been superbly complemented by the bleak dialogue and dark humor.<br /><br />To complement the film further it should be noted that on show here are some of the most powerful and flawless performances for some time and Tommy Lee Jones's is purely outstanding. His character embodies a demeanor of pensive sadness beautifully portrayed by the veteran actor in what is conceivably his best role to date (shocking that he has not been nominated for an Oscar, but this could be due to a lack of screen presence) it should also be noted that the final reels of the film are probably among his best ever committed to celluloid. Javier Bardem's role as the relentless and ruthless psychotic killer is astounding, his on screen presence mesmerizing and his mere appearance a pure treat along with a sense of a darkness casting over the whole room and it really makes you feel like you are in the presence of true evil. When it comes to playing a psychotic I would go so far to say that his performance has only ever been equaled by Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lector and maybe in years to come,<br /><br />I would like to point out that there is little to no music in the entire film which is a plus to me. The use of silence throughout the majority of the movie is very original in the sense that the music doesn't cue the viewer how to react and when.<br /><br />So again, not for everyone, but if you are a frequent movie goer and truly understand the makings of a good film, this is an excellent one to see.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...it's undeniably worth your time.</p></body></html>

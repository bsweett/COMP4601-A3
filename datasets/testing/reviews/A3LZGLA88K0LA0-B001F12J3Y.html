Though the story itself is somewhat thin, the animation is brilliant.  Never has animation seemed so lifelike, with loving detail to character movements and gorgeous alpine scenics.  Tom Hanks lends his brilliant vocal characterizations and physical appearance to several roles, most notably the conductor and the mysterious hobo.  He is of course also the embodiment if not the voice of the hero boy.  The movie's message is clear:  if you believe, then everything is magically possible.  The trip to the North Pole is fraught with misadventures and once there, the magic of the landscape and the North Pole is breathtakingly captured.  Alan Silvestri contributes a fine score even if the BELIEVE song is a little maudlin, but deemed Oscar worthy as performed by Josh Groban.  Nona Gaye also does nice work as the hero girl and Eddie Deezen is a great know it all.  In time, I think this groundbreaking joy will be a Christmas classic.  The whole family should enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

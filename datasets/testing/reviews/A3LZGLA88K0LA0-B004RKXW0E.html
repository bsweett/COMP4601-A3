<meta name="summary" content="THE TOYS ARE US"></head><body><p>The bittersweet transition from childhood to maturity is beautifully exposed in this third TOY STORY adventure.<br />All the favorite toys are back.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return with stellar support from all.  There's action, chases, peril, romance, humor..it's all there, exquisitely crafted.  But the most memorable scene is when Andy painfully donates all his toys to cute little Bonnie and relives his boyhood one last time before heading off to college.  Real lump-in-throat time.<br />There's not a bad thing to say..a real treasure.</p></body></html>

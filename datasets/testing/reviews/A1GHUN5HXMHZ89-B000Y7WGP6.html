The governments explanation that the people of the US want it that way is so ridiculous it isn't funny. The OIL companies and the CAR companies want it that way and the lobbyist and the donations to campaigns help keep it that way. But that aside this movie is an excellent look into the US involvement in Saudi Arabia. It shows the powder keg that everyone is involved in there and it is not in the least bit superficial about it. It shows how our involvement started and how we continue it to protect what has become a national security interest since our cars and planes need the oil.<br /><br />Synopsis: After men disguised as Saudi Police attack and bomb a compound of Americans and kill hundreds, the FBI pressures the country into letting four FBI agents investigate the site. When it is obvious it will only be allowed with blinders they pressure the local police and develop a repoire and eventually find those responsible. I applaud the movies insight and character development. I truly felt the pain of the people on both sides. If you enjoy movies like "Blackhawk Down" you will definitely want to catch "Kingdom". Cudos again to another wonderful Jamie Foxx performance. The DVD quality is excellent and this movie has good replayabilty.</p></body></html>

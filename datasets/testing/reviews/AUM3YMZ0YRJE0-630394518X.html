<meta name="summary" content="Tries to be more, but this is a formula film"></head><body><p>I know why lots of people liked this film.  It has many upcoming stars, like Paltrow, and some established ones who are not too bad (Pitt and Freedman).  Then there are the biblical references and the planing of a chess-player style killer.  But beyond some frills, is there really anything all that original or interesting?  Unfortunately, with the exception of some vivid images and special effects, the answer is no.  Moreover, the film is lacking in an original spirit, somethings that sets it apart on a fundamental level.  I did not see it and frankly, I hped to find it.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

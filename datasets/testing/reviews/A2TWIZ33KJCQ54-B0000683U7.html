THRILLER? DRAMA? LOVE STORY or FARCE?<br /><br />Answer - It doesn't matter, because, North-By-Northwest is one of the most purely entertaining and compelling films ever produced, and it is readily available on a fully-featured, remastered, widescreen DVD.<br /><br />WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT - - THE $4,000,000 BARGAIN OF 1959!<br /><br />Mistaken identity is taken about as far afield as it can go, with some wrinkles thrown in, like murder, attempted murder, love, betrayal, and plot twists on plot twists. Add to this, the pace of this film really books!<br /><br />THE HITCHCOCK TRADEMARK TAKES CENTER-STAGE: GOOD GUY WITH A FLAW - ENTER R.O.T.<br /><br />Just like Janet Leigh's character in "Psycho" and James Stewart's character in "Vertigo", the hero in "North-By-Northwest" has a character flaw that's going to cost him big. In Roger O. Thornhill's case he makes a living by capricious, harmless "exaggeration". He is in advertising and in this movie everything that happens to him seems like sensationalism, hyperbole, misrepresentation, stretching the truth, a whopper, overkill, and a lot of bull. All of which are synonyms for "exaggeration", how R.O.T. describes his occupation to put a fine point on it. The effect of this kind of literary justice is to put R.O.T. in a position where he must examine his soul and decide to take a position rather than a viewpoint. In doing this, he reaches a well-earned epiphany for both himself and his patient audience. In the end, his life is not only restored but is new and improved, as they say in advertising, with Eva Marie Saint becoming Mrs. Thornhill as his reward for sincere caring and many unselfish acts. In the end, goodness becomes more than its own reward as it can only be counted on in fiction: ah, but such good fiction was this.<br /><br />THE SETS - -<br /><br />North-By-Northwest was filmed on many locations in the United States and made to look like many more. There are memorable scenes in the United Nations in New York, Chicago, Mount Rushmore and even on Long Island, not to mention on the train with Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant from New York to Chicago. There are On-Location shots and matte backgrounds depicting outdoor sets filmed in Hollywood at MGM. Many of the interesting and unusual sets are explained in the featurette, all of which are well done and are very useful and important to the film's realism, which remains surprisingly intact throughout all the permutations in the plot and scenery.<br /><br />NICE SOUNDTRACK - -<br /><br />LET'S NOT FORGET THE MARVELOUSLY DARK SOUNDTRACK by Bernard Herrmann which made long scenes like Grant's drunk-driving fiasco seem tense rather than tedious.<br /><br />THE ACTORS - -<br /><br />Cary Grant is Roger O. Thornhill, or is that George Kaplan? You'll have to see the film to know for sure. His mother, Clara Thornhill, played by Jesse Royce Landis, isn't even sure, it seems, when Grant's life has been hijacked apparently without cause. James Mason as Phillip Vandamm is the unconventional leader of an international spy ring that has just marked Cary Grant for death. Unfortunately for Grant, but fortunately for us, he has little in common with most action heros so his solutions are also a little unconventional and more sophisticated than the usual Hollywood hero's.<br /><br />The result is fast-paced action entertainment that keeps the large, experienced cast of Hollywood veterans quite busy and the audience guessing.<br /><br />Cary Grant - Roger O. Thornhill<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint - Eve Kendall<br /><br />James Mason - Phillip Vandamm<br /><br />Jesse Royce Landis - Clara Thornhill<br /><br />Leo G. Carroll - The Professor<br /><br />Martin Landau - Leonard<br /><br />Philip Ober - Lester Townsend<br /><br />Josephine Hutchinson - "Mrs. Townsend," housekeeper<br /><br />Adam Williams - Valerian<br /><br />Edward Platt - Victor Larrabee<br /><br />Robert Ellenstein - Licht<br /><br />Les Tremayne - Auctioneer<br /><br />Philip Coolidge - Dr. Cross<br /><br />Patrick McVey - Chicago Policeman<br /><br />Edward Binns - Capt. Junket<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock - Man Who Misses Bus<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD - -<br /><br />This excellent transfer comes with the following;<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, French<br /><br />Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), French (Dolby Digital 1.0)<br /><br />Commentary by: screenwriter Ernest Lehman -- Somewhat dry and not really coordinated with what is happening on screen but it is, after all, comments by the screenwriter so it is worth listening to at least once if you are interested.<br /><br />Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest, with host Eva Marie Saint, Martin Landau, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, Patricia Hitchcock and others. This is a somewhat interesting 40-minute featurette, the high point of which is Martin Landau doing an excellent impression of Hitchcock during minute 28 of the 40-minute featurette.<br /><br />Music-only track: Music-only audio track showcasing Bernard Herrmann's score, Stills gallery, Hitchcock trailer gallery plus Widescreen anamorphic and full-screen formats! Not bad for $8.00!<br /><br />IN THE END - -<br /><br />Without a doubt, "North-By-Northwest" is my favorite Hitchcock film. For me, it is the Hitchcock film that stands up best to nearly a half century of repeated viewings. "NORTH BY NORTHWEST" is a case of the right men [Hitchcock & Grant] making a most entertaining 'Wrong Man' film.</p></body></html>

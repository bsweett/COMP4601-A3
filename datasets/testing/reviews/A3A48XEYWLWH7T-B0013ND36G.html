Don't want to spoil it, but don't expect a happy, fluffy, thumbs up as the t101 goes into the molten metal.  Picking up where the second left off, the machines are trying to kill John Conner again, and while they're at it, eliminate some of his cabinet members from the future.  The new evil Terminatrix is the logical progression from the amorphous T1000 prototype from the second film.  I thought the actress playing the TX did a nice job walking the line between tough as nails ice queen and sexy in spite of herself-robotness.  I remember reading once after T2 that they compared Arnold to the T1000 as a tank to a Porsche, the comparison holds true here as well.  With her hair pulled back, she is sleek and dangerous in the same way Patrick was..  I actually liked this one more than T2, it wasn't as self-referentially funny.  There are moments of comedy, but they are tempered by the ominous situation facing the heroes, more than the second film. Could also be that we don't have to deal with the whining preen of Edward Furlong from back then.  The action and chase scenes are impressive and seem less CG-ish than the freeway chase in Matrix II [although that sequence still is unsurpassed in my opinion].  Overall, there is really is no down time lull that doesn't work, the quiet moments are handled well with Conner and soon to be more Claire Danes [sp] &lt;who also did a bang up job>].  Arnold was Arnold, some of the new quips had us laughing, `Talk to da hand'.  The DVD contains numerous extras but notably hilarious section on principals of the Terminator universe where they don't use the original actors from T1, T2 and have them running out of focus or Photoshop art effected.  There are two audio commentaries, one done with the three actors, and then one by the directory.  Upon repeated viewings I think it held up well as the third member of the franchise.

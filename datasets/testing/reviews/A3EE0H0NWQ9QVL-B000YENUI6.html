Last year brought the Irish Mafia of Boston in `The Departed,' and this year has brought many other facets.  `American Gangster' brought a true tale of Black organized crime, and, now `Eastern Promises' gives us a take on the Russian Mafia in London.  Chillingly brutal, David Cronenburg, who also directed Viggo Mortensen in `A History of Violence' in 2005, nearly reinvents violence once again in `Eastern Promises'.<br /><br />At the beginning ruthless Russian mobster, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), has a rival's throat cut in a brutal opening scene at a barber shop.  Nearly simultaneously, a pregnant teenager, a mere child, arrives at a pharmacy seeking a prescription while hemorrhaging all over the floor.  She's taken to the hospital where midwife Anna Ivanova (Naomi Watts) delivers the baby prematurely as the mother dies.  Honest and caring in every degree, she takes a diary from the young mother's possession and seeks a translation.  At home her English mother and her Russian uncle, Stepan, keep her company.  At first Stepan refuses to translate the diary, which only leads her to restaurant owner, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), whose only son is Kirill.<br /><br />Keeping close to Kirill is a Russian Mafia driver, Nikolai (Mortensen) who doesn't take a back seat in the family business.  Kirill, who is gay, is both surly and affectionate with his recruit, but  Kirill is Nikolai's ticket to Semyon,  the mob boss.  Meanwhile, Anna startlingly discovers that the mysterious girl was a prostitute named Tatiana, one who makes several references to Kirill and Semyon in her diary.  Trying to discover the baby's true family, Anna tries to negotiate with the mobster family in exchange for Tatiana's incriminating writing.  Nikolai, although having a steely reserve, only shows us the surface, beneath which shows some compassion for Kirill's women in distress and some secrets of his own.<br /><br />Suspenseful and mercilessly violent, `Eastern Promises,' using spare dialogue and tight editing, gives us an unflinching look at the underground.  Included in the bloodshed is a confrontational scene in a steam bath, where a case of mistaken identity sets up Nikolai for the knife fight of his life.  All plot points come together as a turf battle caused by the initial killing and Nikolai's full initiation into the mob family come to a head.  Unforgettable for its brutality as well as its logistics, 'Eastern Promises' delves into the frozen hearts of some truly unsavory figures in organized crime.</p></body></html>

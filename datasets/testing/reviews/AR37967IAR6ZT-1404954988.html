<meta name="summary" content="You're not missing much by not seeing it. SPOILERS."></head><body><p>The problem with SPANGLISH is that it doesn't seem to know which characters it's really "about." The film can't decide whether the Klasky family is its focus or if the focus is their maid Flor, played by the beautiful Paz Vega.<br /><br />Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni play a successful couple with a bad marriage.<br /><br />Sandler plays his character as a charming but befuddled doormat who only occasionally asserts himself, though he never does that with his wife.<br /><br />Deb Klasky, Leoni's character, is a particularly unpleasant character. She's horribly insensitive, totally neurotic and makes some awful, awful choices. And then, for some reason, the film offers her character no ending whatsoever.<br /><br />I was waiting for there to be some resolution. I wanted to know what happened to the Klasky marriage. I wanted to know where the movie went from its central confrontation.<br /><br />But nothing happened.<br /><br />I don't know why the movie can't be about both Flor AND the Klaskys - giving all the plots a proper resolution, but director James L. Brooks apparently thinks, at different points in the film, that it's about one set of characters or the other.<br /><br />So we're left with some characters that get no definition at all (the Klaskys have a son who gets almost no screen time), some plotlines that are just left dangling (when does the young girl stand up to her mother?) and some confrontations that the movie seems to build toward that just never happen (Deb and Flor should have one more conversation).<br /><br />Also, the movie is told by a narrator who CAN'T know all the things the movie is telling us.<br /><br />On my way out of the theater after SPANGLISH, I heard one woman tell another that they liked it and liked, most of all, that it didn't have a traditional "Hollywood ending."<br /><br />I found it uneven, and I found its ending a cheat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="strong visuals, weak everything else"></head><body><p>In this top-heavy and bloated sequel to "Pitch Black," Vin Deisel plays a top-heavy and bloated antihero whose job it is to defeat an army of half-dead warriors bent on taking over the universe.<br /><br />At 135 minutes, "The Chronicles of Riddick" is an interminable m&eacute;lange of derivative mythology, mind-numbing dialogue and uniformly wooden acting, made bearable only by the breathtaking design and look of the film.  Diesel sleepwalks through the part of Riddick, barely managing to sputter out even the few paltry lines of dialogue the screenwriter has seen fit to assign to him.  About the only point of interest in the otherwise dull and tedious enterprise is why the classy Judi Dench chose this particular neighborhood to go slumming in.</p></body></html>

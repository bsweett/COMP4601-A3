<meta name="summary" content="A slathering of violence over a reflective core"></head><body><p>On one level, NCFOM is story about the collision of cowboy culture with drug culture. Set in 1980, it concerns the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, and a missing satchel holding over $1 million. Good guy Llewelyn Moss comes across the money, decides to keep it, and figures he is smart to outrun the bad guys, who also want it back. Yet two larger forces are also at play -- the law, represented by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and an enigmatic sociopath, Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. Anton is fond of shooting metal bolts into skulls or door locks using nearly-noiseless blasts from a compressed air tank. That's when he is not using a silenced shotgun with brutal accuracy. The plot moves the characters from desert to trailer park to motel, with the outcome always in doubt and the intensity on high.<br /><br />But there's more going on here than a shoot-em-up. The movie explores ideas of fate, intention and luck. It also explores the frustrating realization at the base of every human life that one's mission, however grand or petty, however exemplary or banal or destructive, will remain unfinished. As the body count mounts, thanks to Anton and his gas gun, Sheriff Bell struggles with coming end of his own career. As the tide of the drug trade begins to overwhelm his familiar world, he comes face to face with the fact that he will not finish the job he began. Only Death, cold and implacable, extends its icy grip beyond the human lifespan.<br /><br />NCFOM is extremely violent, though the violence is rendered believably. The suspense level is very high until close to the end. This is not a feel good movie, but has other rewards -- the terrific writing, convincing acting, and even bitter humor. Standout performaces were too numerous to mention, but include Josh Brolin as Moss, Kelly MacDonald as his worried but cooperative wife and Garret Dillahunt as Sheriff Bell's smart but unseasoned protege Deputy Wendell.<br /><br />Well-made as it is, this film has not sat well with me. I should have trusted my instincts when I saw the trailer. The violence is right on the edge of gratuitous, threatening to bury the message beneath the mayhem. The Coen Bros may have crafted a fine movie, if you can stand it, but it was no movie for this old man.</p></body></html>

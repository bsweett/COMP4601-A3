I watched it using headphones, sitting next to my wife, and she stopped what she was doing several times and looked at me like I had gone crazy. The truth is that if you enjoy humor that is sometimes politically incorrect, and even a little rude, you will have a blast with this film.<br /><br />The premise is pretty simple, John and Jeremy are two friends that crash weddings and not only get free food and drinks, but also hook up with a lot of girls in the process. They are living the good life and stay on this path of hit and run fun for a while. But when at the wedding of the daughter of Secretary William Cleary they get together with the two sisters of the bride, things get a little more complicated. They end up going on a weekend trip to an island with the family and close friends of the just married couple, and the madness goes on a rampage.<br /><br />The cast does an outstanding job. I was surprised by how good Vince Vaughn was on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCPS94">The Break-Up</a>, but I think he is even better on this movie, with a great delivery of some extremely funny lines. I have been disappointed in the past by Owen Wilson, but here he made me laugh out loud, and he certainly showed us that he can play the "good" guy effectively. Then there is Isla Fisher, who is great in her role of Gloria, the nymph that "captures" Jeremy in her net and makes Glenn Close in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA0">Fatal Attraction</a> look sane. The rest of the cast does not lag far behind, including a conflicted brother of the bride, a mother in need of attention, and a priest that gets more than he bargained for, but I have to make a special mention for Will Ferrell. Fans of this actor know what I am talking about. In the couple of scenes in which he partakes from the action, he makes us laugh so much that it is unbelievable.<br /><br />I think that by now it is pretty clear. Those that like "proper" humor should not even consider watching this. However, if you are looking for one of the funniest movies in the last several years and do not care much about political correctness, this is a film you cannot miss.</p></body></html>

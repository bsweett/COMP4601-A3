<meta name="summary" content="I can't believe this movie was the # 1 grossing film in HK !"></head><body><p>Holy Smokes! There are more than 150 movies released in HK per year, and this one was the # 1 at the box office for the entire year! Isn't that something! People must be starving on special effects and anorexic of good storyline. I gave 1 star for this movie, and the other star is for Jake Gyllenhaal for having the courage to do a career-suicide movie. I mean I totally loved him in The Good Girl(Jennifer Aniston), and I am stunned that he did this movie. It's got more special effects than human characters. Even Dennis Quaid is in It! I mean he just did his career revival Far From Heaven less than 2 year ago, and now he adds this to his resume. It's as bad as Twister, and not as good as Deep Impact or Ammagedon. After some 20 minutes of seeing the disaster on earth, the story and the special effects started to go downhill. This is probably last year's Battlefield Earth, but it didn't lose any money. I am glad I just rented it, and not bought it or paid a regular admission at the cinema.</p></body></html>

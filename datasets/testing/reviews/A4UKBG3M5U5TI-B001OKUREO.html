Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is rather muddled.  The plot hews fairly closely to the most widely-known material and accepted facts from Bush's life - his early partying ways, his mediocrity as a businessman, and his meteoric and surprising rise to Governor of Texas and then President.  The most controversial aspects of his life are left out here, which makes the movie adhere more closely to a "typical" biopic.<br /><br />Therein is one of the fundamental problems.  Oliver Stone is known for being a liberal-minded director who isn't afraid of stirring up controversy and even fluffing up conspiracy theories (see "JFK"). His nerve seems to have failed him here or else getting older has made him more moderate; "W." is not the brutal skewering some people are likely to expect.  Bush is portrayed as a lovable buffoon, and it's a rather timid depiction.  Indeed, the tome of "W." is uneven, with some of the actors seeming to play their roles as broadly satiric (Thandie Newton's spot on "impression" of Condoleezza Rice would fit in nicely on SNL) whereas others take a more realistic approach (Richard Dreyfuss is unrecognizable as a power-hungry Dick Cheney).<br /><br />Likewise, the movie's tone lies uncomfortably in the middle, neither condemning Bush nor adding much understanding of his character.  The only aspect of his life that it explored that hasn't been examined much previously is the allegedly rather contentious relationship between Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush; who is portrayed here as profoundly disappointed with his son every step of the way, even when he is elected President.  This depiction is at odds with the public persona of George H.W. Bush and his comments about his son, but it could explain certain aspects of W.'s personality.<br /><br />In the end, "W." is likely to frustrate equally people who like Bush and those who despise him.  Perhaps it was simply too soon for this type of movie.  Although "W." only covers Bush's first term in office, most people do not yet have the distance to gain perspective on Bush and his Presidency.  Stone's commentary track suggests that he does - he discusses the intense hatred he had toward Bush during the first term as dimming.  However, this perspective has seemingly resulted in a muddled movie unlikely to make anybody very happy.  "W." was interesting and even somewhat enjoyable, but it shed little new light on our most recent ex-President.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beat to "General Quarters" For This One"></head><body><p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain and Franch were mortal enemies fighting for dominance of Europe by land and sea. England was threatened with invasion for the first time in three hundred years. The only thing protecting the isle was the Royal Navy. This is the backdrop of Master and Commander who fights for England with his brave crew and stout ship against France on the far side of the world.<br /><br />Russell Crowe heads a first rate cast that replays a genre that hasn't been seen since Gregory Peck played the title role of "Horatio Hornblower." From a consistent script and story, one gets the impression of what life was like on the high seas during this time and how quickly, silently, and deadly mortal danger could arise. There was no sonar or radar save those in one's sight, hearing and judgment. And the fog could be one's enemy as much as it could be a friend.<br /><br />Besides the acting, the music lent perfectly to the story, and one can recognize Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 played by Yo Yo Ma. My favorite was Boccherini's La Musica Notturna Della providing the background for captain's order to beat to "General Quarters."<br /><br />As soon as you can, steer a course and set sail to your nearest store and purchase "Master and Commander..." It's one of those stories that seems to get better with each viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kill Bill Vol. 2"></head><body><p>More Dialogue and less action-packed than Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2, nevertheless, delivers the goods for those expecting a satisfying conclusion to this two-parter. Oh yeah, now this is fun movie watching. After the hilariously gorey Kill Bill 1, how on earth do you expect a sequel (which is actually just the 2nd part of the film) to top that? Why add some drama, create and atmosphere of intrigue and suspense, even some mystery, and a great eye gouging scene! I loved Kill Bill Vol.1 I mean I felt like I was watching a live action Anime! My sister happens to be an anime freak (I only claim to liking the Drangonball series) and she agreed that it was like an anime. Maybe that's why it is so, shall we say, unique. It takes the classic revenge story and puts a new twist on it, and thus Tarontino keeps his audience guessing thorugh the whole thing. The second and final volume in Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL series is another stylish, sprawling masterwork. VOLUME 2 picks up where the first film left off, as The Bride resumes her quest to track down her former mentor, Bill and exact revenge. But before she gets to Bill, she must first take out the remaining minions who helped to slaughter her best friends and fianc&eacute;. First up is Budd a quiet but dangerous country boy who lives in a trailer. Next is Elle Driver a one-eyed vixen who doesn't appear to have a heart--or a conscience. As The Bride makes her way closer to Bill, scenes from her past are revisited, including her training with the angry and brutal Pai Mei. Finally, The Bride locates her man, sparking a truly unforgettable confrontation. In contrast to the nearly dialogue-free first volume, VOLUME 2 is filled with extended conversations that bring the story full circle. Watch both Kill Bill's back to back and you'll have one entertaining evening awaiting you. Sometimes 5 stars just isn't enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Masterpiece from Eastwood"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood had already convinced me that he knew how to direct a movie. "Unforgiven" stands at the Pinnacle of Westerns and, good as it is, didn't surprise us that much. After all he must have learned a thing or two about making Westerns in all those earlier films. "Mystic River" was astonishingly good - and probably he learned something about police procedural movies from those Dirty Harry films. (Although Mystic River reaches levels of emotional complexity never attempted by the Harry movies.)<br /><br />In Million Dollar Baby Clint scores again. Everything about the film is set up to make you think this is a film about boxing, and as a boxing movie it's better than all the Rocky movies put together - even the one that won the Oscar. But in the final act "Baby" becomes another movie, and to say any more about the last 30 minutes of the film would be to say too much. (Although you wouldn't have to look hard to discover the controversy involved.)<br /><br />Eastwood directs himself and gives one of his best screen performances as Frankie Dunn, a lonely old man who runs a boxing gym and knows how to train fighters. But he's also afraid to put his fighters into a position where they could be hurt - perhaps going back decades to an incident where his friend Eddie "Scrap" Dupris fought one fight, or at least a couple of rounds, too many and lost an eye. Scrap is played by Morgan Freeman in one of those performances that you can't imagine anyone else in. You have to believe that he loves that gym and loves Frankie and loves the boxers who go there to train. His boxing career left him capable of not much more than sweeping the floors at the gym, but as in "Shawshank Redemption" Freeman's character serves as both an importance character, and as the story's narrator, filling us in on the heart and soul of the other characters.<br /><br />Hilary Swank earned her Academy Award as Maggie Fitzgerald, a poor white trash girl who left her dysfunctional trailer-park family behind in Missouri and headed out west to make her way. She has already discovered that she has a little ability, and she knows she has the heart. But she has not trained properly and she just knows that Frankie will be able to help her. But Frankie tells her gruffly a half-dozen different times that he doesn't train girls. Since she is persistent and keeps coming to the gym, he has to become increasingly cruel in his dismissals. The transition between the first and second acts of the film is a remarkable scene where Swank and Eastwood stand toe to toe. She is as determined as ever to become the best fighter she can - he is equally stubborn that women shouldn't even BE fighters. But she bares her soul to him - telling him about the welfare cheating family she left behind to come out west to make it, and Eastwood's Frankie gives in a little. He tells Maggie that he'll train her, but once she's ready to actually fight she'll have to find her own manager.<br /><br />The movie is full of realistic and wonderful touches as we see little morality plays involving unscrupulous managers, cheating fighters, boxers with plenty of skill and no heart and the opposite. Some of the most delicious moments involve Eastwood and Freeman about the most mundane things. I'd be glad to watch the whole movie again just for the conversation they have about Freeman's socks.<br /><br />It's wonderful.</p></body></html>

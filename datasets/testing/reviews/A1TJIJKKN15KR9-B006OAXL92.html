<meta name="summary" content="Childlike Spirit With a Sharp, Friendly Imagination"></head><body><p>Wonderful, wide-eyed, sentimental adventures through the eyes of an imaginative child. With a root premise ripped from the pages of industrial-era kids' stories, it's innocent and magical but also grounded, stretching reality like the best fairy tales. Though the plot is routinely jabbing in unexpected new directions, it's all done with a purpose and everything comes together beautifully in time for the closing credits. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are appropriately doe-eyed and rambunctious youths, Ben Kingsley brings a perfect amount of hidden warmth to the role of the stern, icy toy shop owner with a secret, and Sacha Baron Cohen shows surprising versatility in his turn as the persistent, bumbling train station officer. Spectacular visuals, passionate storytelling and expert direction make this kids' movie suitable for all ages, even if it does drag for a stretch in the second act.</p></body></html>

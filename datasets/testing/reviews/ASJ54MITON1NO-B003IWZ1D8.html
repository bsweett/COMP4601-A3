<meta name="summary" content="1960 Hitchcock"></head><body><p>One of Hitchcock's best films, carefully constructed, visually, and thematically. Before the slasher films were popular, which this film influenced, the psychological suspense film, done only the way Hitchcock could, was a more effective approach to the subject matter. Most of the associations of the events, takes place in the mind of the viewer, rather than on the screen. Leaving much left to the imagination, rather than having the events crammed down our throats, the way they appear in today's slasher films. The (Special Edition) DVD, contains more bonus material, but it's no big deal. Also, the newer released DVD, states that the feature film Psycho is digitally remastered, but looks essentially the same as the (Collector's Edition).</p></body></html>

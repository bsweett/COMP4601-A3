<meta name="summary" content="From a life that's hard to swallow, to the drugs that's leaves you hollow."></head><body><p>When I first heard about Mar&iacute;a Llena eras de Gracia and its subject, I had many doubts about the treatment of such a delicate subject and how Colombian this movie was, with a writer/director from the USA; but when I heard the interviews and read the reviews I got really interested in the film and had the opportunity to see this film this afternoon.<br /><br />Maria Full of Grace is one of the better films of 2004: well acted, well written, and very unique in its' story. From the beginning to the end Joshua Marston chooses to present the story in a way that has us relating and sympathizing with Maria in her plight to find her place in the sun.<br /><br />A very real topic with very real portrayal and acting, this is definitely one of the better films to come out. Unusually well managed without being junked up with the usual Hollywood tawdry tinsel and situational extremes, this very human drama does more pound-for-pound than most films many times its size. It presents its story at a quick pace and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone in general, being a great triumph in film-making. I hope to see more films from Joshua Marston in the future.</p></body></html>

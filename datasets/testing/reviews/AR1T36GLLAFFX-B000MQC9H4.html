<meta name="summary" content="Great writing; but no chemistry between the stars"></head><body><p>I don't recall ever hearing the name of Nancy Meyers before.  Yet she took a lot on in this production, with both the writing and directing duties.  My feeling is that she is an unusually talented writer, a decent director, and a below-average casting director.<br /><br />Set in LA and England, Amanda Woods (Diaz) and Miles (Black) work together putting together movie trailers.  Woods breaks up with her boyfriend Ethan (Edward Burns) after she finds out he had an affair.  Miles is in a relationship with a seemingly more stable girlfriend Maggie, who turns out to not be so stable.  Meanwhile, in London, Iris Simpkins (Winslet) has been carrying on a three-year, one-sided affair with co-worker Jasper (Rufus Sewell), while her brother Graham (Jude Law) is busy editing books.  Iris finds out Jasper is engaged with a girl in the circulation department, and has her heart crushed in front of all of her co-workers.  Amanda and Iris are ready for a change.  That comes when they agree to switch houses for the Christmas holiday.<br /><br />In any movie, things have to be believable.  That of course can be stretched in, say, a science fiction movie because we know there is no such thing as time travel, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, and there are (unfortunately) no monsters on Mars waiting to attack us as soon as we set foot there.<br /><br />But in a movie such as 'The Holiday', the arc of the relationships have to work, because the whole movie is ABOUT the relationships!  The sumptuous look of the film isn't matched by the casting choices.  In the DVD special feature, writer/director Meyers says she 'loves' Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet and Jack Black.  Well, who doesn't?  At least in individual roles they really fit in.  I loved Jack Black in School of Rock.  He was just perfect.  Here, he isn't.  There is zero chemistry between the staid Winslet, who plays a newspaper reporter in London's Daily Telegraph, and Black, who is back to his music by portraying a composer for the movies and movie trailers.  Try as he might, Black just doesn't fit well with Winslet at all.<br /><br />The other pairing in the film, Diaz with Jude Law is equally unbelievable.  Diaz, in the Meg Ryan role (ditsy blonde, long in heart and cutesy) had nothing in common with the down-to-earth Law.  They just don't fit, and you don't believe for a minute that these two could really end up together.<br /><br />Ironically, if the male leads were switched, the chemistry might actually work, especially with the non-manic Winslet and the equally settled Law.  The potential match between Black and Diaz might be a bit less convincing, because, let's face it, Diaz is a major beauty, and Black is always ruffled, no matter how often is shirt and pants are ironed.  Still, you could see it.<br /><br />But you just NEVER buy the pairing as put forth in this film.<br /><br />I must comment, however, on the sparkling writing of Ms. Meyers.  This woman can write dialog with the best I've run across in the past decade.  Her writing is such that you notice how excellent it is, and you make a point of find out who came up with this.  There's one scene with Jude Law talking to Diaz about how to make their relationship work that has pacing, inflection, cadence and lyrical tone that is just outstanding.<br /><br />Oh, and a note about Eli Wallach, who turned 90 during the filming.  His character (Aurthur Abbott) is sweet and light-hearted and wonderful.  He plays a writer (I suspect Meyers chose that career because of her own talents) who has won many awards, but 'hasn't been busy since 1978'. Iris (Winslet) finds out that the Hollywood community wants to honor a lifetime of writing, but he doesn't want to go.  Winslet convinces him to go, and Abbott finds out that many haven't forgotten about him after all.  Not to put a fine point on it, but the Winslet-Wallach pairing DOES have chemistry.  Their personalities mesh with a 50 year age difference better that the putative pairings of the film.<br /><br />Over all, three stars.  One star only for the casting.  Terrible, and it ruins the film.  Five stars for the writing.  Four stars for the actors when they are not with their supposed 'magical matches'.  Two stars for Black and Diaz when they are with Winslet and Law, and four stars for acting for Winslet and Law with they are with their 'mates'.  Simply, they are more talented actors/actresses.<br /><br />It's sad this is such a miss because of the casting.  With believable pairing, this could have been special.  The worst choice? Diaz.  There doesn't seem to be much heart in that girl at all.  She comes across as all surface.  I didn't like her in the role at all.  Poor choice.</p></body></html>

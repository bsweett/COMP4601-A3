<meta name="summary" content="What's that? It's a Velociraptor! RARRRR!!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best dinosuar movies I've ever seen in my whole entire life! The acting and stunts were awesome, and the robotic dinosaurs really rocked my world! Especially the velociraptors! They are, always have been, and always will be my favorite dinosaur  of all time, whether they be in the three Jurassic Park movies or in the late Cretaceous peroid 70 million years ago. This movie was filled with intense action, as well as some funny moments. And the setting, the sheer terror, the design, the savagery-there is almost  no dinosaur movie better than this one. Buy it if you can find it. It is well worth your $25.00.</p></body></html>

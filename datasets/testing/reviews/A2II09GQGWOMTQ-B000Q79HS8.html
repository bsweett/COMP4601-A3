<meta name="summary" content="A great sequel"></head><body><p>I finally got around to watching all three Bourne movie.<br />I loved the first one but I wasn't sure if the sequels would be as good.<br />My worries were for nothing.<br />A lot of franchises blow it with the sequels, that is not the case here.<br /><br />Ok, short and sweet.<br /><br />The good?<br />Everything.<br />Everything that was good about the first one is back and bigger for the sequel.<br />More action, more story, more twists.<br />Great acting.<br />Great direction.<br />Great story.<br /><br />What was bad?<br />Really?<br />Nothing.<br />I'm thinking..........I can usually come up with at least one thing I didn't care for in a movie but I honestly can't here.<br />As far as the action/adventure/spy genre goes....<br />The Bourne movies are first rate experience from start to finish.<br />The Bourne Supremacy comes....<br />Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

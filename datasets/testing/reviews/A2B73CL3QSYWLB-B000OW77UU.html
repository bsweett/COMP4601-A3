<meta name="summary" content="Deeply Moving Tale of Self Determination"></head><body><p>"The Pursuit Of Happyness" is an emotionally enriching cinematic experience.  It's basically a tribute to the pursuing one's dreams despite the obstacles that are thrown in front of you and perservering in the end.  Will Smith's Chris Gardner is an industrious chap with a lot of charm and savvy but suffers from a little misdirection.  He begins the film peddling around San Francisco doctor's offices bone density scanners.  This venture doesn't make him rich so he soon sets his goal on an internship with Dean Witter for a one-in-twenty shot at being a stockbroker.  There are many pitfalls to attaining his dream.  His wife recently left him with a five year old son to fend for.  The internship is unpaid.  He's evicted from a number of domiciles and at times forced to live in shelters and public bathrooms.  Racism isn't really cited as a reason for Chris' predicament but there are subtle hints like when Dean Witter's instructor forces Chris to park his car.  Despite it all Chris never wavers from his determination.  Credit Will Smith for giving a full-bodied portrait of a man who wants his piece of the American Pie.  Not to give anything away, the look on the face of Chris as he meets with the Dean Witter executives toward the films end will bring out the tear ducts.  Jaden Smith, Will's real life son and his son in the film, gives a naturally charming and unaffected performance.  "The Pursuit of Happyness" should soon be a bona fide word-of-mouth classic.</p></body></html>

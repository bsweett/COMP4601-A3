<meta name="summary" content="Denzel Washington dances with his dark side for an Oscar"></head><body><p>I have no problem with Denzel Washington receiving the Oscar for "Training Day," because the history of the Academy Awards is filled with winners who were probably being honored for a body of work rather (e.g., John Wayne, Henry Fonda) or making up for an earlier snub (e.g., Jimmy Stewart, Al Pacino) than a career best performance (e.g., Yul Brynner, F. Murray Abraham).  All of this is certainly debatable but Washington's performance as Detective Alonzo Harris, the philosophical narcotics detective who is teaching the rules of the street to wannabe detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is certainly a solid characterization.  How memorable you consider it probably has to do with you are a fan of Washington or the genre; for the former, this is a radical departure for the actor that standard in marked contrast to everything he has done to date, but for the latter the most significant different would be that this time the younger cop is being taught by an older cop who happens to be black.  <p>The strength of the film is not so much Washington's performance as it is the way both the character of Jake and the audience are put in the perspective of wondering how much of Alonzo's "training" is legit, and how much is some sort of put-on, ruse, or test for the rookie.  Early on it becomes clear that Jake has no clue as to what is really going on, and neither do we.  Jake is a bit too na?ve at the start, especially if he thinks a drug dealer is going to let him refuse an offer to toke up, but no matter how much he knows he would clearly be in over his head before long as Alonzo laws down his personal blend of street justice and economic opportunity.  Screenwriter David Ayer is definitely comfortable in this genre, having deal with undercover cops in both his previous film, "The Fast and the Furious," and the upcoming "Dark Blue," but there is one thing that I think constitutes a glaring error in the film, which really got in the way of my enjoying the final act.<p>I think that anybody who has watched a moderate amount of cop shows on television or seen their fair share of movies about cops during their jobs, knows what happens to a cop who shoots somebody.  Well, that does not happen in this film.  In fact, one of Alonzo's boasts is that he and his men are protected by their captain from such legal inconveniences.  Of course, if they follow standard procedure then the rest of the film does not happen, so Ayer take what I consider a rather large liberty with the real world because with the multi-million dollar lawsuits waiting around every corner I cannot believe there is a major police force in the country that does not cover its rear ends completely on officer involved shootings, no matter who the victim happens to be.  <p>Of course, this might just be me, and you can certainly see this plot element as a speed bump rather than a major roadblock.  When we get to the climax of "Training Day" the big question is what is going to happen and who is going to be left standing.  In a film like this, given the strong acting performances by both of the main characters, I cannot imagine what more your little heart could desire.</p></body></html>

Interesting sentiments that begin Hugo Cabret's (Asa Butterfield) journey towards understanding the world around him and the loss that he has endured after the death of his father, a clock-caretaker and an inspiration to Hugo's inquisitiveness to how things work, especially anything mechanical and most importantly clocks.  The movie takes place in the city of lights Paris within a train station where Hugo also lives.  With the opening scenes of the film, viewers have entered a world of mystery, mischief, and magic that looks like a combination of animation and like-action.<br /><br />Hugo becomes an orphan but somehow becomes independent and self-reliant.  His curiosity and persistence to understand the things that his father (Jude Law) left behind leads him to an experience like no other that a child his age could ever imagine.  And the key component that leads him to a world that he has been enthralled and fascinated with, his father's small sketch notebook; the notebook was one of the last objects along with the mechanical figure that his father had been working on that will help to spark Hugo's energy to unlock the mystery behind the drawings and the mechanical figure.  But before he and Isabelle area able to unlock the mystery, he encounters a disgruntled toy shopkeeper by the name of Georges (Ben Kingsley)and retrieves the notebook who inquires about the drawings; but as the film progresses more mysterious elements arise and the question of who exactly is Georges? But along the way, Hugo does not make his journey alone, and he befriends Georges's goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).  The drawings reveal much in terms of the love for film and its origins, which renowned and critically acclaimed Director Martin Scoresese helped to revive and unlock the mystery as well as the history of film-making within the main character of Hugo as well as other most recent films The Artist.  Both films recaptured the craft and innovation of what movies had first set out to accomplish - entertain but also make the filmgoer wonder after the last credits of the film have gone up.  But also most notably, the individuals that first made this world of wonderment happen and what Hugo's storyline centers upon, legendary filmmaker George M&egrave;li&eacute;s and the cinema.<br /><br />With the sudden resurgence of the history of film, the release of Hugo and The Artist are a welcoming aspect, especially during this rise of technology within the film industry and overall within the cinema.  It is amazing to see that films still make one think and offer discussion afterwards.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Guilty Pleasue of a movie!"></head><body><p>I have never been a comic book guy, and super hero movies are seldom high on my "I got to see that" list. However due to the almost universal praise of this film by reviewers that I have come to trust, I gave it a try and got the Amazon Video on demand purchase last weekend. I got the Hulk on a rental for the above listed reasons, and quite liked it as well, and was happy I watched it first, to get the tie in of Tony Stark industries...<br /><br />In any case I watched it by myself first because my wife is really not a "Comic Book GUY" but I thought it was so good I asked her to watch it, and surprisingly she enjoyed it as well. So why does a comic book work as a movie? It is an interesting story about a life changing epiphany, and how the things you want, may not be the ones you need or love. It is an interesting story about the futility of bargaining with evil. And how any evil thing we do may come back to bite us in the backside, no matter the motives.<br /><br />Also... Iron man is a fun movie with wonderful CG's a very cool visual experience. So, leave your disbelief at the door, and enjoy this very fun ride of a movie!<br />4 1/2*</p></body></html>

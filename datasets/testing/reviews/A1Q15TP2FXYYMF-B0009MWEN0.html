<meta name="summary" content="One Cool Sci Fi Movie"></head><body><p>The open and shut story of this film is Humans fighting for survival against an Alien bug race which threaten planet earth. There is a mild love story thrown in with this movie but the bug battles are the main focus and rightly so too because they are incredible.<br /><br />Although this movie was made in 1997 and the special effect capabillities where already pretty impressive this film really pushed the boundaries. In every battle between the humans and bugs they are on an amazing scale and every detail is superb.<br /><br />Be warned though this film comes with its 18 rating for a reason, very gory and i really mean that being killed by a bug piercing your body with 4 of its legs doesn't come with a price of showing some blood and guts.<br /><br />Excellent film and very captivating especially if you're into the futuristic side of things.</p></body></html>

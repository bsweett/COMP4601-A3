<meta name="summary" content="The Bucket List"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and try to catch one of his movies now and then.  The Bucket List I had heard a lot about but never really gave it much thought one way or the other.  But the late night movie bug caught and it was available, so I finally got my chance to see it.<br /><br />When billionaire hospital owner Edward Cole ends up in his own hospital, he never expects to make a friend in auto-mechanic Carter Chambers.  However, the two do strike up an unlikely bond and on the spur of a moment decision, after being handed their "death sentences" for cancer, they decide to fulfill a bucket list.  Or rather a list of things to do before they kick the bucket.  They go sky diving, travel the world, but eventually Carter realizes he should be at home with his family.  Edward is not so confident in this change of events though and isn't sure how to take it when Carter tries to give him the same gift of realization.  They both don't have that long to live, but its still hard to decide what to do with their lives.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Edward Cole: Jack Nicholson<br />Carter Chambers: Morgan Freeman<br /><br />I really like these two actors but don't think that this is their best performances ever.  They still do a good job but while polar opposites of each other at times, sometimes it seemed a little too contrived.  Freeman's character was a little too sage while Nicholson's was a little too out there to be believable sometimes.  Still, it was nice to see them pal around.<br /><br />For a plot this moved along pretty good.  It was interesting, albeit a bit unbelievable at times but since its a movie I'm allowing to suspend reality for a bit.  It was interesting to see some of the stuff on the bucket list, although it seems a lot of it would be standard for everyone (go on safari, travel the world, etc.) but some of it was unique to the characters and that was nice.  Some of the scenes were a little cheesy and you could tell they were backdrops instead of the actual place which was a surprising thing to me considering when the movie was made.  I also don't remember much of the music which means that it must have just been background filler.<br /><br />Not a bad movie but not the most excellent either of these two have done.  I'd probably watch it again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011</p></body></html>

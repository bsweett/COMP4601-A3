<meta name="summary" content="Johnny was great,,,but"></head><body><p>This film had alot going for it when it started but fell apart terribly at the end.  I have termendious respect for Johnny Depp as an actor and he has come a very long way.  Even though he was excellent in this film and he gave it his best shot the film itself died.I give Johnny 5 stars the movie 1.</p></body></html>

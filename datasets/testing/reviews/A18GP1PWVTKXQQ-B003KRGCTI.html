<meta name="summary" content="Attention all Atheists and disbelievers: 'The Book of Eli' begins with the letter 'B'"></head><body><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For those who were unable to suspend their disbelief (or more importantly, their common sense) regarding the many implausible moments in 'The Book of Eli', let me say unequivocally that I am with you! However, let me explain why I gave this film a '3' out of '5' (or 5 out of 10 on Imdb) despite finding the whole thing quite hokey. First of all, there are many films that are far worse than this one; secondly, I thought that the cgi effects and set design were actually quite good, especially the way in which the filmmakers created their 'equivalent' wild west post-apocalyptic town; and finally, the film actually has engendered a great deal of internet postings defending the many absurd, implausible ideas and scenes utilizing all kinds of tortured reasoning, which I found quite enjoyable to read!<br /><br />The Hughes Brothers have come a long way since their urban crime drama, Menace II Society. They have proved they can proffer up a post-apocalyptic shoot-em-up as good as any mainstream director. Taking a cue from M. Night Shyamalyn's 'Sixth Sense', not only do they know how to dispatch (i.e. 'off') the bad guys in a multitude of creative ways (hands chopped off, cross-bow shootings, one gunshot take downs, etc.), they also can throw in all kinds of clues, pointing to the fact (SPOILERS AHEAD--DON'T READ IF YOU WANT THE TWIST ENDING SPOILED FOR YOU) that Denzel Washington (Eli) has been blind all along. How exactly is Eli able to kill all those biker dudes (first with a knife and later with a gun) without being able to see them? The answer, of course, is in the 'book' itself. Wouldn't you know it, but the Book of Eli begins with a 'B'; yep, shock of all shocks, it's THE BIBLE!!! Channeling 'Ben Hur', the Hughes Brothers make the argument that miracles can be found even in a post-apocalyptic world! Like the Apostle Paul, Eli's 'faith' allows him to miraculously survive multiple onslaughts, including a bullet direct to the gut by bad guy Carnegie.<br /><br />The warmed-over Christian shibboleth that miracles occur due to 'belief in faith alone' is just another canard where we must suspend our disbelief in order to enjoy this film. But there's one small problem. Eli has been carrying one copy of the Bible that he's been trying to memorize for years, and it's in Braille!!! Since the Bible in Braille would consist of many heavy volumes, this is one plot point which even some of the most fanatical defenders of the film, have trouble explaining away.<br /><br />There are other moments in 'Eli' which I still had a lot of trouble explaining away myself. What about Eli walking around for days after having stocked up with only a canteen of water? All the copies of the Christian Bible have been burned but copies of the Jewish Bible and Koran end up on the library shelf at Alcatraz? And how exactly did he escape from the room when Carnegie and his thugs lock him up? I guess Eli finds a 'way' because all those who believe in God, manage to do so.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most weakest ideas in 'Eli' is Carnegie's belief that obtaining the Bible will enable him to extend his power. Since he and Eli are only a few of the people who actually have heard of The Bible, why does he assume that introducing it to the post-apocalyptic survivors will enable him to bring them under his fold? Since the majority of people in the new world have little or no knowledge of prior literature, Carnegie could have wrote his own book which he could have used to sway the masses. Of course, somehow the Bible is supposed to have some kind of a mystical, intrinsic power (perhaps rays emanating from the book itself) which leads Carnegie to believe he can use it as a brainwashing tool. Since it's never demonstrated how Carnegie could become more powerful by getting hold of The Bible, the stakes are never high enough for us to care whether Carnegie gets the book or not. Now if Eli knew the location of a nuclear bomb, that's a Macguffin that I could believe Carnegie would want to get his hands on!<br /><br />There seems little doubt that the most completely miscast actor in 'The Book of Eli' is Mila Kunis. She seems so out of place in this film that her performance actually drags the film down a notch or two. USA Today film critic Claudia Puig couldn't have said it better about Kunis in her film review: "Vacuous and far too glam, she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial." Didn't anyone find it a bit ridiculous how Solara (Kunis) suddenly acquires Eli's amazing martial arts-like skills and takes down most of Carnegie's henchmen in one of the final scenes? Denzel also has become painfully one-note in many of his recent film roles as a middle-aged actor.<br /><br />Finally, I'd like to chime in on the controversy as to whether Eli has converted to Islam when he arrives on 'Alcatraz Island'. A Muslim is not allowed to read any religious book except the Koran, so when Eli dresses up in a white robe as he translates the Bible, I think the Hughes Brothers were suggesting that all along he was some kind of post-apocalyptic Essene. Just my interpretation!<br /><br />I would like to thank all the faith-based defenders of 'The Book of Eli' along with all those who employ tortured reasoning to explain all the ridiculous goings-on in this film. Without you, I would never have enjoyed this film as much as I did and given it a passable rating.</p></body></html>

Its dark atmosphere surrealistic imagery contain murky allusions of dread and foreboding, making a visually stunning treat for the eye.<br /><br />John Murdock (Rufus Sewell) awakens in a bathtub in a strange place, and staggering from his seedy hotel room sees a murdered woman lying on the floor.  But John has absolutely no memories of who he is or why he was in the room.  Even stranger is the fact that when he emerges from the hotel, the entire city has stopped moving and everyone but him is asleep.<br /><br />With John having already fled the scene, Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) arrives to investigate, noticing that though there is a dead body in the room, the killer saved a goldfish from a shattered bowl, placing it in water before he left.  Bumstead has inherited the string of murder cases from fellow cop Walenski (Colin Friels), who has gone mad and been dismissed from the police force.<br /><br />Also looking for John is Doctor Daniel Schreber (expertly played by Kiefer Sutherland), who reluctantly works for `The Strangers', peculiar pale and bald guys who run around in Pinhead/Hellraiser type costumes.  The Strangers have the ability to `Tune', shift the shape of any material matter, and Dr. Schreber has discovered that John Murdock has mysteriously developed this ability also.<br /><br />With his memories gone, Murdock tries to discover the truth behind who he is, believing that he will find the answers at a place called Shell Beach.  The only problem is, there seems to be no way to Shell Beach, and Murdock realizes that it seems to always be nighttime.  Murdock convinces his wife Anna that something is wrong, and along the way enlists the unlikely help from Inspector Bumstead, all the while running from The Strangers and trying to avoid the bizarre Dr. Schreber.  The Strangers are looking for the human soul because their breed is dying, and believe that the inhabitants of Dark City hold the key to their immortality.<br /><br />Dark City is indeed a dark movie, any dark sci-fi/fantasy fan will appreciate the atmosphere and spectacular special effects in this edgy, creepy film.  Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt give excellent performances, Sutherland performing especially well as the lazy-eyed, limping, breathless, haggard looking Dr. Schreber.<br /><br />I liked The Strangers, even though they were a bit of a crossbreed between `Hellraiser' and `The Hidden', with slimy jellyfish things coming out of their heads at times.  I loved the special effects and the overall sinister feeling presented in the mood of the film, but the ending left me feeling a little let down and...well...cheesy.<br /><br />On a special note, simply because my mind is sick and twisted, I had a couple of laughs in this dark movie, produced strictly from associations my warped little mind made.  With The Strangers all having names like Mr. Book, Mr. Hand, Mr. Quick, Mr. Sleep, Mr. Rain...I kept waiting for Mr. Hat to pop up, from South Park.  I couldn't stop envisioning that.<br /><br />Also, when Emma Murdock sings `Sway' at the very beginning, I had to pause the DVD from laughing so hard at the memory of the hilarious scene in `Out To Sea', when Brent Spiner was singing `Sway' while Walter Mattheau and Rue McClanahan did their hilariously funny dance.  The Creep indeed. (chuckle)<br /><br />Overall, Dark City is great movie for horror or sci-fi fans that adore gothic style darkness combined with strangely modern or old-fashioned visualization, interwoven with some nice action scenes and great effects.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Splendid Psychological Horror Film"></head><body><p>Based on Thomas Harris's bestselling novel of the same title, "The Silence of the Lambs" is a riveting psychological descent into the mad realm of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) that works best as a psychological horror movie. Indeed, there are very few scenes of graphic horror in the film itself, and their occurrences only reinforce the mental battle of wills between FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic psychopath Hannibal Lecter. Without question, one of Jonathan Demme's best films and a genuine cinematic classic, "The Silence of the Lambs" is truly gripping, replete with excellent performances from both Foster and Hopkins, who offer filmgoers two of their finest performances (Foster's heroic portrayal of young Starling certainly deserved its Academy Award for best actress.).<br /><br />FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling is given the odious task of interviewing Hannibal Lecter - who is held in a maximum security prison cell - seeking his advice on the modus operandi of another serial killer Buffalo Bill. Lecter does give his advice, but it comes at a painful personal cost to Starling, who is forced by Lecter's psychological terror to reveal some of her own dark secrets from her youth. Demme focuses the intense drama between both characters by aiming the camera directly into their faces, with most of the scenes between Starling and Lecter filmed as though we are witnessing the interrogation from Starling's eyes.</p></body></html>

It tells the story of young girl who, along with her rather oblivious parents, has just recently moved to the Pink Palace Apartments in what appears to be Ashland, Oregon. She feels stifled and doesn't like the place, especially after she meets weird local boy Wybie.<br /><br />Her life becomes rather more interesting when she finds a portal to another world (climbing through something rather similar to a big, blue-purple vagina. I'm not judging, just reporting), where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, both idealized versions of her parents with buttons for eyes. They lavish love and attention upon her and don't appear to want anything in return. Well, possibly her eyes.<br /><br />This is a weird little stop-motion animated movie with some of the best, most amazing visuals I've seen on film in a long time. One of the things I love about movies is their abilities to show me things I've never seen and on that level this film doesn't disappoint. The mouse circus alone is worth the price of admission. It's also got a good, if rather basic, plot and some great voice acting.<br /><br />The film has a brisk pace, and at no point was I looking at my watch, wondering when it would end. The sheer creativeness of what I was seeing up on the screen was enough to distract me from the few plot holes, though I did notice a couple points where it seemed like scenes were missing.<br /><br />But there was something kind of off about the film. I don't know what it was. It certainly felt somewhat incomplete, and the third act felt kind of rushed (basically, "Go off on a quest!" followed a few moments later by, "Right, quest done!"). Despite that, it was a decent movie and I didn't feel my money was wasted, which is always a plus.<br /><br />One word of caution about the film. I would be careful on taking young kids to see it. There's some rather dark images here (like a few attempts at removing eyes), that might give kids some rather unhappy dreams. I'd not take anyone under about 8 or so without seeing it first to screen it.<br /><br />Also, I can't speak to the 3-D effects, since my theatre didn't show it in 3-D. I could tell where there were clearly moments that were supposed to be 3-D but weren't. I've a feeling it probably didn't add anything to the movie to see it in 3-D, though.<br /><br />So if you want a good time at a film where you'll see things you've never seen before, go to this. If you don't want that, hey, there's always Benjamin Button. At least you'll keep in the buttons theme.</p></body></html>

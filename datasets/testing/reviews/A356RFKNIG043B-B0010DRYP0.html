I actually think Liotta is better than DeNiro, who is tremendous. As are Pesci and Bracco. Everything feels authentic; these folks clearly grew up amongst real wiseguys and convey the atmosphere perfectly.<br /><br />What really lifts this flick above, however, is the perfect pacing and editing. The story moves tightly and quickly forward, with few wasted moments despite its length.<br /><br />It's also quite funny at times, though I always question whether making truly evil folks humorous (some of the real old-school wiseguys were not very funny) is a smart idea, but it's art, so each to his own.<br /><br />One thing for sure: the Sopranos pulled at least half their cast from this movie! Why mess with success?<br /><br />I disagree with Amazoon's own reviewer who calls this as good as the Godfather, though. As excellent as Goodfellas is, the first two Godfathers achieve a level of greatness and gravitas that few other movies ever have.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Goodfellas is a complete classic. If only all movies moved this well and looked this good and had this many memorable performances...</p></body></html>

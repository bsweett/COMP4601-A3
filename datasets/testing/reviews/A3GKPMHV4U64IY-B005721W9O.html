<meta name="summary" content="Cancelled But Still Going"></head><body><p>What happens when the only good part of your acting career was a show that was cancelled many years before?  Well, if it was a science fiction show, you can relive your character at science fiction conventions.  That is what has happened to the cast of Galaxy Quest and they are not particularly happy about it.  Then they get a second chance.<br /><br />Aliens far out in space have intercepted Earth's television signals.  As they have no concept of fiction, they believe the shows are reality.  They have decided to base their society on that seen in Galaxy Quest.  They are peaceful but at war with another species that is anything but.  They think their only hope is the crew from Galaxy Quest.  They have seen them defeat evil on countless occasions.  They have now come to Earth to enlist the crew.<br /><br />The cast finds themselves in a real life and death struggle deep in space.  While they know they are only actors, they get talked into helping.  Plot complications, humor, and plenty of action keep the ball rolling right to the end.  What could easily have been a movie based on one bad joke is really so much more.  Science fiction fans will get a lot of in jokes and cliches but non-fans can also enjoy the movie fully.  A truly fun film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The hell is in your mind"></head><body><p>This movie is stunnig. Aronofsky has thrown his glow to the sand with this disturbing and challenging film that will demand of you as viewer one moment of your valuable time because this film is important.<br />The infinite loneliness in which lives Ellen Burstyn (I still wonder why she didn't received the Academy Award for this performance)is just the starting point of horror nightmare which will involve four lives.<br />The hopeless and the no reason to live in the behavior mood of his son , will lead him with his bride and his friend to find the delights and pleasures of an artificial universe , due this world is awful and understandable for these three border characters.<br />The narrative is loaded of brilliant effects ; every one of the meaning characters is inmersed in his own mind jail. The slow decline in the moral will lead to feed the unthristy need of getting more and more ; the huge greed for feeling alright.<br />You'll experience a journey to hell , but beware ; I don't mean special effects ; it's the awfulness , the anguish  in its major expression.<br />This film , from its first release has become in a sudden cult movie.<br />If you felt the human desperation in the man with the golden arm in the fifties , so then prepare your senses when you watch this film.<br />Top notch performances and no mercy script!</p></body></html>

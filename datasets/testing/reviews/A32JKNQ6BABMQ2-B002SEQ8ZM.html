<meta name="summary" content="this movie is sick"></head><body><p>this movie made me ask myself the question,"do i want to continue to keep watching movies considering how evil they've become"? the movie is about a little girl who is ignored by her horrible parents and retreats into a secret path to another better world.then she is threatened with abuse,trapped,forced to see her friend after he has been abused .this is nothing that should be in a cartoon.much less,not advertised as for adults only.the girl is locked in a closet and meets 3 other dead children who died there.this is seriously messed up!i also noticed during the credits and junk that no one mentioned the people at dc comics who coralines evil mom is based on.captain hellfire or something like that.i love comic books but MAN do they have to be so evil?"watchmen" was the epitome of evil comic book movies.i even hear rob zombie has made one.im just not sure why a so called little kids movie is so horrifying.i cant belive society is so lax on evil now that they would allow this to go on.i just cant seem to find new movies these days that dont remind me how F'd up life really is and how far we have all strayed from the right path.i think if you let your children watch this ,you are a bad parent.</p></body></html>

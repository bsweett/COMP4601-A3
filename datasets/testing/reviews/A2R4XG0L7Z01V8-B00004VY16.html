<meta name="summary" content="Arnold Vosloo & Brendan Fraser are great"></head><body><p>This film started off my crush on Brendan, although he's ever so slightly losing his hair now. Arnold is lovely, he's got lovely eyes, as does Oded Fehr who plays Ardeth Bay. I could go on but I won't.<br /><br />Apart from the fact this movie's great, I also love the whole Egyptian thing portrayed in it. I love the way Anck Su Namun (played by Patricia Velasquez) dresses - or doesn't dress rather. I also love the whole black eyeliner thing, which I try in vain to copy, but can never get quite right. (Where is my own makeup artist when I need one?) With the exception of a loin cloth and a few pieces of jewelry, Patricia Velazquez's costume consists entirely of body paint which took 14 hours to apply the poor girl.<br /><br />If you listen closely during the scene where the people are chanting, the supporting artists began to change what they were chanting from the correct Egyptian phrase, to "Ohwhatanarseyouare" during rehearsals. Before long, they were all chanting it, and did so on the final take. Nobody on the crew noticed during filming, and it therefore remains in the film. I still can't hear it myself, although it is quite funny to think about it!<br /><br />Evie (Rachel Weiz) is terrific in this, and I love the way she changes from a "librarian" (complete with awful hair) into loved-up girl (with great hair!) There's so much chemistry between her & Brendan, particularly when Arnold Vosloo takes her away (ha-ha), and they're a joy to watch on screen together. John Hannah plays her brother, with a brilliant English accent, although I prefer his natural accent!<br /><br />Brendan passed out while filming because the noose around his neck was too tight. There's also a terrific scene when Arnold has him in a stranglehold, and his face does actually turn blue! (Right before they take his soul away) It also sounds like Arnold & Brendan had great fun on set as in order to practice the frightened reaction made by Arnold to Brendan with a cat, he threw a teddy bear at Vosloo which, according to Brendan, caused tremendous laughter between the two at the hilarity of being frightened at a teddy bear.<br /><br />There's loads of extras on this DVD, although most of them are quite tedious and not in the least bit interesting. (The Mummy Returns extras are even worse, they go on and on about The Rock like he's the best thing since sliced bread, even giving his character his own film!) You've got your commentaries by writer/director Stephen Sommers and editor Bob Ducsay/Brendan Fraser/Oded Fehr, Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo (no doubt all as dull as dishwater); "Building a Better Mummy": An in-depth look into the filmmaking process documentary; "Egyptology 101" Facts about ancient Egypt and Egyptian mythology; deleted scenes; visual and special effects information: A detailed look into the special effects (zzzzzzzzzzzzz); storyboard to film comparisons; photograph montage; pharaoh Lineage: A look at the pharoahs; "Spotlight on Location": Highlights on the filming of The Mummy Returns. (I ask about the latter WHY?!)<br /><br />Anyone will enjoy this movie, as long as try not to delve into the story too much. It's meant to be enjoyed, not analysed. So sit back, relax, drool over the cute guys (you'll be pleased to hear Oded Fehr gets a bigger role in the sequel). And for the guys? Drool over Patricia Velazquez in next to nothing for a couple of scenes.</p></body></html>

Adapted, as we all know, from a Stephen King book of the same name, the legendary director of such classics as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Barry Lyndon" created a picture here that leaves a chill running down your spine long after the credits roll. Too bad King never liked the picture. It's been well documented in the intervening years how the author blamed Kubrick for fundamentally altering his vision. I saw somewhere that King believed that Stanley Kubrick thought his novel was inferior material that needed to be elevated on celluloid. Well, everyone has an opinion. For my part, I don't think Kubrick thought it an unfavorable book even though it is. I read "The Shining" and really didn't care for it that much. It is, in fact, one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. Only "Cujo" ranks lower--and in that case the film version didn't ride to the rescue. King is a great novelist capable of producing fine work, but long after he is gone people will forget his novel and remember Kubrick's translation. Of course I could be completely wrong, but I don't think so.<br /><br />The film opens with the Torrance family--father Jack (Jack Nicholson), mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and precocious son Danny (Danny Lloyd)--driving out to the Overlook hotel for the winter. Jack took a job there as the winter caretaker, a big task considering the resort sits high up in the mountains where heavy snowfall virtually assures his family will be snowed in for months. A struggling writer and recovering alcoholic, Jack sees this opportunity as a great way to churn out a novel. It's not as though he has much else to do in the hotel: there aren't any guests loafing about and the staff isn't around to hassle him. All he's got to do is keep the lights and heat on, call in to a ranger station on the radio every few days, and he can sit back and collect a paycheck. Problem is, spending five months cooped up in a hotel in the mountains can bring on a powerful case of cabin fever resulting in...well...bizarre behavior. It happened before at the Overlook, actually, as Jack learns during his job interview with the manager of the hotel. One previous caretaker took an axe and slaughtered his entire family. Fun! Jack doesn't think such a gruesome event will present any problems for him or his family.<br /><br />Boy, is he mistaken! Jack Torrance has absolutely no idea of the supernatural horrors that lurk in the bowels of the Overlook hotel, but his son Danny does. It seems Danny has the ability to "shine," or read people's thoughts and see things that the rest of us don't see. And what he'll see at the Overlook hotel would give the stoutest among us a massive coronary. Suicides from years past, rivers of blood pouring out of the elevators, and the deceased daughters of the aforementioned caretaker appear as if by magic in front of the terrified Danny. One of the worst horrors resides in room 237, a room a departing employee named Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) tells Danny to avoid like the plague. Hallorann has the ability to shine as well, and is fully cognizant of the powers the Overlook can unleash with ease. As the days turn into weeks, Jack descends into total insanity, terrorizing his stricken wife and son even as he falls under the spell of the spirits in the hotel. There's no sense in dragging this out except to say that the movie unfolds like a relentless, evil dream. "The Shining" isn't so much a film as it is an experience to savor--for those who can stand the terror, that is.<br /><br />Goodness, where to start! The movie fires on every cylinder. Jack Nicholson is sublime as the mentally unbalanced Jack Torrance, capable of menacing subtlety and raging insanity at the drop of a hat. His line "Hereeee's Johnny" is arguably one of the best-known movie quotes in the history of cinema. Those who hate the film usually cite Shelley Duvall as the primary reason, claiming her whiny and weak personality mars an otherwise acceptable film. Horse hockey. Duvall is supposed to be in a fragile state largely because of her husband's past history and her concern about her son's odd psychic abilities. And when she sees her family falling apart again, she cracks under the pressure. I think she did fine. As amazing as the performances are, however, they pale in comparison to the look and feel of the film. "The Shining" is a cold, detached movie like most other Kubrick films. The dread is a palpable presence in every single frame of the movie, whether we're following Danny's big wheel through the halls of the hotel or watching Jack converse with evil spirits. So many great scenes rise to the forefront of my memory as I write: the chase through the maze, that last soul shattering shot of Jack Torrance, and Wendy's discovery of "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" all exquisitely torture the audience. This is a frightening film, and its one that never loses its impact with subsequent viewings.<br /><br />The DVD? Surprisingly, we don't get much. The picture quality is quite good, as it should be for a Kubrick film, but extras are lacking. A lengthy documentary about the making of the film with commentary from Kubrick's daughter Vivian does help, yet I can't help but wish for more. I could go on and on about how wonderful a find "The Shining" is for the horror fan, but you probably already know all about this film. If you are one of the roughly five people in the world who haven't seen the movie, I pity you. Get out and see it now!</p></body></html>

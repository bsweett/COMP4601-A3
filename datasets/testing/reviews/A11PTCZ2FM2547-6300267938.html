When I first saw this pimple-faced shoot-'em-up in the theater, I was mesmerized, and I was part of the crowd that took to its feet and cheered when Bruce Dern got what was coming to him.  Over the years, as fatherhood and an expanding waistline greeted me, I would come across this motion picture and find myself wincing somewhat.  A Montana cattle drive, led by an aging rancher and a cook with a Shakespearean delivery, and a dozen or so boys not even old enough to shave as cowhands--yeah, right.<br /><br />But this is John Wayne, and this is his senior citizen landmark film, THE COWBOYS.  The movie enjoyed resounding box office success, pleased the Duke's legions of fans, and even spawned an awful, short-lived TV series.  As rancher Wil Anderson, Wayne is his usual tough 'n gruff, crusty and cantakerous hombre; yet the Duke also reveals a kinder and gentler side as he becomes a father figure to his peach-fuzzed employees.  Yet as well as Wayne is in this role, the movie is so inherently flawed--first by the premise of young boys actually driving a herd of cattle, followed by these same boys going on a cold-blooded, avenging killing spree--I find myself growing more and more uncomfortable with each subsequent viewing.<br /><br />Guess I'm getting mellow in my old age.<br /><br />Bruce Dern is a perfectly hateable villain; Roscoe Lee Browne a wonderfully laughable and unbelievable chuckwagon cook who looks like he was plucked from the pages of 'Othello.'  Of the ensemble of 'Cowboys' young Robert Carradine is most noteworthy--and much more memorable via his 'Revenge of the Nerd' roles.  Yet, despite its flaws, THE COWBOYS is vintage John Wayne action and revenge, even though the violence is jarring and unsettling.<br /><br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

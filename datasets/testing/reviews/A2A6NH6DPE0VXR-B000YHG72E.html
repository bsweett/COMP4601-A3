<meta name="summary" content="A Christmas Hit!"></head><body><p>Elf is a Christmas movie that's actually good. It's cute, goofy and harmless fun. Will Ferrell (Old School) is in top form as a big dork named Buddy who grew up in the North Pole  and he..thinks he's an elf. He is shocked and horrified to find out that he's actually not an elf. He then decides to leave the Northpole and find his real father (James Caan) and hold hands and eat sugar-plums with him lol. Caan isn't exactly a nice guy though and doesn't want to believe that Buddy is his son but who could blame him there. Elf delivers laughs as Buddy for example gets hit by taxi's, attacked by racoons and beat up by a midget that he keeps calling an elf. With lame Christmas movies like Christmas with the Kranks and Surviving Christmas in theaters now you are better off staying in and watching Elf.</p></body></html>

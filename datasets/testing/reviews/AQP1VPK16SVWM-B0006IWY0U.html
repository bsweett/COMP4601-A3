<meta name="summary" content="A strong Blu Ray transfer for "Master and Commander" a highlight of the set which is a bit light on extras"></head><body><p>Peter Weir's "Master and Commander" manages to compress two marvelous novels into one marvelous film. Captain "Jack" Aubrey (Russell Crowe in a marvelous performance) and the crew of the Surprise pursue a French warship in Atlantic waters. Out gunned and out classed by a heavier, faster ship, Aubrey is determined to take down the French raider before it takes down another of Her Majesty's Ships. This pursuit will cost his crew, his ship but must be done to keep the waters safe for other vessels.<br /><br />The most important question is whether or not you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray because of improved picture quality. While "Master and Commander" does look better than the standard DVD and many scenes look truly exceptional, the film looks a bit uneven overall. Could the transfer have been better? Absolutely but owning this on Blu-ray comes down to how much you love/like this film. I suspect that the same original HD master was used for this a couple of years back. It looks extremely good but not as brilliant as I had hoped.<br /><br />Sharp direction by Weir, a masterfully adapted script by Weir and John Colee makes this harrowing sea adventure a worthwhile trip. Weir adds a powerful cinematic flair with the sharp camera work of Russell Boyd. Unlike a lot of previous adventures at sea, the fluid camera work adds to the sense of menace and danger that Aubry and his crew feel.<br /><br />The extras are similar to the original single disc DVD which is a bit disappointing especially considering how much Fox is charging for their Blu Ray discs (particularly compared to Warner). All the extras are in high definition which is good news. We get deleted scenes, a historical and geographical trivia track, a pop up map showing you where the H.M.S. Surprise is at any given moment, the theatrical trailer and the ability to search and save your favorite scenes.<br /><br />There's no commentary track nor are there any featurettes on the making of the film. Considering this IS a Blu-Ray disc, I'd expect the featurettes from the deluxe DVD edition of the film if nothing else but, sadly, we don't get it. I suspect we'll see a Blu-Ray double dip shortly.<br /><br />I can recommend the movie on Blu-ray simply because it has a superb looking transfer with nice detail and without the over use of digital clean up (a problem for "Patton" which is one of the worst looking Blu-Ray's I've seen--not because of the image itself but because of the overuse of digital tools to clean up the film creating waxy looking skin textures, loss of general detail and adding an unnecessary digital "look" to the film to eliminate film grain).</p></body></html>

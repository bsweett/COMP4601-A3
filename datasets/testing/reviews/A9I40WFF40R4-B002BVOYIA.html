<meta name="summary" content="As Good As Movies Get!"></head><body><p>This film is certainly as good as any movie released in 2004 and will stand the test of time. Anyone who has the slightest interest in world events knows of the killing of a million or more Tutsis by the Hutus in the mid-90's. HOTEL RWANDA is the true story of Paul Rusesabagina who almost single-handedly saved 1,200 people in 1994. His character is played by Don Cheadle, nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his role as the hotel manager. He gives a magnificent performance and in any other year should have won. Although he is in practically every frame and could have carried the movie alone, he doesn't have to as everyone else to a person weighs in with fantastic acting-- Sophie Okonedo as his wife Tatiana and Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, to name two; but the list doesn't stop there.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are almost too painful to watch. The most poignant line in the movie for me is when a commentator asks the question and does not get an answer: "how many acts of genicide make genicide?" It is well-known that officials in the U. S. Government played semantics with the word "genicide." Cheadle mentions in his commentary included on the DVD something to the effect that the only thing that prepared him for the making of this film was run-ins with the LAPD, a sad indictment of that police force.<br /><br />This movie should be required viewing for everyone.</p></body></html>

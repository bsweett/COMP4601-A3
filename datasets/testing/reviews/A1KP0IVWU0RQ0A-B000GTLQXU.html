<meta name="summary" content="Taken on it's own this "rethinking" is quite good"></head><body><p>O.k. first thing first, the 1972 "Poseidon Adventure" is still one of my favorite movies and one of the better disaster movies of the 70's. A rethinking(that's all i can call it because it is so different) in this day and age isn't that bad an idea. This one is better than most of the retreads we have had of late (Planet Of The Apes, Gone In 60 Seconds, and the endless T.V. show remakes come to mind), and that makes this one worth the price. The c.g.i. fx's are great and the action is first rate. Sure the story has holes(so did the 1972 version) and the people are cardboard cut outs( though well played by Kurt Russell, Josh Lucus, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kevin Dillon as the jerk that you can't wait for him to die) , but it all works under Wolfgang Petersen's direction. The warning about the level of violence is well worth stateing again, people die very "mean" deaths and in full view of the camera, so if you are disturbed by this beware!!! Other wise, relax, sit back and watch an adventure unfold "in an upside down hell under the sea"</p></body></html>

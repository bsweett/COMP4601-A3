<meta name="summary" content="vastly superior to the original theatrical presentation"></head><body><p>If I told you what I paid for the deluxe set (with a collectible Roman-soldier figurine, yet!) on Black Friday at a famous consumer-electronics store -- you'd plotz.<br /><br />This HD transfer is far superior to any I've seen. It's supposedly from the camera negative, and the extreme sharpnss and detail support this. There is no apparent grain reduction, as you can see huge amounts of grain in areas of blue sky (a surprising amount for a film shot in 65mm).<br /><br />The best thing, though, is that the flat, vulgar color of earlier editions is gone. Though no one would mistake "Ben-Hur" for a "modern" film, one can finally appreciate the really beautiful cinematography, especially in the darker scenes shot on studio sets.<br /><br />I get the feeling we're /finally/ seeing the sea battle correctly. In particular, it's much darker than previous versions, consistent with the cloudy skies of the backdrop. (Much of it was shot in a tank, if it's not obvious. Arnold Gillespie's miniatures hold up very well, even after 50 years.)<br /><br />I used to consider Charlton Heston's totally-unjustified-for-an-Oscar-nomination performance as wooden or stilted. Looking at it for perhaps the seventh time, I realize that the problem is that Heston had difficulty modulating his delivery. If he's happy, he's very happy. If angry, very angry. And no one will ever convince me that his clench-jawed butchering of "I see no enemy" in any way reflects how Judah truly felt at that moment.<br /><br />As in "Spartacus", the British actors generally deliver better performances than the Americans. Hugh Griffith, in particular, gets a plum role as sheik Ilderan, the "goofy Arab" version of the "crazy Mexican" Eli Wallach perfected. Griffith is so heavily painted down that it looks as if the makeup department went through many cans of Kiwi mahogany.<br /><br />The supplemental material is pretty good. A hard-back book appears to duplicate the written contents of the roadshow souvenir book, and adds additional photos and press releases. Another, smaller, hardback includes about 100 pages from the journal Heston kept during the production.<br /><br />The most-interesting supplement is a 75m film about Heston and "Ben-Hur". It's almost a hagiography, but Heston convincingly comes across as a kind, modest person who put his family first and was generous to and well-liked by almost all who met him. (This is consistent with the impression I got when Sandy Gross interviewed him a few years ago.) Would that he had been as good an actor as he was a human being.<br /><br />Strongly recommended, if you can tolerate Heston's unsubtle performance. I do have to wonder, though, why, given the things that can be done with digital transfers, his eye color wasn't changed to brown.<br /><br />PS: Just to set the record straight... Miklos Rozsa's "best-ever" score is rarely more than cornball tripe. In particular, the passage where the Star of Bethlehem moves over the manger (switching from widebeam to spotlight) is the musical equivalent of a Thomas Kinkade painting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It would be the end of the world if this won the top prize..."></head><body><p>Now why would it be bad if a low-budget movie with great actors and quirky humor won Best Picture? Simply put, Oscar doesn't go for this stuff. Yeah it'll probably get a nomination but I usually call those<br /><br />"rounders", meaning they're solely picked to round out the 5 nominations. Some were great movies, some were merely okay while others were like "why's this up here?" Little Miss Sunshine is a great movie sure but the idea Oscar will end up choosing this over some "historically important" but rather empty film"" is either when they finally got some sense knocked into them or people will think this is some massive budget epic in line with Braveheart or Gladiator.<br /><br />Thanks to a contestant unable to compete, Olive Hoover is selected to compete in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. However, family problems including suicide, a really mouthy relative and a struggling self-help guru wannabe prevent her from going. Unless you're in the Hoover family and they go on a road trip complete with a poor working vehicle and any other problem they run into.<br /><br />At a certain point, the grandpa of the family rants that they're having chicken again and I definately felt like that with my family. Not a week goes by where someone doesn't order pizza. This is one of those kind of films where it's easily to pinpoint the same occurence in real life complete with all its rough spots. While very "R" talking, the grandpa has a sweet relationship with his granddaughter that I've seen quite a few times and the angst-filled kid hates everyone yet can't resist the power of a good hug when everyone tries to figure out what to say.<br /><br />The casting is always essential in a movie and thankfully not a single cast member is interchangeable. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin and Paul Dano are note-perfect as the father, mother, grandfather and the son respectively. The 2 standouts are restrained Steve Carell who's likable and funny without being overbearingingly so in a Jim Carrey/Robin Williams way. But the real star is actually Abigail Breslin. Known as the too-adorable daughter from Signs (how cute was it when she said she couldn't drink water because of her brother's amoebas) but here she's adorable and sincere without in that kind of cloying "isn't she cute? We wrote her to be super cute" way.<br /><br />Expect a double-dip, most likely around Oscars time since the special features are kind of skimpy. We get commentaries and alternate endings which are fine but don't beat the one in the film. Those girls that everyone was cheering over were so creepy, one literally looked like a porcelain doll. So when Olive does her routine, not only is it different and unique but it was actually more thrilling that showed the alternate ending was not the way to go.<br /><br />Sometimes if a thing gets too big, unfair expectations are placed on it. After the massive hype a film like Brokeback Mountain got, you walking thinking this is the greatest thing ever (and to be honest, I'm one of the few who hated it and it wasn't because of the issue in it) so if Little Miss Sunshine gets nominated and even wins, I'd bet dollars to those fattening Krispy Kremes the words "overrated" will be thrown around loads. But like a character says in the film, losers is when they're scared of winning and don't even bother trying and this is a film that tries its damnednest.</p></body></html>

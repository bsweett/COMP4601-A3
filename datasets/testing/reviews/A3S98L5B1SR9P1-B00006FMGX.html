Tom Hanks has had better days, though he provides a certain comfort for a variety of viewers who have faith in him. Supporting roles in Christopher Walken and Amy Adams are to be commended, as they both add so much energy to the film that brought it all together. Spielberg knew what we was doing when he stepped into this movie and decided to direct it. All in all, it was a great film.</p></body></html>

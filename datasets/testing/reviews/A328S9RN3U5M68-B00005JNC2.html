It is rare when a film is conceived, written, directed and acted by one person and the result is a unique and timely little treasure like this one.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) lives in Los Angeles as an actor and is in a vegetative state of emotional paralysis supported by mind-numbing medications.  A call from his cold and distant father (Ian Holm) informs him he is needed at home in New Jersey to attend the funeral of his physically paralyzed mother who has accidentally drowned in the bathtub. Andrew flies to New Jersey (in a film sequence of a crashing plane that is unexpectedly hilarious) to the family and friends he has not seen in nine years.  His friends include some of the quirkiest folks you're likely to meet: Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), Kenny the cop (Michael Weston), Dave (Alex Burns) among others.  These folks are all as odd as Andrew and it is only when Andrew encounters Samantha the chronic liar (Natalie Portman) that he is able to begin to absorbs Sam's lust for living and ultimately get a grip on his aimless life, face his demons (the major one having to do with his mother's paralysis...) and commit to change.<br /><br />The action is fast, with pauses for some absolutely ludicrous events that are at once hilarious and tender.  All of the actors are superb, with Portman, Braff and Sarsgaard the most outstanding.  It may take a while to filter the storyline and process of filming through your mind: this is creative filmmaking at a new level. But the ultimate effect is a piece of work that deserves repeated viewings and serves notice that Braff is a talent to watch. Grady Harp, December 2004</p></body></html>

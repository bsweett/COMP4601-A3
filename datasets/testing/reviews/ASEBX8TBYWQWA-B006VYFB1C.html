<meta name="summary" content="Understated acting by Jonah Hill are the highlight of the film; BD has EXTRA 36 min. of bonus features."></head><body><p>There are well over 100 reviews of this film on Amazon now - most of them based on the theatrical release - so I won't bore you with many more details about the film itself. I'll concentrate more on the DVD release - especially the Blu-Ray disc which has a few more Special Features than the Standard DVD.<br /><br />As for the film, I'm not a huge sports fan but I was engaged throughout the full two-hour-plus length. Though Brad Pitt will always look like Brad Pitt playing someone, the rest of the cast including Philip Seymour Hoffman and the amazing Jonah Hill (sooooooo low key that you almost overlook his performance, but cheer with him in the end) blend in well with the REAL sports players that Director Bennett Miller incorporated into his cast. And fans of "The West Wing" (I'm a huge one) will spot some of the well-crafted lines by the screenplay writer, Aaron Sorkin.<br /><br />The Standard DVD bonus features include four deleted scenes (12 minutes), Blooper Rell (3 minutes), and  "Moneyball - Playing The Game" the standard "behind the scenes" featurette with lots of clips you have just seen(19 minutes).. The BD adds two more featurettes that are more interesting: "Drafting the Team" about casting (20 minutes) and "Adapting Moneyball" (about it's conversion into a film with discussions by the screenwriter. (16 minutes).<br /><br />Sports fans of any sport will love this. Oakland As fans probably bought this the day it came out!<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

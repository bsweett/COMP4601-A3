<meta name="summary" content="Better than what we usually get"></head><body><p>During times when it seems like you can't make a comedy without exploiting the handicapped or having bodily fluids fly around (like the Farrelly Brothers movies) or when having intercourse with American Pies is considered witty, and when everything else is a re-hash of the juvenile "Porky's" films of the '80s, "As Good as it Gets" stands out as one better comedies of the last 20 years. It is a genuine attempt to derive humor out of genuine human emotions and situations, and it succeeds most of the time.<p>There are dozens of other reviews here that will tell you the plot, so I won't go over it again. What's worth going over is the job the actors have done. Nicholson, who has basically been playing parodies of himself since "The Shining", actually reveals a human side to his maniacal persona. Helen Hunt is endearing, outraged and hilarious, all at the same time. My favorite moment is when she curses out her HMO. Greg Kinnear's eyes are so full of tears most of the time, that you are urged to throw Kleenex at the screen, yet this makes his more humorous moments all the more funny. But it's Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s moments that make you laugh out loud, especially when he interacts with Nicholson. James Brooks' direction is near flawless. <p>My only reason for holding back the fifth star is that the film really doesn't hold up to repeated viewings. You watch it once or twice, and then you have to put it away for a while. The happy ending is a little too neat, but I guess that should be okay. But my chief complaint is that the DVD version really doesn't offer much more than a few interviews with Brooks and the cast that are mildly amusing, but nothing more than what you would see on E! or Entertainment Tonight.<p>Still, the title of "As Good as it Gets" is very modest. This movie is better than what we usually get.<p>Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, A Novel</p></body></html>

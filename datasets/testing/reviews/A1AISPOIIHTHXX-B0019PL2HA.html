<meta name="summary" content="Good way to check what you'd honestly laugh at"></head><body><p>There was one point where I laughed so hard watching movies like American Pie and whatnot but then at a certain point, either the films became less funny or my sense of humor grew. I'll admit when a film did make me laugh but most of the times the film had an inoffensive air around it so it made it seem funny even though there was nothing just laugh-out-loud hilarious. While problematic in parts, Talladega Nights is probably one of those films where there's bound to be something that at least makes you laugh hard once.<br /><br />Ricky Bobby grew up with an unconventional father who taught him that winning is the best thing ever. Ricky loves racing so he combines the two and wants to become the best racecar driver ever. With the help of his friend Cal, his wife Carly and a misfit team, Ricky does become quite successful until gay French rival Jean Girard shows up and not only humiliates him in a bar but actually is better. Things get out of hand in a huge car crash and Ricky has to regain his footing again and become the best driver at NASCAR.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, there's bound to be at least something that makes you laugh, if only because like most comedies, they fire everything they have in the hopes that at least something will be funny among the numerous jokes. Some are repeated way too often (to paraphrase Stewie's jackal rant, that whole "Shake and Bake" thing wasn't funny the first time, why the hell would it be funny the next 10 times) but then there's some winners like a discussions about crepes, France's flat version of a pancake or a prayer involving Baby Jesus, not Bearded Jesus or Teenage Jesus but an 8-pounder Jesus.<br /><br />Casting is pretty spot-on although John C. Reilly is actually the surprise in that he's actually pretty likable and funny even though he's quite the intellectually challenged shall we say. And Sacha Baron Cohen (of Borat and the irritating Da Ali G Show) is quite hilarious as the gay French rival. It's also got some pretty great car racing scenes and some pretty brutal looking crashes but the emphasis is on Ricky getting back into racing so it's not packed with speeding cars but then some stuff in a way doesn't work like Ricky's sons Walker and Texas Ranger (I'm not kidding) who are basically little devil kids who become nice and Ricky's uncaring dad. Kudos for having Leslie Bibb and Amy Adams play the women though (despite my actual thought that it was Brianna Lynn Brown and not Adams playing that role, strange).<br /><br />If you liked Anchorman, I'm sure you'll love this. For everyone else, this isn't going to kill ya if you watch it so why not give it a shot?</p></body></html>

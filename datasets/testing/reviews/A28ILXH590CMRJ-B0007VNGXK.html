<meta name="summary" content="Perlman sells fun and frantic HELLBOY"></head><body><p>Based on the Dark Horse comic, HELLBOY is probably one of the more unusual superhero films around today.  In a prologue set in World War II, the U.S. Army foils a Nazi plot to open an other dimensional portal and unleash monster fiends upon the world.  However, an infant demon slips through into our world.  Taking pity on him, government scientist Professor Broom raises the tyke as his own.  60 years later, we find the demon all grown-up and fighting paranormal menaces for a secret U.S. government agency.  However, Hellboy finds himself batting not only the evils of his past, but his own feelings for Liz, a fellow freak with pyrotechnic powers.  <p> Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as the demon with a blue-collar attitude towards his job.  In many ways, he comes across as your local garbage man or plumber with his world-weary view towards the many monsters he faces. His snappy comebacks are especially amusing.  Perlman?s costume and make-up also reinforce the image with his floppy raincoat and filed-down horns, which resemble goggles more than anything.  Selma Blair is touching as the somewhat sullen object of Hellboy?s affections, while  John Hurt brings an added amount of warmth as the elder Professor Broom.  Rupert Evans is solid as the young FBI agent introduced to this unusual situation.  As the evil Rasputin, Karel Rodin somewhat underplays the part, making him a rather bland bad guy.  Doug Jones, with the voice of David Hyde Pierce, are delightful as fish-man Abe Sapien.  Lending solid support is Jeffrey Tambor as Hellboy?s antagonistic boss. <p>Despite having a lower budget than most films of its type, the special effects are definitely better than average with snaky haired monsters providing menace and a complaining zombie half-corpse providing laughs. HELLBOY is a fast-paced, fun film that definitely will draw in fans of the cult comic, while the irreverent attitude will appeal to action fans in general.  It doesn?t matter if you?re familiar to the comic or not, this film is definitely a fun time, and as such, is one that I definitely recommend.</p></body></html>

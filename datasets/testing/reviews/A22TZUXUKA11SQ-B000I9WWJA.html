<meta name="summary" content="Interesting heist thriller"></head><body><p>With an all-star cast, direction with the artistry characteristic of a Spike Lee joint, and a plot with so many twists and turns it was hard to guess the ending,  Inside Man is an above-average heist thriller.  However, as many reviewers have pointed out it is from a director who makes a habit of underlying his story with social commentary, and Inside Man is no exception.  At times it seemed as if the movie was supposed to serve as an expose on the importance of wealth in contemporary America.  From a child's violent video game whose point is to get rich or die trying, to a wealthy mogul who made his fortune from one of the worst tragedies in history, Lee makes a point of showing that all that glitters is not gold.  I liked that part of the movie, but I can understand how others are bored with Lee's tactics.  Overall, the plot, direction, and all-star cast are the most stellar parts of this film and they are reason enough to give it a chance.</p></body></html>

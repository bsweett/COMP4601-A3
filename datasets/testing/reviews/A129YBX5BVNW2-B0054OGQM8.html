I've seen great restorations before ("Goldfinger", "North By Northwest", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "The African Queen", "The Italian Job" - see reviews for them all) - but this is exemplary.<br /><br />The full run of extras is dealt with in detail in Amazon's description above, but it's worth highlighting that among the superb new extras is Michael J Fox not afraid to show his present medical condition in the 6-part making-of that is spread across the whole set. There are contributions from almost all of the cast, Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steven Spielberg etc - and great on-set footage too. It's also been pitched at a reasonable price. In short, this is properly good value for money for 3 hugely entertaining films that don't seem to have dated at all.<br /><br />I can only add to the chorus of approval for this - a fantastic presentation.<br /><br />Onwards and upwards to the "Indiana Jones" and "Star Wars" Trilogies and the remaining Bond films - which were all Lowry Digital Restorations and look as awesome as this...</p></body></html>

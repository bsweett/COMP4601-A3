This is certainly the criticism I've heard most frequently leveled against "Superman Returns" - that the movie simply isn't sophisticated enough to have any relevance in our cynical, post-modern 21st Century age - but, frankly, I find the movie's simplicity, straightforwardness and actual LACK of sophistication to be rather refreshing for a change.  Not all comic book heroes need to be deeply conflicted to be interesting.  Some times it's nice just to believe in a super human savior who's ready to swoop down from the skies and rescue us from a fate-worse-than-death at a moment's notice, no questions asked.  Who's really going to be fussing about the do-gooder's moral and psychological ambiguity at a time like that anyway?<br /><br />As "Superman Returns" begins, we learn that the Man of Steel has been absent from the earth for five years, having gone back to his original planet, Krypton, after some astronomers located its whereabouts.  Having found little there but a desolate cinder, Superman returns to earth to re-kindle his love interest with Lois Lane and to resume his fight for truth, justice and...well, you fill in the rest for yourself, the filmmakers having cagily opted to de-emphasize the character's nationalism in an effort to boost the film's revenue potential overseas.<br /><br />As stated previously, "Superman Returns" is a relatively straightforward tale of good versus evil done in broad strokes with only a minimum of psychological shading.  Superman may have problems in the romance department, but he seems otherwise well adjusted to his role of the world`s sole functioning superhero.  Crippling self-analysis has really never been Superman's "thing" anyway so there wouldn't be much point in his suddenly becoming unduly brooding and introspective here.  Luckily, the film makes up in warmth and charm what it lacks in sophistication.  Director Bryan Singer wisely chooses to emphasize the romance over the storyline which is little more than the usual generic silliness about Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) inventing a machine that will allow him to take over the world (ho hum).  The real conflict comes with Superman discovering that Lois has moved on to a new love interest and has a five-year-old son.  Superman's attempts to woo her back provide some of the most lyrical, touching moments of the film.  In fact, Singer, who has directed the film with both energy and style, is at his best in the subtler moments when he's showing us Superman flying across the city and around the world, backed by some of John Williams' most subtle musical passages since "E.T."  The Lex Luthor stuff, with all its attendant, high-tech special effects and eye-popping action sequences, just feels like the icing on the multi-million dollar cake.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is far from a perfect film.  It runs way too long at 155 minutes and we still can't understand why nobody is able to put two and two together and figure out that Clark Kent and Superman are really one and the same person - especially when they both disappear for five years, then make a surprise return to town at exactly the same moment.  Oh well, some things one just has to accept on faith when it comes to movies of this type, I suppose, and this is clearly one of them.  Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth lack the spunk and charisma that Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder brought to the roles, but they have a chemistry that works well on screen anyway.<br /><br />At least "Superman Returns" has a bit of a heart and soul to it, which is more than can be said for other recent blockbusters like the "Mission Impossible" or "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies.  And even though I appreciate a layered, psychologically conflicted comic book figure as much as the next guy, it's nice to have the real thing back for a change as well.</p></body></html>

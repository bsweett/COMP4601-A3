<meta name="summary" content="Excellent movie..."></head><body><p>I thought this was a well done movie with very few exceptions. There was just a little unbelievableness throughout the movie. The ending couldn't have been better! The language, death scenes, and intense drama keeps this one from being for the whole family.<br /><br />An oil companies compound is attacked by a terrorist group. Three American FBI agents go to Saudia Arabia to help with the investigation. Josh Harnet's role is a short one! Jennifer Garner needs to wash out her potty mouth and maybe her part could have been more fulfilling. She barely said anything but the "f" word. Jamie Fox does a really good job and brings this cast together!</p></body></html>

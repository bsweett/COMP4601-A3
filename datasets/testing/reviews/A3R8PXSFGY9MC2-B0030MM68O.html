<meta name="summary" content="The Hurt Locker"></head><body><p>`The Hurt Locker' looks at a bomb disposal squad during the Iraq war as they go about diffusing various roadside bombs and evade various traps and battles. It has plenty of tension throughout and the use of slow motion cinematography heightens the impact of some of the scenes, as bombs kick up dust, debris and spent gun cartridges cartwheel end over end. By the end this tension has made you see the war from the soldiers perspective a little more and you start to understand their outlook on danger and fighting, even if it makes you further question the involvement in Iraq. The typically gung ho American persona grates initially, but this soon fades as you become more involved in the film. You can see why this won the Oscar and the direction is very impressive and this ranks highly in films made so far about the Iraq war. If the Iraq war is going to spawn as many films as Vietnam did, then this is a decent enough addition to the genre. To be honest this isn't as good as I'd hoped, especially after all the hype (although it is a fairly decent film), and I can understand some of the apathy towards it, but as far as war films go this is very good and worth a viewing at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Turn your brain off and you might enjoy it"></head><body><p>Paul Anderson to me is a guy movie director: he doesn't make 3 hour long character studies or big period pieces, he just wants to have 90 minutes to show people kicking ass and blowing s*** up. Story may be very one dimensional, as are its characters, and dialogue may be hokey, but if I turned off my brain, I actually could enjoy this.<br /><br />Resident Evil the first film was essentially a prequel to the first Resident Evil game which took place in the Spencer mansion. The movie was written to provide a prologue to the game even though there's Resident Evil Zero but oh well.<br /><br />After the events of the first film, Alice, having woken up from some experiments done to her, she awakes to find Raccoon City looking decimated(kind of like RE2 and 3). Umbrella wants to know what happened in the Hive so they open it's huge doors, bad idea. The "zombies"(they're not called that in the films) attack the scientists and start to overrun the city. The city people then go to the city's only exit, but someone contracts the virus and turns into one of them. Umbrella decides that it's too dangerous to have the virus this close so they do the next best thing to get rid of it: nuke the city. What follows is a group of people trying to escape without getting infected or killed and rescuing the T-Virus creator's daughter.<br /><br />The plot is basically Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. There's no mention of William Birkin, Leon, or Claire. It does have Carlos Olivera and Jill Valentine from RE3(the latter also being in the first game). Not an important thing but Jill is HOT. Oded Fehr plays Carlos with a badassness and Milla Jovovich is quite capable in the movie-only character Alice. The big creature is the Nemesis, who transformed from Matt from the first movie. He looks like the game's character and has a rocket launcher and mini-gun.<br /><br />Instead of Paul directing the sequel, the reins are given to Alexander Witt, a long-time second unit director but first time head director. He sometimes has a tendency to have the fast editing syndrome that plagues a director like Michael Bay with fast shots. This makes the fight with Alice and the Nemesis kind of weird too watch cause he's so damn slow yet it's shot like he's going Bruce Lee on her.<br /><br />They're making a 3rd one with Paul returning as director. Seeing as how Resident Evil 4 just very recently came out, I'm wondering how it'll have its plot turn out. And here's to having Claire, Chris, Ada and especially Rebecca in the next film. But as for this one, give it a shot since it won't do anything bad and may enjoy it(except if you think the movie sucks).</p></body></html>

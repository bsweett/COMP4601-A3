<meta name="summary" content="Clever film about almost weightless travelers"></head><body><p>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)  has carved out a life of weightlessness (almost).  He's an executive for an out-placement firm that is engaged when a company needs to get rid of large swatches of their employees.  He's pared down his existence to a single carry-on; so much so that he's beginning to carve out a side career teaching others how to shed their possessions, their obligations, even their relationships and loved ones.<br /><br />He lacks one of the key elements of what it is to be human.  He's almost estranged from his family, he has no wife, no kids, no pets, not even a houseplant.  He does have a good business relationship with his boss, his assistant, and that's pretty much it.  He is so detached that he doesn't even notice anything is missing.  But, things will soon happen that shake up his world.<br /><br />On first viewing, I admired the acting (especially Clooney), the set design, the lighting, the cinematography, and the sound.  The story itself was clever, but the movie watcher really knew what was going to happen.  Bingham was going to experience something (or someone) that would make him realize that his goal of being the seventh person to achieve the coveted 10 million mile status (the youngest to get there) paled in comparison to his startling lack of human involvement.  The movie was extremely well directed (by Jason Reitman) and well achieved, but curiously non-involving.  It's good, but it's not a film that will be taken down from the DVD shelf very often.<br /><br />It's only after watching the commentary with director Reitman that I really appreciated the craft of the movie.  This commentary is why DVD special features were invented.  Playing the movie with the commentary on added a whole other dimension to the film.  Reitman grew up on Hollywood, his dad produced the film (Ivan Reitman), and he has many, many stories to tell about the making of the film.  So many, in fact, that he hardly ever stops talking.  There are two other members of the crew on the commentary, but you seldom hear from them.  Reitman just won't let them get a word in.  He's good and very entertaining to listen to, but why even have the other guys there?  And yet, he is entertaining as hell.  What a great dinner companion he would be.  Once he got going, you'd just sit back and listen.<br /><br />I do have to also comment on the film's 'fired folks'.  Some of them are actors, but most of them are non-actors who were asked by Reitman to appear on camera and sort of relive their own firings.  These non-actors were very, very good, and certainly lent an air of authenticity to the film.  A stroke of brilliance to include these people.<br /><br />Three and a half stars for 'Up in the Air'.  Four-and-a-half for the DVD extras (there's also an interesting interview with the company that did the opening shot, and other aerials in the film).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Indiana Jones: Lost In Translation"></head><body><p>Overall, if you go into the movie with the right expectations, you'll be in for a good thrill, a lot of fun, a one helluva sense of nostalgia. Unfortunately, a very poor story, less than thrilling characters, and incredibly over-the-top action keep this one on the ground. I'd rank it third in the series, only in front of Temple of Doom, which it shares a lot of problems with.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5<br /><br />Warning, if you have not seen this film, and have tried to avoid all spoilers thus far, you'll be well served when you see the film, because this movie is chock full of very important spoilers. It's darn tough, but I made it through three weeks of release without hearing anything totally major, and the experience was better because of it. From this point, be warned: HERE BE SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />Indy: Ahhh, since riding of on the Jordanian sunset, the good doctor has been very busy indeed. First, he fought in World War 2 (wouldn't you pay to see THAT movie???), and when the aliens landed in Roswell, he was there too, for some strange reason we're never quite privy to. The good doctor can still kick butt, and do incredible stunts, once again proving that like cows, Indiana Jones gets tougher with age. Whether you like this fact or not, since let's face it, Harrison can get the senior discount at Disney Land, right? Really, he hasn't changed personality wise since the last film, he's the same old professor, stressing old. You'll get giddy when he puts his hat on, and let's face it, you love seeing the icon again, right?<br /><br />Mutt: First off, what kind of name is "Mutt" for a potential future action hero? And what kind of iconic weapon is a pocket knife, which I believe is was lost in the movie? This could have been a great character, and in some senses he is, but he could have been a helluva lot better. He has a great personality, but he didn't really show he could be the next Indy like Phoenix did back in 'Last Crusade.' And I was very disappointed that Indy didn't pass the torch to Mutt. I mean, are we supposed to deal with old Harrison for another movie, kicking butt in a wheelchair? There's one scene where Mutt almost puts on Indy's hat, which would have been a great ending, but instead Indy takes it away. Very disappointing Spielberg.<br /><br />Other Characters: I found a bunch of characters in this movie just plain uninteresting. Marion, Mac, Oxley, the new dean, and the supporting baddies just didn't interest me. Not to say they were bad characters, I just didn't care for them. Bad character development. And Oxley could have been easily written out in favor for a more interesting plot-mover.<br /><br />Villain: Cate Blanchett is possibly the most overrated actress today. Which isn't hard, when she's almost single handedly dominated the best actress nominations the past few years. Her character could the poorest developed character. Nothing like Belloq, or that rich white guy from 'Last Crusade.' I mean, she pops up, and we're supposed to go, 'Ooohhh, she's real evil.' Not really, I mean, she's more freaky than evil. She's fascinated by psychological warfare? Really, that just doesn't pack any sort of a interesting punch. The character was also stereotypically Russian baddie, in a bad way. I mean, could the character be any more cookie cutter?<br /><br />The Action: Now, Indy has always been about action, so if you don't have action, you don't have an Indy movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem nearly as fun as it was back in the 80's, and it seems a bit forced, and at times uninteresting and unoriginal. Sure the motorcycle chase is fun, but the whole "Hangar 51" sequence seems a bit forced, although it does have some of the best moments of the movie. The whole chase sequence in the jungle on the other hand straddles the Hollywood line between believably and just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />CGI: One of the things that George and Steven wanted to do with this movie is keep down the CGI in most cases. However, on which sequences to use the CGI, they chose poorly. CGI BDA (CGI Big Damn Ants) are really testing that Hollywood line, and I really could have done without them. On the other hand, in the overall worst scene in the movie, Mutt swings Tarzan style through the jungle with a bunch of monkeys, and when you watch the background, either somebody forgot their CGI, or somebody needs to go back to computer school. I mean, that was absolutely pathetic, and reminded me of the terrible action background from 'Temple of Doom.'<br /><br />Over the Top: Let me count the ways...<br /><br />1. BDAs scaling each other to get to Cate Blanchett.<br />2. Mutt's Tarzan aforementioned Tarzan sequence.<br />3. Our heroes fall down 3 huge waterfalls with only a scratch to show for it.<br />4. The fact Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion inside a refrigerator. Did it have airbags?<br />5. The fact Harrison Ford can take down hefty men twice as young and twice as strong.<br />6. The Aliens. Why Steven, WHY?!?<br /><br />Which brings me too...<br /><br />The Story: What bothered me the most was this: the reason it took so long to get another Indy out was because George and Steven wanted the perfect story, and it took them almost 20 years to find it. And THEY CAME UP WITH THIS????<br /><br />Let me set it up this way, Indy searches for El Dorado, the supposed city of gold with Mutt, who seeks his help to save his mother. Now I must admit, I heard this spoiler, since it already was the worst kept secret in Hollywood, and not hard to figure out. Mutt is Indy and Marion's son. So the family races the evil Russians to find the city of gold, which they find with the help of a half-crazed loon who looked into the eyes of the crystal skull too long, which looks strangely like an alien head. When they finally find the city through strange happenstance, they find a room with not surprisingly, a bunch of alien figures. These aliens by the way helped the Mayans build pyramids and invent technology, which of course they couldn't have figured out on their own, so of course it must be alien.<br /><br />The Aliens soon reveal the temple they've been living in as a large cover for their very large spaceship, which is a page directly out of Stargate. The Aliens then leave, taking all the baddies, and giving Cate an overwhelming amount of knowledge, which promptly causes her to explode. The aliens then take the whole valley with them, and leave no trace. Indiana Jones then explains that El Dorado was not the city of gold, but rather the translation of the city of knowledge. Indy and Marion then get married.<br /><br />I blame David Keopp for this utterly lazy and stupid story, and I blame Steven and George for not realizing it was as bad as it was. I mean, the aliens still look the same as they did in the Spielberg movies years ago. They just don't change their look. Now, I could rail more against the story and aliens, but it appears I've almost written a book here...<br /><br />Anyways, we now can add what to expect with 4th movies from now on. 1st movies in classic series are usually classic and groundbreaking. 2nd usually isn't that great, and is bitter disappointment, and a scar that the director will never live down, they're the ones that ruin the series. The 3rd one may not be as good as the first, but it comes pretty darn close, usually dealing with something besides the action, although that's still there, but it just adds a bit more heart. We can now say that the 4th movie is a crapshoot, and you never can know what to expect. The 4th may not be as good as 1 and 3, but it beats 2, and still retains the aspect of what made the series good in the first place.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Simply the best and truest  adaptation to the screen"></head><body><p>I read two books the summer I turned fourteen, this was one of them. It moved me, for the first time, very deeply, and haunted me with it's quiet and unflinching look at racism, seen through the eyes of the purest of us all, children. I identified with Jem and Scout and Dill and wished I could go with them on the heart-stopping excursions to Boo's house; I felt the broad spectrum of emotion that this classic evokes in me to this day, and when it was brought to the screen, there was nothing missing; it is a complete, intact translation into cinema and is, in my opinion, the best performance of Gregory Peck's career. I hated Mayella Ewell for a long time, until I realized what her life was truly like and the real villain here is her father. I felt so bad for Brock Peters, and I felt his hopelessness so keenly, it was hard to watch, much harder than it was to read, and the pain and resignation on his face still conjures up all the hate crimes that continue to this day, and reminds me, uncomfortably, of the truck dragging death in Texas. The setting is wonderful, the gifts in the tree from Boo are touching, and the feeling of sorrow when Mr. Radley fills up the hole is profound. Dill, the character drawn directly from Truman Capote, is one of my favorite characters, the old-young wisdom and mature vocabulary are a joy to watch. Calpurnia is solid and comforting in the fast-changing world of the Finch household, and you are glad she is there. The court-room scene is riveting, as is the byplay in the balcony, where Jem, Dill and Scout sneak in and watch the proceedings. The Reverend, when the trial is over, cautions the children to "Stand up, your father is passing.." so thankful is he that Atticus, although losing the case, has nevertheless made a strong statement by virtue of the fact that he kept the jury out so long...and of course, the end, when the children are attacked on their way home from a Halloween party at the school by none other than Tom Ewell. Boo saves their lives, and when Atticus agrees with the Sheriff to let it be, and leave Boo alone, Scout says, "I understand...it would be like killing a mockingbird." And Atticus sits up all night in Jem's room, and as Scout says, "Atticus stayed there all night, and would be there when Jem waked up in the morning..."</p></body></html>

Lewis Carroll's adventures of a little girl who falls down a rabbit hole to discover a strange world is "mad" enough...  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp over did it.  I suppose that's what Disney wanted or else they could have picked someone else to direct/produce and star in the film, but in my opinion they both were not the best choices.  The only live human who really "worked" was Helena Bonham-Carter as the Red Queen.  She was fantastic.  Ann Hathaway as the White Queen was strange, Mia Wasikowska did not seem like the lively Alice of the book or of the earlier animated version of Disney's Alice in Wonderland and again, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter was overkill.  The whole production was overkill and too far off the farm... and it ruined the story, which is a shame because the original story is an awesome one.<br /><br />p.s.  A rating of PG was a little low considering the intensity of the film.  I think PG-13 would have been a better choice... very small children may be frightened.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not a movie I will ever see again..."></head><body><p>We acquired this movie because it had won several awards and the main character is played by one of our favorite stars, Daniel Day-Lewis, but as the movie unfolds, we found ourselves disappointed by the film. While the performances are excellent and the story a clear indication of where ambition, corruption and big business, specially the oil industry can take individual passions, the lack of humanity of some of these individuals is simply abhorrent.<br /><br />The film delves into the beginnings of the oil industry in the United States, seen through the life of a self made oilman by the name of Daniel Plainview, masterfully played by Daniel Day-Lewis. He travels the country identifying opportunities where to buy land that yields black gold, oil, to gain power, wealth and status.<br /><br />It is during the early part of the 20th century and we get the impression that the process was brutal, without regard to the cost of human life and at times with dire consequences for the families that lived on the land where oil was found.<br /><br />The movie confronts religion and family values against capitalism and the acquisition of power, and it is terrible to see how a young man who claims to be a prophet forces Daniel Plainview to accept religion in exchange for land where to build a pipe line, later paying back by having to renounce his beliefs in exchange for money to cover debts resulting from the market crash that leaves him penniless.<br /><br />Not a movie I will see again... anytime soon.</p></body></html>

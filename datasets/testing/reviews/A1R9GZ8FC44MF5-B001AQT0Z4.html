<meta name="summary" content="Okay I made a mistake."></head><body><p>My last review should not be listened to, see because when i wrote that i hadn't seen the whole thing i got up to the rape scene and said screw this.  But now that i have seen it again i must say that it still isnt that good.  Although it certainly is not a bad movie, it still lacks action and the story isnt all that interesting.  The movie is too long for the story, it fairly simple its a basic hit man crime story all about a simple job involving taking a case, showing the bosses wife a good time, then jewels goes good and vincent gets shot by butch, thats the story very uninteresting.  The rape scene is unecessary and could have been toned down, there is no other real action just some shooting, of course there is style and good music, this is tarantino were talkin here, but i feel this is his worst movie and could have been better.  Overall its a half decent movie that has a certain good feel to it at the end, its got some funny things like "damn i just shot marvin in the face".  Kill Bill is much better, this is a movie you should see once, and i understand why most people like it alot, but for me it just doesnt provide me with has much fun as Kill Bill, but its defintly worth a look.  Quentin is now working on a war movie called Inglorious Bastards, which definetly sounds good, Tarantino doin a war movie, o hell yes.</p></body></html>

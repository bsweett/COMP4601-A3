Or is it that this newer generation is so into computer generated effects that real talent doesn't matter anymore?  I took my nephew to see this film and i couldn't wait for it to be over.  What happened to the sharpness of the older cartoon features.  As old as "Snow White" is, that had better quality than any feature cartoon made in the past decade.  I think because of the lack of american education the kids today will accept anything that is put in front of them.  I'm so glad i'm not a kid anymore.  Total waste of time, don't bother to see this film, or rent it, or buy it.</p></body></html>

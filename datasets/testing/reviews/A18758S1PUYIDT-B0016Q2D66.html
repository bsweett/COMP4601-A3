<meta name="summary" content="Not easy to sympathize with these two"></head><body><p>Andaluz nails it in the review, saying that it is tiresome to watch these people fight and carry on when they really don't have it so bad.  They are so overwrought and picking fights and pushing each other's buttons that it becomes overwhelming after a very short time.  The first fight that we see, after April performs in a play, seems to come out of nowhere and to have no context.  But then, having the context and the backstory later doesn't even help all that much.  Also, the music is too loud and rather pervasive and distracting at times.<br /><br />On the plus side, the photography of the lovely yet sterile-looking homes and the washed-out faces is absolutely appropriate for the subject matter and tone of the film.  A late scene with April trying to perform a procedure on herself at home is especially haunting.  Winslet and DiCaprio can't be faulted for doing the best they can with what they're given.<br /><br />It's just hard to give much of a care about two folks who create their own problems and are their own worst enemies.</p></body></html>

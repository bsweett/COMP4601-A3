From his rear window, he is able to look out in the courtyard of the apartments around him and into the windows of other apartments. He becomes voyeur looking into to the lives of other people because he cannot get out on his own and he is bored with it. During the course of his vicarious living, he becomes suspicious about a neighbor and comes to believe that he is a murderer but nobody at first will believe him. Gradually, others come around but danger looms when the crook realizes that he is being watched.<br /><br />This has become something of a signature role for Jimmy Stewart. He gives a very creditable performance with only a single flaw. He is bored with life and bored with his adoring, socialite, beautiful and intelligent girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly. He displays ebullient, angry, pensive, playful and sarcastic moods well but he never quite manages to be convincing when he is bored with Grace Kelly. No one is that good an actor!<br /><br />The suspense in this film comes from wondering what is going to happen next and from the dramatic photography. There is no blood and gore. Kind of makes you miss the "good old days."</p></body></html>

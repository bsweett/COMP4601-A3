<meta name="summary" content="The Final Take Of A Movie With Some Merits, And Some Flaws."></head><body><p>Oliver Stone was not kidding when he mentioned that Alexander The Great's life might be too complicated for dramatization, which explains why it has taken the controversial director three seperate cuts to finally settle on a version of his "Alexander" that he claims he's comfortable with. "Alexander" still stands as one of the most curious flops of recent years. Its release was preceded by a whole year of hype and anticipation as Stone, the director of brilliant, engaging films like "JFK" and "Platoon," was setting his sights on ancient history, many suspected his decision to tackle Alexander's life and invasion of the East as a sort of statement on Bush's current campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The production itself was an epic struggle, just read historian Robin Lane Fox's book "The Making Of Alexander" (Fox was also the film's historical consultant). When the film premiered in November 2004, it was immediately bashed and ridiculed as a bizarre, muddled homoerotic swords and sandles flick (although it was a hit overseas). Now after two DVD releases, including a Director's Cut that was shorter than the original, comes "Alexander Revisited," which is Stone's attempt at taking the movie and molding it into something more akin to the grand epics of old Hollywood, with modern sex and gore. The result is indeed a more focused, less confusing storyline on a grander scale. Stone has literally re-edited the movie, different takes are used, and certain scenes mixed around. Shots of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy speaking that were originally at the end of the movie are now at the beginning, and this time the movie skips over Alexander's youth at the beginning and uses the epic battle of Gaugamela as a springboard into the character's life. Some expanded material is a lot of fun to watch, especially the scene where Alexander (Colin Farrell) first sees the Bactrian princess Roxane (Rosario Dawson) dancing during a feast, here the scene is longer, with some great choreography. And yes, there is more sex and violence. The battle scenes include some wicked moments of gore, consider the battle in India where now we have a shot of an elephant's foot crashing down on a doomed Greek skull. Alexander's homosexual side is more evident here as well with new material between him and the Persian eunuch Bogoas. The film does still have some merits, especially the beautiful cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (Babel, Frida), the music by Vangelis (Blade Runner), and some stunning production design and costume design credits. But no matter how much Stone slices and dices his movie, there some problems editing simply cannot fix, like performances. Colin Farrell is simply a bad Alexander, he does not have the drive, the brilliant madness, or captivating air for a Greek philosopher king who conquered the known world and spread Hellenism, and his balance of Alexander's strong warrior angle with his more tender, feminine character is unbalanced and makes for a performance that is sometimes puzzling, most times weird. Angelina Jolie is a good Olympias, she manages to bring fierce energy to her scenes with Farrell while Val Kilmer does a great King Philip (Alexander's father), Anthony Hopkins as always is notable eventhough he just walks around and narrates. But the movie still suffers from a confusion of what it wants to say, or WHAT it wants to say. Most of the story is still told through voice-over work, and we never get a good look or sense of what exactly Alexander was doing or achieving as he raided all these countries. We know he spread Hellenism and Greek culture, because we read it during history class in high school, but Stone never SHOWS it, instead we get scenes of argument and dialogue that can lead nowhere. The movie can chug along at moments, and great characters like Roxane are wasted and never used as they should. Jared Leto is also a terrible Hephaiston and his over-done use of eye-liner is peculiar. In the end, "Alexander Revisited" is an interesting study in the re-editing and assembly of a feature film, but it also shows that there are certain things you simply cannot fix in the editing lab.</p></body></html>

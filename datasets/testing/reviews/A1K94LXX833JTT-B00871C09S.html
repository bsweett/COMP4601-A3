<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock classic in new 2-disc Special Edition due out October 7th, 2008!"></head><body><p>Rear Window is considered by many Alfred Hitchcock's best movie.  The story suited him well.  A man confined to a wheelchair, watching things that may be innocent or murderous, a beautiful woman out of her element, in danger, with gradually building suspense that takes a potentially fatal turn as we watch helplessly with our immobilized protagonist, and a cliffhanger climax.  The movie has been analyzed by very smart people looking for much more than that, deeper meanings and allusions, and some of their ideas are true, and some are fun.  But it's the basic story elements, sharp dialogue, fine acting and the direction of a master that make it a great movie.<br /><br />The immobilized man is "Jeff" Jeffries (James Stewart), a Life Magazine photographer who's laid up in his New York City apartment with a broken leg.  Accustomed to an active life of adventure and world traveling, he's reduced to passing his time using binoculars and a telephoto lens to spy on the small world of neighbors across a small courtyard from his rear window.  The beautiful woman is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), a high society woman whom he is avoiding marrying on the excuse that she isn't cut out for his rambling life of action and danger, and he doesn't want to settle down.  As events across the way take a potentially sinister turn, the tables are turned as Lisa shows her grit in risky investigations while Jeff must remain passive.  Raymond Burr (of Perry Mason fame) plays the suspect neighbor who may or may not have killed someone.  Thelma Ritter is Jeff's house-call nurse who also gets involved.<br /><br />Most of the film is presented from Jeff's powerless perspective, giving the suspense an extra edge.  There are allusions to impotence and, through the lives of the neighbors, a range of romantic and marriage relationships mirroring the fears of many men and women, including our protagonists.  Much has been made of the theme of voyeurism, the window as a representation of the movie screen and so on, though I think it's easy to make too much of that.  Screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Hitchcock work in the usual Hitchcock cameo and humor, including a dog who "knew too much" (a reference to another Hitchcock film).<br /><br />The new 2-disc Special Edition DVD looks to be an excellent set.  It will include new special features:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by John Fawell, author of Hitchcock's Rear Window: The Well-Made Film<br />-- Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master<br />-- Hitchcock/Truffaut interview excerpts<br />-- Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock<br />-- Alfred Hitchcock Presents Mr. Blanchard's Secret<br />-- original theatrical trailer<br /><br />There will also be features carried over from the 2001 Collector's Edition:<br /><br />-- Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary (55 minutes)<br />-- A Conversation with Screenwriter John Michael Hayes (13 minutes on the Collector's Edition)<br />-- 1983 re-release trailer for Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Trouble With Harry, Rope, and Rear Window, narrated by James Stewart (6 minutes)<br />-- production photographs<br />-- production notes<br /><br />There's no mention in the press release of the screenplay feature that was on the older DVD.  It allowed you, using a DVD-ROM drive, to read the script while watching the movie, or to print out the script.  (The script is available online now.)<br /><br />The picture will be in the original 1.66:1 widescreen format, anamorphic, with the original mono sound.<br /><br />No announcement for a Blu-ray edition yet.</p></body></html>

To many movies spend so much on action that they overshadow the true nature of the business. That is not to say there isn't plenty of action in this third installment of the successful series, it just doesn't smother it. Tom Cruise is amazingly fit at 44 and does a great job in reprising his role as, Ethan Hunt, an agent for the IMF. Ving Rhames once again turns in a fine preformance as part of his support crew. Directing by J. J. Abrams was superb and showed his talent at making an action film with more than just special effects. He brought out some good charactizations, and made me want more screen time from even smaller support roles like Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn.<br /><br />This movie centers on Ethan becoming romantically involved with a nurse. Although it may not please action fans, it has a ring of truth to real life, and not just love em and leave as so typical in the Bond movies. We are surprised in fact that Ethan marries and has given up his field work. He is called back in to save one of his trainees and she is killed by a heartless arms dealer during her rescue. Ethan then sets out to capture the arms dealer Owen Davian played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but things go very wrong. Not only does he lose Davian, but finds that his wife has been kidnapped. When he tries to rescue his wife from the clutches of Davian, we don't know what to expect. One thing that impressed me was her part in the rescue. To often the ladies scream and cry and are helpless, that is not the case here and I am glad to see strong females portrayed.<br /><br />I bought this DVD without seeing it in the theater on the hope it would fill out the trilogy without regrets. It did more than that. I am far happier with it than my third installment of X-Men. It makes me want a MI:4. The DVD is excellent quality and contains many extras in addition to the standard commentary and making of documentary. If you enjoyed the previous MI movies or you enjoy spy movies like "The Bourne Identity" or the James Bond series, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly solid sequel"></head><body><p>For a majority of it's running time, the Bourne Supremacy excells above the Bourne Identity, with Matt Damon reprising his role as the amnesiac CIA assassin, who is once again on the run after being framed for murder.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles return as well, and Joan Allen is a welcome addition as a CIA handler trying to make sense of the conspiracy web that Bourne is tangled in.  While the action sequences are superbly done, and Damon is great as well as Bourne, the film suffers from the shaky camera work by director Paul Greengrass.  Now this may not be a huge problem for some, but there will be those who will find this utterly annoying.  Not to mention that the film itself bears little resemblance to Robert Ludlum's original work, and the dispatching of Franka Potente's character is disappointing as well, but the Bourne Supremacy gets more right than it does wrong.  All in all, the Bourne Supremacy is a more than solid mainstream action/espionage adaptation that, and if there are more films on the way, then this could be the start of something good.</p></body></html>

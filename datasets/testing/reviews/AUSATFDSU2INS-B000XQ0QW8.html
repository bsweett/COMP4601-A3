<meta name="summary" content="The sixth sense of Bruce Willis"></head><body><p>What person, fan or not of superheroes stories, has not thought at least once, if it's possible that such fantastic figure exists, a person able to defeat evil?<br /><br />The creative brilliant mind of Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan, explores the possibility of such preposterous hypothesis in his film, Unbreakable.<br /><br />David Dunn (Willis) is a security guard, whose family life is crumbling. A fatal train accident miraculously leaves David as the only survivor, without a singular scratch or psychological trauma. Such strange event catches the attention of Elijah Price (Jackson).<br /><br />Carrier of a disease that makes him extremely fragile, Elijah has gallant ideas about David, who demonstrates skepticism and thinks in the beginning that Elijah is crazy... until slowly, he begins to discover amazing things...<br /><br />We must not be confused by the similarities between Unbreakable and Sixth Sense: certainly both were written and directed by Shyamalan, starred Willis, set in Philadelphia and structured in three acts, but the similarities end there. While Sixth Sense was a character drama with a supernatural touch, Unbreakable is a mysterious history with continuous growing suspense.<br /><br />Unbreakable tries to present to us, in the most realistic way possible, David and Elijah's journey towards the discovery of something "greater", beyond the human understanding, about "that quality" that makes some people different from the rest of humanity.<br /><br />Faith, coincidence and the presence of a sixth sense are constant subjects in this story, where two men opposed in many ways - physically, intellectually and philosophically- must learn to develop their instincts and to discover their mission in life. The atmosphere in the movie is less than chilling, full of anticipation and surprises.<br /><br />Using like reference the worlds displayed in heroes stories like Superman, Spiderman and such, Shyamalan tries to make us understand that the latter are not mythical stories where good faces evil, but human efforts to explain the very nature of the evil.<br /><br />The cinematographic style applied to the film maintains an involving and realistic tone: the images are deep, full of important actions; the sequences are long, full of sorrow, tension and complexity. The narrative is absorbent.<br /><br />While the central characters and their complicated emotional maps are exposed, we get caught by the unusual world the movie displays. Bruce Willis reflects a wide emotional turbulence as the reticent man who has to accept his destiny, while Jackson is magnetic like the man full of fantastic theories, worthy of a lunatic who has just escaped an asylum.<br /><br />Once again, Shyamalan demonstrates that he is a brilliant film director. Imaginative, able to surprise, confuse and please our expectations. His work in the direction keeps exploring new ways; his eagerness in the details is admirable.<br /><br />An unexpected end, although not as surprising as the one in Sixth Sense, will leave you with the sensation that Shyamalan, without no impudence, has made fun of us again. Everything what we thought we knew about heroes and villains will not be worth anything while we pleasantly discover the secrets Unbreakable hides.</p></body></html>

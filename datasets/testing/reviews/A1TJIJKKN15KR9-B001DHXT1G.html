From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a complete story. Knocking out the whole origin chapter during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce never came off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk. He actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brain, which kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that's supposed to fuel the story. They're both mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors. This blew up in Marvel's face.</p></body></html>

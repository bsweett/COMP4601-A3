<meta name="summary" content=""The Last With Pierce""></head><body><p>"Die Another Day" was the 20th James Bond film and coincided with the franchise's 40th anniversary. The plot is pretty simple when compared to other Bond films: upon being released from captivity in North Korea Bond is determined to find out who was behind the kidnapping believing someone in the British government was behind the plot.<br /><br /> The film received very mixed reviews upon release, but became the highest-grossing Bond film at that point making over $431,000,000 at the box office.<br /><br /> I also must say Oscar-winner Halle Berry does a superb job playing the latest Bond girl.<br /><br /> This was also Pierce Brosnan's final outing as the British super agent before heart-throb (and my personal favorite Bond guy) Daniel Craig took over.</p></body></html>

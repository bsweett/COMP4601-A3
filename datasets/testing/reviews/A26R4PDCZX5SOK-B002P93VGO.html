Action, sci-fi, characters, scenses, wow! OK, I am a fan of the X-men series of movies (1 to 3). Now this installment gives the history of the key character Wolverine, from young kid just discovering his mutant skills to his time at war (from WWI to Viet Nam). This is a must watch movie; oh, Blu-Ray makes a big difference!! This is now on my favorite movie list!</p></body></html>

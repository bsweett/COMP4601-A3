<meta name="summary" content="The "Date Doctor's" Successes with Single Men, and Then the "Malpractice""></head><body><p>In this comedy, Hitch, the "date doctor", helps discouraged single men connect with women. He doesn't just advise them--he hangs around and monitors their performance. He begins by saying that women don't really mean it when they say that they are just into their careers, etc. He coaches men according to the principle that most communication is through body language. For instance, he tells men that, when a woman wants no kiss at the end of the date, she just takes out her keys and opens the door. But when she does want a goodnight kiss, she fiddles around with her keys. That is the signal for men to watch for.<br /><br />The "date doctor' succeeds with even seemingly-impossible cases. Albert, a taciturn, nerdy, heavyset, completely-bumbling fellow, gets dates with no less than Allegra, a popular beauty queen. Spectators can't believe it. In time, this makes it into the tabloids, provoking such a furious response in Albert that he trashes the store carrying the tabloids and gets himself arrested.<br /><br />Hitch's own girlfriend is Sara, who is highly cynical of men in general. She reacts with contempt when she learns of the very existence of a "date doctor", and then is furious with Hitch when she learns that he is in fact the one. She even throws things at him. Sara and the other women feel manipulated at the thought of their men's actions having been coached come-ons, not genuine romantic expressions.<br /><br />So Hitch's world seems to fall apart. The heartaches are unbearable. Can Hitch win back Sara? Will Albert get Allegra back? At the end of the movie, Hitch makes a statement that is very ironic in view of what he had been saying all along about men, dating, and women.</p></body></html>

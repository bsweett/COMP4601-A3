Having now seen it, I cannot for the life of me understand why. This is a romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor funny. Its pacing is interminable, its characters stupid, its script (adapted by Payne from Rex Pickett's novel) an interesting if failed attempt at... something. I could never quite figure out what.<br /><br />Plot: Jack (Wings' Thomas Haden Church) is about to get married, and his friend Miles (Paul Giamatti, recently of The Hawk Is Dying) takes him on the ultimate bachelor party: a week in Napa wine country. There, the two run into Miles' old friend Maya (The Haunting in Connecticut's Virginia Madsen) and her party-girl friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy). Jack, in the pursuit of getting Miles hooked up with the recently-divorced Maya, finds himself hooked up with Stephanie, which leads to a possible crisis in his future; does he want to marry the safe girlfriend at home, or drop everything and ride off into the sunset with Stephanie? And meanwhile, can Miles grow enough of a spine to finally woo Maya, who's obviously attracted to him? Oh, and I should add that all of these characters (save Jack, who could care less) know far more about wine than you or I ever will, and never let you forget it.<br /><br />Now, because it's been addressed in a couple of reviews I've read, I'll start off by saying that my problem with these characters is not that they are, in the main, hateful, depraved beasts. I generally love movies with hateful, depraved beasts as characters (viz., for example, The Sweet Smell of Success). No, my problem with these characters is one that literary types know as the golden rule: these characters, with one exception, do not change. And that one exception is not Miles; he's as spineless at the end of the movie as he is in the beginning. (I hope that's not a spoiler.) Unless he feels there's no chance he'll get caught, Miles takes no initiative unless he's prodded to the point where he has no other choice, from the first scene to the last. As Miles is the center of the movie, that he doesn't change is the cardinal sin.<br /><br />Not that the movie doesn't have other problems. The pacing is constantly undermined by the movie stopping to talk wine. Which, I guess, is fine if you're a wine snob. And yes, I do understand that the wine is being used as a metaphor. I'd find it hard not to; it's constant, heavy-handed, and just as much hammering you with the message as it would be if he just came out with it (as he did, for example, in Election; despite that, Election is by far the better movie. Relatively, of course). I'd say that that makes the movie only worthwhile for wine snobs, but this is obviously not the case, given the number of people who seem to enjoy it. Unless there are a whole lot more wine snobs in America than I think there are.<br /><br />I was planning on going on, but why bother? I'm sure you can tell where I'm going with this. Terrible movie, only worth watching because Virginia Madsen is, in general, the best thing about any movie she's in. Never has that been more the case than it is here. *</p></body></html>

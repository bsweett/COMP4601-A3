<meta name="summary" content="Tom back to what he does best"></head><body><p>I originally had the first Mission Impossible on video. I never actually understood what the heck was meant to be going on half the time, but I've watched it more over recent years, and understand it more now. Then, really, I'll happily admit I was watching it for the eye candy that was Mr Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Then everyone went haywire for him & his publicists. Splitting with Nicole Kidman, becoming more vocal about his love of Scientology, getting together with Katie Holmes, getting her to convert to Scientology, having a baby together, and then possibly, a marriage.<br /><br />But the latest Mission Impossible movie brings Tom back to what he does best - despite the fact that baby Suri was born just a few days before the premiere. There's stunning special effects, and Tom Cruise is back to the eye candy he was in the first movie. Don't even get me started on the long hair he had in the second movie. Not a good look.<br /><br />As an avid watcher of Alias, I finally realised why some aspects of Alias seemed familiar - there's a lot of similarities between Alias & the Mission Impossible movies. So it now seems appropriate that J.J. Abrams, the director of Alias (and Lost) directed this, taking the place of David Fincher and Joe Carnahan, who both dropped out of directing it. J.J. even manages to include a regular cast member of Alias in the party scene near the beginning of the film - keep your eyes open for Greg Grunberg (who played Eric Weiss for the first four seasons of Alias, and appeared briefly in one episode of Lost), who barely has one line to say.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this film was Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Simon Pegg. Ricky Gervais was originally supposed to be the computer geek, but got replaced by Simon Pegg, who should stick to what he does best. The role would have worked sooo much better with Ricky Gervais. And I just didn't like Phillip's character I guess. Wasn't he a nasty piece of work? And Michelle Monaghan (whose role in Constantine ended up on the cutting room floor), just seemed awfully dull throughout. Hardly the life of the party you'd expect Ethan's character to end up with. Plus, her and Keri Russell spend the best part of the movie tied to a chair, and Keri's character quickly gets disposed of. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is disappointingly not in the film that much, and doesn't get the chance to show off his gorgeous Irish accent, which is just a complete & utter tragedy.<br /><br />The 120 minutes of the film flew by quite fast for me, although I was very annoyed at the person across the aisle from me, who didn't stop eating for the entire duration!!! My friend & I were gobsmacked. She even left halfway through, and came back laden with more food. And I could see the light of her mobile phone getting looked at constantly. What could be so important that you couldn't switch off your mobile?! Are those Orange ads (which I don't really find funny) that uneffective?<br /><br />Occasionally, I felt like I was transported back to watching True Lies. There's even a bridge which looks remarkably like the one used in True Lies. And the idea of trying to keep a HUGE secret from your other half just doesn't work. It's been done before, in True Lies for example.<br /><br />I'm not sure if there will be a Mission Impossible 4, I did like the way they changed this one, so it wasn't like the previous 2, and I definitely think J.J. should direct another one, but with so much press surrounding Tommy Boy constantly, I don't know what could possibly happen. People go to his films just to slate him. But in my eyes, he did redeem himself a wee bit.</p></body></html>

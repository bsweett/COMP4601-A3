<meta name="summary" content="HUGE let-down...nowhere near as entertaining as Vol. 1"></head><body><p>It should be remembered that "Kill Bill" is essentially one movie split into two out of running length necessity; the (rather sensible) logic was that NO ONE would be able to take in a single feature that ran 248 minutes (just over 4 hours) in length.<br /><br />So what you have is a similar situation with "Kill Bill" as with Tarantino's last full-length film "Jackie Brown"; a good movie that (in my opinion) simply runs too darn long.<br /><br />"Kill Bill" peaked with "Volume 1", a movie that ran at just under two hours but seemed to go by much quicker, ham-fisted dialogue notwithstanding.  "Volume 2" is actually over two hours but seems to go by a third as fast.  "Volume 2" features much more introspection and less action than "Volume 1"...and as a result the plot just drags.  Introspection is well-used in a movie where there is a level of intrigue involved (see prior Tarantino examples "Reservoir Dogs" and even "Pulp Fiction" to a degree), but in an action spectacular like "Kill Bill" it does nothing but slow things down...BADLY.  The flashback sequences do this movie no favors (unlike "Volume 1", where the flashback involving Oren Ishii actually was one of that movie's true highlights), and the personalities of the remaining "deadly vipers" simply aren't as powerful as those slain (perhaps prematurely, in terms of plot pacing) in the first movie.<br /><br />That in itself could perhaps be forgiven...but the final act is such a tremendous letdown.  What should have been an epic battle between two warriors built up over nearly four hours of screentime as demigod-like figures is unforgiveably underdone.  David Carradine once infamously got on martial arts/action cinema icon Chuck Norris' bad side by failing to pull his punches in the filming of "Lone Wolf McQuade"; that and his history as Kwai Chang Caine would seem to warrant a more pronounced presence in the final confrontation.  But four hours of plot development (again with a reference to the length of the movies; I do apologize, but it does much to color my overall impression of both films as a whole) leads up to a fight sequence that lasts perhaps a minute, if even that?  That may be well and good for Sergio Leone pictures where the pull of a trigger takes but a second and ends a life equally as efficiently, but a good martial arts movie demands MORE and SUSTAINED ACTION (see "Enter The Dragon", "Return Of The Dragon" "Project A", and basically any Bruce Lee and/or Jackie Chan movie ever made for reference).  The Bride's fight with Copperhead and GoGo from "Volume 1" was far more exhilerating and much more worthy of a climactic ending than the inevitable showdown between Bill and The Bride (whose name, finally revealed, is one of the coolest things about this movie).<br /><br />Logically speaking, anyone who likes "Volume 1" should want to see "Volume 2".  However, while I can recommend buying "Volume 1", I can't in good faith say that my money was well-spent when I bought the concluding DVD.  I believe, knowing what I know now, I would have felt better with the story ending unresolved.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gondry loves the slight of hand visual effect"></head><body><p>With Michel Gondry you have a director who is interested in both making art that is visually captivating and smart. He does that continually in this film. I also have to say that because this is true of him he's the most unique director to ever have brought Charlie Kauffman's scripts to life. Since Kauffman was new to the feature film scene and so was Spike Jonze, a lot of people thought that it was Jonze who was the mastermind when he was actually just channeling the ability of Kauffman. Jonze does deserve credit for feeling that his script was important and worth doing though.  Gondry really knows how to work with Kauffman's scripts the best at this point and time.  "Human Nature" was good, but not great.  He's learned more this time around.  One thing that I noticed about the film was that he included music which had an vinyll hiss to it and sort of gave the feeling that the actions that were taking place on the screen were relived and dated which is exactly what was happening. Ingenius! I didn't notice the slight of hand visuals until the scene where Jim Carrey is remembering seeing Clementine in Barnes and Noble with Elijah Wood hiding and he walks away while the lights in the B&N turn off and he fluently walks out of the kitchen of his friends house and into their reality. The effects are like that in this movie for the most part.  Certainly there are many clues into what is happening and some of them are obvious such as the people who have no face because the memory has already been zapped.  When a memory is being zapped and the subtle things start to disappear it's because Gondry wants your focus to be on the emotional crisis at hand, but still cogniscent of the danger of the procedure. OK, I MUST STEP OUT OF MY REVIEW TO STATE TO ALL OF THE MAINSTREAM FILMGOERS THAT THIS FILM IS COMPLEX. To exemplify this, let me explain a scene. Jim Carrey's character is having his memories of his girlfriend erased in the comfort of his own home. While this procedure is taking place he is in a semi-sleeping state where he can't revive and stop it, but he visualizes the memories when they come up. He can occasionally hear the voices of the people working on the procedure and his subconscious can change his living of the memory as if he were awake while still being asleep. Multilayered, huh.? Anyway, the thing that I liked most about this film was trying figure out the relevance of the supporting characters in this film after it was finished.  I'm still thinking about it. As for Jim Carrey, he does a tremendous job and my friend who went with me didn't like him at all in any of his previous roles, serious, or funny.  She found a respect for him after watching this film. Kate Winslet was serviceable in a role that really takes a backseat in the scheme of things. When I say servicable it means she was great, it was just a serviceable role, but it was miraculous how she made the role obnoxious, difficult, profane, and yet, believably likable to Joel, the Jim Carrey character.  All of the other actors are good as well, but like I said, I'm still trying to find the significance of their very simple roles in contrast to the mind surgery of Joel.  I recommend this film wholeheartedly for people who like to watch intelligent films that aren't interested in the status quo and work outside of it, or morph it into what they want it to be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Rocky Balboa" is great!"></head><body><p>"Rocky Balboa" is great! This is the best sequel of the franchise. Sylvester Stallone has given us a movie that nearly comes close to the original "Rocky" (1976) and is the best sequel of the series. His directing and story and screenplay are excellent. The cast led by Stallone is excellent. The music by Bill Conti (who also did the original "Rocky" & the sequels) is excellent. The cinematography by J. Clark Mathis is great. The film editing by Sean Albertson is great. The casting by Diane Heery & Sheila Jaffe (both of them also did the casting to "Invincible" (2006) is great. The production design by Franco-Giacomo Carbone (who also did the production design to the upcoming "Bug" (2007) is great. The art direction by Michael Atwell & Jesse Rosenthal is great. The set decoration by Robert Greenfield (who also did the upcoming "Lucky You" (2007) is great. The costume design by Gretchen Patch is great. This is an interesting sports film that will keep you entertained.</p></body></html>

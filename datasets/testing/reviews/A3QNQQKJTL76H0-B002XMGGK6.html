<meta name="summary" content="Spoiler-free review: a watchable but utterly ridiculous drama"></head><body><p>Law Abiding Citizen is about a mild-mannered family man, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered in a home invasion. Shelton's lawyer, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), is a hotshot Philadelphia prosecutor with a 96% conviction rate. He tells Shelton that the evidence is too weak for a conviction and arranges a plea bargain with one of the killers, Clarence Darby, in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Rice keeps his winning streak and Darby, the real killer, walks after serving a light sentence while his partner is sentenced to death by lethal injection. Feeling betrayed by the broken and corrupt criminal justice system, Shelton becomes a man obsessed. He lets himself get captured and uses his brilliant mind to orchestrate a series of vengeful acts from his jail cell (sort of like the Joker in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight</a>) in order to teach the world a lesson about justice, a lesson taught in blood and dead bodies.<br /><br />Without giving away any major plot points not already divulged by the DVD box art or Amazon's editorial review (which has some wrong info), Law Abiding Citizen is just utterly ridiculous and strains credulity, even when one generously suspends disbelief. The problem is that it's written by Kurt Wimmer, who after the cult hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRRAE4">Equilibrium</a>, went on to make the super terrible and idiotic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGGE7C">Ultraviolet</a>. With flimsy character development and nonsensical plot devices, this far-fetched thriller handles story progression with the subtlety and grace of a sledgehammer. The setup within the first 5 minutes is an absurd and simple-minded way to justify the rest of the movie. Shelton, a brilliant inventor with a dozen patents, is at home with his daughter tinkering away when a loud and urgent pounding comes from the front door. He opens the door, two men rush in, bound and gag him and proceed to brutalize his wife. How can someone be so stupid? Being the talented engineer, you'd think he'd have some sort of advanced video security system, or at least think to look through the peephole before opening up the door. There is no explanation for the motivation behind the brutal and sadistic crime, how the investigation was bungled, or why Shelton was left alive. All this is glossed over.<br /><br />After the brief trial, 10 years go by in one camera pan, yet no one has visibly aged a day. Now Shelton sets his devious plans in motion, first exacting his revenge on the two killers, then on all those involved in the case. What doesn't follow is why Shelton devotes a decade to plotting this huge elaborate scheme, spending his entire life savings, setting up a shell company and convoluted finances when he could've simply offed the guilty parties over the years through covert means. Not enough development (actually, none) is shown on how this soft-spoken engineer becomes this obsessed madman bent on thinking he can change the system. There are enough plot holes and faults of logic for a herd of elephants to fall through. His evolution from peaceful family man with no history of violence to cold, calculating serial killer capable of gross mutilation, torture, and assassination is unconvincing. (You'll see two very graphic acts of murder committed by Shelton, one involving a power saw and another involving a spork). Instead, we just skip ahead 10 years and he's already a hardened sadist and unflinching murderer in his own right. The revelation at the end into his methods is ludicrous and too outlandish. It's all very Batman-ish. You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />Fans of MacGyver will get a kick out of seeing Bruce McGill (Jack) as Nick Rice's mentor, but otherwise, none of the characters except he and the young female research attorney are likable. This film ask us to make any emotional investment in the one-dimensional characters, so we don't care if they lived or died. I can only recommend this as a rental, or if you are particularly fond of Foxx, Butler, or director F. Gary Gray. It can be entertaining on a boring evening, but don't expect too much out of this far-fetched thriller. A thought-provoking drama, it is not. 3.5/5 at best.<br /><br />On a final note, this DVD gets points for sporting an environmentally-friendlier case design from Eco-box that uses less plastic. It's lighter and supposedly recyclable. Outside is a slip-on paper dust jacket.</p></body></html>

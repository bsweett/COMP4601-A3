So this was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Throughout "Get Smart", I couldn't help being reminded of the "Austin Powers" series.  How can you not?  Bumbling spy, bad guy asking for billions in ransom demand, etc.  This is nowhere as good as "Austin Powers", but there are some funny moments.<br /><br />Also a few days earlier I saw Jim Carrey's "Yes Man" in the theatre...and it was god-awful.  Really nothing much more than a chuckle in that.  This flick at least had some things going for it.  I don't think Steve Carell played it right...it was weird not having him do "the voice" from the original series.  That would have made it better for me.<br /><br />Pretty forgettable flick, but not bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I usually hate ultra-offensive films, but I liked this one"></head><body><p>I think the main reason I hate ultra-offensive films is the film makers usually lack the talent to make any jokes besides offensive ones.  I think Borat is different though.  Although offensive jokes run consistently thoughout the movie, Borat shows the capability to pull off other kinds of humor as well.  In one scene he's shown riding in a car to go off to America, and when the camera zooms out, we see that the car is actually being pulled by a horse and buggy.  Then there's a scene where Borat sings his country's national anthem at a rodeo and upsets the entire patriotic audience.  And all through the movie Borat's broken English alone is enough to make me chuckle.<br /><br />When Borat isn't ultra-offensive, it switches to being just plain silly.  Its like a combination of a Mel Brook's movie with MTV's Jackass.<br /><br />Like I said, I usually can't find a way to enjoy comedies that advertise themselves as low-brow and crude, but I must admit I found Borat's total disregard for political correctness to be very refreshing.  I'm not saying I hope to see more movies like it, but I thought it was something to see.</p></body></html>

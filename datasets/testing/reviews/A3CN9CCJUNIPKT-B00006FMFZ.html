Warning, warning!!***  Will the director have what it takes to rise above this pitfall?  You'd think that Sam Mendes, whose direction of "American Beauty" showed remarkable narrative and textural depth and admirably original ironies, would be one of the guys who could redeem themselves after such a palpably weak introduction.  However, this would-be arthouse crime thriller relies too heavily on its measured tempo and soft-edged presentation, but doesn't back it up in the end.  This is, we are clearly and unceasingly telegraphed, a Thinking Person's Crime Film, and as such falls readily into the category of melodrama.  Tom Hanks, ever likeable, plays (oooh!) a bad guy... sort of, but not quite.  A seasoned gunsel for the local Irish mob, Hanks finds himself a victim of his boss's own dirty laundry and, with his life ruined and in peril, he goes on the lam with his 12-year old son, forming a one-and-a-half-man army against the Mob.  This movie is well produced and engaging (and beautifully shot, by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall), but ultimately it's just another hollow glorification of gun culture, masquerading as a morality tale.  I enjoyed watching this film, but felt empty and unnourished as it slid slowly to a halt, and as soon as I started to think about it, even a bit resentful.  This is the sort of Boy Film where it's easier to kill a man's family than to fully construct them as realistic characters, and in which the logic of violence too easily overcomes the reality of emotion -- sort of like a movie version of that old Harry Chapin song, "Cat's In The Cradle," but with lots of guns and a "happy" ending where the son realizes what a mensch his gangster dad was.  Paul Newman is grave, charismatic and not very prominent as the Midwestern crime boss, while Jude Law is squandered in his role as a sadistic hitman.  However, somebody really oughtta cast the kid, Tyler Hoechlin, in some movie along with Leonard DiCaprio, either as a relative or as a younger version of Lennie... they have a very similar sleepy-eyed look.  Other than that, I didn't get much out of this film.</p></body></html>

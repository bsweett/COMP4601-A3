Gary Gray's "The Italian Job" (2003) is a glossy, pretty update of an earlier movie.  If "Ocean's Eleven" hadn't been exquisitely remade in 2001 by Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, and assorted other stars, "The Italian Job" might have been able to stand on its own two feet.  Unfortunately, it looks like a poor knock-off job where Mark Wahlberg unsuccessfully tries to be another Danny Ocean, but lacks the gravitas of either Clooney or the original Ocean, Frank Sinatra.<br /><br />One thing about this movie is undeniable, and that is that it looks great.  From the opening scenes of a clever heist in Venice to a double-cross on a chilly Alpine dam to a car chase through L.A. to the glorious lines of Charlize Theron's face, "The Italian Job" is one of the best-looking crime movies you'll ever see.  Unfortunately, beauty carries a movie only so far - "Under the Tuscan Sun" is another movie that looks uber-gorgeous, but nobody's going to eagerly await the 10th-anniversary edition of that DVD, are they?<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, who starts the film as the heir apparent to the role of leader of a gang of lovable thieves, now that former leader John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is stepping down.  Croker leads his team through the successful "Italian job," which is a clever heist involving swiping a huge safe from a Venetian mansion using explosives, scuba gear, and a very fast boat.<br /><br />But in a plot twist that the promotional ads gave away, the Italian Job goes bad when Steve (Ed Norton) double-crosses the team and leaves them for dead, swiping $35 million in gold ingots.  (As an aside, is "Steve" really the name you want for your villain?  If the filmmakers were trying to make a comic point here, perhaps using the blandness of Steve to point out the over-the-top names of many movie villains, they were a bit too subtle.  Instead, "Steve" comes off like a first-draft name that they simply forgot to revisit.)<br /><br />Some time later, Croker and team track down Steve in L.A. and plan for a caper that would both bring back the millions they lost to Steve as well as a certain measure of vengeance.  To do this, they need a safe-cracker, and wouldn't you know it, the late Mr. Bridger left a lovely daughter Stella (the aforementioned Ms. Theron), who is a safe-cracker who works for the police when she isn't racking up speeding tickets.  But where dear old dad "worked by instinct," Stella uses the best in modern technology to get the job done.  With that set-up, would you be surprised if there is a scene where Stella has to abandon her hi-tech gadgetry and crack a safe using nothing but her "instincts"?  If you would be surprised by such a plot development, "The Italian Job" is probably going to be one of your favorite movies.<br /><br />And this is ultimately where "Ocean's Eleven" sinks "The Italian Job."  Both movies cover essentially the same ground (planning an incredibly complex and witty heist), but "Ocean's Eleven" does this so much better.  Both films involve teams of lovable criminals, but while you can't criticize Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Seth Greene of "Italian Job," this ensemble can't hold a candle to "Ocean's Eleven's" "supporting cast" of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mack, Carl Reiner, and others.  I enjoy Ms. Theron's performance much more than Julia Roberts' turn in "Ocean's Eleven," but it must be said that as far as the female leads are concerned, there are no losers here.<br /><br />Both films also spend a lot of time focusing on the intricate planning that goes into a major caper, but again "Ocean's Eleven" has a caper that is rich with surprise, wit, and humor.  The climactic heist in "The Italian Job" builds to, of all things, a car chase.  Sure, it's an amazing car chase, but if your movie is focusing on wit and humor, relying on a car chase to pull off the climax is a signal that the writers have given up.<br /><br />And finally, as much as I enjoy Ed Norton as an actor, you have to admit that his villain, Steve, can't hold a candle to the ominous refinement brought to the screen by Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict in "Ocean's Eleven."  Garcia injects such slick venom into his scenes that otherwise throwaway lines like his "Terry" - "Danny" exchange with Clooney take on a whole new life.  Ed Norton is a wonderful actor, but Steve just ain't that much of a bad guy -- he's so unoriginal that he spends his ill-gotten gains on the prizes that his other fellow criminals planned to purchase.  Translation -- Steve is an empty box, and empty boxes do not great villains make.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm getting long-winded for a three-star review.  I must confess I had high expectations for "The Italian Job."  But at the end of the day, all Wahlberg and crew (with the exception of Charlize Theron) did was make me want to go watch a better crime movie.</p></body></html>

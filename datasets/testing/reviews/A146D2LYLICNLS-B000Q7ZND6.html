<meta name="summary" content="Some good CGI + Tilda Swinton=good. Rest of movie = mediocre"></head><body><p>I'll begin by saying that I know nothing about the Constantine comic book story, for the simple fact that I've never been into comic books. Most of the negative reviews here seem to be by those who say the movie does not follow the comic book story, so I'll take their word for it. But for someone like me, I have to judge this movie on its merits alone. And what about its merits? Well, I didn't think it was a complete disaster, but not among the better movies I've seen lately either.<br /><br />Whether Keanu Reeves did justice or not to the character of Constantine will be open to personal interpretation, again, mainly by those who know the comic book story. For the rest of us, it all depends on how much we like (or dislike) Keanu Reeves. If you didn't like him before, this movie won't change your mind about him, put it that way. In some areas he's as wooden as a 2x4, and yet in other areas he isn't. I've never quite figured out the mystery of Keanu Reeves. In any event, I thought he was adequate as Constantine. No, he won't win an Oscar for his performance, but this movie wasn't made to win any Oscars. Just one of the things to keep in mind as you enter the theater.<br /><br />One of the things this movie has going for it is the special effects. The scenes where Constantine travels to Hell are simply awesome, no doubt about it. The rest of the special effects are pretty much standard stuff. I also liked the way the movie has a nocturnal feel to it, with most shots of the city taking place at night, when the scary stuff usually happens in this world.<br /><br />In terms of other performances, I'll agree with other reviewers that Rachel Weisz does a nice job in her role. She's able to make us feel for her character and displays a depth not very common in that type of female role in other movies, where the main purpose is to just look pretty for the camera. But the real star has gotta be the ever-so-underrated and ever-so-underused Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. She isn't given very much screen time, but when she does come on screen, it's pure magic. Why this talented actress hasn't gotten bigger roles is beyond me (if you want to see a movie that fully allows her to show her talent, watch "Orlando" or "The Beach").<br /><br />"Constantine" does have its flaws though. For one, many parts of the script are cliched to death. Case in point, Constantine's geeky sidekick who ends up saving his a** and becomes a minor hero when Constantine runs out of bullets. Looks very familiar, huh? That's because it is, done hundreds of times before. The other problem I have with "Constantine" is that it tries too hard at times to replicate classic horror flicks such as "The Exorcist." A perfect example is at the beginning of the movie with the girl and the demon. As one is watching this, they are almost expecting the infamous pea soup to fly out of her mouth. I don't have a problem with paying homage to other movies, but this is overdone to the point of trying to copy it. Sorry, there is only ONE "The Exorcist."<br /><br />All in all, I would hesitantly recommend "Constantine." While not very memorable and quite disposable, it has its good points. Was I presented with an outstanding quality movie? No, I wasn't. But was I entertained for 2 hours? Yes, I was. Just put your brain on neutral, grab that popcorn, and remember to not take it too seriously.</p></body></html>

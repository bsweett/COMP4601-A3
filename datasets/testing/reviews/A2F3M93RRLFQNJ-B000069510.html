<meta name="summary" content="Standard zombie flick"></head><body><p>Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game:  the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background.  There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.<br /><br />With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.  The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better.  On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good.</p></body></html>

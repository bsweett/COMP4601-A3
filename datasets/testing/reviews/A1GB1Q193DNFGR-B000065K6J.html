Watching Teenagrs Die One by One Can Be Fun!"></head><body><p>James Wong IV's Final Destination is a kinetic highly explosive firecracker of a horror film that has overflowing intelligence to spare. Though even more implausiable than most other Dead Teenager Films (DTM)  including: I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (Ugh!), Jason Goes to  Hell: The Final Friday (Gag!), Bride of Chucky (Pinch me am I really  awake?) and Dangerous Minds (I've fallen and I can no longer watch! ).  Wong's poetically melancholic voyage regarding the teenage conception of  human mortality, the randomness of fate, and the human philosophical  pursuit of the existence of God has much more dramatic resonsence and  emotional impact than any other other traditional slasher film in the  Scream generation of horror films. Wong allows his characters to bloom into  real terrified people that have to deal with the possibility of death  during the age of presumed teenage invurneribility. There have been several  complaints  that Final Destination indulges on self-conscious campy humor  and the overuse of conventinal Slasher movie techniques. No offense to  horror movie junkies, but the Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street,  Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and Scream series have so ingrained  random teenage death into modern pop-culture that  audiences are so  conditioned to that presentation that anything similar is too convential or  petty for their viewing. As for the film's humor, it is needed to keep the  film's somber mood at bay. Get past your overdose of cinematic filth and  give this stellar movie a chance. The film is traditional in both its  pacing and conclusion, but the film's genuine interest in theology,  philosophy, and the unique design of fate transforms this movie into a  tremendously absorbing visit into the paranormal. Horror fans- If you do  not see this splendid gem in the theaters, definitely buy the DVD or  videocassete version when it becomes available.</p></body></html>

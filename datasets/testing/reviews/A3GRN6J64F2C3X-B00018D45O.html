<meta name="summary" content="You've got to admit that chainsaws work pretty well in horror movies"></head><body><p>Slick, watchable fun... perfect for when you don't want to slog through a complicated plot but just want some scary scenes and gruesome villains.  The opening and closing sequences, which make the movie feel like one of those "true crime" shows that endlessly play on the A&E channel, are also effective.<br /><br />But it's probably the gore you'll remember most about this.  The other reviewers are right: whatever your opinion regarding how this movie compares to the original artistically and creatively, this remake is inarguably MUCH gorier than its predecessor.  Having said that, however, I still think the film pulls its punches on a few occasions, probably to secure its "R" rating and avoid the dreaded, unmarketable "NC-17".  If you think today's horror movies rely too much on gore, you'll likely appreciate the occasional restraint here.  Myself, I think if you're paying to see a movie called "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", you know what you're signing on for and don't need to be protected.  But I have to admit that, even with the filmmakers' occasional squeamishness, this certainly is no Disney movie and, as a whole, it does deliver the goods.<br /><br />And having Jessica Biel running around in it ain't bad, either.</p></body></html>

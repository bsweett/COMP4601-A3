The lighting, the sets, the location, the clothes, every single detail is completely appropriate to the era (1931). The cast is a flawless blend of British and American actors, all of whom turn in beautifully controlled performances. It is a film completely devoid of false sentiment, even, in an odd way, of excessive violence. The climactic scene is done in an almost balletic silence, with only one spoken line. Scene after scene is framed and lit in a fashion that evokes Edward Hopper paintings. This is, above all else, a story about fathers and sons; actual father and sons, surrogate fathers and sons. Paul Newman is wonderful as the conflicted father of a reprobate son (played with great fidelity by British actor David Craig), torn between his love of Michael Sullivan, his son in spirit, and Connor, his son in fact.<p>Hanks offers a fine, controlled portrayal of a man betrayed by the father figure (Newman) to whom he believes he owes everything. And young Tyler Hoechlin is equally wonderful as Michael Junior. Jude Law, the ultimate chameleon performer, turns in a creepily effective performance as the photographer/killer hired to wipe out Hanks.<p>There are moments of great humor (Hanks teaching his twelve-year-old son to drive) and others of great joie de vivre (a Gaelic dance sequence at the wake that opens the film), and moments of classic fraternity--young Michael Jr. reading in bed by flashlight, being questioned, to his annoyance, by his younger brother.<p>There is so much to commend this film: the exquisite lighting, the tight editing, the perfect soundtrack, the casting, the directing. In short, everything. Don't miss this. Sam Mendes seems to be a young man who gets it right every time.<br />Most highly recommended.</p></body></html>

This movie is based on a true story about a high school football team in Odessa, Texas in 1988 that chronicles one important season in the lives of the players, their coach, and the rest of the people in the town. Billy Bob Thornton (who recently seen as Davy Crockett in "The Alamo" (2004) and also starred as Karl Childers in his directorial debut "Sling Blade" (1996) plays Coach Gary Gaines, the high school football team's coach. Derek Luke (who played Antwone Fisher in "Antwone Fisher" (2002) plays Jimmy "Boobie" Miles, the star player and tailback for the team. Jay Hernandez (who recently starred as Keith Perez in "Ladder 49" (2004) plays Brian Chavez, the fullback for the team. Lucas Black (who also starred with Billy Bob Thornton as Frank Wheatley in Thornton's directorial debut "Sling Blade" (1996), plays Mike Winchell, the team's quarterback. Garrett Hedlund (who recently starred in "Troy" (2004) as Don Billingsley, the team's linebacker. Lee Thompson Young as Chris Comer, the team's third string tailback. And in his film debut, Tim McGraw, as Charles Billingsley, Don's father and former high-school football player. The cast is excellent.

Hedlund gives an superb performance as Don Billingsley, and it also is one of the best performances of his career, thus far.

Tim McGraw, making his film debut, as Charles Billingsley, gives an mind-blowing performance, and it also is one of the best performances of any actor this year, even if he is a country singer, it proves that he is an excellent actor. All of the actors give Oscar-worthy performances, especially, Thornton, McGraw, Luke, and Black. This is an excellent sports movie, that is one of the best sport movies of its kind and it is one of the year's best. The directing by Peter Burg (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is superb and excellent. This is his best movie he's directed, thus far. He also directed last year's hit "The Rundown" (2003), which starred The Rock. The screenplay by David Aaron Cohen (who also wrote the screenplay to "The Devil's Own" (1997) & Peter Burg, based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, who is, weirdly enough, Burg's 2nd cousin, is excellent. The music by Explosions In The Sky is excellent. The cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler (who also did the cinematography to Berg's hit "The Rundown" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Colby Parker Jr. & David Rosenbloom (who recently film edited "The Last Shot" (2004). He also film edited "The Recruit" (2003), "Hart's War" (2002), "Pay It Forward" (2000), "Frequency" (2000), "The Insider" (1999), "Deep Impact" (1998), "The Peacemaker" (1997) & "Primal Fear" (1996) is excellent. The casting by Janet Hirshenson & Jane Jenkins is excellent. The production design by Sharon Seymour (who production designed "Bad Santa" (2003) which also starred Billy Bob Thornton, is excellent. The costume design by Susan Matheson is excellent. The art direction by Peter Borck (who recently art directed "Breakin' All The Rules" (2004). He also art directed "Bad Santa" (2003) is excellent. The set decoration by Carla Curry (who recently set decorated "The Alamo" (2004). She also art decorated the upcoming "Walk The Line" (2005) & "The Wendell Baker Story" (2004) is excellent. The football stunts coordinated by Allan Graf is excellent. This is superb, excellent, riveting, touching, powerful, and mesmerizing. Go see it for yourself, if you want to.</p></body></html>

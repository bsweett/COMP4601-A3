(The actor playing the role of a Palestinian gunman pacing onto the balcony of the Israeli compound in exact sequence with the infamous real life footage was utterly chilling.) My lack of total and complete admiration for this film comes from the fact that the quality of the plot was drastically uneven, there was not enough story to match its long run-time, and I could not escape the suspicion that much of what I was watching onscreen was simply a fiction, not based on actual events as claimed. Munich ran out of gas too early and never quite found its message, so it tried unsuccessfully to be about many things. What Munich did nicely was raise the question of when justice mutates into revenge, and when preventative counter-attacks to prevent future terrorism themselves become terrorism. As a movie it was better than most of what gets made in American cinema today but it was also disappointing given what it could have been with so much talent behind it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Entertaining Film Which Does Not Take Its Self Too Seriously!"></head><body><p>Ghost Rider has one very profound line: "Look into my eyes and FEEL the pain you have caused others!" It was cathartic to see violent criminals being forced to feel the pain others experienced because of their brutal and selfish actions! Something I personally believe we will all face in the afterlife when we experience our own life review! But I digress...<br /><br />This film did not take its self too seriously, nor was the violence gruesome, or excessive. It clearly shows the  power of good versus evil in a new and refreshing way.  But is still edgy enough so not to be boring.<br /><br />It had plenty of occult symbolism,  even touching on Faust! In other words it had something for everyone - older children, teens and adults! If you like a movie where you can turn off the critical thinking part of your brain - than this refreshingly entertaining fantasy film is for you!</p></body></html>

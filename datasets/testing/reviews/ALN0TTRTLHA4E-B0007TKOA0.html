<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious"></head><body><p>In essence this is a film in which one of the characters learns that " he would not be riding through Paris in a sports car with the wind in his hair." The character is one who has written a novel that he hoped to publish and turn his life around. Instead he now has to retreat from fantasy and to look at his life and start to rebuild it getting a job and trying to enter a relationship. Perhaps more importantly he has to cope with his ordinariness.<br /><br />The action of the film takes place mainly during a week when the aspiring writer takes a university buddy on a week trip to a wine growing area. The author's friend is a former soapy star whose career has been declining probably and his main work is doing voice-overs. Both characters are unattractive being adolescents who have not made the transaction to adulthood. One steals a large sum of money from his alcoholic mother to finance the trip and the other cheats on his fiancee in a way that is almost pathological.<br /><br />After hearing a summary of the plot one would think that the film is a grim affair which might have a week season in one or two art-house cinemas. In fact the film has been one of the most successful low budget films in years. The reason for that is despite the repellent nature of the characters it is hilarious. Each scene is a minor masterpiece either comic in itself or part of the gradual development of the character study of both of the participants.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most bizarre things about the film is that you feel drawn to the two protagonists. Despite the fact that one is a brilliantly drawn pompous wine snob and the other is both superficial and not bright, one cheers for them. Some of the scenes are classics of comedy. The first wine tasting, the preparation for the night out, the later visit to the commercial winery, and the attempt to recover the actor's wallet.<br /><br />It is one of the best films and years and after seeing it one can never attend a wine tasting again without bursting into laughter.</p></body></html>

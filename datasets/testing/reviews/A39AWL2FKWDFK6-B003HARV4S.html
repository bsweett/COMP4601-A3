<meta name="summary" content="The Illusionist is magical"></head><body><p>Neil Burger does an outstanding job in writing and directing an engrossing, moody period piece taking place in turn of the 20th century Vienna.  The movie is filmed in the picturesque baroque settings of the Czech Republic.<br /><br />Edward Norton, a talented young actor who has compiled an impressive resume of excellent cinematic performances plays Eisenheim a highly skillful illusionist.  The lowly son of a cabinetmaker Norton was the childhood sweetheart of the aristocratic Duchess Sophie.  He was banished to quash this tabooed relationship.<br /><br />Fifteen years later he triumphantly returns to Vienna as a well respected magician.  His talents come to the attention of Chief Inspector Uhl played by the terrific Paul Giamatti in a role that might finally garner him a well deserved Oscar.  Uhl, himself an amateur magician is checking Norton out in anticipation of the attendance of Crown Prince Leopold to a performance.  The sinister and truculent crown prince played nicely by Rufus Sewell is ironically betrothed to Norton's old flame Sophie.<br /><br />When Norton and Sophie played by Jessica Biel reunite the sparks again begin to fly and they resume a relationship.  Giamatti, under the influence of the crown prince, has been following Sophie and reports back to him of their affair.<br /><br />Sewell in a murderous, jealous rage manhandles Biel and she is found the next day in the woods dead, a result of blood loss from a sword slash.  Leopold is implicated but Giamatti throws another man in jail for the crime, even though he has suspicions about the crown prince.<br /><br />Eisenheim is convinced that Leopold killed his beloved Sophie and changes his act and now begins to bring spirits back from the dead.  Everything seems cut and dry but is all as it seems?<br /><br />Overall the film is certainly one of the best to come along this season.  It concludes with a twist almost of the magnitude of the incredibly great "The Usual Suspects".</p></body></html>

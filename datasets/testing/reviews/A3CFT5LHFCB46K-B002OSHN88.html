Since I hadn't seen the movie before (Except for clips on the AFI's broadcast of the most thrilling movies), some might call this a mistake. I call it a good, though not wise, investment. <p>Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) goes to Post World War II Vienna to visit his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). After he arrives, however, he finds that Harry had been killed a few days before. Holly investigates into Harry's death, only to find himself entrapped in murder, racketeering and visits of friends from beyond the grave. He also finds that he has fallen in love with Lime's ex-girl Anna (Alida Valli). <p>The Third Man is a rare perfect marriage of performances, cinematography and music. Cotten is excellent in his role as Martins, while the rest of the supporting cast (Especially Valli as Lime's ex-girlfriend and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway) are just as good. The Oscar winning cinematography of Robert Krasker is superb in the way it brings to life the darkness of Vienna. It brings a sense of depth and realism to the movie. A viewer feels like putting their hand on screen and touching the water soaked walls. Could a similar feeling have been reproduced if the whole movie was filmed on soundstages? But what the movie is probably best known for is Anton Karas's Zither score. The themes of it are difficult to explain. Sometimes the music is happy and cheerful and other times we feel a sense of sorrow. Some thought of it as a mistake that the music of the entire movie should be done with one instrument. Today, it's unthinkable without it.<p>Criterion has always been known for their quality and they don't disappoint with The Third Man. The picture has been digitally restored to where it looks as new as anything being made today. It might possibly be newer. The sound is perfectly clear. In fact you'll be adjusting the volume to lower the sound. The supplements are also excellent. First, there is a restoration demonstration, which will make one appreciate much more how much care Criterion put into this movie. Then there is vintage newsreel footage of the Vienna Sewer Police as they perform their duties in the film's famous sewer location and footage of Anton Karas performing &quot;The Third Man theme&quot; at a club (Reportedly in the same way he was found by director Carol Reed). There are production notes that cover many aspects of filming the movie and have some interesting trivia. There is also an interview with director Peter Bogdanovich and an alternate opening voice over for the American release. The main extra highlights though are two radio broadcasts: Orson Welle's presenting &quot;A Ticket to Tangiers&quot; from The Lives of Harry Lime and a radio presentation of The Third Man. <p>Criterion has overall made an excellent DVD and should be applauded for it. Buy it, watch it, cherish it and listen to Welles' famous speech: <p>&quot;In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.&quot;</p></body></html>

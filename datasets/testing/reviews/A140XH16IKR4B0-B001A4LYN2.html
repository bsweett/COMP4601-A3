The musical score -- an impressionistic mix of half-musical screeches and mechanical noises -- was an overpowering presence throughout the film. So much so that its occasional absence was jarring and unnerving. "There Will Be Blood" features a tour de force performance by Daniel Day Lewis as the monomaniacal oilman Daniel Plainview -- a man whose singleness of vision matches his surname. Indeed, Plainview has but one aim -- to become wealthy beyond imagining, to work devilishly hard to get there and to let absolutely nothing get in the way of his dream. Plainview is the epitome of the American character -- driven, relentless, brutal and dismissive of societal niceties, except insofar as they help him achieve his aims. His chief antagonist is Eli Sunday, the preacher son of a poor farmer. Sunday and Plainview each seek their own means to riches, and quickly become locked in a vicious pas-de-deux. Sunday needs Plainview to finance his church; Plainview needs Sunday's approbation to persuade his congregation to cooperate in his ventures. The tension between these two men becomes so overwhelming at times that I started to wonder whether there was an allegorical element going on -- religion v business -- or perhaps a commentary about the unholy alliance between commerce and the Cross in American culture.<br /><br />But TWBB is extraordinary on so many levels. The acting is superb. DDL molds his character into a natural force. His growling voice, perpetually sweaty face and cold eyes convey menace even when expressing the most banal of sentiments. The writing is phenomenal; the recreation of the turn-of-the-century Southwest is more than a little convincing. The depiction of the early, grueling methods of extracting oil from the ground is fascinating. The plotting never gives away the story arc, as periods of intensity and frenetic action are juxtaposed unpredictably against periods of reflection and preternatural quiet. There are many star performance in the film, but aside from DDL, kudos go to Dillon Freasier as Plainview's young, laconic son, H.W. "There Will Be Blood" is a masterpiece, an original, and tremendous ride through one man's personal obsession to succeed.</p></body></html>

This film was like nothing I have ever seen on the big screen before!<br /><br />I wish to draw attention to the fact for those who do not know that Apollo Command module footage was taken under actual zero gravity conditions aboard an aircraft flying parabolic arcs, and if I am not getting my films mixed up, the space suits were actually ventilated and extremely realistic.<br /><br />Some of the details of the Launcher Umbilical Tower were wrong (like the motions of the swing arms) but visually very exciting. This film left no stone unturned to make it the most exciting movie of the space age. Ron Howard really goes to great lengths to do really fine work!</p></body></html>

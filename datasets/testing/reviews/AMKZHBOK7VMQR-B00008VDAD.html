Even though the actual outcome is well known, the movie provides dramatic tension as the Apollo 13 crew and the people at mission control work their way through a most remarkable life threatening situation. The cast is outstanding, with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise all giving wonderful performances. For me Ed Harris as Mission Control director Gene Kranz just about steals the movie. He is just incredibly good in this role , possibly his finest hour on screen.<br /><br />It is easy to take the technical aspects of this film for granted because they are so realistic and presented in almost documentary form but the effects and the atmosphere aboard the space capsule and lunar landing craft are extraordinary.<br /><br />This is definitely a film worth owning and one I pull off the shelf now and then and always enjoy viewing.</p></body></html>

What if computers controlled the world? Well, in 1984, a man named Kyle Reese and a terminator were sent to kill the mother of the rebel leader of the future. Sarah Connor supposedly gives birth to the leader of human resistance to the machines and his name is John Connor. The man was sent to protect her and the machine was sent to  change the course of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the ultimate mechanism that has no feeling and no heart! How frosty! It's the fight of a lifetime between the man and the machine, but unfortunately, the man loses. After many deaths fulfilled by the terminator, Sarah Connor crushes it. I was so perturbed with the extermination of Arnold, I turned it off right then. Arnold should never die in a movie. Good thing Hollywood made the best sequel to have ever hit the big screen to explain themselves. Shame on them!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""One Of The Best Films Of 2003""></head><body><p>The problem with "The Matrix" is that it only told the story but didn't embrace and explain it as the second movie has done, it told me about Zion but didn't explain the origins of Zion. I didn't get what I wanted to help me makes sense of this world in the first one, but in the "Matrix Reloaded" I am shown Zion's population, more information about the birth of the matrix and I witness Neo's (Keanu Reeves) complete powers.<br /><br />*Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.<br /><br />"The Matrix", written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, inspired so much philosophy and so many action films that it's all "The Matrix Reloaded" can do to stay ahead of its followers. *This film is a skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: Heroes, villains, special effects and stunts, chases, explosions and romance.<br /><br />****SPOILERS AHEAD****<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo must decide how he can save Trinity (Carrie Ann-Moss) from a dark fate in his dreams.<br /><br />Three great scenes in `The Matrix Reloaded' surpass "The Matrix." The first is when Neo is fighting one hundred Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving) This scene is the most beautiful fight scene, I have ever seen in my life. Unlike most fight scenes, this one makes sense. Agent Smith tells Neo when he destroyed him, his body parts were scattered and became the Matrix. So now he can move in and out of any program in the Matrix.<br /><br />The second comes when Morpheus returns to Zion and addresses an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in "Metropolis." After his speech, the citizens dance to a wonderful soundtrack, which is shown with scenes of Neo and Trinity making love. Maybe those are there real bodies having sex, although I'm not sure.<br /><br />*The third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with beautiful choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. This scene is a 14 minute fun ride, although I might wonder, if such deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it?<br /><br />I recognize two philosophies in this movie. First, I feel that this is what might happen to humankind if they let technology develop unchecked. The second philosophy is that love and hope will conquer all.<br /><br />The film ends with a "To Be Concluded" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in November. I loved this film and I recommend it to anyone. I give this film a 15 out of 10.<br /><br />* NOTE: two of These sentences are from Roger Ebert's review of Matrix Reloaded.</p></body></html>

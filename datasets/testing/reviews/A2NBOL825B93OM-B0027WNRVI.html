<meta name="summary" content="The Sommers' tradiction"></head><body><p>Have you ever watched "The mummy"? If so, and if you liked it, there's a good chance you'll probably going to enjoy "Van Helsing". Director Stephen Sommers once again used his proven formula to make a blockbuster movie: a likeable male character, a resourceful heroine, funny moments provided by the supporting characters, lots of visual effects, impressive monsters, winged ghouls, the works. <p>Sommers was very intelligent: he knew that a movie like this was going to be burdened by all the endless clich&eacute;s used in previous monster movies, made since the beginning of cinema history. Count Dracula, the Frankesntein monster and werewolves (among others) were portrayed in countless movies; some of them were serious, some of them were spoofs, some of them were good, most of them were terrible. <p>So, what did he do? He pays homage to all those movies. The very first scene is a nod of the head to early horror movies (Lon Chaney comes instantly to mind). This scene is filmed in black-and-white, and features all those constant elements of ancient movie-times: close-ups of the faces of the angry villagers, the huge monster carrying a human being in his arms, a terrible fire in the wind-mill, and more. Sommers also set a sarcastic tone to "Van Helsing" by featuring scenes with more than a close resemblance to other action movies, most notoriouly "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "Mission: Impossible" (this is very funny), "Sleepy Hollow", "The name of the rose", and, obviously, Coppola's "Dracula" and Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein". <p>That is to say: Sommers wrote his screenplay in an intelligent way. He shows the viewer his intention since the first shots. The movie is greatly helped by the beautiful wintry landscape. The visual effects are carefully done, and the animated monsters interact with live characters in a believable way. I only wanted to remind the viewers that this is a work of fiction; in fact, Van Helsing is a fictional character, and vampire, frankenstein and werewolves legends are fictional too. I won't understand someone complaining that he didn't know what this movie was about, that he went to the theater expecting a movie like "The pianist" for example. "Van Helsing" is what it is, and it's good at that. <p>Hugh Jackman is a good actor, and shows it once again. But I think that he could have played his Van Helsing a little bit more loosely; the problem is that he would have looked too much like Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell in "The mummy". Kate Beckinsale is very beautiful in her dark looks, but she's still unconvincing as a romanian Lara Croft-like maiden. The touch of genious is Count Dracula: Richard Roxburgh (from "Moulin Rouge") is almost unrecognizable in his Bono-looks, an extravagant, sometimes pathetic creature. I almost forgot to say, the "romanian" accent was tiresome.<p>If I had to compare "Van Helsing" to "The mummy", I would have to say that "The mummy" is better: the settings, the characters and the story. But "Van Helsing" is not that far behind. It's one of those movies that start slow, but then picks-up the pace and completely grabs the viewer. <p>Anyway, a very good entertainment. For those who know how to appreciate it.<p>Grade 8.0/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Travel through time all over again"></head><body><p>This is a great set that collects all three "Back to the Future" movies for an affordable price. Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly, a slacker high school kid who gets into wacky adventures with his inventor friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). The first movie is a trip to the past, where Marty meets his parents and interrupts their courtship, thereby endangering his own existence. In the second film, a trip to the future wreaks havoc on the present, and Marty must jump to the past again to set things right. The final movie has Marty travelling to the old west to rescue Doc before he's gunned down by a gang of bandits. Overall, when you watch the three movies together, there is a strong sense of character development and continuity. Lots of little details and flourishes make the time travel aspects consistent unto themselves and make the world believable. Traditionally the second and third movies haven't faired as well critically, but in hindsight all three are tremendous fun and instant classics.<br /><br />A lot of extras on this set, as the producers aren't afraid to dig into the movie's development, discuss time travel, and generally have a good time. There are deleted scenes, special effects featurettes, and the infamous making-of documentary that aired in the 90s. A very strong package.<br /><br />When Universal first released this set, there was a framing error with the second and third movies. I don't know if the disc exchange is still effective, but as of now you should be able to pick up a new copy and be confident that it's a corrected edition. Look for a 'V2' on the fine print of the second and third movie discs to be sure.<br /><br />Back to the Future ranks up there with the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Godfather of 'Holy Grail' trilogies. Get it.</p></body></html>

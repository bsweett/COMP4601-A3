<meta name="summary" content="beautiful cinematography - plot a bit of a mess"></head><body><p>My actual review is 3 stars - but i would like to balance out some of the unjustifiable 1 and 2 star ratings. This is nowhere near De Palma's best film.. Compare it to 'Dressed to kill' for example (one of the great masterpieces of cinema) - both films are visually stunning - but 'Dressed to kill' is not nearly as plot heavy it is so natural in its combination of images and sound.. by this very nature we are able to probe the conciousness of the characters in a way that is seldom done in film - 'Black Dahlia' , it is a shame to say, cannot live up to the enormity of the plot - and becomes a victim to it.. Such a shame as it is probably the most beautifuly photographed film of the year.. the interiors, the lighting and shadows just scream with beauty.. the acting, surprisingly is pretty good too.. It is a shame that this is all wasted by a story line that just tries too hard to be interesting.. A more natural approach would have made this a fine film..<br /><br />P.s. watch 'dressed to kill'</p></body></html>

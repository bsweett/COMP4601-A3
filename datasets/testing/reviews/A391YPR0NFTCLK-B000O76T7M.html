This is by no means a good film but it is entertaining anf fun, even though it does not make alot of sense at times. I wish it could have been better or even have an R rating. But this is what we got so just enjoy it. Also I know there is a 2-Disc Collector's Edition coming I just don't know when, but wait for an announcment but it will proabably be here by the end of summer or fall...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rise of The Machines"></head><body><p>I enjoyed watching the 3rd installment in the terminator series. This movie had a lot of action and was quick paced. As far as sequels go, this sequel is great as it takes the storyline to the next step.... which is that the machines do start a nuclear holocaust no matter how hard John & Sarah Connor attempted to prevent Judgment Day from occurring in the past.<br /><br />I can only speculate that a "Terminator 4" may possibly be made in the future in order to see the aftermath of the nuclear fallout and how John Connor actually leads the remaining human population in an uprising against the machines that have taken over the world. So, let's hope "Terminator 4" is made into a movie to complete the story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why sequels are not always a good idea"></head><body><p>There is a line in this movie in which the Arnie Terminator says &quot;It is time.&quot;  I so wish that someone would have told the writers and director that BEFORE this movie came out.  That is to say, it would have been nice if they had been notified that the TERMINATOR story had run its course.<p>Unfortunately, that didn't happen, and T3 was made.  This movie should be used as &quot;Exhibit A&quot; as to what happens when a good idea is recycled one too many times.  Instead of continuing w/the excellent story of 1 &amp; 2, this one comes off as generic, tired and rather silly.<p>One of the problems lies in the fact that the T-1000 from T2 didn't give the writers anywhere to &quot;go&quot; to make the Terminator in this one even more impressive.  So, what they come up with are some absurdly far-fetched powers that don't coincide very well with logic.<p>The lone bright spot of this movie is Kristanna Loken.  She is most assuredly cast perfectly as the new Terminator.  She is  drop-dead gorgeous, has a fantastic athletic body and she also has that &quot;don't mess with me&quot; look.  Seeing her come thru the time portal naked might just be worth the price of renting this movie - but the storyline certainly isn't.<p>It is sad that this movie was so bad, as T1 was a classic and T2 was even better.  All T3 does is throw in a lot of ad hoc details that un-do everything that T2 did.  Apparently the film-makers thought that the ending was going to be a big &quot;surprise.&quot;  Anyone who half paid attention to the movie could predict what would happen 1/3 of the way in.  <p> Sadly, the theme of the movie is nearly as predictable as how bad it looked like it was going to be.  For all TERMINATOR fans out there, I would admonish you to watch T1 &amp; T2 over and over again, but skip this one entirely.</p></body></html>

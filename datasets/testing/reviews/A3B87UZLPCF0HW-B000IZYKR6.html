<meta name="summary" content="My goodness...what a pleasant masterpiece"></head><body><p>This was downright nail biting, anger causing, and made Dateline NBC (catching pediphiles) something that could turn a freakish child molestor into a slobbering idiot.<br />We have Jeff, a photo taking and participant in the loving of little girls. Then we have Haley---she is 14 years old and starts chatting online with Jeff about attraction, photo shots and plain sexual attraction.<br />They get together at Jeff's house (where most of the movie is shot) to begin this cat and mouse, "who can get out of his house alive, with sexual organs still intact."<br />Actually this is Jeff's worst nightmare....Haley wants retribution for a young girl who came up murdered. She believes Jeff was the culprit, or as we find out, part of the duo in the death of this young girl.<br />Haley through the movie manipulates, psuedo tortures and degrades Jeff to the point where he is a blubbering idiot.  Haley's objective....she wants Jeff to hang himself from the roof of his house in front of his former girlfriend and the world, leaving behind all sorts of twisted videos/pics and such, to let the police and the world find out what kind of man he actually was-----a thought in closing---maybe Jeff wasn't that bad???? Maybe Haley should have considered not being Judge, Jury and Executioner---she was one scarey little 14 year old girl throughout the flick.</p></body></html>

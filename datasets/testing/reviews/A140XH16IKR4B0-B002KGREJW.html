But something is missing, making the movie less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The story concerns Olive Hoover, a pudgy, bespectacled 10-year old who dreams of being a beauty queen. She has no chance in the world until the winner of a contest (in which Olive placed second) loses her crown. Suddenly, Olive has a shot at the Little Miss Sunshine crown - if only her dysfunctional family can get its act together and help her get to the contest!<br /><br />LMS is another in a long line of "funny" movies about dysfunctional families. But this one inexpertly negotiates the fine line between crazy people being funny and crazy people being weird, mean or dangerous. Grandpa is a porn-addicted coker. Uncle tried slit his wrists - a very unfunny way to do oneself in. Brother is a Nietzsche freak who hates everyone and has taken a vow of silence. Dad is desperate to sell his pathetic self-help regimen. Only Mom is half-way sane, though how she keeps up with this gang of misfits is anyone's guess. In the hands of an accomplished writer, this might have worked, as it did every week for the writers of "Malcolm in the Middle." But with LMS I found myself alternately horrified for or horrified by the cruelty and pathetic weirdness of this bunch.<br /><br />I also found that the movie misfired in its attempt to satirize pre-pubescent beauty pageants. In post-Jon Benet America, the sight of people dressing their young daughters as sexy starlets is more than a little creepy.<br /><br />There was a very human and very funny movie lurking inside LMS. Maybe a different cast or a different set of writers could have set it free. As it was, I experienced it (and I expect that this is a minority view) as a rarely funny cringe-fest.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="As good as any of the "Potter" movies probably"></head><body><p>Like all of the other movies this one came so long after the book that I can't remember a lot of details but the adaptation seems as "good" as any to me. It is, after all, a darker toned story that still managed to get details right in spite of being heavily edited down from book form. "Goblet of Fire" seemed to have more color in it if my memory is right, this one is dark and depressing colorwise.<br /><br />The "extras" disc is pretty much a waste of time with Tonks tour of the studio being kind of silly, not telling a person much, the editing section was the usual stuff too.<br /><br />I'm waiting for the next movie now.</p></body></html>

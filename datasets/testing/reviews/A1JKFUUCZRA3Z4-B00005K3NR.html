<meta name="summary" content="The consequences of mental abuse and tunnel vision"></head><body><p>Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a teen who's being mentally abused by her mother (Piper Laurie) and by the popular kids at high school.  When Carrie gets invited to the prom under pretense and has a cruel prank played on her, the abuse becomes too much for her to bear.  Her anger reaches a point where she can no longer distinguish between good and evil and instead, just sees everyone as evil and needing to be punished.  Her extreme tunnel vision proves to be deadly.<br /><br />Carrie's mom also suffers from extreme tunnel vision and the results are deadly, too.  Like Carrie, a specific event  angered  her so much that she can no longer distinguish between good and evil and instead,  sees everyone as evil and needing to be punished.  And unfortunately,  at the end of this movie, this becomes a case of like mother, like daughter (sort of).<br /><br />Both Spacek and Laurie are compelling to watch.  Spacek plays her role as mostly sympathetic, but towards the end, becomes truly scary.  Laurie plays her role as mostly scary, but with sympathetic moments, too.<br />The movie ends with a scene that's meant to shock, but I anticipated it, so it didn't shock me.<br />Overall, though, I thought this was a compelling story about the consequences of mental abuse and tunnel vision.</p></body></html>

Singer did not screw it up so it is passable..but I hope he does not stay for the next film.<br /><br /> The film is well directed visually and in terms of pacing. The film's use of color is generally very poor. Superman's cape does not appear to be red nor do his boots. Even when the sun is shining, the film appears to be taking place at night. I thought most of the cast were underplaying something fierce and consequently very few registered. Routh is okay as Superman but is basically doing a Christopher Reeve impersonation but that is fine. One can live with him. It is hoped that the next film allows him to have more dialogue. It seems to me that everyone is babbling away around him while he does monosyllables. Spacey is a very slight improvement over Hackman PLAYING Lex Luther leaning more towards Lyle Talbot's take on the character but he still comes across as a mere evil real estate salesman. Everyone else is disposable with the odd exception of James Marsden as Lois Lane's unmarried spouse. One was more interested in his character emotionally than anyone else save Superman...which is probably a flaw rather than a good thing.<br /><br /> The film's problems are as follows. Singer does not seem to like Superman over much. He is constantly being told off or mocked by characters either indirectly or to his face. The costume is very dark and looks dirty. Everyone has already heard that the Truth, Justice and the American Way line is tossed off with contempt. Lois Lane is, if possible, even more unlikable than in her 30s/40s period and Bosworth's vapid empty performance does not help.. While Luthor is slightly more serious this time out, he is also unaccountably more stupid. He is constantly taking actions that, for a criminal genius, are moronic. He is going to create a new continent using kryptonian technology. Yet when asked how he will fend off other nations attempting to claim the land for their own, he says he will fight them off using that same tech--yet all we see him with are a couple of laptops and a few suitcases. WHAT offensive Kryptonian technology does he have? Apparently none. He is on a private yacht when the continent begins to form--which he promptly abandons for no good reason with a helicopter that it turns out does NOT have enough fuel to reach the mainland. How was Luthor going to return to shore? Why abandon the yacht rather than chug out of harm's way for awhile. We later learn that Luthor has no food supplies yet we see him and his gang happily sitting in a cave on the new continent. The new continent is a barren rock. There is no food. The Chopper does not have enough fuel. He has no offensive weaponry. Just WHAT was Luthor thinking of doing???<br /><br /> Another Luthor related problem that is a holdover from the original series is that the character here--rather than being a brilliant super scientist--is really more of a parasite unable to accomplish anything without stealing and/or making use of other people's creations. In the first film, it was US tech. The second Kryptonian. Here the same. Only in the fourth film did we ever see Luthor actually BE a brilliant Super scientist..and that film is unjustly derided.<br /><br /> Another odd problem is also conversely the film's strength. To wit: the film is practically a shot for shot remake of the first film. Luthor's plot is much the same as before only bigger and with more cgi. His moll goes through the same story arc as the Valerie Perrine character in the first film. We get much the same dialogue and situations only tweaked. Luthor traps Supes with kryptonite and tosses him in water to drown where he is saved by a woman. Only here it is Lois and not Miss Tessmacher. Luthor explains his plans in his abode only here it is to Lois and not to Supes. A Kryptonian space ship crashes lands on the Kent farm where Mrs Kent finds her son. Supes save Lois from a crashing aircraft and then lecturers on the safety of flying. An averted plane crash by the way is directly swiped from the animated film SUPERMAN: THE LAST SON OF KRYPTON. Marlon Brando is trotted out to speak the same dialogue as he did in the first film. A major earthquake hits a major port city. Superman puts a stop to things by lifting a large rock.<br /><br /> On the other hand, since much of the above worked in the first film, it is still exciting here..just very familiar. The question is why watch THIS film when one has the original???<br /><br /> What Singer brings to the proceedings besides his unoriginality and distaste for the character is a Jimmy Olsen who is coded as being gay without ever coming out and saying it. A silly subplot about how Luthor got out of jail that was overly complex, added nothing to the proceedings and was not required. Luthor could have just broken out of jail. An anti-marriage agenda that is understandable coming from Gay Agenda Singer but not required in a Superman film. The whole thing of having Superman return from what was basically a great big silly and irresponsible wild goose chase also seemed unnecessary. Just have another adventure of Superman! The bastard son of Superman plotline which can be nothing but a problem for future installments of the series and is only there so Singer can have sooner or later another of his "Dad. I am different and not like other men" Gay Agenda moments. Superman dies not ONCE but TWICE in the film to diminishing returns. The thundering and repeated(5 times) antismoking propaganda barrage is so blatant that the last scene of the film is where Lois decides to stop smoking. THAT is the main message of the film. Don't smoke. And there is a nasty dog joke(and the film is generally unpleasant to canines in every scene in which they appear) that was not appreciated by me and very alien to the material. This is a Superman film Singer not a Monty Python sketch.<br /><br /> The film is also decided claustrophobic. Where the earlier films felt as if they were part of the planet with American Presidents, the Arms race etc all being involved, this film feels cut off from all that. I don't even think there is a shot of the American flag anywhere.<br /><br /> Still the film is an entertaining installment that should hopefully jump-start the series again. It is not as good as the first two and the fourth but is better than the third. Which is about as much as can be expected. The film suffers from that somnabulic acting and generally dreariness that seems to inflict many modern hero franchises from the dead on arrival BATMAN BEGINS to the disaster CASINO ROYALE. It is not as fatal here but the film IS generally dark, unlovable, uninspiring and suffers from the blahs. One cannot imagine ever watching it again.<br /><br /> Still if they dump Singer, kill Superman Jr, use a villain other than Luthor, maybe we will start getting somewhere.</p></body></html>

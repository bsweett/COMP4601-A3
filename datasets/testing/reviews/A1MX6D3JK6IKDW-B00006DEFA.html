This somewhat forgotten classic is rarely seen on television and is worth every penny of purchase or rental.Abraham won a well deserved Oscar, yet it's Hulce who steals the show with his credible,offbeat portrayal of Mozart.Oh well, perhaps life is just as unfair today as it was in 18th century Austria.

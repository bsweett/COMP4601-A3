<meta name="summary" content="Another average movie from Stone"></head><body><p>It is clear that this movie was made by a Bush Hater I watched it out of curiosity and did not find the movie as entertaining or factual. Once again a movie that portrays conservatives as idiotic and evil.However it was well acted, Josh Brolin does a good job, however looks old when he tried to play W in college. Oliver Stone stumbles badly because he tries to hate the President and tries to suggest that all his decisions were driven for the approval of his father. I would recommend it only if you miss Bush. I know I do....I used to love Oliver Stone but he has not made any notable movie lately, to make matters worse he is recycling his old movie material watch out for Wall Street 2.</p></body></html>

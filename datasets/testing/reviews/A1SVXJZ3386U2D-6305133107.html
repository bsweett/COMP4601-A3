However, the awareness that this was one of 30 some John Wayne movies I hadn't seen led me to watch it last night.  I was impressed.  For one thing, I could tell from the beginning that this was a major production for its' day.  The cinematography was impressive and the location and sets were well done too.  The case for why a school room-full of kids were chosen for the job was credibly made and the journey begins.  There's a fair amount of action and entertainment along the way.  John Wayne gives a good performance as the cattleman who comes to respect his trailhands.  There is some suspenseful conflict with some bad guys and something that rarely happens in a John Wayne film occurs.  I won't say what it was but I could only think of "The Shootist" and, in an indirect way, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" as the other times it occurred after "The Alamo".<br /><br />The kids give a credible performance and so does Roscoe Lee Brown.  Interestingly, there was a bit actor with the last name Canutt who showed up on the credits (as one of the bad guys).  Could it the Duke found work for a relative of his old sparring partner Yakima Canutt?  Collen Dewhurst is featured but she's over-billed for her gratuitous part.  This is not a great movie but it turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would be.</p></body></html>

If the future is really changed, there's nowhere for the Terminators (and Kyle Reese) to come back _from_, and the whole house caves in. (T3 makes a valiant effort to overcome this problem but doesn't quite make it.)<p>This first one is complete as it stands. Shot on such a low budget that James Cameron couldn't even afford to record it in stereo (a shortcoming finally remedied in the 2001 DVD release), this film sets the standard of logical consistency for time-travel action-thrillers (admittedly a pretty narrow genre; the other reasonably well-known one is _Timecop_, and it's far from consistent).<p>See, the plot in this one is carefully constructed so that when Skynet sends the Terminator back in time, it's actually helping to _bring about_ the past in which John Connor is conceived: by sending Arnold, Skynet seals its own fate. If you're an SF reader, you'll be thinking of Heinlein's 'By His Bootstraps' at this point, and you'll be right.<p>There's lots of cool action, too, and even the low-budget special effects have held up well against the last twenty years of cinematography. But the film doesn't actually rely on them all that much; it's really Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and the terrifying Arnold, under James Cameron's direction, that keep the tension high here.<p>I saw this movie in 1984, almost by accident. I was living on Long Island as a graduate student (math) and my housemate and I headed out one Saturday night to see a movie. By the time we got to the theater, it was already ten p.m. and this was the only one that hadn't already started. I expected to be disappointed, and instead was very pleasantly surprised.<p>It's still one of my favorites, and it's still every bit as watchable as it was twenty years ago. It's a pre- and post-apocalytpic thriller, a man-vs.-machine action flick, and several other things. But mostly, it's just a great movie.</p></body></html>

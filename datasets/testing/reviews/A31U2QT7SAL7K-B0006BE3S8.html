<meta name="summary" content="I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"></head><body><p>Let's assess the "ancestors" of this "continuance": "Alien" was a genuine thriller with a surprising heroine in the person of "Ellen Ripley" (Sigourney Weaver); James Cameron's "Aliens" was a slam-bang roller coaster of excitement and thrills; the third one, "Alien3", may have suffered with plot but it did benefit from some interesting SFX and the acting of Weaver and Charles S. Dutton; and final installment, "Alien: Resurrection" featured interesting wordplay between characters portrayed by Weaver, Ron Perlman, and doe-eyed Wynonna Ryder, along with some really kinky erotic imagery between Weaver and the mother alien.<br /><br />As far as "Predator" is concerned, it ranks as one "Ah-nuld's" best, featuring an extremely testosterone-enhanced cast being stalked by the ultimate "big-game" hunter.<br /><br />We won't discuss the forgettable "Predator 2"...however,...<br /><br />"Alien vs. Predator" comes close to the latter as a deplorable addition to the Alien/Predator mythology.  Not that the other films didn't have any plot holes, AVP is so illogical, filled with expendable stereotypes, cheesy effects, poorly lit scenes, occasionally inaudible dialog, and an embarrassingly short running time (100 minutes).<br /><br />Even its predecessors had brilliant scores from the likes of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner, respectively, that heightened the tension in the films.<br /><br />I think that another factor in the film's failure is the PG-13.  While I'm not a big fan of violence and gore, the two series' respective storylines are deserving of R-ratings and the plot development that such classifications may yield.<br /><br />I'm glad to see the usually incredible Sanaa Lathan in a non-typical role for an African-American female, although I wish the actress had picked a better vehicle for which she could make her sci-fi mark.<br /><br />As for Lance Henrikson, he would've done better by letting "Bishop" die in the third Alien.<br /><br />And totally ignore the laughably awful "commentary" by director Anderson, Lathan, and Henrikson.  I can't believe the latter two were aware that they were being recorded!</p></body></html>

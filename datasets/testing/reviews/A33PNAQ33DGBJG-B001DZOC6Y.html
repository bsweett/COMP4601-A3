<meta name="summary" content="An awful movie...."></head><body><p>Al Gore would probably like this movie, but Michelle Polk rates it at zero! A gory movie which made little sense. Oh, I get the whole propaganda theme but the movie itself was just stupid. Suicide after suicide is committed because the plants are angry with humans. It might make a good sci-fi book but to watch those scenes over and over was just too rough!</p></body></html>

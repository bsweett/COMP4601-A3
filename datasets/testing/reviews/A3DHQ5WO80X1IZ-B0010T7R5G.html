<meta name="summary" content="Not quite a classic, but still a VERY good sci-fi movie"></head><body><p>Very cool sci-fi-noir flick from 1998, where humans are the rats in some weird experiment. Hadn't seen this one in quite a while, and was glad to see that it still held up to multiple viewings. And I love the look of this film, which comes across great on Blu-Ray.</p></body></html>

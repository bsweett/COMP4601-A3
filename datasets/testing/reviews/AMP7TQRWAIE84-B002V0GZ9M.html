At times though, it felt drawn out."></head><body><p>Warning: SLIGHT Spoilers Ahead!!!<br /><br />The best part of the movie was the very end of it. For once, Sandra's character, who was a doctor at a local hospital is actually happy, and her and Keanu's character's souls are together! But does it only last 2 years and then he's killed? I was confused about that as well as a few other aspects of the movie.<br /><br />The movie itself was alright. I liked how two strangers wrote each other, taking their time to get to know each other, and ultimately feeling emotionally attached to each other by the end. I loved the emotional parts where Keanu's character pretty much lost it. Before that, he even admitted to his friend that she was, "The realest thing I know."<br /><br />About 20 minutes or so afterwards, you see Sandra's character in tears because Keanu's brother informs him that he is dead. She rushes out of the office, down the steps and out into the city to find him. She eventually does (how, I don't know) and eventually, they are together. FINALLY.<br /><br />Would I re-watch this? Probably not. It wasn't exciting enough. But I did however like the part where Keanu and Sandra's characters met for the second time, and they were talking and stuff and ended up having to cover up a kiss they had when some girl who's into Keanu's character and Sandra's mate come back into the picture. Sandra makes up a lie something like, "He was telling me about the lake house..."<br /><br />LOL. You lyin' fool, you! :-)<br /><br />Worth watching, and at least renting if you're into modern "chick flicks".<br /><br />3.4 stars</p></body></html>

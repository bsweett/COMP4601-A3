<meta name="summary" content="War of the Roses with explosives"></head><body><p>This film is sort of a remake combination of the Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner movie, "The War of the Roses," and the Jamie Lee Curtis/Arnold Schwartneger film, "True Lies."  While the former relied upon outrageous behavior and very good dialogue and the later on action and explosions, Mr. and Mrs. Smith relies more on over-the top violence.  Despite the extremes, however, I felt the film was rather bland and predictable.  Both Mr. Pit and Ms Jolie have done better characterizations in other films, but I didn't really care for either of their characters in this film.  I found it difficult to believe that two people who were so passionate at the beginning would be so boring and indifferent after marriage.  I also couldn't believe that anyone could live five--oops six--years together without any kind of attachment until they were challenged by "bad guys." That the two characters were simply psychopathic I could believe, but in that case I'm surprised that one didn't "off" the other long before the marriage counseling stage.  By the time they got to the point of trying to save themselves from becoming victims of their respective agencies, I had long ceased to care if they made it or not.  Strictly for those who like gunshots and explosions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Philosophically Interesting but Marred by Political Correctness."></head><body><p>_V for Vendetta_ is a film adaptation of a graphic novel which pits an anarchist protagonist against a fascist government.  The film raises several interesting philosophical questions but ultimately it is severely damaged by the type of political correctness all too often seen emanating from Hollywood.<br /><br />First, the movie raises the issue as to whether violence in any form is ever justified.  Obviously the absolute pacifist ethic runs into severe problems when put into practice and in extreme situations in which one must choose between one's own life and the life of a perpetrator.  Even the idea that one should never initiate force (although which may allow for force to be used in defense against force) runs into difficulties when faced with familiar scenarios such as a mother using force to prevent her child from running into traffic.  To this extent, I agree with the movie that force is permissible as a defense against unjust political regimes.  The movie also speaks to the power of symbolism and symbolic actions.  Thus, the destruction of parliament by the (ambiguous) "hero" V is justified in the movie through the idea that it represents a symbol of a corrupt regime that must be toppled.  Secondly the movie raises the issue as to the unethical nature of state sanctioned scientific experimentation on unwitting individuals.  Both totalitarian states and the United States government have engaged in such experimentation (consider for example, the CIA's experiments in mind control and LSD research).  To this extent, I agree with the basic message.<br /><br />However, despite my reserved agreement with this movie on these two points, I must note that its message is severely damaged by political correctness.  In today's world it is political correctness that poses the greatest totalitarian threat.  Despite the current regime's claim to be "conservative", Bush is in fact nothing of the sort.  The government continues to grow and impinge upon the liberties of American citizens.  (Your property can now be confiscated by the state to generate greater tax revenue according to a recent Supreme Court decision.)  Affirmative action and abortion continue to grow in magnitude.  Illegal immigrants continue to overrun the United States (as well as Europe).  And, valuable resources are being wasted on a senseless war in Iraq.  Whether the Democrats or the Republicans win the next election the results will be the same:  greater state interference in the lives of ordinary Americans and the continued threat of ever greater globalization.  In the movie, Christians and "fascists" play the role of unambiguous "bad guys".  The bishop who appears in the movie has an unsavory sexual appetite and is involved in the creation of the death camps.  Homosexuality is glorified and made to appear a victim of a fascist regime.  In today's world, political correctness is by far the stronger force and the various communist regimes which have been propped up through the help of finance capital are never mentioned in the movie.  While the fascists and Nazis murdered approximately 25 million individuals, the communists may have murdered as many as 100 to 200 million.  This difference is staggering.  Certainly government can be a great evil, but by painting all enemies of political correctness as proponents of the state, this movie has severely undermined its own premise.  This is especially ironic given the way in which politically correct forces collude with the state to censor and promote violence against those who disagree.  It is in this respect, that I firmly oppose what this movie stands for, despite its apparent philosophical interest.</p></body></html>

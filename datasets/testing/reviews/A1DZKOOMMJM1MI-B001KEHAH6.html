<meta name="summary" content="Adorable...Garner shines!"></head><body><p>I was never a fan of Jennifer Garner so imagine my utter surprise when 13 Going on 30 turned out to be a great film. Yes, this is another one of those body switch movies (think "Big," "Vice Versa," "Freaky Friday," etc.) in which a child magically occupies an adult body and wonders what to do with the situation. The director, Gary Winick, came out of Sundance with "Tadpole," a well-meaning but overrated film in which a 16-year-old boy is seduced by a 40-year-old woman, and some of us wondered how well that plot would have worked with a 16-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man. Could it even have gotten made, let alone Tadpole's PG-13 rating? Well, now Winick finds out, by supplying a 13-year-old girl with a 30-year-old body and a boyfriend who's a professional hockey star. Their make-out scene is funny yet disturbing. And the film did manage a PG-13. But is it technically statutory rape when the 13 year old occupies a 30 year old body? Hmmm.<br /><br />The plot of the film isn't anything special. Hell, it's been done countless times before, and I rolled my eyes at the beginning of the trailer, but then, my curiosity got the better of me and I am glad it did. The plot has never been executed in such a charming way as this (perhaps only in the Freaky Friday remake). Thanks in part to director Wick, and to Mark Ruffalo, the film has an independent feel that is very beneficial and greatly enhances the story. A few minor plot holes and rushed ending don't hurt it as much as it would hurt other films. I hate to say this but that has a lot to do with Garner, who is terrific in her role. I was surprised to see the King of Independent films, Mark Ruffalo, in this, but he was absolutely perfect. This movie made me realize why I love him so much as an actor. The underrated and unappreciated Judy Greer is also in the mix. Her role is a tough one to explain, but she is as fantastic as in her first starring role in Jawbreaker. (She was also the ONLY redeeming quality in the awful The Village).<br /><br />Effortless and adorable, 30 is a lovable New York romance with the right amount of whimsy and magic. It made me smile through and through, even as obvious plot questions picked at my brain and unrealistic problems stacked up like cars on the interstate during rush hour. That is all forgiven because the cast is so charming and the characters well-written. Plus, who can forget the "Thriller" scene. 30 might not stay with me longer than a week or two, but it certainly was fun while it lasted.</p></body></html>

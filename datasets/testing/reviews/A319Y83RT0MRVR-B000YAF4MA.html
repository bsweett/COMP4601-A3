<meta name="summary" content="You might enter the theater with a closed head, but you'll leave it with an open heart."></head><body><p>With strong performances from both Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, this movie will be a shoo-in for numerous awards. The drama never becomes melodramatic; the movie never drags on or drags you down. There is a pureness of heart and a beauty in the script. There is friendships between the two characters that clearly stems from the actors respect of each other. The script is well done, but so is the direction. The movie is as funny as it poignant, as philosophical as it is perpetual. The movie's message might not be all too different from many other movies - find the joy in your life, seek your family, enjoy your last days to the fullest. Yet, the message is delivered in a wonderful way. The movie relies on Jack Nicholson's performance (more of the same unlikable, filthy rich grumpy old man, we've become accustomed to), but the unsung hero is Morgan Freeman - he brings humanity and humility to the movie and to his character.</p></body></html>

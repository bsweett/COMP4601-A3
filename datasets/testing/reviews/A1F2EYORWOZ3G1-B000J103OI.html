<meta name="summary" content="Quite an achievement"></head><body><p>Okay, I read the other reviews here. And... quite honestly I think some people are missing the point to this story.<br /><br />This is really the story of Andrea and how she learned what it sometimes takes in this world to move on and up. There are those things we strive toward in life and along the way others have to be discarded. Simple fact of life.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is exquisite as the consummate bitch (as good a job as in 'The Manchurian Candidate' but with a twist). The acting, filming, story and music all come together in this one.<br /><br />Meryl senses something in Andrea which is revealed toward the end of the film. She takes her on and teaches her what it takes in the industry to get to where she got.<br /><br />When Andrea finally realizes her 'job' was actually a lesson and what that lesson was, she walks away from it. But she has gained more insight into herself and discovered what she felt she could never do... she had already done. The name of the game is survival.<br /><br />On the surface this is a well played out dromedy. But it does have a deeper message and all the characters in the movie are easily identified with.<br /><br />Saving going into detail here..... forget the movie is about the fashion industry and watch it. There are life lessons, albeit tough ones, taught here. Watch the interactions and growth in the group of characters and you will be nicely suprised.<br /><br />I don't believe any other movie has played this theme out as well, and as cleverly as this one.<br /><br />Not to be missed!</p></body></html>

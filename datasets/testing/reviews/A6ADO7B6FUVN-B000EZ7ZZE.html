People seek refuge outside the city as the Umbrella Corporation, which is responsible for the mishap, has risen walls around the city in order to contain the virus within the city.  When it becomes apparent that the T-virus has reached the outer wall the Umbrella Corporation shuts down the passageway out as the remaining people within the city are left to fend for themselves.  One of these people, Alice (Milla Jovovich), has just awakened inside a hospital where she is attached to several different machines that monitored her health, and once again she has to fight for survival.<br /><br />The struggle for survival turns the film into a roller coaster journey that goes up and down, but unfortunately it seems to stay down most of the time as the action sequences become too cool, almost godlike, which removes any atmosphere of fear, or trepidation that Resident Evil should arise.  The true horror, which was an element in the first film, is wiped out as the film instead attempts to offers a cinematic experience through shoot 'em up action.  There are some interesting scenes such as Alice running down a wall, and the Nemesis attack on the S.T.A.R.S. station, which leaves one survivor.  But overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does not provide much fright or scare.  The action sequences, at times, feel awkward and more humorous than suspenseful as the characters are supposed to struggle for survival.  When some poor soul is about to die, it becomes slightly predictable as if some formula was concocted in order to save the film.<br /><br />The film does not overcome its negatives as in the end the film does fall flat, but there are some highlights in the story.  For example, the film has interesting cinematography, good lightning, and cool special effects.  These positives only make it bearable to view the film as the story seems to be hurried and unfinished.  Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a distilled cinematic version of the video game by Capcom, but the film does not move the near heights of the video game as the film is purely a trip to the shooting range, which leaves an empty feeling within.</p></body></html>

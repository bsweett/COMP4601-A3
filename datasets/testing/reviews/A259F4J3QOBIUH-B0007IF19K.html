I had read that Jamie Foxx was going to portray Ray, so I gave the movie a chance.  I never knew much about Ray Charles, though I used to be into '50s, '60s and Elvis tunes.  Somehow, I never experienced much music of Ray Charles.<br /><br />After watching this film, I immediately purchased a "Best of" collection of his music, because I was astounded by his musical ability, craftsmanship, and lifestyle.  Ray Charles is amazing, and Jamie Foxx put a great deal of effort into portraying him for this biographical film.</p></body></html>

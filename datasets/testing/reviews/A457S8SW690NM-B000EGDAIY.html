Besides the shining and certain exceptions, I usually don't get scared during unrealistic horror movies. This one isn't scary, and tries to scare you by randomly showing someone's eye on the screen. That's not what I call scary. The plot centers around a haunted house in Japan, and everyone that enters this house shall die. This is due to some curse and of course when Sarah Michelle Gellar goes inside it, she's got to find a way to save herself. And of course, her boyfriend wants to die too so he goes in also. Just like the boyfriend in the ring. The movie isn't particullarily scart, and if you dissliked the ring like me, you won't like this. But if you liked it, you'll love it. Oh, and by the way, the little boy that makes cat noises (Meowwwww) isn't scary! That's got to be the stupidest thing ever! I found myself laughing every time he'd Meow. Well, anyway, that's all I've got to say.</p></body></html>

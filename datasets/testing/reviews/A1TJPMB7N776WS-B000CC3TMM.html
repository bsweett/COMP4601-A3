<meta name="summary" content="Our Man Miller"></head><body><p>"The Transporter" was a revelation in many ways: Jason Statham's portrayal of Frank Martin (the transporter), the French Riviera locales, the quick pace, expert editing, the car chases...all these things added up to a fun and at times thrilling movie.<br /><br />But, sad to report, "Transporter 2" does not live up to the promise of the first installment though Statham as Frank Miller is still a hoot: sullen, steely-of-eye, imaginative, intelligent but director Louis Letterrier has let our man Martin down by placing him in a only mildly entertaining situation with often boring, sometimes loutish supporting players: Matthew Modine and the gorgeous Amber Valletta (as the Billings) have to be the most poorly matched screen couple in recent history (I mean, can you really picture these two in bed?). And Miller as their chauffeur? Wouldn't happen in a million years. In fact, I had the nagging feeling that "Transporter 2" seemed awfully familiar what with  Miller downsizing to a chauffeur and his great relationship with the Billings' son whom he drives to and from school. "Man on Fire" maybe?<br /><br />On the positive side there is the, lifted from "The Blade Runner," tall and lanky Lola (Kate Nauta....a Rebecca Romijn clone) who almost beats the living daylights out of Miller and who also can discharge two (one in each hand) semi-automatics at the same time. Nice girl.<br /><br />All that being said, Statham does, through his super-charisma and action hero skills by the way, pull the movie out of the dumps by the scruff of its pants. But why stress the guy out this much? And unless, I misunderstood a line of his dialogue: is Frank Miller now Gay? If so, did he not bed the Asian sweetie in the first Transporter film? Confusing.<br /><br />"Transporter 2" is okay, Statham drips with machismo and screen energy...so with a large buttered popcorn, a Butterfinger and a large Coke...you should have a good time.</p></body></html>

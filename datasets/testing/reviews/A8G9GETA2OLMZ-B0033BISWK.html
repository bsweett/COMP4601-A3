<meta name="summary" content="Terrific"></head><body><p>The director says that "District 9" is primarily for entertainment, and should not be viewed as a political tract.<br /><br />But it is political, and quite well done because it insinuates an interesting message without being preachy.<br /><br />That's because nothing is stated, and everything is dramatized.  You are forced to draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />The main message is: prejudice is deep and almost intractable.  But this message is not immediately apparent because the aliens are deliberately creepy-looking and apparently vicious.<br /><br />In short, in Effective Prejudice style, the "other" is instantly dehumanized, and so it is easy to feel scared and defensive about them.<br /><br />But the rest of the movie humanizes the aliens, and de-humanizes the humans (quite literally in the case of the hero).<br /><br />By the end, you are rooting for the aliens and for the poor hero who realizes his own salvation depends on them, and against the paranoid and trigger-happy humans.<br /><br />The documentary style is flawless and jittery and involving.<br /><br />For U.S. viewers (like me), this apparent you-are-there realism is made stronger by the fact that all the actors are South African and to me unknown--they seem like actual people going through actual, unpredictable events.<br /><br />Superb.</p></body></html>

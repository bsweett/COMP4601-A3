<meta name="summary" content="HIGH ADMIRATION TO THE ACTORS THAT DO THEIR OWN STUNTS"></head><body><p>The reason to buy?  I never catch all the nuances of a story or the actors the first time around.  And buy only if you think you will like it!<br /><br />I have always like the Poseidon story - I thoroughly enjoyed the different take of this movie and the characters.  Although I understood it better after going into the Special Features.<br /><br />Josh Lucas was a great addition and of course I was interested because of Kurt Russell [who I loved in SOLDIER] not much dialogue there.<br />Richard Dreyfuss, I was curious to see how he has progressed from JAWS to ALWAYS to now.<br />And I am always fascinated on how they make a movie.  Wow! I have a great admiration for the actors and actress's who do a lot of their own stunts.<br />What they must go through to provide us with entertainment.  Especially the stunt men and women.  Seventy five shirts for Josh?<br /><br />I like this description of the ship - "13-deck, 20 stories tall Poseidon as it shifts, lurches and implodes" - Yup! I was waiting for the darn thing to explode.<br /><br />I had just got through watching "Mega Disasters" on History of these giant waves that can happen in the Atlantic and turn our coast lines into major disasters.  New York like another Venice.<br />I think a 150 foot "rogue" in the Atlantic with at least one ship a year being lost to one of these waves is hard to imagine - but a given fact.<br /><br />Believe me you will enjoy this version of Poseidon without too much trouble - the characters are recognizable - the shots are great - the coloring definitely excellent - I missed the music for the action.<br /><br />DEFINITELY RECOMMEND - for good clean action.</p></body></html>

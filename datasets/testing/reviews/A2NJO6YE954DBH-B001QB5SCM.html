<meta name="summary" content=""In Her Shoes" is a much better film than what you see in the trailer"></head><body><p>Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette) are sisters.  When they were children their mother died, their father became catatonic, and all they had is each other.  Rose grew up to be a lawyer in Philadelphia, and Maggie became beautiful without bothering to grow up.  Tossed out of the house of her father (Ken Howard) by her shrewish stepmother (Candice Azzara), Maggie moves in for Rose and completely takes advantage of the situation.  No number of post-it notes will stop Maggie from taking her sister's jewelry, money, and shoes.  We know from early on that Maggie is not a good person, and then she does something so horrific that Rose throws her up against the wall and screams, "Get out of my life!"  Rose is right to do so, but given that after their mother's death Rose gave up her childhood to ensure that Maggie had one of her own, her sister's absence is a void that cannot be filled.<br /><br />It seems obvious early on that this is going to be one of those movies where each sister is going to learn to be a bit more like the other, but surprisingly that proves not to be the case.  This makes sense because while Maggie is a failure who needs to "grow up" and become somebody different, Rose's fault is in not being happy with who she is; some modifications are necessary, but not the radical overhauling that Maggie needs to undergo.  The Maggie we meet richly deserves her "F," but at worst Rose is but a "D."  There is the sense in which the two sisters are opposites, since Maggie likes herself more than she should and Rose likes herself less than she deserves, but Rose is clearly the one more sinned against.  Then fate throws Maggie a life preserver in the discovery of her maternal grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine), who was shut out of her life by her father, and who lives in Florida.  So Maggie disappears and Rose tells no one that she does not know where her sister has gone.<br /><br />I found "In Her Shoes" to be much better than I expected.  This is one case where the trailer for a film proves to be deceptive (rather than serving up all of the good parts), because the film is darker than the comic moments we see would indicate.  I like that the cruel twist of fate that brings Rose together with another lawyer at her firm, Simon Stein (Mark Feurestein), who turns out to have the charming ability to make ordering from a menu a romantic occasion.  Simon will attempt to do for Rose what Ella is trying to accomplish with Maggie, but in the end it is only the sisters who can complete the healing process.  The insight comes when Ella reveals that after her daughter's funeral she received what was obviously a suicide note.  What it says explains why Ella cannot be content simply to try and get Maggie to grow up, and why other things must take place.  Whether the credit goes to novelist Jennifer Weiner or screenwriter Susannah Grant ("Ever After," "Erin Brockovich"), the key thing is that the writing is what matters here.<br /><br />Maggie's transformation actually begins before she arrives on her grandmother's doorstep, because it hurting Rose to the point where her sister turns on her, Maggie has finally sees herself for what she is, which is not much.  There is motivation to change, as represented by her remaining sober, but Ella provides the opportunity when she offers Maggie half a helping hand.  Although she is now surrounded by a retirement community of active seniors, where the women look down their noses at her and the men look over their sunglasses, it is a blind English professor (Norman Lloyd), who gives Maggie reason to think for the first time in her life that she is not just a stupid tramp who has nothing to offer anybody but her looks.  What begins with a harsh revelation during an MTV interview and is heightened by the disparagement regarding the insult "Fat Pig," becomes a wonderful surprise at the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not That Great"></head><body><p>I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan to begin with, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  Granted the viewer has to come into this movie with some prior knowledge of religion, but that aside this movie failed to entertain me.  Gavin Rosedale does a pretty good job in what I believe is his first major acting job.  Rachel Weis is solid as well.  My gripe about this movie is the story, not the actors.  You might find this entertaining, but I found it to be a waste of my time and money.</p></body></html>

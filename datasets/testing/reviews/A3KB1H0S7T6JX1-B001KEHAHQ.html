<meta name="summary" content="A nice comedy"></head><body><p>The Pink Panther is yet another take on the well known by now diamond and the goofy inspector Clouseau whose task is to retrieve it.<br /><br />Steve Martin, Jean Reno, Kevin Kline, Beyonce Knowles and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.  Emily Mortimer was delightful as Nicole; let's see more of her!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all wonderful!<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

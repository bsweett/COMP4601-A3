Inarguably, `Die Hard' is `the' action movie; as in the action movie that all other action movies can only aspire to become.  `Die Hard' is intense, absorbing, entertaining and completely `edge of your seat' worthy from start to finish.  Director John McTiernan did a masterful job of getting the action just right, of editing the film in such a way that each scene brilliantly leads right into the next, never losing its intensity or losing its audience.  Add to that one of the greatest action performances ever and you have one thrilling movie that is prime for repeat viewing after repeat viewing.<br /><br />`Die Hard' introduces us to John McClane, NYPD.  You'll want to remember that name, for next to Ripley it's the only `action star' name you'll ever need to know.  Forget Ethan Hunt or even James Bond (well, you can remember James Bond I guess) because John McClane is the definition of action star.  Well, I guess I should say that Bruce Willis is the definition of action star, but you get my drift.  When the LA building his wife happens to be in is taken hostage by a group of terrorists planning a robbery, McClane takes matters into his own hands and wages a war against the terrorists from inside the building.  The LAPD isn't making things any easier, but John has the help of one particular officer.<br /><br />The plot is fine but it's the action that really makes `Die Hard' an instant classic.  It breathes new life into the genre and pushes the envelope in ways that no other action film has done.  `Die Hard' is a movie that will never get old or become outdated.  It holds up even today, twenty years after its release, proving to be just as good if not better than most of the so called `action' films that get released today.<br /><br />The acting is also a highlight, especially that of Bruce.  It saddens me that the Academy can often be so dense and blind.  In my personal opinion Bruce gave one of the best performances of the year.  He was natural and witty, charming and brooding all at the same time.  He created an iconic character, and that is hard to do.  John McClane is a household name.  Alan Rickman is also a pleasure to watch here.  As Hans Gruber he creates a prime bad guy, someone cunning, masterful and of course evil.  Reginald VelJohnson feels like he playing a lengthened version of his character on `Family Matters' and comes off a bit mechanical, but it's forgivable.  Bonnie Bedelia nails her performance as McClane's wife.  She filters through her characters emotions well.<br /><br />In the end `Die Hard' is a classic film that I'm sure many of you have already seen.  If you haven't seen it then I urge you to go out and see it ASAP.  `Die Hard', like I've already mentioned, is a film that stands the test of time.  It is just as up-to-date as the films being released today.  There is no other film like it, and there most likely will never be an `action' film that can top it.</p></body></html>

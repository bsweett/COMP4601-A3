Keri Russell's waitress character has a good heart and is basically likable, but she's a mess of conflicting emotions and desires as she moves into a particularly challenging crossroads of her life.  In fact, she can be so frustrating at times that we sometimes even feel bad for her abusive husband.  But ultimately we root for Ms. Russell's Jenna character to get on the right path, make the right choices, and find her way.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable, even haunting film (made more so by the tragic fate of its director and co-star, Adrienne Shelley), that's probably best described as a serious drama with a generous dose of comedy stirred in to make it all go down easier.  It was also nice to see Andy Griffith in a meaty movie role again, here playing the diner's owner and frequent customer, who comes to befriend and counsel Jenna between his meticulous and cranky food orders.<br /><br />"Waitress" looks and sounds fine on DVD and is accompanied by a generous array of extra features.  Give this one a look.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A disturbing glimpse into the mind of Travis Bickle"></head><body><p>A gritty, dark trip into an alley of alienation and isolation Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver" appears on Blu-ray in a restored nice looking edition. Always gritty looking detail has been improved and colors look extremely good here. This is a large improvement over the previous DVD edition of the film. At first the film appears a bit dicey when the Columbia logo rolls up on screen but the film improves markedly by the first couple of minutes.<br /><br />Offered in a hardcover book style with a replica of the original poster artwork as well as photos from the movie. Special features include the 1986 commentary track with Scorsese and Schrader from the Criterion laserdisc, an interactive feature that allows you to compare the script to the movie(the script appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen as you're watching the movie progressing with each new scene). It's interesting to compare the finished movie where the actors and Scorsese alter the dialogue to fit the their interpretation of the characters. We also get new commentary tracks by writer Schrader and Professor Robert Kolker. We also get new featurettes including "God's Lonely Man", "Producing 'Taxi Driver'", "Travis' New York" comparing 1975 to 2006, storyboard to film comparisons with Scorsese's introduction  and Scorsese discussing the making of the film. I didn't access the "Movie I.Q." special feature here.<br /><br />Shot on a very low budget (less than $1.5 million)and originally slated for director Brian DePalma (who ended up tackling "Obsession" also from a script by "Taxi Driver" writer Paul Schrader which also featured Bernard Herrmann writing the score), "Taxi Driver" became Scorsese and Schrader's first great film. It's fascinating to watch the script-to-screen comparison which illustrates the artistry of writer, actors and director bring to the project making it quite unique.<br /><br />Albert Brooks who makes his film debut here improvised his dialogue as his character wasn't all that fleshed out in the script. He's also quite amusing in a very dark disturbing film. Scorsese makes his debut here as an actor as well when the actor who was originally cast couldn't do the role due to an injury (he appears twice in the film you can also glimpse him sitting on the curb outside the campagin office in the beginning of the film). It's also pretty interesting watching Bickle's reaction to Scorsese's rant and who he considers to be, well, more disturbed than HIM.<br /><br />Bernard Herrmann's moving, powerful score sounds absolutely lovely here.<br /><br />Scorsese and Scharder's powerful glimpse into the mind of an alienated and disturbed lonely man trying to connect with others and finding the only way to do so is the murderous ramapage to "wash away the flith" continues to resonate today.<br /><br />"Taxi Driver" on Blu-ray is HIGHLY recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mel Gibson's best achievement!"></head><body><p>I recently saw this movie on DVD and, it took a second look to truly appreciate the wonder and scope of this awesome film. If you have seen it already like most of us and you don't own it yet, buy the DVD and see it again in WIDESCREEN! Even if you dislike black bars, a film with excellent cinematography such as this must be watched in widescreen (besides, fullscreen cuts off %50 of the movie, believe it or not. Bleh!!) If you have not seen it, get it now! It is a celebration of the human spirit, and a classic film. As William Wallace said, "It's not how you die that's important, but how you live!" So true, and you have not lived until you have seen and fully appreciated Mel Gibson's best film!</p></body></html>

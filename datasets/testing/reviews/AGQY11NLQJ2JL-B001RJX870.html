<meta name="summary" content=""If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed."-Adolf Hitler"></head><body><p>Based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge; one of Hitler's secretaries, this movie describes the last days of Hitler's life. It was exceedingly difficult for me to believe, that any actor could portray Hitler as well as Anthony Hopkins did in The Bunker, until I watched Bruno Ganz shines once again in Downfall.<br /><br />The most outstanding aspect of this movie is that it shows how easy it is to brain wash people and turn them into robots that  do whatever they are ordered. Great performance and wonderful direction, enjoy and don't miss watching the interview with Ganz, it is worth every minute.</p></body></html>

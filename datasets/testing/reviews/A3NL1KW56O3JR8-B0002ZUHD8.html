<meta name="summary" content="I liked it better than it probably deserved"></head><body><p>I love this move; not 100% sure why. I liked the Roman spin on the Arthurian Legend. I also like Clive Owen as an actor (and Keira Knightley is, as always, a total fox). Ok, I admit, the movie is a bit contrived at points but I thought it worked pretty well. Arthur's nemesis in the film was a hoot too. (My favorite line: "Finally, a man worth killing.")<br /><br />KA is probably a 3-star movie, in all honesty, but I'm a sucker for these kinds of films.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

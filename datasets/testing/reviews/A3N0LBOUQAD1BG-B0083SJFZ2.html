This is a remake of the campy but cool 1981 version, and this one features way better special effects and acting and storytelling as bland and predictable as it comes. Sam Worthington (Terminator 4) stars as Perseus son of Zeus who is raised by a fishing family that is killed when Zeus statue is destroyed by an army defying the gods. Perseus is discovered by soldiers of Argos and after discovering he is Zeus' son is asked to take the task of defeating Hades and killing a creature known as "The Kraken". What follows is a series of battle scenes with various monsters that while impressive really don't have any reason to them, they just happen.<br /><br />Zeus (Liam Neeson, "Taken") wants his son to take his place as one of them, while Hades (Ralph Finnes "Red Dragon") wishes for the destruction of all man and wants to become the leader of the gods after being cast out by Zeus some time ago. There's also some race called the Djinn, which are neat looking conjourers that live in the desert that really are about the only cool characters in the whole movie.<br /><br />You get it all in this movie, giant scorpions, bad acting, a battle with Medusa, bad dialogue, the Kraken, and stale characters. Its a quick film, maybe 95 mins before the end credits start, but unfortunately all the thought and effort seemed to be put into the special effects. Again the acting, writing, stale characters really bring it down.</p></body></html>

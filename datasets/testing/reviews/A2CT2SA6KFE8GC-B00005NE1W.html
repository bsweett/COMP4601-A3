<meta name="summary" content=""But it moves so slow......""></head><body><p>This one changed my opinion of Shyamalan.  I dismissed this guy as a total schmuck who found fame in making a movie that [take] the entire plot to "Carnival Of Souls"(and "Jacob's Ladder" in a way).  I don't want to get off on my essay on all the reasons why "The Sixth Sense" was rotten, but I want you all to understand that I HATED Shyamalan about as much as I hate Don Henley(and that's alot).  Well, after his success with "The Sixth Sense", he could have gone on to do just about any movie he wanted.  Instead of making some multi-million dollar CGI filled, action packed "scary" film, he hits us with this bizarre little thriller that almost ventures into David Lynch territory.  I'm not saying that I now like Syamalan based soley on that principal..... I really did like this movie.  Sure, it's slow moving(but the best movies usually are), there aren't jump-out-of-your-seat moments every five minutes, and (this is debatable) there isn't anything really supernatural about it.  I guess I can see why people were let down by this.  I'm sure everyone was expecting this to be another "Sixth Sense" or even to top it.  Everyone seems to love that film more (God only knows why), but "Unbreakable", in my opinion, was a pretty clever piece of work.  At least it didn't [resemble] the plot of an older (and much better) horror film.</p></body></html>

This movie is actually not about a serial; killer  but a lady who is on the run with sopme money she stole and winds up at the Bates motel. A very creepy atmosphere and great role by Perkins. This movie is creepy good classic horror a definite must if you are a fan of haorror and you know what realk good horror is ( e.g The original 1972 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead 1978, Maniac 1980, American WereWolf in London 1980's ) I could go on and on but if you like movies like ( e.g Scream, i know what you did last summer, Jeepers Creepers etc ) then you most likely wont have this movie cause you really dont know what horror is.<br /><br />So for any true horror fans out there , you know who you are get this flick its a must for the serious fan of horrors.</p></body></html>

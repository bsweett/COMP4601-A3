Now he's tracking the elusive &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; (Ralph Fiennes), but Graham knows there is only one way he can get on the right track after all these years of retirement.  Now he must travel to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and visit insane genius Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), whom Graham put away years ago.<p>This is a high improvement over Michael Mann's cult classic MANHUNTER, returning the Hannibal Lecter series to it's original form.  Brett Ratner, director of RUSH HOUR, pulls off his job considerably well.  Ted Tally returns to write the film, and does a good job.  Danny Elfman scores, and his score is excellent.  And, of course, while the cast is all terrific, Hopkins is the stand-out...although Norton (this was his first film that I'd seen) left a good first impression on me.  RED DRAGON is also lighter than the previous Hannibal films, particularly THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<p>Thomas Harris fans will be pleased with the outcome of this film, and well they should be.  It is a terrific film, top-notch entertainment and the second greatest out of all the Hannibal films.</p></body></html>

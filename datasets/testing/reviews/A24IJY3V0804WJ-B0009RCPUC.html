<meta name="summary" content="The last hours of the third Reich"></head><body><p>How can a movie attempt to humanize a demonic regime? Downfall attempts in its own way as it shows the last desperate days and hours of Hitler and his close advisors clutching desperately to straws in the bunker as the Russian army slowly closes on them. Based on several primary sources, primarily through the eyes of a young secretary, Hitler is shown to be a human, although satanic. As everyone met their fate, it was sad to see Goebbels kill his entire family. This is a fascinating movie about the final days of the darkest periods of human history. Four stars. 11/17/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Powerful and sad"></head><body><p>Jamal is a teenager appearing on the Indian TV game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"  and he's doing so well that the host and the police think he's cheating.  When he's taken in for questioning (and torture), we learn that he answered the "Millionaire" questions correctly because of incidents in his childhood, when he was an orphan fending for himself in the teeming slums of Mumbai.<br /><br />This is an exceptional movie with a riveting script, outstanding acting, and cinematography that makes you feel like you're right there with Jamal.  The movie owes much of its success to the small children who play Jamal and his brother in flashbacks; they're wonderfully talented and believable in quite challenging roles.  However, I would recommend it only to those who know what to expect, because it was way too intense for me.  The scenes of the boys growing up in hopeless misery and squalor are so shocking I often had to look away.  Inhuman cruelty directed at young children drew audible gasps and groans from the theatre audience.<br /><br />The triumph of the human spirit at the end is heartening, but the pain and suffering of the slumdogs was so graphic, it was really painful to watch.  It's a well-made movie that I wouldn't want to see again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick Tackles Horror"></head><body><p>"The Shining" was an interesting choice for director Stanley Kubrick to tackle.  Generally, when you think of Kubrick's choices they deal with larger themes and you would not think that he would engage himself in a discredited genre such as horror.  When this film was released in 1980 to lukewarm critical and audience reaction, some feel he didn't engage himself in it very well.  What is this film? Is it horror? Is it dark comedy? A hybrid of both? To my mind, whatever it is or whatever Kubrick intended it to be it works.  The movie is about Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson), a blocked writer, who takes a job as a caretaker at an isolated mountain resort for the winter with his wife, Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny(Danny Lloyd) in tow.  As the onset of winter presents itself, the pressures mount on Jack and he starts to slowly go beserk by seeing things real or imagined and decides to turn on his family.  Now, alot of people point out that Nicholson telegraphed his insanity early in the film by playing his character broadly from the get go.  But considering the demands that Kubrick put on his actors I believe this was purely intentional.  Duvall also gives a frenzied performance, but legend has it that she was a sensitive soul who cracked under the pressure that Kubrick exerted.  The Overlook hotel set also works as a character in the film, with it's long hallways and cavernous rooms used to terrific effect.  The snow-covered exteriors and in particular the hedge maze that was created for the film enhance the horror.  Stephen King was on record as saying that he despised this film, that Kubrick gutted his novel.  He so disliked this film that he approved a made-for-television adaptation that stuck more closely to his book.  I've read "The Shining" and found it more silly than scary.  I think this film has held up remarkably well and that Kubrick made the correct choices.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best westerns ever made........"></head><body><p>Clint Esatwood's masterpiece of film making give's us a look into the world of the charactor that he brought to life in the 60's,70's, and 80's. Basically the lead, William Munny,is no different than the Man With No Name that Eastwood gave us in his hayday. We get to see life after gunfighting.<br />  Eastwood's Munny is an ex outlaw who goes out for one last run when a bounty is put on the head's of two cowboy's who one attacked a prostitute and cut her face. Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan one of<br />Munny's partners who knew him befor Munny met his wife and changed his ways (In the beggining of the film we find out that Munny's wife has passed away).<br />  The bounty is placed by the working girls of Big Whiskey a small town run by a ruthless and very nasty sheriff named Little Bill played by Gene Hackman (Hackman would win an Oscar for the role). We see just how nasty Little Bill can be when English Bob (Richard Harris) wounders into town looking to collect the bounty.<br />  Eastwood showed real courage by not being afraid to show his charactor as both older and flawed.<br />  One of the best thing's about this film is that you get to see the human side of all the people involved. Littler bill building a house and Munny raising pigs show just how diverse the charactors are.<br />  This film won four Oscars including Best Film Editing, Supporting actor, Best Director (Eastwood) and Best Picture. Eastwood himself was also nomminated for best Actor. If you have never seen this film don't just rent it or see it on tv go out and buy it, you'll be glad you did.</p></body></html>

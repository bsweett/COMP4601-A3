It is a very creepy film, complete with eerie music and numerous characters with highly questionable natures.  While Pinhead (leader of the Cenobites, or demons, if you will) may be the ultimate object of evil, it is Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) and Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) that have spotlights shining down on their evil intentions throughout this film.<br /><br />Frank has opened Pandora's box, opening the gates of hell and releasing the cenobites, who take Frank into a place beyond pain and pleasure (if you ask me its just pain on top of pain).  Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) and his second wife, Julia, move into Frank's old home - thinking Frank up and left, Julia has realized Frank's presence still remains.  An acident of spilled blood slowly revives Frank, into a rather gruesome, skinless human (we see this skinless Frank throughout most of the film, so you'll have to get used to this particular visual).  Julia can't keep the visions out of her head of the affairs she and Frank had in the past, and thus promises Frank she will help bring him back to life, by brining men into the home, seducing them and finally killing them.  Frank has every desire to return to human form by taking these victims remains, no matter the cost, and Julia is right there in the middle of the gruesome action.<br /><br />Ashley Laurence plays Kirtsy Cotton (Larry's daughter) who is suspicious of Julia from the start.  It is Kirsty who ends up with Pandora's box and releases the cenobites, thus offering a bargain to give them Frank in exchange for her life, however the cenobites won't go so easily.  In the chilling words of Pinhead (who is deliciously played by Doug Bradley (I wish the character had more screen time)) "We have such wonders to show you."<br /><br />Pinhead is a visual that is hard to forget.  He is named so because his head and face are literally lined with dozens of nails, representing eternal pain and suffering.  His cenobite followers are rather creepy as well, especially "chatter box"<br /><br /> Hellraiser's greatest strength lies in originality.  There is actually a story to this horror film, and is so much more than a basic slasher flick.  Expect some of the unexpected here.  Hellraiser is lined with evil characters, and that list does go beyond the cenobites.  It's a chilling and eerie hour and half of interesting viewing "pleasure".<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Horror - 4<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

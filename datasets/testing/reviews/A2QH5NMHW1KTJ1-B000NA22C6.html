<meta name="summary" content="Depps performance is truly wow!!!"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp should be recognized this film. His performance really deserves an Oscar. Johnny Depp character is an author who is accused of stealing a story from John Turturro's character. Johnny Depp then says he has proof that he created the story first. John Turturro character gives Johnny Depps character 3 days to give him proof that he made up the story first or else he'll kill him if he doesn't make the changes of the story, the original ending John Turturro character made. John Turturro character mess's with his head by killing his dog and just plain messing with him. Johnny Depp caught his wife cheating on him 6 months earlier. So he is going through a divorce, her new boyfriend then threatens to kick Johnny's ass if he doesn't sign the divorce papers for the divorce can be final. Johnny then hires a cop to look over his house and check if no one is in there, and to just protect him. It is a war between Depp and Turturro of who's the better author, even if you don't really like this film, I know your going to love Depps performance. It is a really shocking thriller, which will leave you on the edge of your seat.  <p>This movie is based on the novel by Stephen King, and you know all the movies based on Stephan Kings novels are amazing, like Pet Cementary, Misery, It, The Shining, Carry and other movies based on Stephen King. And you know the movies based on his novels are sure to be shocking thrillers! This is one of those movies where you have to watch it again and again to actually get it. These performances are really great.  John Turturro plays his character so well, he can actually just creep you out like if his character was real. This film has really great cinematography. The movie is really confusing at first, that's really the reason you need to watch it again and again. It will keep you guessing from end to beginning. This movie can make you jump out of your seat, when you walk out of the theater you will just be blown away out of the movie. This is truly, a must see.</p></body></html>

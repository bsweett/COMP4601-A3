And we all know that Director David Fincher will re-release an American version of the film next year with a completely different cast, right? And we all know that the movie(s) is based on the first of three books in a trilogy by Sweedish Author Stieg Larsson (RiP), right? And we all know that the original title of the book and movie were changed from Men Who Hate Women to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so that it would be more well received marketingwise in the US and not perceived as a bash against men by antisexism groups, right? And finally, we all know that the second film in the trilogy has already been released in Sweeden with less than positive reviews and the third in the trilogy will be released later this year...right?<br /><br />Whew. With all that out of the way, I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was great. Two story lines woven together nicely (albeit with the burden of reading subtitles from start to finish). The first story line follows Journalist Mikael Blomkvist after being convicted of libel for accusing a high powered businessman of gun running and other unethical and illegal activity. The widely publicized trial brings Blomkvist to the attention of another high powered businessman named Vanger looking for a long lost niece.<br /><br />Enter storyline 2: A Goth lady named Lisbeth works at a security firm that Vanger has hired to determine if Blomkvist is the right man to hunt for his niece. And the story arcs from there to the struggles of Lisbeth's everyday life of trying to make ends meet while on probation for some serious crimes committed in her relatively distant past.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, both stories are ultimately connected with each other in a thriller tale of intrigue, deception, mystery, murder and revenge. Actress Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth with a seriousness that makes you think she's a real person out there somewhere, and that a camera followed her like a fly on the wall. And be warned, there are some scenes of rape and torture that are very unsettling and difficult to sit through in this film.<br /><br />I don't know why Fincher feels the need to re-do this movie in America, because the Sweedish version couldn't be more well done. It's a very good movie that stands on its own with no cliffhanger ending that requires seeing the upcoming sequels. Highly recommended but not for the squeamish.</p></body></html>

The dialog is corny, delivered by people trying too hard or not hard enough to be hip and funny.  It didn't help that the characters/actors were either extremely obnoxious (Chris Evans) or deadly dull (Ioan Gruffudd).  The relationships were dubious at best (did they hate each other on sight or because of some mysterious history or did they just love to bicker?).  The special effects are hohum, seen them all before.  The story was all about establishing the characters and if, like myself, you didn't like the characters/actors, what was there left to watch?<br />And as for that lame GQ villain!  He couldn't even muster up a credible snarl.  As villains go he was all costume.<br />I was left with acute disappointment, wondering why I bought the darn DVD in the first place.<br />Now, 6 years after my initial viewing, rewatching it again, everything I thought about it in the first place still held true.  It didn't age well at all.</p></body></html>

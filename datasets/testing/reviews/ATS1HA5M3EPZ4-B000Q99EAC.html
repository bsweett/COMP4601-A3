But then a good friend of mine stated, `I think he still has something to say'.  And you know what?  He actually did.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I knew Stallone had talent.  After all, he scribed all the Rocky movies (the first won an Oscar), and directed 2, 3 and 4.  Leaving the fifth to the director of the original.  I can't blame him for wanting to make one more movie (lets hope it's only one more) after the travesty of the fifth movie.  Something was definitely lost in the translation.  This is a beloved character for him and he obviously wanted to set things right.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is most certainly a return to the roots of the original movie and character.  Where a man overcomes all negative odds with heart and belief in himself.  Stallone takes the reigns and makes sure this movie came out the way it should.  An aged Rocky is now suffering the loss of  Adrian, a distant relationship with his son and just getting older.  Everything in his town is changing and even though he seems to be taking it all in stride, there are moments where he is obviously having trouble dealing with it all.<br /><br />When a computer generated `Fantasy Fight' is broadcast on ESPN pitting Rocky (in his prime) against the current champ Mason Dixon, the buzz turns into full blown demand for an actual fight.  The plot is pretty predictable from that point on, the inevitable is going to happen and Rocky ends up in the ring.  But you still find yourself rooting for him with everything you can, even though the guy he's fighting isn't someone you want to hate like the last three movies.<br /><br />After a decade of flopping mediocre movies that he got paid WAAAYYY too much money for (Assassins, The Specialist, Driven) Stallone has been humbled, and seems to be trying to get some dignity back.  He has done that with Rocky Balboa, bringing some class back to an American underdog character that has become an icon of our culture.</p></body></html>

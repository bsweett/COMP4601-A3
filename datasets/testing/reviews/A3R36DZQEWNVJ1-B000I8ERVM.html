<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Carpenter gives a believable performance...even if it is a movie"></head><body><p>Father Richard Moore, played by Tom Wilkinson (upcoming Seperate Lives, Batman Begins), is on trial for the supposed murder of 19 Year Old Emily Rose, played surprisingly in a believable performance by Jennifer Carpenter (White Chicks). As Wilkinson's Lawyer, Erin, played by the always good Laura Linney (Mystic River, p.s.), is told the tale of what happened to Emily Rose from Wilkinson himself and defending the people would be Evan Thomas, played by Campbell Scott (Rodger Dodger, Big Night) and he's also good. Emily Rose was taking medicine and suffering from delusions, seeing things, things made her so stuff but Wilkinson knows that she was possessed by a demon or more demons...they say 6...including Lucifier. Scott Derrickson doesnt do a bad job but this isnt a masterpiece and it could possibly...is...the years spookiest if mixed with courtroom dramatics,movie. It's better then White Noise, let's say that because we all know how bad White Noise was. Carpenter is the real deal here and her character beind 19 Years Old and seeing her suffer even though she's acting on screen, you get a chill down the back of your spine if it was you who was witnessing everything that happened to her, even the part in the chapel where she is crying, asking the boy she likes to please say with her...you feel as if you want to stay with her, comfort her as she goes threw all of this. Also starring Colm Feore (City of Angels, Storm Of The Century), Henry Czerny (Mission:Impossible, Clear and Present Danger) and Alec Roberts (Tv's Stargate SGI, 13 Ghosts(2001). I dont know, you decide...it's your opinion but in my mind, I felt like The Exorcism Of Emily Rose was a good movie even if it had it's falts along the way. Other thing is that Derrickson stated that he didnt rip off The Exorcist...some might disagree with him, I on the other hand dont see any of The Exorcist in this....well, the only thing is that it's a young girl, like in The Exorcist but I cant say it's ripping from it.</p></body></html>

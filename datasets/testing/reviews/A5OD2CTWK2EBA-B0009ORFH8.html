<meta name="summary" content="Great, the film that started them all"></head><body><p>This is the reason zombie flicks are made and almost all other horros, the film in 1968 by George Romero is a classic and for the price its great. How a movie like this is being sold for so little i could never understand. But for those who dont know its in black and white, but that means nothing, to me atleast. If you know what great horror is then this is one to have. Like I said the one that started it all and if you know whats best for your collection you will get this flick highlyrecomended. Also loook to buy the other 2 ZOMBIE flicks by Romero Dawn of the dead 1978 and day of the dead 1985 also the remake of night of the living dead 1992, I believe is directed by Tom savini.</p></body></html>

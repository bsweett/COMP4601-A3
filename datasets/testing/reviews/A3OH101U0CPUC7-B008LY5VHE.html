The 4th of July weekend is rapidly approaching and the businesses are all eager for the dollars that will get them through another year.  And then a young woman goes swimming and gets ravaged by a shark.  The series of events that follows leads to police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) closing the beach and calling in oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to supply information that could help deal with the problem.  Finally, the two of them join the grizzled Captain Quint (John Shaw) on his boat to hunt the great white shark... but the hunters become the hunted.<br /><br />Jaws was a major blockbuster in its day and still holds up pretty well.  The acting is strong whether talking about the stars or the supporting cast.  John Shaw attacks his role with particularly gusto and the script offers him many of the best lines.  The story is a touch slow in some respects during the first half, but once Quint and company go out on the water, the tension builds quickly.<br /><br />The plot has its weaknesses, primarily the extreme stupidity of the nearly every human in the story.  The mayor and town council willfully ignore sign after sign that the beaches need to be closed turning the situation into a true bloodbath.  Yes, they were worried about money but setting up tourists to be slaughtered wouldn't do the community any good in either the long or short term.  Even Quint, largely shown to be savvy and shrewd, allows several feet of water to swamp his boat and does nothing to pump it out.  Then he recklessly, seemingly purposely, burns out his engines leaving the boat to founder helplessly.<br /><br />Jaws isn't perfect, but it is an enjoyable film.  It was one of the films that created the whole concept of summer blockbusters and those who haven't seen it should check it out just for its historical significance.  Beyond that, it's second half provides a suspenseful thrill ride as the struggle of man vs. shark unfolds.</p></body></html>

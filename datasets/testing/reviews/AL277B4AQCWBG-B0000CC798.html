<meta name="summary" content="Best comic book adaptation ever"></head><body><p>Wonderfully entertaining on every level, "X2"works as an action film, a political thriller, and a surprisingly moving romance.  It also has a beautifully controlled subtext about "otherness" which drives some exquisitely accurate skewers right through the heartless chest of the current US administration.  Singer and his crew have managed something that few comic book adaptations even strive for, let alone achieve: they've taken the source material and made it resonate for a new audience in a new age.  They show us how good an effects-intensive film can and should be.  Beyond the sheer delight of digital imagery and fight sequences, Singer has clearly expended just as much effort on ensuring that the story is engaging and works as a film narrative and not just as two hours of eye candy.  He doesn't make the mistake of staking his film's whole appeal on a few elaborate, digitized set pieces which are entirely revealed by the trailer. "X2" confirms his place among the truly interesting directors working today (go back and look at the unfairly neglected "Apt Pupil" - his work there is superb, as is McKellen's).  Singer's talent for balancing spectacle, story and sentiment makes me wonder what he could have done with the "Star Wars" prequels - two films which fail on every one of those counts.</p></body></html>

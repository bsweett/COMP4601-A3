And the dialog was often funny, in a Mickey Spillane kind of way. Mickey Rourke is the standout among the cast.  And I really loved the music. Great, moody jazz!  But the storylines were muddled and the characters were beyond stereotypes. And it didn't really need to be two hours long. So overall, I'll give it a rating of 4 stars.</p></body></html>

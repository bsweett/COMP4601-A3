We've seen "Spiderman" and its sequel, "Elektra," "Daredevil," "Sin City," "Hellboy," "The Punisher," and probably a few others I'm forgetting. Heck, we can expect to see new installments in the "Superman" and "Batman" franchises soon, too. Personally, I haven't seen any of the above listed films with the exception of the first Spiderman, and it's likely I won't see more than a couple of them any time soon. I'm not trying to bash comic books or anything like that, but for some reason I tend to shy away from films based on this medium. Why? I hear very bad things about many of these films, most of which involve complaints about how the films forego important things like plot and character development in favor of shock and awe special effects. If I remember correctly from my comic book reading days, most of the stories dealt heavily with superheroes faced with moral quandaries and personality problems that translated over into the real world. Not so in the movies. The emphasis here is on blowing stuff up and using the biggest CGI effects possible.<br /><br />There are exceptions: "Spiderman" did a good job focusing on the characters' problems. So did "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United." I have seen these movies, and I liked all three of them. "X2," however, is arguably the best of the lot. The film continues the story of the characters we saw in the first film--namely Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos)--while adding a few new faces. After the X-Men saved the world in the first film, not much changed regarding human/mutant relations. Normal people still freak out whenever they see someone shape change, produce fire out of thin air, or any of the other assorted abilities common to mutants. The opening sequences of "X2" do little to alleviate such fears. An attack on the White House by a mutant with the ability to teleport (Nightcrawler, played effectively by Alan Cumming) nearly costs the president his life. The result is a crackdown on mutants everywhere with the resurrection of the dreaded Mutant Registration Act, a draconian measure that will severely restrict the activities of mutants everywhere.<br /><br />The man in charge of carrying out the new act is General William Stryker (deliciously evil Brian Cox), a man whose new mission allows him to carry out his own personal vendetta against Xavier and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. I won't spoil the reasons behind the vendetta, but his official mission sees him launch an attack against Xavier's school in order to round up the freaks. Unfortunately, he picked a bad time to make an appearance--Wolverine is back from his soul searching and is ready to kick some serious you know what. While he assists in salvaging what he can from the fiasco at Xavier's pad, the rest of the X-Men are out and about trying to track down the mutant responsible for the attack on the White House. If they can find this person, they reason, they might be able to head off the impending crackdown. Of course, their mission soon discovers that Stryker's fingerprints are all over the place. Too, Magneto manages to escape from his plastic prison and, with the oddly alluring Mystique at his side, throws a few wrenches into the whole process. By the time the movie comes to an end, we've seen the overall storyline advance amidst an avalanche of mind-blowing special effects including but not limited to huge tornados, rushing walls of water, and whipsaw quick fight sequences. Fun stuff!<br /><br />Heartfelt thanks should go to director Bryan Singer for masterfully balancing the action and CGI with numerous character driven arcs. It's great to see fights and mutant powers blasting away at everything in sight, don't get me wrong, but it's more interesting to see how the characters develop. And in that department Singer and company do a good job. The whole human versus mutant conflict receives fresh treatment, as does Wolverine's eternal struggle to understand who he is and how he came to be. The latter is probably the most intriguing element in the storyline due to its relevancy. Who among us hasn't struggled to understand our identity at some point in life? Of course, most of us haven't been the subject of government experimentation that grafted metal to our bones and wiped our memories clean in the process, but you get the idea. And while the movie simplifies that theme so even the densest dolts in the audience will catch on, it's still an almost universal human issue that resonates with all of us. CGI and character dynamics aside, "X2" is a lot of fun if for no other reason than checking out all the babes. Halle Berry (not a favorite of mine), Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and Kelly Hu provide more than enough eye candy for us older "kids" in the audience.<br /><br />"X2: X-Men United" has something for everyone. And check out the extras on the two-disc set! That's what I call a DVD! I won't waste time going over them in detail except to say that the sheer number of supplements guarantees a viewer can spend plenty of time exploring every aspect of this film's production process if he or she wishes to do so. If you haven't seen "X2" yet, prepare to be blown away. One hopes the next installment will surpass the previous two, but the absence of Singer behind the camera should cause some concerns. Oh well, even if the next one stinks we've still got these two great films to watch over and over again.</p></body></html>

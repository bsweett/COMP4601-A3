<meta name="summary" content="AVP"></head><body><p>A friend loaned me ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (recommended) in the full-screen version - usually not recommended, but in this case it probably didn't matter.  There wasn't that much interesting happening in the middle of the screen, so I probably wasn't missing much happening on the edges.<br /><br />  I'm not a devoted fan of either the Alien or the Predator franchise, and I suppose my ignorance has inoculated me against outrage.  I don't know alien incubation times, or when a predator has last visited the earth, and I don't remember what a predator is supposed to look like when he pulls his mask off. Also, I'm blissfully unaware that AVP offends the story lines of earlier movies.<br /><br />  AVP is okay, but that's about it.  About my only beef is that the aliens didn't really versus the predators enough.  Probably a rental, but I'd recommend borrowing it from somebody if you can.</p></body></html>

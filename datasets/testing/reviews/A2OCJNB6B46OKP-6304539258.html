<meta name="summary" content="Now the very first means so much more..."></head><body><p>The credits roll and the flagship scorlls across the screen nowadays I say to myself..."So begins the second chapter." With 'Revenge Of The Sith' marking the completion of the prequil trilogy 'Star Wars', now christened officially as 'A New Hope' makes so much more sense to me than ever before! I now know who Darth Vader is and where he came from and when he walks through the halls of the flagship for the very first time I now fear him because I truly know how evil he is.<br /><br />Darth Vader's fate now rests in the hands of three people. His old master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his twins Luke and Leia. This movie is the one that started it all back in 1977 introducing us to that Galaxy far far away. Now however everything that i see every charater, every bit of dialogue and ever planet makes so much more sense to me because of the fact the history has been told. But what makes this movie so good is the fact that the great Harrison Ford is in this film as the crafty smuggler Han Solo. Everything he says and does in this movie is just awesome. When you speak to the fans everyone's favorite scene is him pretending to be a storm trooper. I adore this movie so much more now thanks to episode 3, because after what is seen and done you just need that little bit of light back in your system. 'A New Hope' delivers on that account. Still, eventhough the rest of the story is something I can now recite with my eyes closed I now want to enjoy the rest of this story and watch what will unravel now that Luke knows he has to destory the Empire.</p></body></html>

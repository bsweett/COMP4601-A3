<meta name="summary" content="Mamet can write thrillers as well--yowza!"></head><body><p>This is an excellent thriller mostly thanks to the storyline that takes a few nice twists and the excellent lead role played by Val Kilmer. Supporting cast is first-rate and the tension built throughout the movie is there in spades.<br /><br />DVD is a waste, though, as all you get is a Kilmer commentary track. Rent it don't buy which is why this gets a "4" rather than a "5."</p></body></html>

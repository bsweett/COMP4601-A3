<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected"></head><body><p>Much better than the 1989 direct to video adaptation which starred Dolph Lundgren in the title role, the Punisher, the latest film adapted from a Marvel comic, succeeds where Hulk and Daredevil failed.  Capturing the feel of the comic (for the most part anyway), this ultra violent actioner finds undercover agent Frank Castle's (Thomas Jane, perfectly cast) retirement and bliss destoryed when his entire family is murdered by money laundering mobster Howard Saint (John Travolta in oily villian mode).  Castle survives, and vows revenge against the people who ruined his life.  Director/co-screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh knows the source material for the most part, with scenes and characters taken directly from classic issues of the comic.  Hardcore fanboys may not be too happy with some differences between the film and the comic (such as the change of scenery from New York to Tampa for one), but the overall film is more than satisfying.  Plus, the epic fight between Frank and the Russian (wrestling star Kevin Nash) is one of the best filmed fights in recent memory.  The great casting is also a highlight, with Will Patton as a sadistic gangster, Mulholland Drive's Laura Harring as Saint's wife, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Frank's neighbor Joan, Samantha Mathis as Frank's wife, and Ben Foster (excellently cast) as Frank's heavily pierced neighbor Spacker Dave.</p></body></html>

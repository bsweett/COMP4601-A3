Much of the time, groundbreaking films are not particularly remarkable artistically-- they simply get by on doing something that had never been done before.  NotLD is a particularly glaring exception because it is so effortlessly and organically transgressive.  A film like "Last House on the Left" seems to exist exclusively for the purpose of pushing the audience to the edge, but NotLD never announces that it is a new, darker sort of horror film.  One gets the impression that Romero and Russo and all the others didn't even specifically intend to make a more graphic horror film when they started out.  It appears almost normal, initially, but moves inexorably towards the horrific conclusion, at all points defying the expectations as to who ought to survive, or whether or not bravery or cowardice ought to be rewarded.  It never feels self-conscious or scripted, and that's why it holds up so well even after it is no longer a particularly morbid or gruesome film.  Despite the supernatural elements, NotLD is disturbingly authentic.<br /><br />Horror films tend not to be to big on plot, and "Night of the Living Dead" is no exception.  It is your standard zombie apocalypse plot, though, of course, no such thing existed at the time.  Most modern zombie films take the action-horror route along with an urban setting, but NotLD is pure horror, and takes place inside a desolate farmhouse out in the Pennsylvania countryside. As the film opens we are introduced to Barbara and Johnny, brother and sister.  These are characters we've seen before: Barbara is snippety and uptight, and seems to be well on her way to becoming an old spinster.  Johnny feels like the hero, and he'd probably feel at home in a 50's Sci-Fi or Horror flick, as he's whiny and jokey and teases his sister.  Still, he seems to have a good, courageous heart, however, as he immediately comes to his sisters aid after she's assailed by a strange man in the graveyard. But Oops! Johnny gets his brains bashed in only a few minutes into the film.  And though she's technically alive Barbara is more or less out for the count for the rest of the film, and mostly lounges about in a nearly catatonic stupor.<br /><br />Barbara flees to an apparently abandoned farm house, and we are shortly introduced to the films real hero, Ben, played by Duane Jones.  The acting in the film isn't exactly  terrific, but Jones is good as Ben, and helps create one of the most appealing protagonists in all film.  He's smart and capable but certainly not a saint-- Notice how he decks the hysterical Barbara after she slaps him  during her vain attempt to get them to search for the now very dead Johnny.  Much has been made out of the fact that he's black.  Romero will tell you that this means nothing, or nothing more than that Jones was the best actor they could find for the part, regardless of race.  Again, the roots of NotLD's greatness are exposed-- They were neither conforming to nor defying tradition.  They simply made it their way.<br /><br />The core of the film is not especially eventful: Ben works to barricade the house, and eventually argues with the unexpected tenants in the basement, two couples and one child.  These scenes show that Romero really knew what he was doing from the very beginning, and that his experience in industrial films and commercials wasn't wasted.  The film somehow maintains a slightly hypnotic intensity in the section as Ben seals of the house while the all to calm radio announcer drones on and on in a hopeless attempt to get a grip on the whole extraordinary situation.  Romero keeps the camera moving and the editing sharp so that even after over 10 viewing my mind never wanders in this seemingly uneventful section of the film. (This is a good description of the visual style of the film in general, as it is far from flashy and very realistic, but still energetic enough that it never really feels flat.)  And then there is, of course, Ben's dramatic monologue about his first encounter with the "things".  This scene has been surpassed a few times in later films, like "Jaws" or "28 Days Later", but it still holds up very well.<br /><br />Eventually, the majority of the farmhouse's residents determine that it's best not to simply wait around for help, and plan a fairly reasonable escape.  Suffice to say, things do not go well.  I don't want to go into too many specific as it'll hurt the film, but this part is really quite brilliant.  Their plan seems really quite reasonable on the face of it, but it proves disastrous.  Fate and human error intervene, and we a treated to one of the earliest gore scenes you'll ever see outside of an H.G. Lewis film, as the ghouls feed on charred remains while ominous, amelodic electronic music drones on in the background.  Again, this isn't remarkably gruesome by modern day standards, but it's probably the creepiest zombie-feast scene ever filmed.<br /><br />Shortly after this things spiral out of control between the survivors, and all hell break's loose, leading up to one of the greatest endings in all film.  Again, I won't go into specifics, but it's just such a classic, senselessly tragic endings.  It's been knocked off many times, but the ending here still has the sorta authenticity that you find in all the rest of the film.  This isn't a morose, violent ending that a supposedly edgy director stuffed on to prove how far he'd push boundaries This is just they way it happened to turn out.  Just a great film.<br /><br />The Elite Millenium Edition is the only way to go.  Good transfer and sound, nice extras.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

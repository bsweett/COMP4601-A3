<meta name="summary" content="Not just an A for effort"></head><body><p>The first thing I noticed when seeing this movie was the hair.<br /><br />As a former computer programmer the rendering of the hair it was done not as a block as you often see.  It was very well done, must have been thousands of hours of work by a top notch team.  It portends an even brighter future but will be forgotten over the years as we become used to the miracles of the computer.  A shame that such an effort will be forgotten.<br /><br />What will NOT be forgotten is first rate writing, plotting and a story and a moral that will pass the test of time.  It was as entertaining as a movie can get, excellent for all ages.<br /><br />All the bugaboos of modern PC are hit, from a sue-happy public, to enforced mediocrity "Everyone is special which means nobody is."<br /><br />Add to that action, comedy and you have a real winner.<br /><br />Go see it.</p></body></html>

Some viewers are more plot and substance driven, while others are more visually oriented. This movie obviously plays to the visuals. The film is cinematically stunning; the French landscape, the set design and the costumes are gorgeous beyond belief. If nothing else, this 2 hour and 3 minute romp through pre-revolutionary France will delight your senses to an array of color, texture and architectural wonder you'll long remember. For that it's worthy of at least 3 Stars.<br /><br />But what about plot and substance, is there any? The movie plays like a period piece on the lives of the rich and famous, however there are some good moments sprinkled in here and there. There are several charming and whimsical scenes concerning Marie's need to permanently establish her aristocratic standing by becoming pregnant and Louie's hesitation, lack of interest, or inability to consummate the marriage. There is also the presence of the constant, idle chatter amongst the bored, nobly born patrons of the King's Court that helps maintain your interest for awhile as the ill-defined plot lumbers to its eventual conclusion.<br /><br />Do I recommend this film? Well, if you're into period pieces and stories of Lords and Ladies, or if you're looking for magnificent scenery and sumptuous attire you'll probably enjoy it. If not you should pass on this one.<br /><br />My Rating: 3 ? Stars</p></body></html>

The dark script and characters are still fantastic this time around, but it's almost an exact copy of the one that came before. The last horror film I remember that followed almost scene for scene from the source material was Psycho, and we all know how that turned out. At first I was trying to think of a reason why they would remake an already good/great movie so soon, but I guess they thought most audiences in the U.S. wouldn't want to read the subtitles that the foreign version had to offer.<br /><br />The story involves a 12-year-old vampire girl who befriends a neighbor boy, while her loving "father" has to kill people and bring home blood for her survival.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz is even more impressive here than in her breakout role as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. There is just something hypnotic about her acting. When she is on screen, your eyes are transfixed. I can see a Jodie Foster like career for her, if she doesn't go the Lohan way. Kodi Smit-McPhee was up to the challenge as well. They share some great chemistry. You rarely see one good child actor performance in a movie, let alone two. Richard Jenkins didn't have a major role as the father figure of the vampire girl, but he fit the mold nicely.<br /><br />I liked the atmosphere and creepy visuals even more in this version. The kills were also more quick, brutal and bloody. Some people seem to be complaining about the CGI (which isn't used much anyway), like when the vampire climbs up a tree, but I hardly noticed. The music was okay, but could have been more memorable. I liked the way Blue Oyster Cult's "Burnin' For You" and The Greg Kihn Band's "The Breakup Song" were put to use.<br /><br />Let Me In is easily one of the top five films I've seen this year. I think you will enjoy it more if you don't see the original first, but they are both equally great (maybe a slight edge to this one, especially if you don't want to read), so I'll let you decide. You're welcome.</p></body></html>

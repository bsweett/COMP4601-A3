<meta name="summary" content="The last majuscule Western!"></head><body><p>Dodge City 's recent clean up is the last solved conflict by Earp brothers, but as you know the marauding never rests, and sooner than you imagine on, they will have to put their guns back on.<br /><br />The admirable action sequences, the formidable edition and the presence of Val Kilmer playing his best performance 's lifetime until this date as Doc Holiday, will make of this film the last superior Western made until now. Cosmatos made undoubtedly his masterpiece, although the occupied place by My Darling Clementine still remains unmatchable.</p></body></html>

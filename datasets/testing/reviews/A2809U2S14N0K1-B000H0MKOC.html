<meta name="summary" content="Spin - loved it"></head><body><p>The story itself is interesting. It is a satirical look at political activism and advertising today which it calls spin. The hero is a spokesman for Big Tobacco, who tries to push cigarettes by claiming that it is the rights of smokers.<br /><br />I also found the different characters interesting. Overall they came together well. Much of the acting was good. Not surprising as some were very good. In particular I did like Aaron E. Eckhart performance!<br /><br />Some of the stuff was a bit over the top but it is a movie.<br /><br />I also liked some of the logic, examples and methods of argument used.</p></body></html>

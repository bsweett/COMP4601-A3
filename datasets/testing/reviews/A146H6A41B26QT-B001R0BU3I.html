<meta name="summary" content="Cheadle's a star!"></head><body><p>Don Cheadle gives a wonderful performance as Samir Horn. . . .and that's all I'm going to say, because anything more would ruin the film for you. Yes, it's an "international spy thriller/espionage/war on terror story that spans the globe." Some locations are exotic--Sudan, Yemen, Marseille, also London and Washington. But the movie is more, much more. Afterwards, you may think about the unanswerable question--does the end justify the means? And if you conclude it does, what's the personal price you pay? Cheadle's anguish is plain to see as he wrestles with the question. Guy Pearce is also marvelous as an FBI agent who believes he knows the answer, but never stops thinking. Highly recommended!<br /><br />This film has a PG-13 rating but I'd be cautious. A teen may find it hard to follow, and it's violent at times.</p></body></html>

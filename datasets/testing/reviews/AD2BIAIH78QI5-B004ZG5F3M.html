Juliette Binoche is quite charming as the chocolatiere who's getting everyone worked up but managing to subdue them all with just the right kind of truffle or cocoa. Oh, if life were only so simple in actuality! I especially loved the colors of her clothes in this movie, lovely aquas and salmons. "Chocolat" is a feast for the eye as well as the mouth (although the mouth part is vicarious, really). Dame Judi is a bit more crotchetty here than usual, but still a great performer. Depp is sexy as a gypsy guy who manages to be slightly a step ahead of Binoche, disconcerting her as the only one who's favorite chocolate she can't quite detect.  <p>I think it's interesting how many other reviewers are angry that Johnny Depp didn't have a larger role than his billing would have you believe, but I think the true qualifier for that dubious honor would be Leslie Caron. I don't think she says two words together in the movie; she just keeps looking over her shoulder to be amazed at finding John Wood there (is that really the strangest thing?).</p></body></html>

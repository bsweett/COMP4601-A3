We get together with the right (or the wrong) man or woman, form a short/long/meaningless relationship, and bang, a mere nine months later, you're parents. You don't have to move 70 miles to have that baby (depending on how bad your relationship actually is), you don't have to walk for miles to find your partner, you don't have to keep the egg warm and you don't have to starve in order to have a baby.<br /><br />Penguins are completely different. Not only are they men in tuxedos, they're cute, but they also go through life or death situations every year. Just to reproduce. I'm damn sure us humans would quickly die out if we had to do what penguins do just to reproduce. Yet they do it. Repeatedly.<br /><br />Can you imagine marching 70 miles to find your partner? Well, I certainly couldn't, and in my next life, I don't want to be a penguin. Once they've found their perfect partner, they have to fight off other jealous potential partners, and there are some heart-wrenching scenes when each couple gets together. Then the egg is produced, but needs to be kept warm. Impossible in minus something very cold temperatures? But it's done. Some eggs don't survive, as they're left or left out too long in the cold. The fathers have to look after them as the mothers have lost most of their body weight during the pregnancy, and need food now.<br /><br />Many fathers do survive, but some, especially the older ones, simply go to sleep, and the tear jerking scene where one just closes his eyes for the last time is just unbelievable.<br /><br />And then the eggs hatch. And little fluffy heads pop out, feel the cold, and decide to stay in the shell. If they stay out too long, they freeze. The beaks poking at a frozen baby penguin is again heartbreaking, and makes you put some extra clothing on.<br /><br />The life of penguins is not easy, as shown in this documentary, and you seem to become part of their world, with Morgan Freeman's soothing voice guiding you through their perilous journey. (His narration was recorded in just one day.)<br /><br />This is definitely a must have in any DVD lovers home, and also included are some very interesting featurettes, and a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Awwww!</p></body></html>

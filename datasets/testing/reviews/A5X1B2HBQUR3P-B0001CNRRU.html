<meta name="summary" content="Edited in a non-linear arrangement where the lives of the characters are depicted before and after a tragic automobile accident"></head><body><p>21 Grams is a movie which has three parallel thread stories which seem to be unconnected but the movie progresses it becomes apparent that all three stories and characters are connected.<br /><br />The thread stories are<br /><br />1) Sean Penn plays a critically ill academic mathematician,<br />2) Noami Watts plays a grief stricken mother,<br />3) Benicio Del Toro plays an ex-convict who has newly discovered Christianity<br /><br />All three characters center around a tragic automobile accident.<br /><br />The movie although shot in  chronological order, is edited in a non-linear arrangement where the lives of the characters are depicted before and after the accident. The random order in which the 'before' and 'after' bits of the 3 stories are mixed around, could confuse some viewers who are not attentive or who don't want to take the effort. This movie requires a bit of serious viewing. But it's different and novel. When the end, start and middle of the movie are mish mashed around, it breaks down our formal thinking process of a first, middle and last act of the movie. It also adds suspense and curiosity to see what transpired in between when we see the start,end and certain middle parts one after the other and then spend the rest of the time curious to know what happened in between and to fit the pieces of the puzzle. Not a conventional film, not for everyone but a good film neverthless.<br /><br />And the title "21 grams" actually refers to suppossed loss of weight when a person dies. So when a body dies it looses the soul and in the movie we are told 21 grams is what the 'soul' weighs and we thus weigh lesser by 21 grams after death.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

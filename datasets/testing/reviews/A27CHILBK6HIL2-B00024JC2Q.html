<meta name="summary" content="Much More Enjoyable Than Anchorman & Dodgeball"></head><body><p>MOVIE: After seing the dissapointments that were Dodgeball and Anchorman I decided to give Ben Stiller and the gang one more chance. Boy am I glad I did. This movie was a truly funny movie that did not force the audience to laugh by doing crazy things. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson really clicked in this movie and that really helped the experience. The movie is not a parody, it's not making fun of the 70's like Anchorman is. This is just a funny spin on a classic tv show, and sure you'll find a little spoof on things here and there.. It's not as over the top as Zoolander, which was a very vivid parody on the modeling world. This was a good comedy that I really enjoyed. I really hate comparing it to Dodgeball and Anchorman but I have to because all the cast members are in each of these movies except for Owen Wilson. I actually found Will Ferrel funnier in here than I did in Anchorman. Never will this movie force you to laugh nor will it have crazy things that have no reference whatsoever. So, if you need to wash that bad taste of Dodgeball and Anchorman out of your mouth then this is the movie to do it with. Great to own, a must to rent.<br /><br />  VIDEO: The video turned out great for this kind of movie. There are a lot of bright colors in this movie and every thing was sharp and crisp. Ususally red is a nightmare for movies because it blurs very easily, but Starsky's car was so very shiny on my HDTV.<br /><br />  AUDIO: The standard 5.1 mix does the job, and actually will surpass your expectations. It certainly surpassed mine.<br /><br />  PACKAGING / EXTRAS: Oh my! Another single disc release from Warner in an Armary case. Maybe they got rid of those cheap snapper cases for good, but there is no insert. The extras are a bit wimpy as well. You have a commentary by the director, a funny take on making of documentaries, a look at Snoop Dog's character, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a trailer. You will breeze through these in one day. Thankfully the movie was enjoyable.<br /><br />  MOVIE SCORE: (* * * *)<br />  DVD SCORE: (7 / 10)</p></body></html>

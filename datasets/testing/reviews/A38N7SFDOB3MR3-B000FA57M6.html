<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad. 57 out of 100."></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie. I expected little, as I generally do as a Sci-fi fan, and got more than I expected. While Doom isn't a classic on par with Aliens, it kept my interest and I didn't regret watching it. I was immersed in the story, and felt entertained and like I had left my borning life on planet earth and entered into the story.<br /><br />The only part I didn't care for was the Rock's character turn at the end when he shot the young soldier. That was rather pointless.<br /><br />I would watch it again - and there are few Sci-fi products I can say that about.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 57<br /><br />34 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />5 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />8 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />4 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />5 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />1 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Just So Gross!"></head><body><p>I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.  Now I realize that it does have a plot, and a very good one.  I don't recall any other movie where ghosts have trouble trying to scare living people out of a house and have to hire another ghost who claims to be an expert.  However, after this set-up happens, THAT'S when the movie becomes a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.<br /><br />Whenever someone mentions Beetlejuice, I think of nothing else but all the weird stuff that's in it.  For instance, when the ghosts try to leave the house, they wind up in some crazy desert place where giant sandworms threaten to eat them.  The movie doesn't do a great job of explaining where this place is, but I think it's the planet Saturn.  Needless to say, since the ghosts can't leave their house, it definitely motivates them to scare away the living people moving in (a bunch of weirdos by the way, so that provides some extra incentive)<br /><br />Then there's the lost souls room, the guy stretching out his head to look like some sort of chicken, the shrimp cocktail turning into hands, Beetlejuice living in a model of the city, the chalk-drawn door opening up to a portal, and the moving art statues.  This movie is just flat-out bizarre.  There's so much that's packed into it.<br /><br />But its kind of a downer that the afterlife is shown as some kind of overly-administrative going to and fro, where you have to read a handbook, wait in an office, talk to a case worker, and do all other kinds of boring things.<br /><br />Here's the kicker.  I work in a funeral home, and this movie STILL grosses me out.  Walking dead folks are all over the place.  Some sawn in half, others flattened by a truck, and Beetlejuice himself looks to have some kind of mild skin decomposition.  But by far the scene that's hardest to stomach is the seance.  The ghosts are summoned in their wedding outfits only to grow older and older until they start to fall apart.  I should be thankful that they weren't shown as green and bloated throughout the whole movie, since drowning's the thing that killed them.<br /><br />This is one of the most original and disgusting films you'll ever see.  I think everybody should see it once, just to see how bizarrely creative it is.  Obviously a whole heck of a lot of work went into it.  Beetlejuice himself made me laugh quite a bit, with lines like, "Attention K-Mart shoppers!" but he sure did gross me out a lot too.<br /><br />I kind of wish Burton would have stayed away from the Halloween type movies and did more stuff like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  I've been wanting to see Big Fish for a while, but I heard its not very good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Big Fat Enjoyment & Laughter"></head><body><p>This movie definitely received a lot of hype - but for good reason. A relatively unknown comedienne was discovered by Rita Wilson (actress and wife of Tom Hanks) and her story was put on film - and it starred the unknown comic, not some Hollywood-type, plastic person.  You do not have to be Greek to enjoy this film. The main character (Toula, played by creator/author Nia Vardalos) is growing up as a chubby, hairy, lonely girl in a very Greek, very large home with very eccentric relatives. Her family holds fast to strong family values and unlike all too many families today, they hold strongly to their ethnic traditions.<p>Vardalos tells the story of her life, her loving & nutty family and how she made the decision to change her appearance, education and attitude at age 30 to pursue her dreams. From her father's love of his own Greek heritage to his obsession with the miracle healing powers of Windex, the viewer will quickly fall in love with these quirky characters, warts and all.<p>Despite some deeply held biases, her family is very loving, if not over-protective. When they find out she has been dating a non-Greek man, they go bonkers... but they come around and grow to love their soon-to-be son-in-law.<p>The movie is less about the wedding and more about the family... the positives and negatives of growing up in a big, loud, loving family and how true love conquers all. Best of all, this is based on the true life story of lead actress Nia Vardalos.<p>Her real life husband portrays the friend/colleague of her husband in the film and many of her own relatives made cameos through out.<p>Great acting, great comedic timing and an over-all feel-good film. Family safe? That depends. It is definitely implied that the lead characters have a less than platonic relationship before they are married, but there are no [love] scenes and no nudity in  the film. It's up to the parents to decide what age is appropriate for their kids on this one. A really young child may not appreciate what is going on, but anyone 12 and up should get a kick out of this movie.</p></body></html>

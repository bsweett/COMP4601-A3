<meta name="summary" content="Wildly Uneven, But Very Funny in Spots"></head><body><p>I finally got to see this Will Ferrell vehicle.  Parts of the film were just hilarious, parts not so much, some gross (well, more than some, but we're talking Will Ferrel here), and some tender and romantic (just kidding!).<br /><br />With over 400 reviews here, I'm not going to re-state the plot or comment on much other than my over-all reaction to the film.  First of all, if you're a Ferrell fan, this is a must-see.  Even if you're not, it's worth the price of admission.  Ferrell is his typical over-grown teenager (again) in Anchorman.  He plays a man-child who is vain, dumb, clueless, awkward, and somewhat sentimental.  He loves his dog, his own mug, his friends, and not much else.<br /><br />There are fights, sing-alongs, dog punting, dog survival, bikers, women-libbers, homoeroticism, cute girls, sterile apartments, teleprompters, and a zoo.<br /><br />Mildly recommended.  If the film were edited down a bit to get rid of some of the more stupid scenes (arms getting ripped off, a wild melee between news crews), this would be a better film.  Ferrell is terrifically talented, but only in a set way.  One can compare Ferrell with another SNL alumnus, Bill Murray.  Murray shows range in films such as 'The Razor's Edge' and 'Lost in Translation'.  One cannot imagine Ferrell pulling off either of those films.<br /><br />Three-and-a-half stars for 'Anchorman'.</p></body></html>

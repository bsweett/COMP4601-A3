<meta name="summary" content="Historical tradegies make for difficult film review."></head><body><p>Reviewing this film is difficult as there seems to be several camps at work here that will find fault with whatever one writes about this important film.  I would like to take time to address these camps as in introduction to my review.<br /><br />Some argue that this moment in our history is so terrible, so ungodly, so inhumane and still so raw in our memory that any attempts by Hollywood to reproduce that time is an insult to the memory of the victims and shows Hollywood for all its callousness and greed.  I agree that some passage of time is necessary for us to heal from pain, but we can't ignore that the medium of film is a form of memorial as much as any plaque, statue, or monument.  In addition, one should recognize that film can be and often is a cathartic experience that allows us to express our hurt and, thus, aid in the healing process.  Therefore, it is not, in my view, so questionable for Hollywood to make a film about a fairly recent tragedy, but it is questionable whether boycotting such films serves the purpose intended by those who believe we should.<br /><br />Should we boycott such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXTG">Pearl Harbor</a>, and  all other such films based upon true tragedies because one can view them as profiteering off of another's pain?  I would think that it is more important that we never forget the various tragedies in history and film does assist with that.  How about boycotting films about natural disasters, famous murders and murderers or films about those mentally or physically challenged?  Isn't someone profitting off of these tragedies as well?  Shouldn't we boycott them too?<br /><br />I think this is all just too extreme.  Yes, films need to make a profit, but that doesn't mean a film is devoid of purpose or that it can't be beneficial to many outside of weighing box-office receipts.  Can these films, while making a profit, not provide a fitting tribute to those victims and the survivors, and, in the end, provide some comfort?  I think so.<br /><br />The other problem with Hollywood, and it's been around since the silent era, is the viewpoint or vision presented by those making a film.  As far as a film being bias with the writer's or director's unique perspective, or an actor's interpretation of a character (real or not) is a rather moot point as that is a given with ANY film and, quite frankly, any work of art.  It is THEIR take on a topic just as an impressionistic painter is creating his view of something onto canvass.  The medium is different, but both have a right to their perspective.  I do agree, however, that when dealing with great human tragedy one must be very careful in how he interprets and presents facts, but one's personal bias can rarely ever be objectively overcome no matter the medium of expression.  If this is all new to you, then you need to stop watching films completely until you come to terms with this reality as this has been around since the dawn of film making.<br /><br />For those that criticize Hollywood for "taking advantage of the victims and their survivors" let's not ignore that the families connected to this film gave their stamp of approval for it to be made (Hollywood rarely ever even asks for that) and were extremely satisfied with the end result.  Also, a portion of the money made from this film benefits them (via a memorial).  That is rarely done in Hollywood and they deserve some praise for doing that.  So much for callous greed.  This also means that boycotting this film may actually be hurtful to these families that deserve whatever we can give them either monetarily or via a memorial.<br /><br />The other camp in relation to making films about historical tragedies finds that any criticism of the film an insult to the memory of the people in which the film relates.  Sadly, these folks have difficulty seeing the difference between criticizing a film and criticizing people or an event.  I was a bit disappointed with Oliver Stone's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTRKE">World Trade Center</a> for cinematic reasons, but I quickly found myself defending my own patriotism in the comment section of that review (that section has since been "edited").  I ran into similar issues when criticizing the recent Disney TV remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059XV6">The Miracle Worker</a> (the true story of Helen Keller).  Criticizing such films does not make me unamerican or intolerant of those with disabilities.  Finding fault with "United 93" doesn't mean one doesn't appreciate what those individuals went through that day.  The film may be based on true events, but that doesn't mean the film itself or the director's vision is flawless.<br /><br />Now there is one other camp at work here, and they are the "conspiracy theorists" who have decided to use this forum not to review a film, but rather to exploit the victims of 9/11 in a manner worse than anything Hollywood could do and indirectly cause much more harm to us than what the terrorists did on that fateful day.  We have the right to freedom of speech, but we are expected to use that appropriately too.  I can't yell "FIRE" in a crowded movie theater without criminal consequences.  In that light, I don't march, shout obscenities, or picket the funerals of our soldiers because I may not believe in a war our country asked them to fight as that is not MORALLY my place to exercise my so-called freedom of speech and is unnecessarily hurtful to others who are already suffering.  This is called using discretion and it's what our founding fathers expected us to use.<br /><br />To read on here, in what is supposed to be just reviews for a film, and find what are merely personal assertions (with little or no facts), propaganda by groups seeking "the truth" (as long as it fits their myopic views), and slander regarding that tragic day on 9/11 without regard for the individuals truly involved is rather disheartening and certainly self-serving by those involved who have little concept of the "truth" other than some website they try to direct us to which often contain little more than hearsay, doctored photographs, and other such nonsense.<br /><br />Even if I agreed with all these conspiracy theorists and "9/11 Truth" groups and I ignored any and all evidence to the contrary and sincerely believed that the events of 9/11 were the result of an "inside job", television special effects, government propaganda, fantasy and so forth, I would NEVER think of so vocally expressing that here, which may be my right, because if I am wrong in my assertion, the harm I would inflict on the actual families and friends of those who personally suffered from the events of 9/11 would be unthinkable to me.  I have read far too many "this was all faked by the government" or "it never happened" comments and "reviews" (I use the term loosely here) that I can't imagine the deep hurt experienced by those who truly did lose loved ones that day even though I am one of them."  For me, personally, this is beyond cruel and literally inflicts more harm than anything the terrorist did that day.  Are we ALL allowed our opinion?  YES, but some discretion is called for in such extreme situations such as those connected to 9/11 and some form of decency, respect, and discretion should be paramount before we open our mouths or type on the computer.<br /><br />Now having addressed both camps and the conspiracy theorist group that have more than made themselves know here by commenting, sometimes viciously, on one's review I offer my perspective on this film.  "United 93" is an extraordinary film that plays out more as a small independent docu-drama than a traditional big-budget Hollywood film.  Paul Greengrass's direction is straight-forward, confident and unobtrusive; however, his script faults in just a few places where some stilted dialogue is present.  His brilliant casting of unknowns (actors or even the real people involved in some cases) was a respectful move in order to not promote a specific star's career and this allowed the focus to be on the real-life characters portrayed within the film with no distractions.<br /><br />In addition, while some have criticized the film for being overly speculative, I found it rather fair treatment of events that unfolded that day as careful analysis of cell/plane calls, witness testimonies (some even by phone), news reports, aircraft recording devices, government documents, and so forth were the foundation for much of what was presented in this film.  Contrary to the callousness of our conspiracy theorists there is no solid evidence for Greengrass to consider of United 93 being shot down or having landed in some secret location.  In fact, all the evidence concretely contradicts these ludicrous notions.  There speculative moments within the film as we can't know exactly what was said and done at all times on that flight; however,  ALL films, I'll say it again, ALL films on true events are speculative by nature and events are often open to interpretations.  I simply found this film to be realistic and fair based upon what was known about that day.  I felt good judgment was used in presenting what happened and what most likely happened that day on United 93.<br /><br />Our heroes, as presented in this film, where very much the way I imagine them to be: ordinary people who were scared to death.  There was no Jason Bourne or John McClane on board United 93, just everyday ordinary people placed in an extraordinary situation.  Some were too scared to do anything, some were in a state of panic, some prayed for deliverance, some just hoped for the best, and some took desperate measures.  ALL were heroes for facing what I would never want to face myself.  Facing death, even when afraid of it, is heroic, especially when it is forced upon us.<br /><br />The film is in "real time" and that heightens the tension and our appreciation for what those poor souls experienced that day.  This allows the story to move swiftly and with purpose as it demonstrates the overall feeling of confusion that occurred that day.  Most of us could not believe what was happening and it didn't matter if we were the everyday guy on the street, a government official, a pilot, or a teacher in the middle of a lesson as I was that day.  We were all caught off guard and in disbelief and this film captures that well.  There are no unnecessary diverging scenes within this film.<br /><br />I found this film to be generally flawless (except for some dialogue problems at times), one of the best of 2006, and a fitting tribute to those who so bravely faced what most of us would find unimaginable.  "United 93" is a haunting, frightening, realistic, moving film, and a triumph of the human spirit.  I know that is a cliche term, but it is most fitting here.<br /><br />In conclusion it important to observe that we all lost something on 9/11, some indirectly and some directly.  As former New Yorkers, my wife and I lost co-workers, friends, and a sense of security oddly found in the skyline of that great city that no longer looks as it did when we last were there.  We both worked in and around The World Trade Centers (I actually witnessed them be built).  I worked at the base in a department store and my wife worked on the 96th floor for a bank.  It's hard to imagine that most of our co-workers and friends from there are gone.  I have yet to return to New York, but I know I will one day; I must.  In the meantime, I find films like "United 93" to be an emotional outlet, a reminder of the fragility of life and the evil man is capable of committing, and the fight to survive that is in all of us.<br /><br />This is why I defend the making of such films on 9/11 and why I'm also so appalled at the callousness of some here abusing their freedom of speech by shouting such obscenities as "this didn't happened", "it's a big cover-up", or "it's all fiction" and back it up with websites that are an insult to the memory of those who perished that day.  I guess my friend present at the WTC didn't see that plane hit it as she said she did.  It was television special effects or a bomb planted by our government to mislead us.  I guess both the flight recorder and those who spoke to loved ones on United 93 moments before the attempt to break into the cockpit had it all wrong as well as they were "shot down by our own Air Force" or "landed safely in a secret location" as our conspiracy theorists claim or have doctored photos to "prove it."  My dad once told me that it is "better to be silent and only thought to be a foul then to open your mouth and remove all doubt about it."<br /><br />According to our conspiracy theorist those of us who witnessed or were otherwise connected to 9/11 have it all wrong and have been fooled by the government that set out this elaborate plan in which it would take thousands to orchestrate and keep secret) to kill thousands of American lives and destroy national landmarks in order to create a war for fun while wrecking the already financially crippled airline industry and putting a death grip on our overall economy that would take years in which to recover.  The same people who would have us believe that utter nonsense are now shouting how we should dishonor those we lost that day by pretending the events of 9/11 never happened and check out their websites to review doctored "evidence."  I think not.  These individuals embarrass themselves and only assist at rubbing salt in a hard to heal wound that was made by the terrorists that clear day on September 11th.  A day that should be remembered as it was and not as we would like it to have been and shame on the revisionists in our society who are nothing more than selfish attention seekers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the last three Star Wars movies I've seen."></head><body><p>This film got mixed reviews upon release back in '04 and I finally got around to seeing it last night when I plopped it in my DVD player and played it through the little flatscreen unit next to my treadmill.<br /><br />I had no expectations at all so I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie was.  I expected something like a 1930's Flash Gordon type cliff hanger, and it was very much like that.<br /><br />The visuals are beautiful; the story moves briskly along but the plot is sufficiently developed given the kind of movie it is.  I loved the gadgets!  The music was completely appropriate and enjoyable and fit the retro cliff hanger atmosphere.  I could tell a lot of work went into this movie.<br /><br />And, guess what?  The actors could actually act!  I didn't think they acted quite as well as they could have, but it must have been difficult since probably much of their acting was done in front of a blue screen.  They must have had to imagine what many of the scenes were going to end up looking like.  So, I deducted one star due to the fact that we had accomplished actors very obviously (to me anyway) not doing their best work.  They seemed way to relaxed way too much of the time considering the danger they were surrounded by for much of the story.<br /><br />So, it's a fun film, and a great way to walk away 400 calories.<br /><br />Postscript:  Bonus features are neat!  There is a multi-part documentary on the making of the movie which is an interesting and inspiring story in and of itself.</p></body></html>

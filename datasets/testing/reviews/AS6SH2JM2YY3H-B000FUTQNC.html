<meta name="summary" content="Predictable yet entertaining... it's Harrrrrison Ford!"></head><body><p>This movie is a Harrison Ford, "ordinary Joe" just minding his own business and the bad guys butt in and threaten his family, punches that look like they hurt, and hair and clothes get mussed and dirty, type movie.<br /><br />Harrison Ford has these roles in Air Force One, The Fugitive, and Patriot Games. The good guy wins, but he pays for it. In Firewall, Ford is a bank security specialist whose family is held hostage unless he helps the bad guys rob his own bank. Ford rolls with the punches (literally) and thinks up an alternative strategy (reminded me of Mel Gibson's character in Ransom).<br /><br />There are some interesting twists in the screenplay. Police were practically nonexistent in this movie... the viewer was always just ahead of them. The bad guys were pretty bad, which is a trend in today's movies... emotionless scoundrels. You wished you knew what happened the day after the movie ended... was Ford fired, his secretary rehired, and the money returned? Where did that money go, anyway... it was taken out of the bad guys accounts and put in...?<br /><br />Who cares?! This film had lots of the action expected in a Harrison Ford movie. That is all I expected, and I wasn't disappointed.</p></body></html>

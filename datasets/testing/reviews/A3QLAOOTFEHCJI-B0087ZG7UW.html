<meta name="summary" content="Lustrous Blu-ray version of a Hitchcock classic"></head><body><p>Having seen this movie several times over the years, I tend to watch at it without the dread of being shocked by the shower scene.  Looking at this lustrous Blu-ray version, I noticed that when Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) drags out the body of recently slashed Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) you can see faint panty lines. Ah, the modesty of the 60's.  Hitchcock raised the bar very high with this superior horror film and proved that the genre didn't always have to be full of blood and schlock.  What was shocking in this masterpiece is that it was so startling, compounded by the music with emphasis on heavy violin work.  It was also unheard of that the "A" list star would be butchered so early in the film.  Frankly, the second murder of the private detective (Martin Balsam) is equally shocking but then he's not a naked Janet Leigh.  Perkins is brilliant as the shy Norman with a dark secret.  The byplay between him and Marion in the parlor prior to the murder is a terrific set up.  Also watch him when Sam (John Gavin) puts pressure on him later in the film.  Perhaps more than any other film, "Psycho" turned the film industry on its head and made horror films mainstream.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sci-fi fantasy in art deco style"></head><body><p>Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are paired as a pilot and a journalist in conquest to save the world from the mad scientist.  This scientist has created robots who are overtaking New York.  There is a mysterious assassin trying to kill off all the remaining scientists who can prevent the apocalipse.<br /><br />Part adventure, part romance, part nostalgic movie set in art deco style, this film has feel and touch of the old era.  Although at one point there is a clip of the movie "Wizard of Oz" which must have been filmed more that 30 years ago.  That confused me a little bit.  If it was supposed to be a metaphor for Paltrow's character in this movie, I have not quite got the message.<br /><br />This movie is cute and unpretentious but easy to let go of once you've seen it.</p></body></html>

Of course, the special effects are splendid (Storm calling up the weather, Magneto at work, his henchman Toad hopping about flourishing an incredible tongue, shapechanger Mystique, and Wolverine's claws, to name a few), and Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier was an inspired casting choice.  But there's a certain darkness to the movie that isn't just about Marvel angst (I would have preferred to see the costumes from the original comics rather than a generic uniform, for one thing).  What's more, the focus is less on the X-Men as a whole than on Wolverine (perhaps to be expected considering his fan base!) and Magneto.  And even without being able to read Magneto's mind, it seems that a genius like Xavier, with the advantage of his long acquaintance with Magneto, would at least entertain the possibility that it's Rogue, not Wolverine, that he wants.  (Wolvie, after all, has apparently been out and about for a while before we meet him by way of Rogue, the newly-fledged Mississipian mutant who has run away from home in terror of what her powers do to people.)  On the other hand, Magneto is a villain with whom one can almost sympathize (especially considering that we learn early on that he survived the Nazi Holocaust and therefore fears that mutants may be the target of another such program--or should that be pogrom?).  I'm hoping that the subsequent chapters will give Cyclops, Jean Gray, and Storm more chance to shine.  On balance, though, it's a well-done action movie with a strong underlying message, and could well serve as a springboard for some good family discussions.</p></body></html>

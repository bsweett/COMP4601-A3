<meta name="summary" content="Jason Bourne on Meth, Crack, and Cocaine all at once- I love it!"></head><body><p>Released overseas about half a year ago and widely acclaimed, Taken is the new action flick written by Luc Bession, who did the very famous Leon: The Professional. If you were satisfied with the pure straight Balls To The Wall action style that Leon offered, look no further than Taken, with Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace! Taken is an action movie that just is pure energy and action from beginning to end.<br /><br />In "Taken", Liam Neeson plays Bryan, an ex-CIA agent who is divorced from his wife, yet still sees his Daughter on a regular basis. His latest thing he's done is protect a repressed pop singer from a violent riot that happens after a concert of hers. Later, he learns that his daughter wants to go to Europe with her friend, and he very reluctantly lets her. Within the very first hour of their arrival in Paris, they are both captured by two people, and Bryan, being the overprotective flake he is, learns that these two people addict the girls they capture to drugs, and eventually, within 96 hours, they become prostitutes in the European Sex Slave Trade. Bryan travels to Paris to save her. He has 96 hours to find her and get her to safety or it's too late!<br /><br />More effective than an energy drink, this movie wastes no time and just gets straight to the point right away. There's lots of great action, and the finale on the boat is a total "WHOA" moment. The only problem I had with this film is that even though I loved it, I had the feeling as if I had seen it before somewhere. Usually, with these types of action films, you've seen one, you've seen it all.<br /><br />But overall this is a great, fist-clenching action thriller, very well made and a great way to spend 90 minutes. Don't miss this movie, because you will be "taken" in by its action!</p></body></html>

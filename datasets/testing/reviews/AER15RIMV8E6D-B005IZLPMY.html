When I first saw it, I thought it didn't have enough action and started out pretty slow. But the more I see it, I appreciate it more. The action scenes were pretty awesome. It had beautiful scenery, a decent cast, some funny moments, and Captain America's costume was really cool. (Hayley Altwell did a great job as Peggy Carter. She was very pretty, and looked like she was from the 40's.)<br /><br />Steve Rogers is too skinny and weak to join the military in 1942. He is offered a chance to be the first in the "Super-Soldier" experiment. He soon becomes tall and muscular and becomes a national treasure as 'Captain America' with an awesome motorcycle and bulletproof American flag shield. He must stop Red Skull from destroying the world with a cubed jewel. If you enjoy Marvel Comic movies, you might enjoy CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There Will Be Greed"></head><body><p>Director Paul Thomas Anderson ("Magnolia") achieves something very rare in films, he manages to create a really extraordinary film whose main character Daniel Plainview played by Daniel Day-Lewis ("My Left Foot") is for the most part reprehensible. With the exception of rare moments of affection for his deaf son, whose deafness is caused by an accident at his father's oil wells, Plainview cares for no one on earth, hates most people, is highly competitive and filled with unstoppable greed and ambition.<br /><br />The film is based on a novel by Upton Sinclair OIL and is set in the early decades of the 20th century when a lot of Americans acted like Plainview-- to a lesser degree we hope-- in their quest for wealth at whatever expense.<br /><br />The critics could not get enough of this film. Daniel Day-Lewis earned an Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of Plainview. While he is supported by good performances by other actors, notably that of Paul Dano ("Little Miss Sunshine") as the hell-fire minister of the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli Sunday, the film ultimately belongs to Day-Lewis.<br /><br />In addition to his statement about greed, Anderson also shoots a nice arrow into fundamentalist, crazy religion. The soundtrack works very well, particularly the use of the beautiful Brahms Violin Concerto.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how this film holds up in the years ahead, but for now it is still white-hot.</p></body></html>

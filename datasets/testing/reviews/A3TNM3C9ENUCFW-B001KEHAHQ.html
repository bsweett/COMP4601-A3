<meta name="summary" content="Martin, not so pretty in pink"></head><body><p>OK, Steve Martin is a funny guy, and has made some good comedys over the last few years, he's also made some howlers and one suspects that his material choices are cause for the blame. Here is a classic example of a bad idea, you shouldn't fix what isn't broken even if your trying to bring a cult classic to a whole new audience. The main problem is not that the character, is bigger than the actor, rather that the character WAS the actor, and watching Steve Martin, trying to play Sellers, playing Clouseau is a mess. Using the idea that this is a prequel doesn't do him any favors either. A Shot in the Dark introduced Sellers as Clouseau back in 1964, in arguably one of his funniest turnouts, alongside his long suffering boss Dreyfuss (the inimitable Herbert Lom) and a superbly dry supporting role by the late George Sanders. Here Martin relies way to much on some very ridiculous sight gags, and struggles with some awful dialogue as he attempts to recover the famous "Pink Panther" diamond, stolen during a football game at the beginning of the movie. His sidekick Ponton played by the always pleasing Jean Reno attempts to mirror the Bert Kwok character of Cato, only without any of the bumbling pathos of the originals, and even Kevin Kline playing Dreyfuss, can't lift this picture out of mediocrity. One has to tip their hat to Martin et al, for taking on a remake of sorts where the bar had been previously set so high, but wonders if an allegorical character based pastiche would have been more appropriate. The movie has some funny moments, but overall is a real let down. I had expected it to be OK but no where near as good as the original, but even going in with this pragmatic approach, I was left disappointed. A real shame.</p></body></html>

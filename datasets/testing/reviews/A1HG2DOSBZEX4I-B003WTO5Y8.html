<meta name="summary" content="Criterion Collection Disc"></head><body><p>This review will discuss the merits of the now rare and out of print Criterion Collection version of the film. One of the questions a viewer needs to ask him or herself is whether or not the added expense of a rare edition can be justified.<br /><br />The Criterion dics presents the film in a letter boxed widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 which appears to be the correct shooting format used by cinematographer Tak Fujimoto. The sound is standard 2.0 Dolby Surround. This is a fairly new film and the Criterion transfer appears to be reference quality. I have heard that there is an inexpensive collector's edition by MGM that presents the transfer as a widescreen anamorphic with a 5.1 surround mix. For pure picture quality either way you go is probably fine.<br /><br />There is really no reason to discuss the plotting of the film. It is well recognized that the acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins as the two leads is amazing. Both went on to win Academy Awards for their work. The Ted Talley screenplay was also give the Oscar for iis adaptation of the Thomas Harris source material.<br /><br />The biggest feature of the Criterion Edition is a commentary track featuring director Jonathan Demme, actors Foster and Hopkins, screenwriter Talley and FBI agent John Douglas. As far as I can tell this is the only edition that offers a commentary track. The track is informative and is a good listen. The Criterion Disc features seven deleted scenes taken from a workprint (timecode is included). Most of these scenes are unnecessary but two reveal a dropped plotline that is rather interesting. The rest of the film extras include storyboard galleries and a storyboard to film comparison of the Memphis jail break.<br /><br />Two rather interesting features are pure textual. There is a lengthy series of excerpts from the FBI Field Classification Manual on Sexual Homicide prepared by John Douglas ans a feature called Voices of Death which is a series of quotes by convicted seriel killers prepared by Michael Newsom from his book. All in all these features  compose a great deal of material on the criminal mind and should not be skipped.<br /><br />The Criterion Disc is well suited to fans of the film or to those with an interest in the subject matter. It is also well worth seeking out for the Criterion completist.</p></body></html>

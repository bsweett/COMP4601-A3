The Hills Have Eyes 2 was the other one. This movie starts off like a seizure with the camera being jerked around so much it felt like an ode to Blair Witch Project. Then he gets on a boat and sails away to peace and quiet. Then two kids uncover a survivor while roaming the empty streets and all hell breaks loose. It was a watchable movie but I would not rank it as one of the best horror movies of the year. Come to think of it, 2007 wasnt really a great time for horror movies. The only two movies I thought were worth watching was The Mist and 1408. Dont believe the hype though, this movie is alright but the first one was better.</p></body></html>

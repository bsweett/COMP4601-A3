<meta name="summary" content="Indulgent acting mars what might have been a hard-edged story. At least we can see Rosemary Harris show us the real goods"></head><body><p>The contradictions, and especially the indulgences, in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows Your Dead are queasily evident in the first and last scenes. In the first, which pops up as soon as the lights dim, we have a nude, pale, flabbily fat actor doing Pin the Tail on the Donkey with a nude actress on her knees, hips high, in front of him. The only image that came to mind was of a quivering Moby Dick throwing the harpoon at Mrs. Ahab.<br /><br />The last scene -- spoilers alert! -- gives us an old man who had to study like a son of a gun just to pass his written driver's test suddenly smart and clever enough to know how to fake out a heart monitor machine in a busy hospital so he could smother to death a gunshot victim and not be caught.<br /><br />In between these two points are the bones of a hard-edged story of unlikable people that could have been a classic. Instead, we admire the potential but are bored by a lot of the show-off flash. Lumet has always had the reputation of an actors' director, a man who can pull great performances from a cast. Actors, in turn, have always been eager to work with Lumet. At least in part, now we know why. Frequently with this movie, the story, the tension and our interest come to a screeching halt when Lumet permits Philip Seymore Hoffman as Andy to plunge headfirst into "acting"...or to permit Ethan Hawke as Hank to plunge headfirst into "acting"...or to permit the two of them to share intense scenes of "acting," all the while with the camera respectfully observing the performances. Only a disciplined director able to impose his will on actors will be able to convince most actors that less is more. It seldom happens here, and the movie -- despite the potential for classic unhappiness and despite scenes of real tension -- winds up as self-conscious melodrama. This is a frustrating situation because Hoffman is riveting at times as a slick, sick manipulator whose life for quite a while has been on the down escalator. Hawke as Andy's shlumpf of a younger brother is stuck in a losing role as an unsympathetic weakling. Albert Finney as their father, who, with his adored wife, owns a small jewelry store, does Albert Finney again. To give him credit, he picks up steam when his character decides to be the avenging angel.<br /><br />It's Andy's plan to rob his parents' store that goes bad, but it's Hoffman's indulged acting, approved by Lumet, that's the real crime. Even some of the secondary actors, particularly Michael Shannon as Dex, over emote...and actors playing secondary characters wouldn't do that without the specific encouragement of the director. Rosemary Harris, as the two brothers' mother and Finney's wife, does the real acting. Harris is one of the great actresses of the American and British stage (and the mother of Jennifer Ehle). Her role is brief, just two real scenes. One shows her affection for her aging husband and the other as the frightened victim of the robbery who decides to resist. Harris knows the value of less is more. She gives to a small part real strength and motivation, and makes Finney's motivation for revenge believable. The irony is that while many movie fans will be thrilled by Hoffman's performance, most probably won't even notice how good Harris is or even recognize her name.<br /><br />Lumet must have been aiming for tragic drama but he wound up with the Hollywood version. This was a real disappoint for me because I have a lot of respect for Lumet and for a number of his actors.</p></body></html>

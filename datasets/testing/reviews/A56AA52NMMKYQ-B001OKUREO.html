It is not quite a hatchet job but will be enough to irritate Bushies.  The plot line of sibling rivalry between W. and brother Jeb is pure speculation, eclipsed by an Oedipal conflict with Bush the elder.<br /><br />The cast is extremely strong, especially with Richard Dreyfus channeling the essence of Dick Cheney.  Josh Broland as W. turns in a masterful performance.<br /><br />Many more years are needed to offer a fair perspective on the Bush era.  In the meantime, Oliver Stone's over the top "adaptation" is entertaining and likely to hold your interest, whether you are a fan of The Decider or one of his detractors.</p></body></html>

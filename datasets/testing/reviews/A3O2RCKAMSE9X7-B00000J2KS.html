<meta name="summary" content="To Understand the Movie Understand the Title"></head><body><p>Movies that seem to focus on one apparent theme or set of visuals usually do not stand up to the ravages of time.  Whenever a director builds his movie on that single element, then if that element is no longer in synch with future audiences, this movie dates badly.  With A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director Stanley Kubrick made sure this would not happen.  Kubrick took the novel by Anthony Burgess and squeezed out the ultra violence that characterized the nihilistic teens of a vaguely futuristic England and grafted it onto the big screen.  Malcolm McDowell as Alex the Droog is a walking trunk of unleashed anger that feels unbound by the laws of morality that bind the rest of the world.  To him, the world exists only to serve as the backdrop against which he plays out his fantasies of sex and violence.  For Alex, as his inability to distinguish Beethoven from brutality indicates, is similarly unable to recognize that the violence that he sees daily on the screens of his milkbars originates not from them but from within himself.  <p>The novel suggests that Alex's violence is a learned response to the violence of a harsh world that is even more morally empty than Orwell's Oceania.  Kubrick implies that if violence is the problem then more violence is the solution.  If there ever were an unregenerate soul it is the teen Alex, and if any technique could regenerate him, then that technique ought to be seriously considered for widespread use.  The problem with that is that Kubrick's use of sight and sound mask the inner villainy of a solution that is, at least on the Christian level, as bad as the disease.  Human beings are human, not because they can do both good and evil, but because they are free to choose either.  When Alex is sufficiently brainwashed, what emerges is not a de-violenced Alex, but a totally different young man who only looks like his amoral predecessor but with whom he has nothing in common.  This Alex reminds one of nothing less than a morally inverted character from any novel from the Marquis de Sade.  If one can unlearn violence and have that process hailed, then the reversal of that same process can be hailed too--if one also believes that free willed evil is preferable to forced good.  <p>Such weighty issues of free will versus predetermination stamp A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as far more than the astounding melange of surreal violence accompanied by classical music that many critics have either praised it as thoughtful or condemned it as mindless.  What both the book and film emphasize is that if a thug like Alex can choose evil over good, then it is far better for society to punish him than punish the rest of us by forcing him to tread a path that to him might have once seemed ugly beyond belief.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blu Ray Review"></head><body><p>King Kong - The world's first blockbuster.  An epic for its time, 1933, and still memorable nearly 80 years later.  There's no doubt the movie is a classic, but the question is, how does this Blu Ray release fair to past releases and is it worth the upgrade?<br /><br />Well.. I'm torn.  The BD transfer IS good despite some who claim otherwise, you can tell this explicitly during intimate shots (Ex: not in the jungle) and especially during the opening credits, BUT for those seeking a really glossy high definition experience (example: the comparable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VWONB2">Casablanca [Blu-ray</a>]) King Kong probably isn't your best bet.  If, however, you're looking to have the best possible release King Kong has ever seen, this is it, for better or worse.  Considering the film's age and that many scenes were inhibited with misty jungle fog and primitive special effects, I have the feeling that the slightly hazy look of the picture isn't going to go away no matter how advanced film restoration has come along. Let me assure you it's not That bad, though.  Some of the reviews are making it to sound like it's unwatchable or messy, and it's really not.  If you've seen the movie before you know it's old and shows its age, but I assure you the DVD release is by far less clear than this BD.  There may not be a jaw-dropping difference like we see all the time with HD releases, but it is significant.<br /><br />Overall, I think you know whether or not you should get this.  For film fanatics, history buffs, King Kong enthusiasts, this is an easy purchase.  Kong is never going to look any younger and for that it's hard to place a price tag. But for the fan with little more than passing interest, eh, you can live without.  Worth renting for sure, but $20+ bucks is a little steep, slice of history or not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as it gets..."></head><body><p>I was surprised to discover that I really dislike this film.  I like James L. Brooks and most of the people involved - including Adam Sandler.  The picture starts out good enough - lots of snappy dialogue - but then it takes a wrong turn from which it never recovers: it becomes a tedious, plodding, melodrama.  The film seems to go on forever.<br /><br />One of the things that killed the picture for me is that I just didn't like the Paz Vega character.  This is disastrous as the movie expects the audience to fall in love with her.  I thought she was annoying.  I also had a lot of trouble with the ending, which is supposed to be bittersweet and uplifting, but I found it totally false and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Ultimately, the best thing about this movie was the shots of cooking.</p></body></html>

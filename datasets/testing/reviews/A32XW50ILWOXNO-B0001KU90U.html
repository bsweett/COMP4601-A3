<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful requiem for traditional warriors of all kinds"></head><body><p>Former Paramount studios chief Robert Evans used to call his holiday pictures "Christmas gifts to the world," and "The Last Samurai" is staged just so: Much of it is handsome, magnificent and morally decent, yet the movie is full of itself, in both solemnity and faraway gaze. Edward Zwick's latest giant is in need of a bit of exuberance to push it over into classic status, and the director never quite gets enough of it, and certainly not from star Tom Cruise, in permanent furrowed brow. <p>Developed from an interesting story by John Logan, "The Last Samurai" concerns Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a drunk, disillusioned cavalry solider in 1870s hired to train a "modernized" Japanese army defeat the legendary mountain samurais, whose "bushido" code of discipline has long defended the nation. The samurai are led by their last great fighter, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), fight by sword and bow, and have the fealty of the people. The upwardly mobile Japanese ambassador Omura (Masato Harada) has the ear of the young emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura). <p>Bushido code is such that Katsumoto would drop his sword if the emperor wished it so; until then, he leads charges against green Japanese troops. In one battle, pitched in the forest by fog light, he wounds Algren, captures him and ushers the captain to a mountain hideout to study his recovering enemy. The samurai village is beautifully realized; Zwick and cinematographer John Toll ("Braveheart") purposely create a utopia at high elevation. With a valley in the distance reminiscent of a fertile green ocean, Algren begins to adjust to the mood and practice of the warriors and prove himself worthy of it while kindling a romance with a samurai's widow (beautiful, expressive Koyuki).  <p>While Katsumoto may belong to an ancient order, he speaks English, displays a quick sense of humor and seeks to trade wisdom with Algren rather than merely dispensing it. His philosophy is unbending, but his moods aren't. Watanabe is so good because he plays against the expectation of the stern, authoritarian titan, and, with a smile, steals most of the scenes away from Cruise, who affects the broken man about as well as a naturally expressive actor can. <p>Inevitably, Algren wins a few mock battles and stands beside Katsumoto during a midnight ninja attack, setting the stage for Algren's conflicted return back to his old post in Tokyo, then his subsequent change of heart that leads to fierce final battle between tradition and guns, played out in the valley we've seen from afar the entire movie.<p>Four-act films are rare, but Zwick doesn't fight the built-in structure, uses it, in fact to cover all the political bases, punctuating the end of each with a clash of some sort. The ninja raid has a hint of Kurosawa, while the forest sequences echoes the Vietnam movies of Stone and Coppola. The final battle is a close cousin to "Braveheart" and deserves to be mentioned with it. Cruise and Watanabe worked the swords themselves, and betray no weaknesses. Zwick is a fabulous combat director, and considering the movie's scope, deserves a mention during awards season.<p>"The Last Samurai" never quite reconciles what movie it prefers to be. It forces a romance between Algren and Taka, the widow, when there's no time to develop it. It tacks on a needless, uplifting epilogue to a naturally earth-moving conclusion. The movie errs on the side of being disconsolate, too, in portraying the one-dimensionally evil Omura and Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), one of Algren's former superiors who enjoyed slaughtering innocents in Indian raids. Such stark lines of romance and villainy detract from the movie's underlying elegy of samurais courting death against the machines.</p></body></html>

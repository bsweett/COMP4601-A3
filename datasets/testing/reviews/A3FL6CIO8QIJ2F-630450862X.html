<meta name="summary" content=""Sissy Spacek Is Unforgettable!""></head><body><p>Sissy Spacek won a well deserved Oscar nomination as Best Actress for her portrayal as a shy teenager with powers of telekinesis who is harrassed by her classmates in "Carrie". This nomination is unheard of as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rarely acknowledges performances in horror films. "Carrie" is based on the splendid Stephen King novel and also stars John Travolta in one of his first films. Piper Laurie gives a blood chilling performance as Carrie's mother, a Bible -thumping woman who demands her daughter live a celibate and isolated life.<br /> The DVD is beautiful and comes with a collectible booklet featuring info on the film. Also included is a featurette featuring interviews with Spacek and others, an animated photo gallery, theatrical trailer, and an interview with director Brian DePalma. French and english subtitles are included with a running time of 1 hour and 38 minutes.<br /> "Carrie" spawned a sequel in 1999 called "Carrie 2" and a remake of the film was adapted for television on NBC in 2002.</p></body></html>

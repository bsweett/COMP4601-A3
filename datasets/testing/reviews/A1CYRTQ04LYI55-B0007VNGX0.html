<meta name="summary" content="Executed well against low expectations"></head><body><p>Perhaps the only movie that could come in with lower expectations of an adaptation of a video game is the sequel to an adaptation of a video game.  Despite (or perhaps because of?) such low expectations, the movie was remarkably well done.  The twists and turns of the plot were interesting, and not 100% predictable.  There was advancement of the broader story line of the t-virus:  A bioweapon that happens to turn the infected into flesh eating zombies.  Sounds simplistic?  Well, the story has more to it than that.<br /><br />Even from a non-zombie afficianado, it was a sequel worth watching.  Not a Casblanca classic, but perhaps in 20 years this will still be watched as a cult classic.</p></body></html>

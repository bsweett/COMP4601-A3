<meta name="summary" content="The Remake Goes Like Fast Rollercoaster But Has No Heart In It: And Where's Shelley Winters?"></head><body><p>`Poseidon' is of course the (second) remake of famous disaster movie `Poseidon Adventure' and the 2006 version comes with improved special effects. But what is truly remarkable about this new version is that it is shorter than the original by about 20 minutes. Wolfgang Petersen as director chose the opposite direction of King Kong,' and that is the real problem of this remake.<br /><br />`Poseidon' is, as you know, about the survival of the passengers in the titular doomed ocean liner. After the extremely dull opening 20 minutes, where we are introduced to the cardboard characters played by Kurt Russell, Josh Lucus, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, Freddy Rodriguez, Kevin Dillon, Stacy Ferguson, and Andre Braugher, the film suddenly gets into gear when a big `rogue wave' hits the ship, and completely overturns it.<br /><br />Now, WARNING. The sequences showing the disaster may be shocking to the younger kids as Petersen sticks to the `reality' of these scenes with lots of blood and dead bodies. The deaths are not suggested, but blatantly shown, with the state-of-the-art skills of ILM technicians.<br /><br />[EFFECT-RIDDEN] These effects about the water, fire, even explosions, are the only raison d'etre of this remake, and though you can easily see how and where Warner Bros. and other film companies spent as much as estimated $ 140 million, but you will never understand WHY.<br /><br />The 1972 original is sometimes (rightly, I think) accused of its corny dialogues or hammy acting, but the truth is we love the original `Poseidon Adventure' because of these corny and hammy actors. Shelley Winters' role might look ridiculous, yes, sure, but we love her for what she is, and love Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens too. It is still great fun to watch them even if the whole situation is totally unconvincing.<br /><br />What we get in this unnecessary remake is lots of actions that gradually changes from "catastrophic" to "overblown," and finally "very silly." I not only stopped caring who dies or not, but stopped caring what is happening on the big screen. I know I might be a little unfair, but for those who fondly remember the fun of watching the original and the other Irwin Allen productions, this remake is simply pointless except for the big, loud actions.</p></body></html>

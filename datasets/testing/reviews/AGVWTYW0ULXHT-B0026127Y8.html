<meta name="summary" content="Father knows best...death to any and all who threaten his little girl"></head><body><p>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired and divorced ex-spy, who now lives only for his estranged daughter.  The trouble is, while she seems happy enough to see him when he manages to meet her, usually she won't give him the time of day.  She's got all she wants from her enormously wealthy stepfather, and all she wants from her real father is permission to go to Paris.  He's reluctant because, as an ex-spy, I guess, he knows that Europe can be much more dangerous than most people think, especially for a naive young woman.  It turns out he's right, because the moment his daughter arrives with her friend in Paris, she's targeted and kidnapped by sex traffickers.  She manages to get a phone call off to her dad before she's abducted and immediately he's on the case - figures out who they are and plans do do much more than kick butt on his way to saving her.<br /><br />Directed by Pierre Morel, this film has all the marks of its producer and writer, Luc Besson.  Mills is a classic Bessonian hero - who does what he does without remorse, and ruthlessly, but all in the service of good old-fashioned family values.  Luc Besson's heroes tend to be jaded professionals, highly competent at killing but without direction in their lives until they discover that they are meant to save some innocent, to fix some kind of family crisis.  It's a weird mix of visceral violence and sentimentality.  He takes on anyone who gets in his way, anyone who threatens his daughter, anyone who even refuses to help him on his way, and, according to the bizarre but effective Hollywood action film logic that Bresson distills to its essence, it's all okay, it's all morally acceptable, and it all comes out in the end.  The basic principle is that the ends always justifies the means, especially if family is at stake.  In films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a>, there's something else at stake (lots of innocent lives, money, national security), but family is at the heart of it, and in this film that becomes the whole of it, sex trafficking merely becomes the vehicle, the focus for a father's rage.  Of course if you stop to think about it, you have to realize that this guy is a psychopath, and that there are proper channels for a reason, given the number of innocent lives he puts at risk on his quest to stop the bad guys - even though most of the bad guys he actually dispatches are truly bad.  Still, it's strange how easy it is, watching a film like this, to buy all that, and how hard it is not to.  It's a precise, taut, effective, action thriller, and Liam Neeson brings just the right mix of emotional intensity and ruthlessness for the audience to care about him and his emotional quest in spite of themselves.</p></body></html>

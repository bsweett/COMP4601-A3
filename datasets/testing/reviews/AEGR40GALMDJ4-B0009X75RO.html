Chicago is a new musical classic from the 21st Century.  The movie seems old even as if it was made in the golden years of MGM or Warner Brothers.  The acting was superb, the music was great, and the songs were addictive.  It is a very fast paced, sexy, vibrant outburst of crime and jazz in the 20s.  Renee Zellweger played the sweet innocent Roxie Hart.  Richard Gere plays another millionare, but this time he is a singing one.  My favorite acting from the film came from Queen Latifa, who played Mamma Morton, and Catherine Zeta- Jones who played the gruff and bold Velma Kelly.  All around the movie was awesomely put together.  It all blended into a fantastic film.  One of the best musicals ever.</p></body></html>

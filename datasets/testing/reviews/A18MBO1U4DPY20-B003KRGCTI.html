I was impressed with the cinematrography but it grew old and then I looked for the story which this film really doesn't have. I understand a lot of people have credited this film and some have even discussed their disagreement with the central character and wondered what religion he belongs to. I, sadly, am never going to reach that stage because this film doesn't deserve discussion. In some way, it's hopeless, lacks any half intelligent dialog, the only thing effective is the soundtrack, the action sequences are bizzare and I feel today's audience is too intelligent and a tad bit too impatient to sit through something like this. Atleast this is my opinion. The film had absolutely no premise, there is just one central character of Washington who acts like he's a messiah of some sort, at no point in this film is any wit, any humor, any heartfelt emotion displayed. I'm a big Washington fan but I was disappointed he made something like this.<br /><br />Because people have liked this, I would strongly recommend you watching it prior to buying.</p></body></html>

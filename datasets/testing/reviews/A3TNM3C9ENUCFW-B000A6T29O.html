<meta name="summary" content="Huge Disappointment"></head><body><p>There's something odd about a transition from a video game to a movie, and whereas it is often compared to comic book characters one would assume (after seeing this movie) it is much more difficult to carry off convincingly. Angeline Jolie is sultry, sexy and certainly focuses your attention, but the plot is thin, predictable and very silly in places. In trying to add suspense to a weak script the viewer is left with a comic depiction. The movie never intends to take itself seriuosly, and shouldn't considering that upon which it is based, but what starts out with such promise, ends in a contrived mess. One for a rainy day only</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, Great Cast, Great Period!"></head><body><p>After 30 years since its release, this movie with Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher and Danny DeVito is still a classic! I liked everything about it, the story, the cast and even the Oscars to prove it! Even though the language is strong, I liked what the movie presented. A must watch film!!</p></body></html>

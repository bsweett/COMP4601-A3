To be honest, I didn't really like this movie, apart from Norton's acting.  I just found that the movie dragged on and on.  When the movie ended I had to shake my head because there was such a plot twist at the end and I didn't see it coming at all.  That part was so well done.  It's too bad that the rest of the film wasn't as interesting.  It's not a perfect film but it is intriguing enough to have you watching the whole film.</p></body></html>

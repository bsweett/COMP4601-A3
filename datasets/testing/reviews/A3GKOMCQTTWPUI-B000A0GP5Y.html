<meta name="summary" content="The Longest Yard (DVD)"></head><body><p>Although less a review than a basic analogy, Peter Segal's 2005 remake of "The Longest Yard" is to Robert Aldrich's 1974 prison football epic as 2005 star Adam Sandler is to 1974 leading man Burt Reynolds.<br /><br />While Reynolds' Paul Crewe was a trademark '70s anti-hero, a pigskin-chucking sibling to the pragmatic rebels played by the likes of Jack Nicholson or Gene Hackman, the only real antecedent for Sandler's Crewe are the actor's own highly financially successful string of athletic loveable misfits, a character more intellectually gifted than Bobby Boucher of "The Waterboy" and more sedate than the title character in "Happy Gilmore." Reynolds could play self-destructive and willfully belligerent, a man who could demand and receive respect in the most precarious of situations. Even if he's trying to play a superstar jock, Sandler is a benign doofus, an Everyman as comfortable in a maximum security prison as Britney Spears would be at a Mensa meeting.<br /><br />Glossy where the original was gritty and raw, silly where the original was scabrously funny, cartoonish where the original was dangerous and threatening, this new "Longest Yard" aims only to be a diverting summer lark. With the help of a game and eclectic supporting cast and a spunky (but never convention-challenging) attitude, it succeeds admirably.<br /><br />Sheldon Turner's adapted screenplay stands by Tracy Keenan Wynn's original script down to the tiniest of plot details, lifting every twist and many of the most pointed conversations. Sandler is Paul "Wrecking" Crewe, a former NFL MVP quarterback booted from the league for allegedly fixing a game. He bottoms out in an elaborate escalating traffic violation that lands him in Allenville Federal Penitentiary, the personal fiefdom of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a martinet passionate about his prison football team and his own political aspirations. Distressed by his team's recent stumbles, the warden entrusts Crewe to put together a squad of inmates to go against the guards in what he assumes will be a season-opening rout. What he doesn't understand is that for the Mean Machine, this game will be a chance at revenge and vindication.<br /><br />Buried amidst the portrait of a disparate group of men bonding in adverse circumstances (a trademark Aldrich theme), the original "Longest Yard," also questioned the rehabilitating possibilities of the penal system, with an interesting racial critique on the side. Sandler's version strips away most of the thematic richness, sprinkling cheap laughs on the already fertile framework like so much natural fertilizer. None of the changes in this new version is more telling than the reimagination of the warden's secretary, a lusty young Bernadette Peters in 1974, a randy and perverse (and hilarious) Cloris Leachman now. Throw in a gang of cross-dressing cheerleaders (led by Tracy Morgan), prison sodomy jokes galore and repeated references to the prodigious size of wrestler Bill Goldberg's, um, Gold-member and this "Longest Yard" isn't better, but it's probably funnier.<br /><br />Chris Rock assists with the wisecracking humor as Caretaker, one of those obligatory prison movie inmates who knows all of the loopholes and catches in the system. Rock's acerbic one-liners are sharper than anything else in the film conveying the impression that nobody forced him to stick to the script.<br /><br />The easy interplay between Rock and Sandler probably helped create a comfortable work environment for the cast's legion of non-thespians. The reliable character actors (Cromwell, William Fichtner), genuine football stars (Michael Irvin, Brian Bosworth and Bill Romanowski) and professional wrestlers (Goldberg, Steve Austin) blend perfectly. None of the non-actors embarrass themselves and Cowboys' great Irvin, stretching as a star wide receiver, and rapper Nelly, as an unstoppable running back, are big screen naturals. Less successful are the appearances by various ESPN personalities, particularly Chris Berman, who proves to be even more ingratiating when his shtick is written for him than when he works off the cuff.<br /><br />Reynolds shows up in an extended cameo and he even gets the movie star entrance, striding in purposeful slo-motion with the sun setting behind him, but his presence is mostly a reminder that even at a mind-bogglingly spry 69, he's more convincing as a sporting legend than Sandler.<br /><br />Although he and Sandler have had hits with their previous collaborations ("Anger Management," "50 First Dates"), this is easily Segal's most accomplished film. Much of the credit probably goes to Oscar-winning cinematographer Dean Semler ("Dances with Wolves"), who works with Segal to deliver vigorous football action -- set, often music video-style, to an assortment of classic rock favorites and hip hop -- to accompany the comic scenes and even one or two moments of actual pathos.<br /><br />At some point this summer, a literate independent film will be released with an R-rating because of a fleeting glimpse of a nipple or because characters discuss a sexual relationship in an emotionally honest matter (something in the "Raising Victor Vargas" vein), preventing responsible young adults from seeing the movie. When that happens, I hope those filmmakers point to "The Longest Yard" and its PG-13 rating as a sign of the MPAA ratings board's ongoing hypocrisy. Whatever the limits are for casual verbal obscenity, crass dialogue and jokes about sexual deviance, this movie pushes them.<br /><br />Sandler's core audience of young male teens and frat boys will love this movie, but the Boys Club tone (Leachman and Courteney Cox, in a fleeting cameo, are the token females) may turn off distaff viewers who would rather see the funnyman romance Drew Berrymore than do hard time.</p></body></html>

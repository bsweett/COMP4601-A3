<meta name="summary" content="I hate stupid movies..."></head><body><p>Okay, so I didn't expect this to be `smart' but really, how stupid can you get before you just have to throw up your hands and yell "enough already"?  I'm tired of movies that are trying to be smart but wind up proving themselves ten times over to be more preposterous than realistic.<br /><br />There is not one scene in this movie that makes any sense whatsoever.<br /><br />`Eagle Eye' starts with a slacker twin brother mourning over the loss of his brother, his stark opposite.  There is also a single mother who fights to find some time for herself while struggling to get her son's father to do his part.  These two people are going to be thrown into an adventure when a woman (is it a `woman') calls them up and gives them an ultimatum.  For Jerry it's `do as I say or the FED's will think you're a terrorist and arrest you' and for Rachel it's `do as I say or the train your son is on is going to crash'.  So, needless to say, they do as the voice says.<br /><br />It could have been interesting, but it is so mind numbingly ridiculous that it loses all interest points in the first twenty minutes.  The plot is overworked and underdeveloped.  The ending is a ridiculous mess that feels thrown together to make sense out of something that offers no sense to be made.  Some have noted that the films moves at such a fast pace we are not given time to understand how stupid the film is, but sadly that is not true enough.  Sure, there is a lot of stuff going on all the time, but the fact of the matter is that the action is so over the top and half of it feels as though it has been spliced in from bigger and better films.<br /><br />The action is also very, very uninteresting.<br /><br />The acting is a mess.  Shia LaBeouf is just irritating, not charming or likable at all really.  Michelle Monaghan (who is gorgeous yet manages to look like a wreck here) is horrible here, giving her character no development and just one oversized emotion.  Rosario Dawson is unbelievable, Chiklis is underused and Thornton is a clich&eacute;, but he's entertaining at least so I'll credit him that.<br /><br />Each and every passing scene brought with it yet another `that would never happen' moment, and so many of those strung together makes for one very tediously unrealistic movie.  My wife likened it to `Minority Report', in that both films make an enemy out of technology, but the difference between those two films is that one of them fleshed out a coherent and plausible plot and coupled it with engrossing and entertaining action while the other through a bunch of action scenes on an idea and called it a movie.<br /><br />`Minority Report' is a minor sci-fi classic; `Eagle Eye' is a forgettable popcorn muncher.</p></body></html>

I'll admit when I first find out they were making a Hulk movie I had my resverastions as soon as I found out there would no classic Marvel villain other than General Ross in the film, I would have loved to see Charles Dance or Alan Ruck play The Leader. So on opening day I mainly went to see the movie to see what Mr. Ang Lee could do with the direction and I was impressed. Lee's editing and split screen transations and wipes give the film a real comic book affect which is why the film impressed me so much. Eric Bana whose carrer I haven't really followed does well as Bruce Banner as do the always good Jennifer Connely and Sam Eillot. I think in the acting department though the film belongs to Nick Nolte as Bruce's father. I don't really see the film as a comic book movie for the fan boy but more of a thinking person's action movie which is a rarity this summer. I give the film *** stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fun thrill ride that could have been more."></head><body><p>Based on the hit survival horror video game series from which it gets its name, Resident Evil does an adequate job of setting up a film franchise, but does practically nothing with the rich world available to it from its source material - it's all set-up and no follow through.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson does keep the pace brisk and the film uncluttered with too much detail, but a little more shading in the character department would have been nice, and having the two people who should know more about the facility than they actually do because of a nerve gas induced amnesia is just a dirty (and lazy) little cheat, narratively speaking.  Also the movie too often resembles other, better movies (i.e. Aliens, Dawn and Day of the Dead, etc.) instead of the games upon which the movie is supposed to be based.  Weak script aside though, the movie is visually exciting and fun to watch in its own way.  It just isn't the moody and scary experience the games are.  Hopefully the inevitable sequel will be an improvement and not another semi-successful missed opportunity.  For Resident Evil fans only.</p></body></html>

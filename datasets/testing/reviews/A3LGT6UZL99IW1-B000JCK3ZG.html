<meta name="summary" content="Excellent movie with lots of continuity errors"></head><body><p>I've watched it a few times now. Great plot, fantastic effects, but so far I have counted over 20 continuity errors, some major, some minor.<br /><br />Here's some samples: When Magneto and the doc are confronting Phoenix and it all hits the fan, the sliding doors are open. Next cut they are closed, and for the remainder of the scene. Yet when Wolfy is crawling along the ceiling towards the doors, they are open, close, open, closed.  Really sloppy editing there!<br /><br />When Magneto moves the bridge, it's the middle of the day. When the bridge hits land, minutes later, it's night.  All the vehicles were abandoned (except one) and tossed around like crazy, especially when Magneto clears the path through the cars.  Yet whenever we see the same section of bridge in distance shots..... 1) all the cars are in nice, neat rows. 2) All the car's headlights lights are on.  Neither is possible in the context of the movie, even ignoring the fact that day became night in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />Logan gets two gut injuries from the horn tossin' dude.  He heals. So does his t-shirt - because in the next scene, the holes are missing.<br /><br />When Logan is getting abused by Magneto at Alcatraz, he switches position between cuts. While lying down. While pinned.<br /><br />The section of bridge broken away would not span the gap from the mainland to the island.<br /><br />Those are my favorites.  Can you find the rest?</p></body></html>

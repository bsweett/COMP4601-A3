The best thing about this particular film is the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, they are a hoot as a weird and unapologetic couple. Ben Stiller is still annoying and Robert De Niro seems rather bored in this sequel, he probably was forced do it. Good comedy just not that memorable.</p></body></html>

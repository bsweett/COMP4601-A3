<meta name="summary" content="DiCaprio the Heartthrob Is Back"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks do their usual superb jobs of directing and acting.  They bring to life the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., an incredibly gifted con man who spent four years impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer from ages 16-20 and "earning" millions of dollars while at it. FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is hot on his trail the while.  Christopher Walken plays Abagnale's father brilliantly and it is in the disappointments and failings of the father that the genius of the son is born.  Abagnale, Jr. can teach himself anything plus he can also charm the birds from the trees.  He has nerves of steel when doing one of his impersonations and can think very fast on his feet.  Yet he is also heartbroken from 16-20 over his mother's leaving the father he adores and the father slowly drifting and falling further and further from mainstream life as a result.  Abagnale, Jr. clearly wants to save his father and restore his parents' marriage as the end goal of his impersonations.  In this he is still clearly a teenager of divorced parents trying but failing to come to grips with that reality.  I was surprised to learn that this film is almost 3 hours long since it is so fast paced. DiCaprio is again a heartthrob here, as we haven't seen him since "Titanic" but he's also so much more.  See it.</p></body></html>

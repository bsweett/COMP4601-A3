While "First Blood" will always go down as a classic for me, the other two Rambo films (far more commercial and the badly executed rambo III) are entertaining.<br /><br />However, this fourth and final installment of the roaming life of Viet Nam Vet John Rambo closes with a bang and I believe that Burma is still recovering from this one. You have to hand it to Stallone for carefully choosing the catalyst for the fourth Rambo film (the ongoing 60 year civil/genocidal war of Burma).<br /><br />The other aspect of this film is how underestimated Stallone is not only as an actor, but really as a director. Perhaps he may follow into the foot steps of Clint Eastwood and really take on a path as a director? His last two films were so good (particularly Rockt Balboa) one can only guess what his capabilities are in the future?<br /><br /> For those of you who haven't seen Rambo yet, BE FORWARNED. Rambo does not have the cartoony action in it you might identify with as seen in the second and third films. Rambo is "in your face up close and personal" graphic blood and guts with non stop gore through about half the film. Just think about the first 20 minutes or so of Private Ryan but its about 40 strait minutes of killing (allot with the 50 cal).<br /><br />So our plot synopsis is Rambo living his days out in Thailand as a boatman doing whatever he can to survive and leaving his life of war behind him. One day missionaries (nobel,yet misguided) contact him for a trip up the river into Burma, which he then reluctantly agrees to. The missionaries disappear, and Rambo is once again brought back into war and coming to terms of "what he is", a finely honed killing machine. With a small group of mercenaries, they plan a rescue extraction of the remaining missionaries being held captive. One their way out, they run into trouble with the Burmese army right on top of them....let the killing and non stop carnage begin.<br /><br /> "Live for nothing, or die for something" is the phrase that Rambo utters and is really the message delivered in this film despite the blood and carnage. There's nothing satisfying about war and that is another aspect of Rambo that I belive is missed as well which has been otherwise glorified by some the war films of the early and mid 1980's.<br /><br />Look at what the exposure of violence and a life of war/killing has done to an otherwise regular guy like Rambo.He could be someone who could easily be your next door neighbor?Make no mistake, war runins people on all sides whether for good or bad reasons and that has been horribly overlooked from some of the reviews I have read here so far.<br /><br />Well worth owning and watching...even better on Blue Ray and on a big flat screen TV. Read between the lines of Rambo, just don't focus all attention on the obvious(although it is difficult not to dwell on it).Stallone delivers on Rambo and it ends with a big bang as opposed to other failed franchises ending with a pathetic sputter.</p></body></html>

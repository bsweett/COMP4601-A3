<meta name="summary" content="A Thoroughly Satisfying Adventure Movie"></head><body><p>The Mummy is high quality entertainment.  It does a great job of entertaining, that's saying something.  Some movies can't even do that.  But this succeeds on all levels.<br /><br />It's a great popcorn flick.  And it's packed to the brim with action.<br /><br />The DVD features a commentary from the director Stephen Sommers, deleted scenes, a few making of featurettes, and a bevy of other special features including trailers and a music only track.<br /><br />If you're a fan of action, definitely recommended.</p></body></html>

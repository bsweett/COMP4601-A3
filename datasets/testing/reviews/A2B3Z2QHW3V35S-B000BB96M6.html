<meta name="summary" content="Good movies"></head><body><p>I have a thing for Johnny Depp. He is a good actor and very handsome in every movie. I didn't grow up watching the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory like a lot of people did at my age. I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory first and I think this movie is a crazy copy of Willy Wonka. But sooo good. This is a must see for teens and adults.</p></body></html>

In fact, there is rarely a romantic vibe to be found within its 105 minute timeframe.  There's yelling and fighting and humiliation and aggravation and a whole lot of tension, but underneath all of that there beats a heart that is real and raw and overall very, very inviting.  It's inviting because it feels true.  What I really respect about `The Break-Up' is that it doesn't sugarcoat anything; even the ending is far from your typical Hollywood `happy' ending.  As much as this movie is classified a `romantic comedy', and as much as it is about two people presumably in love and as much as it is, at times, very funny, `The Break-Up' is more in the vein of `The Family Stone'; a dramedy with very serious overtones.<br /><br />The couple in question is Gary and Brooke.  Gary is pretty much an overgrown child who works with his two brothers running a Chicago touring company.  Brooke is an aspiring artist who obviously is more well-mannered than Gary and only wishes that he would act his age every once in a while.  After a blowout the two of them decide to separate but are inadvertently forced to remain together since neither is willing to give up their condo.  Brooke, who still loves Gary, tries her hardest to make him realize he has nothing without her.  She turns his friends against him and flaunts her dates in his face and pretty much humiliates him whenever possible.  Gary retaliates by treating her friends like garbage and corrupting her dates and standing her up.  They react like children, yet when you watch them you see this glimpse into their soul.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn are great here.  Vaughn is really coming into his own these past couple of years, breaking back into the main stream and becoming a `go-to-guy' in Hollywood.  He's likable and funny and charming and very believable.  Even though Gary is an overgrown child we still feel affection for him; at times even more so than for Brooke.  Aniston does a great job as well with Brooke.  She plays her very authentically.  She reacts like most women in her position probably would.  She loves Gary and wants to be with him; she just wants him to realize he needs to change in order to make things work.  She doesn't always go about it the best way but her intentions are pure.<br /><br />The supporting cast also help to elevate this movie.  Joey Lauren Adams (I love this girl) is sweet and kind and possesses this genuine beauty that draws me to her.  Jon Favreau is the most likable of Gary's friends and serves to help Gary see the folly of his way so-to-speak.  Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio do a fine job as Gary's very different brothers and Justin Long is hilarious as Brooke's co-worker.  Judy Davis is memorable as Marilyn Dean, Brooke's boss and John Michael Higgins is the supreme scene stealer as Brooke's show-tune-singing brother.<br /><br />In the end `The Break-Up' is written with an honesty I didn't expect to come from a `quote-unquote' romantic comedy.  The actors all get inside their characters in order to flesh them out for us and deliver their lines with real intensity and believable passion.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

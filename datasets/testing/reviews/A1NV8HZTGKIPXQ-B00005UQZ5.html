<meta name="summary" content="The Best Action Film Of The Last Decade"></head><body><p>The Fugitive is a fantastic film. I'm just going to come right out and say that first. It's perfect. It can't be any better than it is. Director Andrew Davis(Under Siege)delivers a high octane action/adventure film that's a great ride from scene one to the end climax. Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble. He's an innocent man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife(Sela Ward). While being transported, the jail van gets in an accident and the good doctor escapes. He's now on the lam trying to find the real killer and to clear his name. Tommy Lee Jones is an F.B.I. marshall after Ford. Jones won the Supporting Oscar for this. He's teriffic. Ford is his usual solid, perfect self. If he isn't the blueprint for the perfect matinee idol, then I don't know who is. This movie holds you from the beginning and never lets go. Julianne Moore pops up in a very brief role. Don't even bother with the sequel &quot;F.B.I. Marshalls&quot;. This is one great classic. A must!.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very disappointed, not what I expected"></head><body><p>I saw the ads and read all the buzz about this movie so I thought it might be pretty good, I was disappointed. I wondered what was going on with the B/W intro, turns out that was a flashback- it looked about as good as any part of the movie. For the rest you get an odd mix of action, some humor bits (including the James Bondish weapons lab in the Vatican Cellars, and the friar who develops some of them), and a lot of visuals.<br /><br />I'd get this one for the extra's,(I'd love to see how they did all of that stuff),not the movie itself.<br /><br />Spend less than twice the money and get any season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you'll get better value.</p></body></html>

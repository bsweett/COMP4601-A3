<meta name="summary" content="Too old for Will Smith?"></head><body><p>"Men in Black", featuring Will Smith both as lead actor and end credit singer, is a classic comedy. When I first watched it years ago, I laughed at almost every situation. My favourite? Smith and the other guy are going to meet an expert on intergalactic diplomacy. Everyone assumes it's the weirdo with the dog. Actually, it's...the dog! Had me fooled, too. Another old favourite is the claim that Sylvester Stallone is an alien. The tall guy from Twin Peaks makes a guest appearence (he's been on Star Trek as well).<br /><br />Since I was versed in the UFO subculture, "Men in Black" struck me as extra funny, since the secret agents don't exactly behave as MIBs are supposed to. Usually, they behave in the exact opposite way... And yes, they are more cool!<br /><br />When I watched the movie last night, I was stuck by two things. One, I wasn't laughing so much anymore. Why? No idea. Maybe I'm older, maybe I'm through with the "funny Black sidekick" angle, maybe I remember the only twist element in the plot ("The Galaxy is in Orion's belt"). Instead, I found myself analyzing the meaning of the scene where Will tries to fill in a form at MIB headquarters, together with a bunch of marines. Is there some deeper meaning hidden away in that scene? Or is just me getting Freudian?<br /><br />Two, despite this, the movie isn't bad, although I might yet draw that conclusion when I'm Tommy Lee Jones' age, waking up from a coma after 35 years. Or perhaps I'm just tired of the UFO subculture?<br /><br />Although I no longer get laughing tics out of Will's character in sunglasses, I nevertheless give "Men in Black" four stars. If you are 20+, don't miss this classic sci fi comic flic. And remember: the Galaxy is in Orion's belt!</p></body></html>

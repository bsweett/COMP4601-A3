<meta name="summary" content="Couldn't be much worse or better"></head><body><p>We'll it's certainly not worse than "House of the Dead" a<br /><br />video game to movie release, and I'll admit there are<br /><br />certain parts of Doom that I liked in a cheesy way<br /><br />also unlike "House" there is some better acting.<br /><br />The Rock plays it straight for the most part sensing<br /><br />he took this seriously which I am surprised since the<br /><br />movie is obviously geared for laughs using the video<br /><br />game fan audience who'll practically buy anything.<br /><br />Doom is of course based on the classic game by ID Software<br /><br />which took the game industry and parents by storm.<br /><br />Despite being outdated the game made thousands of dollars<br /><br />and the game Doom went into history as one of the more<br /><br />nostalgic games ever. The Rock as the marine sent<br /><br />down to investigate the going ons at a scientific<br /><br />facility is pretty good.<br /><br />I know critics panned the movie but it has some<br /><br />brights spots, at least the gore and some scenes were<br /><br />done with some effort, the other parts are not, but<br /><br />even then you can laugh your butt about them. It<br /><br />was kinda funny to see the scientist in the beginning<br /><br />use keycards (like the game) to escape, it looks<br /><br />much cooler in the game than in the movie.<br /><br />Andrzej Bartkowiak does a fair job but I probably<br /><br />wouldn't be excited about his next movie.<br /><br />Rosamund Pike who is Samantha Grimm , another scientist<br /><br />in the movie is pretty darn watchable though like<br /><br />the role for the most part takes the role seriously.<br /><br />The special effects were average but I guess enough<br /><br />for some people. Maybe they could have used more gore<br /><br />or instead of using the computer effects for some<br /><br />creatures done more prostetic work.<br /><br />In short though due was an ok movie but not something<br /><br />I would shell it money for on DVD, it ain't that good<br /><br />and will never be except for die hard gamers who wanted<br /><br />to see their game on movie screen.</p></body></html>

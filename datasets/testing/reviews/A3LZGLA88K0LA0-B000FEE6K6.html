<meta name="summary" content="GUN SHOPPING"></head><body><p>Obviously intended to be a dark satirical look at the amazing world of gunrunning, Andrew Niccol's LORD OF WAR offers the average viewer an inside look at not only how and who sells guns and weapons, but why.  Nicolas Cage stars as Yuri Orkov, a Romanian immigrant who works his way to the top of the gunrunning trade, taking on a fashion model wife (well played by<br /><br />Bridget Moynahan), his cocaine-addicted brother (a convincing Jared Leto) and a competitor (Ian Holm, cagey as always).  Cage's character is really an antihero but with his sharp wit and self assuredness, a likeable one.  Ethan Hawke has a supporting role as Jack Valentine, a federal agent who dogs Cage but can never come up with enough evidence to put him away.  The movie's ending is chilling in its implications.<br /><br />While not a movie to really admire for its thematic content, LORD OF WAR is very well done and Cage is extremely good in this difficult role.</p></body></html>

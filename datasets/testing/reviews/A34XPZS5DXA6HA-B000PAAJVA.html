<meta name="summary" content="A Story of True Patriotism"></head><body><p>In this film Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin who is a colonist who re-discovers his love for his country through his love for his children. This is a wonderful story of a parent's love, a man's strength, as well as what he feels is his loyalty and duty.<p>The costumes are perfect and guide the veiwer to another time and place. The cast is masterful at what they do, and the writers have truly made a movie that has brought the story full circle as well as developed a plot making the audience think about the true value of family, and patriotism, and how the two work together. Let us not forget the villans who are vital to any good movie.  This movie comes complete and hasn't left them out.  They are believable and you truly will hate them as much as you love the good guys. A warning for all of you soft of heart like myself, be prepared to cry. There are a few scenes that will break your heart.</p></body></html>

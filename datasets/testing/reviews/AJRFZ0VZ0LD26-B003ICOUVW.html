<meta name="summary" content="A bad wolfman and a good one"></head><body><p>In this film that casts mainly British actors, it is still puzzling to me how Benicio DelToro gets to play a lead role.  "Wolfman" starts with a horrifying scene of a beast killing a young man in a forest.  As it turns out that young man is Benicio's character's brother.  It is the grieving fiancee (Emily Blunt) that gets in a picture when she asks for help in finding her fiancee's killer.<br /><br />Film does not have particularly strong special effects.  Anthony Hopkins look more bored that scary as a wolfman.  He is ruthless in a sense that is his willing to sacrifice his entire family for his need to kill.<br /><br />It is a so-so movie, fine entertaiment but nothing too deep.</p></body></html>

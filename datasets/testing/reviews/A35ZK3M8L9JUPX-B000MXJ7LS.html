<meta name="summary" content="World Trade Center (Full Screen Edition)"></head><body><p>On September, 11th 2001, after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center, the building collapses over the rescue team from the Port Authority Police Department. Will Jimeno and his sergeant John McLoughlin are found alive trapped under the wreckage while the rescue teams fight to save them. It is a powerful movie that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this movie with Strong acting from a huge cast including Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena. This movie is not ground-breaking work, but it wasn't meant to be. It was meant to tell the story of a few brave men and their families and their experiences during September 11th, and it accomplished this very well.</p></body></html>

With definite nods to the classic werewolf and wolfman films of years past, and though more or less adhering to the basic tenets of the traditional werewolf legend, Landis and Baker create a werewolf film that is more tragic, more horrifying, and more realistic than any that have come before it.  In other words, it ain't your father's wolfman.  (Actually, if you're too young to have seen this movie during its original theatrical run, this just might be your father's wolfman.  But Lon Chaney it ain't.)<p>Borrowing from the successful formula of James Whale's classic horror films of the 1930s, Landis uses both macabre humor and visual gruesomeness to tell the story of David Kessler, a young American college student who is bitten by a werewolf and subsequently begins to engage in &quot;carnivorous lunar activities&quot; himself. The juxtaposition of jocularity and repugnance creates a sense of uneasiness that only adds to the tragedy of David's fate, and Landis is successful in milking from this ambivalence a crescendo of terror that reaches its apogee with the film's abrubt, though effective, climax.<p>The contributions of Make-up Artist Rich Baker to the effectiveness of this film should not be underrated.  The realism and hideousness that Baker creates with his make-up and related visual effects provide the audience with the ability to suspend disbelief and buy into Landis' tragedy, and without them the film would certainly fail.  Many of the effects for the scenes depicting the man-to-wolf metamorphosis are actually ground-breaking make-up effects, and Baker was awarded the 1981 Oscar for Best Make-up (first ever for this category) for his work on AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.<p>The 2001 DVD edition of this film does not include Theatrical Trailers or TV spots--a required bonus these days, especially since a previous DVD release did include them--hence the four-star rating.  The film alone actually deserves a five-star rating, as it represents both ground-breaking filmmaking and great entertainment.  It is a must for fans of the horror film, especially those genre fans who place the werewolf flicks at the top of the list.</p></body></html>

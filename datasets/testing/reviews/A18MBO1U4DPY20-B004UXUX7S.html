For Clooney who plays the man things are unraveling faster than he can possibly catch his breath. The Descendants is one of those films that come once in a way and they have the discerning eclipsing element of moving you with just srark reality.<br /><br />Not a single friend of mine agreed to go for this film with me. The ones who'd already seen the film seemed to have forewarned others about the film's lack of entertainment. It seems people don't go to the films anymore in search for what I would term as the truest form of a drama. Anyway, so I had to see this film at home and I really loved it. I knew I wanted to watch this film when I heard the reviews (same exact words from all my friends)<br /><br />My favourite scene involves the protagonist running senselessly as if it his sense of dignity he is running after. The Descendants with it's uniquely executed well studied storyline seemed to be an imperative formula I thought despite it's DARK sense of humor that may stump most viewers.<br /><br />The film is a wonderful study of superficiality and on a side note it was also interesting to watch how well the director Alexander Payne managed to catch the sheer ungratefulness of rich kids who've inherited a large wealth. The emotion or lack of is captured masterfully in a scene or two.<br /><br />Overall, Clooney acted so well, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets the nod for the best actor in lead role.</p></body></html>

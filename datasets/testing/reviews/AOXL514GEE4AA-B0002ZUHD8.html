<meta name="summary" content="King Arthur...the man, the legend! Blu-ray review."></head><body><p>Arthur and his knights of the round table, alive in Roman times? This puts the story into a whole new territory. The film follows the Arthurian legend we've all come to know in such films as Excalibur but without all the myth and magic. It recounts Arthur from youth to his rise as king. The destiny that surrounds Arthur becomes the very fabric of his legend. It takes a mythological figure and brings him to life as a real man. The movie itself is fantastic from the wonderful casting to the well written script. The action sequences draw you into the story instead of leaving you removed with shock and awe at the cgi! It is a wonderful film that will appeal to many and is worthy to be in anyone's collection.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: All the special features are carried over. This is the best the film has ever looked but it does not stand out. I was shocked considering Disney usually produces the finest products. Understand that the film's color tones are yellow and blue which is an obvious choice by the director. It clearly looks sharpened up on Blu-Ray but it isn't a demo disc. Nothing stands out. The audio is also lacking which leads me to an overall disappointment. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it get the blu-ray. If you love this movie as much as I, upgrade. If you are a casual fan, than don't. Ultimately, it is a must own film.</p></body></html>

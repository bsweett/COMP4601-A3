The film stars Jodie Foster in her 2nd Oscar-winning role as Clarice Starling, a fledgling FBI agent assigned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychiatrist doing time in a maximum security facility. There's a serial killer on the loose dubbed Buffalo Bill, who has been kidnapping innocent young women and taking portions of their skin. People often mention that this movie and its book are based on the legendary serial killer Ed Gein. It's not, but that aspect of the story is. As Clarice begins interviewing Lecter, she finds herself drawn further into the case and finds herself forming a sort-of friendship with Dr. Lecter. Now, this is a film that is much like "The Godfather" in the fact that it's been parodied endlessly ("Joe Dirt" and "Family Guy" have recently parodied this film), yet when we actually see the legendary scenes of the film we don't start laughing. Most people who haven't seen this film can still recite the lines "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again." This movie is not just filled with legendary portions of dialogue, but also legendary scenes. Notably, the introduction of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. This scene is simple, yet unforgettable. Clarice is walking down a hallway, to the final cell at the end. When Lecter is revealed, he is merely standing in his cell completely erect waiting for Starling. It's this kind of body language (among other things) that won Anthony Hopkins the Oscar. Few other actors have created characters that have had so much effect on our society (other examples would be Marlon Brando and Al Pacino). Ask someone to identify a line of dialogue from this film and it will either be the line I listed above or "I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti." This is a film in which Hopkins proved (much like Pacino did in "Dog Day Afternoon" and John Malkovich did in "Of Mice & Men") what a complete actor he is. In a lot of films you watch, you see an actor and think, "there's [insert name here]." When Lecter first appears, my thoughts were "there's Hannibal Lecter." Foster is also effective as Starling, considering she's in damn near every scene of the film. She's also the moral center of the film, as well as the protagonist. Hollywood is nervous about giving a woman the lead role, especially in a role that requires the woman to be both vulnerable and strong-willed at the same time. Foster does both and makes it completely believable. Ted Levine is one of the only actors who could've played Buffalo Bill (the only other actor I can think of that could have pulled off the role is John Malkovich). It's the voice mostly. Much like the line "I coulda been a contender" probably wouldn't have been much had it not been Brando who recited it. "The Silence of the Lambs" is a perfect film, at least of it's genre. The reason it has stood the test of time is for the same reason movies like "Pulp Fiction" and "Casablanca" have. Like those movies, every scene is absolutely necessary for the film to function as a whole. Howard Hawks once defined a great movie as "three great scenes and no bad scenes." "The Silence of the Lambs" has more than three great scenes, several legendary ones, and no bad scenes. After 16 years, more people still see this than they do its sequel and prequel "Hannibal" and "Red Dragon." I'm sure in 16 more years, it will still be seen more than those two films and it's recent 2nd prequel "Hannibal Rising."<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

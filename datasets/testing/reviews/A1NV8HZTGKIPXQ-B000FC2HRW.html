We should expect part 4 to come along real soon with a train. I am a fan of these films and enjoy them a lot. I thought the original film was a smart, different, and entertaining film amid the sly slasher films that were the norm. The sequel was bigger with the deaths and gore, but not as good. Now the original team that brought us the first film, have brought us the third. This one is better than the second installment. This time around, a group of graduating high schoolers are at a carnival, where a number of them get on board a scary looking rollercoaster. Like others before her, Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)has a vision that the ride will go horribly wrong and people will die. Soon enough, her vision comes true. A handful of students are thrown off the ride, and now death is looking for them. Like in the previous two, this one follows the same formula. The bunch that got thrown off are now dying one by one. Death is coming to collect those that got away. This one isn't too packed with heroes and heroines trying to figure out "death's design" as the previous ones, and just goes straight ahead with gruesome deaths and trying to get the victims in time. Our heroes do follow pictures that were taken at the rides to help them know how one is going to buy the farm. The only thing people go to these films for are the murders. The second film uped the ante from the first, and this one follows suit. There is no disappointment here concerning creative kills or gore. It's there in all it's glory. I never felt "death" hanging around as much as in the first one. These deaths just seem to happen. As for the characters, they are the usual lot. The good girl, the nice jock, the beautiful twits, the outsiders, etc. None of them have any distinction, but none of them are bad either. The movie is sharply made by James Wong, who can set up a scene and spine tingling moment with the best of them. The cast do what they can with their characters, but they weren't written with much else in mind but to be victims. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a fine leading lady for this kind of thing, but after a while, she is just doom and gloom and is always looking dour. Seperated from the other two, Tony Todd does not appear. He does make his presence known tho. I won't tell you how or where. I'll let you try to spot him. The DVD is well packed with extra goodies, and the "Choose Their Fate" idea is a brilliant idea!. I wouldn't mind seeing this feature be a regular thing for certain films. Final Destination 3 is a fun popcorn/cotton candy movie designed to be as slick and tasty going down as those mentioned goodies, and just as empty.</p></body></html>

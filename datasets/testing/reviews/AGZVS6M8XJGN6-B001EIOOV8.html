<meta name="summary" content="Robert De Niro, an icon of the contemporary Hollywood crime film..."></head><body><p>Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese "Casino" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas... We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night...<br /><br />De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper... He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country... Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them... As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys... 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tables...<br /><br />But he had a fatal flaw... 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions... So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him... Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power...<br /><br />Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating... Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town... For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score... So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money... 'Ace' knew that but he didn't care...What he wanted was to marry her...<br /><br />Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild... She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires...<br /><br />Joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops... He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer... (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.)<br /><br />To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect... Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty... 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf... Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer...<br /><br />The clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening... They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story... 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy... And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic...</p></body></html>

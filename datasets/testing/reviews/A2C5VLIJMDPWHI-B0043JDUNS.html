I love Robert Downey Jr. in this film and think he was perfect for the part. He has the right sense of dry humor and the ability to make us believe that he really is Iron Man. The action was fun to watch. Don Cheadle was even better at his role than Terrence Howard, plus he's very nice to look at. Samuel L. Jackson in any movie always adds a little extra swagger. All of the actors played their roles well, and I enjoyed the bickering back and forth between Iron Man and his CEO ("I was going to make you an omelet and tell you").<br /><br />The basic summary of the movie is some guy takes revenge for an event Iron Man can't control and decides to copy his costume. Does he want to take over the world or just defeat Iron Man? Find out how it all works out by checking this film out.</p></body></html>

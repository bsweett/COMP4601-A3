<meta name="summary" content="Turnabout"></head><body><p>It seems incredible to me that liberal theorist Oliver Stone, who has turned over every cinematic stone en route to exposing "truths" about Vietnam, Watergate, Nixon and Kennedy -- typically to the chagrin of American conservatives -- has now produced a film that conservatives love and are falling over each other trying to see.<br /><br />Syndicated columnist Kathleen Turner, who is about as conservative as anyone in her trade, raved about the movie she saw during pre-release. She said she interviewed the real life characters portrayed in the movie and they told her the events were similar to what happened in real life. One of them, she said, was induced into coma for six months after his resuce so he could have 30 surgeries.<br /><br />Even Cal Thomas, who is perhaps the most conservative poison pen of all the political columnists, raved about the movie he saw in pre-release.<br /><br />This is quite a contrast to what people of this political ilk said after seeing "JFK", "Born On the Fourth of July", "Platoon" and "Nixon", where Stone took extreme measures to portray the truths of these situations. These were situations that did not induce likeness from the political right; quite the opposite, in fact. Stone was said to be an idiot, a historical revisionist that would re-write history to suit his own political purposes.<br /><br />Now, with "World Trade Center", he is the darling of conservative American when conservatism is more broad-based and more widely practiced than anytime since the Red Menace scare of the 1950s. All this because of a movie, a piece of art that reflects an actual event in history.<br /><br />Like usual, Stone has created an art form of extreme interest about an event many of us shared and on whcih we have divergent opinions. He is now the hero of mainstream conservative America because he made this movie, as if he now speaks from the other side of his mouth saying completely different things. It doesn't seem like a good enough reason for this to happen, to me.</p></body></html>

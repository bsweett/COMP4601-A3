Your influential zombie movie came out in 1968 and it still holds up today.  Dozens of walking zombies terrorizing some people trapped in a farmhouse makes for a fun and frightening movie.  This review is of the 40th Anniversary original black-and-white movie DVD, not the one that has both the black-and-white and colorized versions on the same disc.  And not the pitiful 30th Anniversary edition.<br /><br />This 1968 cult classic stars Judith O'Dea, Duane Jones, Marilyn Eastman, Karl Hardman, Judith Ridley and Keith Wayne.  Basically the plot is this:  Zombies have risen from their graves to feed on living humans.  They are chasing (actually slowly stumbling around) people all over about 1/3 of the country.  One of these people being chased is Barbra (Judith O'Dea), who had been with her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) at a cemetery visiting their father's grave.  Her brother comes into contact with a wandering zombie and dies.  Barbra escapes and comes across a farmhouse where the residents are not there.  She hides inside.  She is shaken and in shock and comes across as being quiet and helpless for most of the movie.  Soon after, Ben (Duane Jones) arrives at the farmhouse in a pickup truck for shelter and a safe haven as well.  In all, seven people (five of which were in the cellar before Barbra and Ben even arrived) are seeking refuge in this farmhouse to try to get away from the swarm of zombies outside.  Ben had arrived at the farmhouse in a pickup truck, but the truck's gas gauge is on empty.  The people inside the farmhouse board up the place and look for an escape route when the opportunity presents itself.  There is a lot of infighting between the people inside the farmhouse.  It gets violent at times.  Some of the people who came in contact with the zombies become zombies themselves.  That's the story in a nutshell.  I don't want to give away too much.<br /><br />The acting in this movie isn't worthy of an Academy Award for anybody, but it's at least adequate or pretty good and the important thing to realize is that this is an independent film with unknown actors.  Barbra is helpless and quiet while Ben is a "take charge" kind of guy.  I find this movie very entertaining and frightening.  It's also very gorey.  Shockingly gorey.  The movie's atmosphere and music are good.  This was truly a groundbreaking movie that paved the way for other zombie films in the decades to come.<br /><br />This 40th Anniversary DVD comes with very good special features, including audio commentary by members of the cast and crew, a feature-length documentary, a Question and Answer session with George Romero, an interview with Duane Jones, the theatrical trailer, a still gallery, and the original script.<br /><br />If you like and appreciate independent horror movies that are low budget but "do the job" and don't have Hollywood's influence, then this movie falls into that category and you should enjoy it.  Very highly recommended.</p></body></html>

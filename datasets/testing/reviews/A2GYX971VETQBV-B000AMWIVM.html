<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Plot Device & Ending + Bad Acting & A Lack of Complexity"></head><body><p>SAW is a good thriller: a film with a lot of potential, but lacking in follow-through.  On the one hand, the premise is very cool.  Two men wake up in a bathroom, chained to piping, completely unaware of where they are or why.  As the film progresses, these two men start to piece together their situation: they have been planted in this situation by a deranged madman, someone who enjoys placing his victims in life-or-death situations and forcing them to make horrific decisions.  It's a marvelous setup and the surprising conclusion is right on target and thrilling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film reeks of a small budget.  The acting, in particular, is quite poor.  Unlike SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SAW fails to explore its characters.  Instead, the madman's device becomes the center of the entire film and our poor actors get to scream and cry their way through 100 minutes.  Moreover, our madman is portrayed as a deranged person, complete with a secret lair and everything.  Unfortunately, we don't come any closer to understanding him by the end of the film than we did at the start.  He appears to be "teaching" his victims a moral lesson, but what that lesson is in his mind is completely obtuse.  Both SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS also have clever plot devices, deranged madmen, and the like.  But unlike SAW, they decide to spend most of their time revealing their characters instead of merely relying on the plot devices.  The result is a much more engaging, interesting, and ultimately satisfying thriller.  It may seem like a strange thing to say, but exploring the haunted games of a madman is not nearly as creepy as exploring the haunted depths of a madman's mind.<br /><br />In the end, SAW has a really cool plot device on its hand, but lacks the heart and complexity of other thrillers.  It's definitely worth a look and will thrill anyone who loves this genre.  But with mediocre acting and complexity, it will never reach the status of either SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.</p></body></html>

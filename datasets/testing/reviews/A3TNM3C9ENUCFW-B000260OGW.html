<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Costner Mini Epic"></head><body><p>Fans of Kevin Costners previous avenues into the western genre will certainly not be disappointed by this movie, and his obvious love for the material is certainly in evidence. This is a simple story concerning &quot;free grazers&quot; or wandering cattle herders that drift from place to place, feeding their cattle on the land as they go, usually only suffering from the ravages of the weather or terrain. A run in with a local avaricious land baron (aren't they always) leads to some strong arm tactics by our protagonists, which leads to a show down, and one feels long overdue come uppance for the main villian (played with some zeal by Michael Gambon). At almost 2hrs 20 minutes this is by no means a formula western, but the power to captivate the viewer for so long, with such an essentially short and simple tale is testament to the film makers credentials. Costner is more than ably supported by Robert Duvall as the crusty experienced cowhand, who won't lie down and take a beating, and a romantic interest in the form of Annette Benning is also interwoven well into the story. Some amazing camera work, with jaw dropping vistas and a real feel for the story and characters is more than enough eye candy, and although a little predictable, this is well worth a rental. Interesting extra's on the DVD add to the value, and whereas I wouldn't put this in the same league as Wyatt Earp, or Dances with Wolves, it is very close. Enjoy</p></body></html>

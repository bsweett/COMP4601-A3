Some people compare Identity to Memento, an over-praised train wreck of a movie in my opinion. Don't be scared away by this comparison, Identity is a fine movie. <p>  A great cast, including John Cusack and Ray Liotta, is brought together to a lonely desert motel during a bad storm, or so it seems. The whole concept behind this movie is not new, but the interpretation and the execution of that concept is very original. The film's final revelations are, to me, the best parts of Identity.</p></body></html>

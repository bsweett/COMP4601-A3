The storyline was great, even if a few plot devices were less than believable (a defect with all the movies) but for sheer entertainment you'd be hard-pressed to beat Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull. I wish the movie had made the Soviets more obviously evil, perhaps making the male colonel out to be an ex-labor camp chief or something. One of the things that made you root for Indy in the original movies was just how BAD the protagonists were. But still, an excellent film and one I look forward to watching many, many times!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too many effects,  not enough story...but not bad"></head><body><p>Maybe the title of my review says it all, but here goes. I got to admit, I was somewhat dissapointed with this movie. Although, it was great to see the original crew back from a nearly 10 year hiatus, I have to say that the overall plot of this film was weak. Now I have read reviews saying that this edition has cut out some sub-plots and storylines, so maybe I should watch the original cut, but I just couldn't stay really interested in the overall story. I also think, especially with this edition, the movie was overloaded with too many special effects. Some of the scenes were drawn out just so the effects could be shown. Take the scene when Kirk and Scotty were in the pod boarding the Enterprise toward the beginning of the film. That scene seems like forever. Its just shot after shot of the Enterprise sitting there in space at every angle imaginable while Kirk and Scotty fly around it. Ok, I get the picture..it's the Enterprise..cool shot...now move on please! Another thing is that I don't think the original crew actors had really shaken the rust off yet. They just didn't seem to mesh as well as I had expected. Now I know it seems I'm bashing this film badly, but its not that this is a terrible movie. Maybe I was just expecting better, but I was just dissapointed.</p></body></html>

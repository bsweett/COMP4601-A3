As I understood it, "Munich" was criticized for being too "soft" on the Palistinians.  After watching it last night, I understand that criticism somewhat but that isn't my criticism of the film.<br /><br />I was 20 at the time of the horrible event at the Munich Olympics and I am surprized as to how little I knew about the details.  I discovered how limited my knowledge was when I watched the excellent documentary "One Day in September".  That film was electrifying and it was the unanticipated standard that emerged as I was watching "Munich".  I was put on guard with the opening note "Based on an actual event" (or words to that effect).  What could be more rivitting than the actual events?  Well, not "Munich" as it turned out.  I did not play Spielburg's introduction to the film so maybe there was something in that which could have assuaged my concerns.  Nonetheless, I took heart in realizing that this movie would be about the ruthless and systematic search and destruction of the group that plotted the outrageous act.  That went well until I started questioning who, what and WHY was there a family that, for a price, did all the search and location of the enemy participants.  I realized right away that this had to be a fictionalized short cut that denied us the greater appreciation as to how the "good guys" were able to locate the "bad guys".  I assumed, with disappointment, that it was an effort to save time on the already lengthy script.  It bothered me and I couldn't let it go.  It may have served in a symbolic way although I didn't get a point worthy of its' inclusion.  It did give us a perspective, in time, of the hunters becoming the hunted.<br /><br />Ultimately, the message I got from "Munich" was that violence is its' own reward.  The individual in charge of the actual search and destruction metamorphs into a very troubled individual.  The overall theme that I found is that hate met with revenge reproduces itself endlessly until a new dirrection is introduced.  Tell that to the Israeli's who don't have many options to safely experiment with.  There were elements of world-wide politics that were introduced to the movies and many might have caught some conspiritorial meaning in those allusions.  However, I was immune to that since that French family of missing person brokers convinced me it was all fiction anyway.  If you thought that "Munich" was interesting from an historical perspective, be sure and get the better (and more dramatic) reality from "One Day in September".</p></body></html>

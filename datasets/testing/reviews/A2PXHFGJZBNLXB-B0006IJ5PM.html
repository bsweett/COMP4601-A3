<meta name="summary" content="Definitely more than just another sports movie"></head><body><p>I had to write a review of Peter Berg's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS for the Rutgers University New Brunswick newspaper, the Daily Targum, and I think, by giving it a lukewarm review, I might have underrated it a little.<br /><br />In my newspaper review, I had complained about a lack of character development in the movie, saying that I didn't really feel deeply involved in these characters as perhaps I should have. And when you watch FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, you might feel a similar kind of emotional distance. By the final game, I wasn't really rooting for the Permian High Panthers to win; instead, I felt more like one of the spectators, objectively and dispassionately watching an event unfold. I admit, I was left a little cold by the movie at first.<br /><br />But, thinking about it since writing that review, I think I've come to appreciate its strengths much more strongly. FRIDAY NIGHTS LIGHTS is less about football, and maybe even less about its individual characters, than it is in portraying, with searing authenticity, how an economically-depressed small town like Odessa, Texas puts all their hopes and dreams on their high school football team. Thus, there are many scenes that have only the barest wisp of a connection to football, but instead show some of the individual players living their own lives. Don Billingsley, for instance, has to deal with an occasionally abusive drunkard father (played by Tim McGraw, in a surprisingly effective performance) who tells him straight out that if he and his team doesn't win the championship, there's not much left to look forward to in Odessa. And then there is the poor coach, Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), who has to deal with similar kinds of pressure from nearly a whole town. Scenes like the one in which Coach Gaines is stopped by some rude townspeople in front of a shopping mall all vividly show a town that has become so attached to their high school football team that their reasons for living---at least in Odessa---become tied to the team. That is what FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is about, and the way Peter Berg explores their subject---the sometimes-brutal character scenes, the vivid realism, the slightly washed-out quality to the film's colors that seem to comment on the town's loneliness---gives the movie a disturbing quality that goes far beyond the usual feel-good sports movie. (And the ending of this story is much more emotionally complex than is usual in these kinds of movies.)<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS may not be a great movie, but it is definitely about something much more than just football. It's about how desperate people can project their hopes and dreams on something even as trivial as high school football. Despite my misgivings about the way the moviemakers approached the characters in the film, I think overall FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is worth a look. Recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Magic is Back!"></head><body><p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial's release (has it been 20 years???), Steven Spielberg made some cosmetic changes to the film (a la George Lucas with the Star Wars Trilogy), and returned it to theatres; now, in a beautiful package, BOTH versions of the film, plus an array of terrific special features, are available to buy for under $25, and it's a GREAT investment!<p>While only a few minor scenes were reinserted, the new version offers an E.T. with more expression and movement (thanks to C.G.I.), more colorful and magical night skies and alien spacecraft, and, as was widely publicized, the agents' guns have been all digitally changed to walkie-talkies (as Spielberg felt the weapons were too threatening). The best part of the package are the extras, including a 'Making-of' documentary, outtakes from the original film (did you know Harrison Ford originally had a cameo?), a concert version of the theme, performed by John Williams and orchestra, interviews with the artists who created the creature, and, best of all, a reunion of the original leads (they all look WONDERFUL!), with Spielberg. (No, B-movie star C. Thomas Howell, and Playmate/Actress Erika Eleniak, both of whom were in the original, are included in the reunion!)<p>The only disappointment in the Special Edition is that they DON'T address what has become the great unanswered controversy of E.T. ...who actually provided the voice of the creature? Debra Winger is the person most frequently mentioned, but the question is never even asked. I guess SOME mystery has to be maintained!<p>Definitely a keeper!</p></body></html>

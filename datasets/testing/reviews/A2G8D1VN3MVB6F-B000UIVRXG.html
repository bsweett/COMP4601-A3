That said, I must admit that I did love this movie. It was funny beyond expectations. The characters were great while just trying to do their jobs as law enforcement officers in a small English village. The supporting cast was great. Timothy Dalton was an extremely slippery villain who facilitates all the killing within the town. The movie does serve as homage to some of the recent crime movies produced in the US. IN the process what you get is a silly take on the depressed state of filmmaking within the United States.</p></body></html>

I thought he did a great job of bringing the violent, former Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin to life on the silver screen.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, I thought the character of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan was completely naive and bogus, but a REAL PERSON..... so, I kept wondering how could someone of his stature and educational level be so naive about Idi Amin's violent character for so long when he had such close personal contact with him?<br /><br />Then at the end of the movie when I was watching the special features I discovered that Dr. Nicholas Garrigan wasn't even a part of Idi Amin's inner circle and that he was a fictionalized character! No wonder Dr. Nicholas Garrigan felt completely off the entire movie, he didn't exist in real life!<br /><br />Had the unbelievable character of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan not been in the movie I would have given this movie a higher rating.</p></body></html>

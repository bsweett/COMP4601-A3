<meta name="summary" content="This is a reasonably good political thriller, but it is not an action adventure flick"></head><body><p>Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who works at the United Nations.  Her speciality is southern African dialects, since she was born and raised there.  In the meantime, half a world away, three men enter an abandoned soccer stadium, and after seeing a room full of bodies, are in turn killed.<br /><br />One night she returns to work after hours to retrieve a bag she left there, and incidentally overhears some men over the UN's translater system.  She doesn't know what it means, at first, but the US Secret Service gets involved, because an extremely unpopular leader of a southern African nation is coming to the UN to address the assembly.  Sean Penn plays the officer who leads the team in charge of the investigation.<br /><br />That's the set-up.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was fairly impressed by the series of plot twists and intertwined story lines that were woven together in this film.<br /><br />Kidman, originally from Australia, plays a convincing southern African.  Penn, though clearly aging, does a good job of playing a grieving widdower who believes that working will help him deal with his loss.<br /><br />The development of the story line, illumination of character after character and how they are connected with each other made for a great movie-watching experience for me.  This is not, however, an action adventure film, it is a political thriller.  There are no high speed chase scenes, no spattered automatic weapons fire, but there are plenty of scenes that build significant suspence, and enough other scenes when the tension is released that it worked, at least for me.<br /><br />This film is, all in all, a solid film, and I recommend it, but it won't ever be a 5-star classic in my book.  it is well worth watching a time or two.</p></body></html>

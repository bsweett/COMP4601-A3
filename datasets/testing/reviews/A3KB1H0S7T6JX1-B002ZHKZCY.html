<meta name="summary" content="James Bond meets Jack Bauer"></head><body><p>The Bourne Supremacy picks up two years after the original film ended and continues to shed light on Jason Bourne's adventures.  The former assassin returns to Europe to find out why he is still hunted down by the CIA.<br />Matt Damon, Karl Urban (from LOR!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well (Matt Damon is once again amazing in his respective role!).<br />Moreover, it was a pleasure to see the lovely Julia Stiles, though a bit more exposure would have been just right...<br />Overall, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.<br />In short, The Bourne Supremacy is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></body></html>

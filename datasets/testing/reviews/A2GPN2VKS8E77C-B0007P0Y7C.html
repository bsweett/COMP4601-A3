<meta name="summary" content="Interesting. Could Have Been Much Better, Though."></head><body><p>Note: I just saw the theatrical cut of this film with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.<br /><br />Elektra, the sequel to Daredevil, has a very good trailer, a great opening action sequence and of course, Jennifer Garner, but that was basically it. There's a scene in the trailer which is not in the movie for some reason, and the plot is basically chopped up, like an appetizing Big-N'-Toasty that looks great when advertised on television, but the actual meal is a let-down. The actual storyline was good, but it could have been much better. Barely a reference to Daredevil and some fleeting glimpses of the death of Elektra's mother, the latter of which barely has any significance to the plot, beyond explaining why Elektra wants to protect Abby. More plot was needed, and what is it with almost every movie made these days in which the Lord's Name is taken in vain? "Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain." Hence the three stars.<br /><br />See it once.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 (intense action sequences, a strong religious profanity & some brief moderate language).</p></body></html>

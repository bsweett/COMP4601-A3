<meta name="summary" content="Shut up already."></head><body><p>I very much enjoyed the films Mulin Rouge and HairSpray, so I was open minded when going to see this one as well. I was seriously disapointed.  I was bored throughout 95% of this movie.  I thought the music was boring and also very annoying, as the movie dragged out to the point where I wished they would just shut up!!! Don't expect to see some lavish performance with spectuacular special effects; you just won't see it here.  The plot, actors, and writing were all extremely boring to me. For me, a waste of time and money.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thicker Wicker"></head><body><p>The original Wicker Man, a cult British horror classic from the early seventies, hasn't aged well, and, in a certain light, looks - dare I even suggest it - a bit like a spoof of something else. On the other hand, it's filmed and acted with such a lack of pretension and such simple elegance that it ultimately ends up being deeply moving and very affecting.<br /><br />Since this 2006 remake is the exact and polar opposite of the original, let's dispense with any comparison right now, and concentrate on what we have in front of us with the new version. Although, since the new version is so horrifyingly dreadful, you might just want to skip it altogether: for all its flaws the original movie is much, much better.<br /><br />So basically, the 2006 Wicker Man typecasts Nicolas "Scary Hair Plugs" Cage as a traumatized ex-cop who departs California for the mysterious commune of Summersisle, when he receives a letter from his ex-fiancee Willow asking for his help in locating her missing daughter Rowan. Cue cult members, witchcraft, murder and... ...fish costumes?<br /><br />Anyway, Cage plays himself and the rest of the cast sort of mumble their way through an embarrassing script. Poor Ellen Burstyn must have needed the money: as Sister Summersisle her role promised me a reprieve from the Search-Yell-Search antics of Nicolas Cageennegger, but sadly, she's as bad as the rest of the cast. Leelee Sobieski and Diane Delano are unwatchable and the rest of the cast is composed of stock C-List horror movie "actors".<br /><br />The script is wholly charmless, but Neil LaBute's direction does provide one comparatively small plus point: Summersisle and its environs and contents do look suitably idyllic.<br /><br />Still, if idyllic scenery is what you're after, you'd be better off with a subscription to National Geographic: "Wicker Man" is a complete failure as a horror movie. It runs along similar lines to "Silent Hill" - missing daughter, creepy locale, cult-member natives - and, for all its many flaws, "Silent Hill" is a far better movie.<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague!</p></body></html>

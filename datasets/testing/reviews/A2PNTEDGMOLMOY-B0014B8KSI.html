<meta name="summary" content="Top-notch cast in rather pedestrian tale of selling out in the legal profession"></head><body><p>This is a tough review to write.  I am a huge fan of virtually everyone involved in this movie, from George Clooney to Sydney Pollack to Tom Wilkinson to Tilda Swinton to Steven Soderberg to Kevin Gilroy to . . .<br /><br />"Michael Clayton" tells the story of how the titular character (Clooney, rather more vulnerable than usual) struggles to save his soul, even though he's an attorney.  (Ha ha.)  He's an admittedly unusual attorney, a "fixer" for a top New York firm. On the firm's website, he's special counsel for trusts and estates.  In reality, he's the guy a congressman calls when his daughter gets busted with cocaine or a rich executive is guilty of a hit-and-run.<br /><br />Deep in debt, struggling with a broken family, Clayton gets thrown into the mix of his firm's soulless representation of a soulless megacorporation that has poisoned hundreds of innocent civilians with its chemical products.  If this sounds familiar, it's because we've gone over this ground a gazillion times before ("A Civil Action," "Erin Brockovich" ring a bell?).<br /><br />So no matter how well-written the story, how solid the behind-the-camera talent, or how great the cast is, one cannot escape the fact that we have been here before.  So does "MC" break any new ground?<br /><br />For all its talent and all the intelligence that went into the movie, not really.  This movie does not rise to the level of great courtroom dramas, such as "The Verdict" or even "A Few Good Men."<br /><br />And so it's a three-star flick.  This is a solid line-drive single rather than a home run, if you will.  Again, this is tough for me to write because I wanted to fall in love with this movie.  Oh well.  Back to "O Brother Where Art Thou?" and "Out of Sight" it is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific Horror Classic with Renowned Cult Status..."></head><body><p>Night of the Living Dead is by appearance a timid zombie film in regards to many others that feast in splattering gore and gruesome zombies devouring the flesh of people.  The heroes in the film are just plain old average people found in every town in every state throughout the United States. The film was shot in black and white to save money while the filmmaker George Romeo had a very strained budget that he had to juggle with.  How could this film create such a wave of dedicated supporters for almost four decades while acquiring cult status?<br /><br />Simplicity!  George Romero had to maximize on the budget by simplifying the story and maximizing on aspects that were inexpensive.  The story that Romero co-wrote with John A. Russo illustrates that they were aware of the cost of frequent location changes, as they shot the entire film in a very few locations in an area within driving distance from Pittsburgh.  The choice to shoot the film in black and white accentuated the contrasts within the film and together with efficient use of light produced several haunting moments.  The cast consists of a number of unknown actors, which also increases the genuine atmosphere.  A star would have reduced the authenticity of the atmosphere and probably cost much more as well.  Lastly, the moments of humor within the film add a level of humanity to the film that builds a bridge between the story and its audience.<br /><br />Watching the opening scene at the cemetery is an ingenious move by Romero, as it quickly captures the audience's attention through the symbolical meaning that a cemetery provides in connection with horror films. The trepidation continues to intensify within the scene where a brother spooks his sister with, "The are coming to get you, Barbara. They are coming for you."  Ironically, they are coming to get her and everyone else, as the first stumbling corpse ends up in a struggle with Barbara's brother while she tries to escape.<br /><br />Barbara seeks shelter in an abandoned house where most of the film takes place, as a number of other characters come to seek shelter in the house.  Isolated from civilization with a growing number of uncoordinated corpses trying to find a way inside to gobble on their flesh they begin to fortify the house by barricading the doors and windows.  Some are getting hysterical while others take on leadership roles, as the dead are inching closer to the house under the darkness of the night.  The night is accentuated through the black and white photography, which increases the suspense and anxiety that the film intends to generate.<br /><br />Conclusively, Night of the Living Dead still haunts its audience after more than 30 years of its initial release.  The film even had a 30th anniversary release in 1998.  The zombies might not look as genuine, as in more recent zombie films, but their strange psychomotor dexterity is what helps generate the lingering fear within the audience, as they appear both bizarre and creepy.  Several directors still employ this movement in their zombie films in order to generate a similar result.  Romero created a cinematic experience comparable to a car accident; it is bad but one cannot help but watch as curiosity takes over.  However, this film is far from bad.  It is an illustration of how dedicated work can pay big dividends to those who pursue their visions, and Night of the Living Dead became the beginning of a number of intriguing zombie films by Romero.</p></body></html>

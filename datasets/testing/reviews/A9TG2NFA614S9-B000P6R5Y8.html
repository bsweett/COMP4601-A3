<meta name="summary" content="Fight the Bullies and the Cliches"></head><body><p>This is a strange movie. It's largely realistic, but it has a streak of fantasy that might have been better if it were implied or gauzed over with effects that suggested menace and creatures without really showing them.<br />The plot is familiar. Jesse, a teenage boy, although big and husky enough lets himself get bullied at school. He's an outsider (what else is new?), the butt of jokes; he's a fast runner, and has a gift for art. He is alienated from his mother and father and two of his four sisters. (His two nasty sisters are reminiscent of Cinderella's two caustic step-sisters.) He is close to one little sister. A strange new free soul of a girl, Leslie, comes to school, outraces Jesse, and eventually they become soul mates who discover a fantasy world.<br />The stereotypical schoolyard bullies are in play. Leslie's father is like an empathetic resurrected hippie while Jesse's tough-minded dad takes an awful long time to come around. The movie has a good message to convey, and it holds your interest although some clich&eacute;s and stock characters and time-worn plot devices are in evidence. It's about misfits who triumph. Highly recommended for kids of all ages.</p></body></html>

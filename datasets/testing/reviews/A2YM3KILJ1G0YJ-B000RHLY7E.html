<meta name="summary" content="A twisted horror masterpiece!"></head><body><p>If you are offended by the F-Bomb, disgusted by dead animals and unfathomable filth, frightened by the thoughts of a serial killer dressed as a clown ala John Wayne Gacy, or appalled at onscreen murder and torture, then this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />A psychotic family on a secluded ranch are awaken one morning by a police raid led by acerbic small town Sheriff Rydell (Williams Forsythe).  What the law will soon find is not only the tens of missing people, but also the results of the most heinous mass murdering spree in U.S. history.  When Rydell only manages to capture the family matriarch - Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) - his personal vendetta, which has a taken on Captain Ahab proportions, burns his desire for justice asunder.<br /><br />The remaining family members are perhaps the most disturbed group of sociopathic killers ever.  Led by foul mouthed father Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), a quick-witted pervert who paints his face like a clown; the other two are brother Otis (Bill Moseley), a wraith-like psychopath with grungy hair (he looks like a Rob Zombie album cover); and sister Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), a blonde bombshell who disarms with her beauty and surprises with her sadism.  The trio wreaks havoc upon all they encounter, and abuse the world about them without remorse or hesitation.  When Sheriff Rydell enlists the help of criminal mercenaries - played brilliantly by the duo of Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page - the explosive situation runs its course in a heart-stopping finale.<br /><br />Everything is near perfection, and Devil's Rejects has the feel of an older horror movie.  With one Texas Chainsaw Massacre homage after another, there is definite respect paid to 70s and 80s horror (i.e. several unnecessary T&A shots, stupid people die, over-the-top sadism).  Even Michael Berryman, original creepy bald guy from The Hills Have Eyes, makes an appearance as a pimp's right-hand man.  The pacing of the movie falls right in line with theme, even providing a few freeze-frames mixed in so viewers can absorb the carnage.  The blood and gore are all present, and just enough to satisfy the gorehound.  The acting is top notch, believable, and downright scary.  The lengths to which Haig, Moseley, and Zombie go to make everyone loathe them is outstanding; in their attempts at evil and wickedness, they are admirable.<br /><br />Credit goes to Rob Zombie for making a captivating tale of evil, and for a creation that not only resembles the work of Tarantino, but rivals it as well.  Highly recommended for the demented - one of the best horror movies of the past several years.</p></body></html>

This latest flick from 2006 is no exception, and is probably his best role yet.  Here, he plays the stage magician Eisenheim, a subtle, humble yet cunning artist who encounters his childhood love, Sophie, one evening at a public performance.  Straight away he strives to regain her love and steal her away from the future prince of Austria.  The prince however, is no pushover and has the local police chief in his pocket.  Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan that lets them escape, but which also leads to the suicide of the prince.<br /><br />The movie is set in Austria at the beginning of the 20th century.  The story is told in a roundabout way, beginning near the end, going back to the Eisenheim's childhood, and progressing to the climax.  Along the way we see a lot of surprises, including many good magic tricks, even by 21st century standards.  We also see how the calm and cool demeanor of the magician prevails over the haughty and sometimes pushy attitude of the Prince.  The DVD does not come with much extra features; no extra or deleted scenes, no alternate endings, and short interviews.</p></body></html>

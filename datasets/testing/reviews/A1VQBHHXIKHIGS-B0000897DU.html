<meta name="summary" content="Eminem"></head><body><p>A bit of a padded feel that was only natural given the simple story that had to be stretched to two hours. The part that felt most real to me came early. I attended a black university in a ghetto of Tampa, but then I bicycled home to the Busch Gardens neighborhood. Kinda like wading in the shallow end of the pool at will while Eminem was in the deep end. That's one thing I got from the movie.<br /><br />"Sweet Home Alabama," as sent up by Eminem and Future, has to be one of the funniest and most clever things I've ever seen in a movie. I cracked up and annoyed the sleeping cat on my lap.<br /><br />Chinese viewers in China might not realize Detroit's supposed to look ugly in this film. Casting Kim Basinger was a stroke of genius, since the audience's view of the actress is about as low as Eminem's opinion of his mother.<br /><br />The later excitement felt very contrived, like maybe I was watching a movie. The inevitable battle at the end was a thing of beauty to rap fans everywhere, even this old redneck in China. Too bad it only lasted 5 minutes, but DVDs allow you to skip back as often as desired.<br /><br />Oh, and just to beat you over the head with the obvious, Eminem got out of the ghetto with his words. No gats, no hos, no drugz, and he can't even play sports. Not bad, eh? I love this movie.</p></body></html>

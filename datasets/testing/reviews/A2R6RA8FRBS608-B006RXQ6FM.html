<meta name="summary" content="taut drama with lots of suspense--and the performances couldn't be better"></head><body><p>Doubt deserved more awards and nominations that it received.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire way through. This taut drama couldn't have been edited any better--there's nothing much to cut here! The plot moves along at a very good pace and the acting is very convincing; the brilliant cast turns in tremendous performances that would make most "celebrities" green with envy. The cinematography worked well, especially in the scenes in Sister Aloysius' office; and the choreography shines all the way through the film.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), the first and only African-American student in The Saint Nicholas Catholic School in late 1964. Donald doesn't fit in; the rest of the students are from Italian and Irish families and he does get harassed by a fellow student soon after he enters the school. Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) takes a liking to the young boy and professes that he wants to help Donald because Donald comes from a troubled home. Father Flynn thinks Donald needs extra attention to be sure Donald succeeds in his new school. Trouble is, however, that one day Sister James (Amy Adams) witnesses some odd behavior: Father Flynn returns Donald's undershirt to his locker instead of just giving it directly to Donald; and after a private talk with Father Flynn Donald returns to class--with alcohol on his breath.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius already dislikes Father Flynn intensely; his progressive attitudes represent all that is changing in the outside world while Sister Aloysius is desperate to preserve the old ways of life. Sister Aloysius also dislikes that Flynn takes sugar in his tea, wears his fingernails a bit long--and now he wants a secular song added to the school's annual Christmas show. But once Sister Aloysius finds out that Donald may have been approached by Father Flynn in an inappropriate way, she just might have all that she needs to drive him out.<br /><br />And what a power struggle it becomes. Sister Aloysius gets nothing but denial from Father Flynn; he adds that Mr. McGuinn (Jack O'Connell) caught Donald drinking alter wine and that Father Flynn privately forgave him so that Donald could remain an alter boy. Does McGuinn back this up? And when Sister Aloysius tries to talk to Donald's mother (Viola Davis) about the potential problem, she gets quite a different reaction than she expected. What an explosive scene!<br /><br />I can't say enough about these incredible, unforgettable performances. These actors really and truly become the characters that they play in this film; everything is THAT convincing. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Viola Davis worked magic to make these characters come to life. The final confrontation between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn couldn't have been performed any better. In addition, the theme of light is very noticeable; Sister Aloysius opens the shutters to put Father Flynn in a police-like interrogation spotlight when she initially questions him with Sister James at her side; and it's interesting to note that Sister James, who comes to believe that Father Flynn is innocent, "causes" a light bulb to go out during a conversation she has with Sister Aloysius. The wind also is used to highlight the tensions between all these people.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a number of very good extras. We get a featurette on the Sisters Of Charity; and there's a commentary with writer/director John Patrick Stanley. I also liked the bonus feature entitled Doubt: From Stage To Screen. There is more, too.<br /><br />Doubt is not a family movie; it's a dark, pensive film that packs a punch. It also makes a strong statement about the difficulty of interpreting behavior that is ambiguous to say the least. I highly recommend this film for people who like dramas that are chock full of tension and suspense.</p></body></html>

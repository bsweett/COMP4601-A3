<meta name="summary" content="Looking  forward to the following movies in the Millennium trilogy"></head><body><p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo or as it was originally titled, Millennium: Part 1: Men Who Hate Women is a very dark movie in the style of "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven." It also has a lot in common with the excellent book Place of Execution by Val McDermid and its very good TV adaptation, especially in the part that deals with the investigation of the old disappearance case of a 16 years old girl. It is interesting that David Fincher who had made"Seven," is working on the American re-make of the tattooed girl already, even though the Swedish film was released less than a year ago. The film is good, not great but certainly very watchable and it is the most interesting when Noomi Raspace's Lisbeth Salander takes the screen. This is a character with obviously something so horrifying in her past that had changed her forever and altered her life in many ways. Lisbeth is a a Computer hacker of highest class and she helps to the popular but fallen on the hard times financial journalist Mikael Blomqvist who faces the jail time for the lost libel case against the powerful industrialist to solve the cold case of the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger. The beautiful and sweet 16 year old girl from a wealthy and influential family disappeared without a trace 40 years ago, and her uncle, 82 year old Henrik Vanger the owner of Vanger Corporation, wants Mikael to take a closer look at the case. The film is long, 152 minutes, but is quite watchable due to good pacing, interesting story, and one of the most fascinating, complex and enigmatic characters that I've seen in the movies in long time. Must warn you that the movie fits its original title Men Who hate The Women and contains several scenes of violence toward women and equally brutal but in my opinion and in the opinion of my 80 years old mother and my husband highly justified but difficult to watch revenge scene. As it is well known, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the adaptation of the first book in the phenomenally successful Millennium trilogy by a Swedish journalist Stieg Larsson, published after his sudden and untimely death. Larsson wrote the books for his pleasure, and decided to offer them for publication shortly before his death. Larsen called the first novel Men who hated women, but it was released in English as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />Millennium trilogy is one of the world's best sellers. Three novels were translated to over 40 languages and sold 27 million copies. Larsson stated that the main source of inspiration in create the character of Lisbeth, was Sweden's most beloved heroine of children literature, Pippi Long Stocking by Astrid Lindgren. I would add Pippi the survivor of nightmarish horrible childhood ... I have not read the books yet but I most certainly will and I will be waiting for the rest of the movies' release. I am intrigued by Lisbeth's dark sides as much as her brilliant intellect and her personality. She is the best part of the film and I want to learn more about her.</p></body></html>

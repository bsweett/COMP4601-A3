<meta name="summary" content="Very funny improv comedy movie"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell is a genius of improvisation.  So are Sasha Baron Cohen (playing the French driver, best known as Borat - you like?) and Jane Lynch (playing Ricky Bobby's mom, who you've seen in "Best of Show" and other Christopher Guest movies).  I don't know if they even had a script for this movie, but it didn't matter; it's still very funny and has a more coherent plot than many things I've seen lately.  The deleted and extended scenes, and other extras, show a number of alternate takes for a number of scenes.  It appears that everyone just made up funny dialogue on the spot, and the scenes were assembled in the editing room based on what was funniest.  Poor Jenny McCarthy - she turns in a good performance, but you can see the fear in her eyes in some of the deleted scenes where she tries to get in the improv spirit and fails miserably.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewers who say this movie is overly long.  To its credit, they know that we know that Ricky Bobby is a big Nascar star in this movie, so they don't belabor the early days of his rise to fame, and we race through the exposition pretty quickly.  But the remainder of the movie does have some fat that could have been trimmed.<br /><br />This movie is at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Movie That Says More About Its Fans"></head><body><p>I could never figure out the appeal of SCARFACE in the years after it came out.<br /><br />Easy to watch but easily discarded.  This story brings out the worst of Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma.  And Al Pacino for that matter.  His Tony Montana is almost a parody of a coked-out Cuban drug dealer.  Tony is a scumbag.  He was a scumbag in Cuba, he was dumped on Miami where he really excelled as a scumbag, and he ended up in a gloriously over-the-top scumbag death.<br /><br />The movie came out in the 1980s and was pretty much forgotten...until rap music.  Then the rappers gave SCARFACE a second life.  When they're not shooting at each other, they're worshipping Tony Montana.  I live in the Western U.S. and you can chart any mall's decline when posters and blankets and wall hangings of Tony Montana begin appearing in the storefront windows.  SCARFACE is a thug's dream.  Its enduring popularity owes more to the growing scumbag population in our popular culture than any cinematic merit of its own.<br /><br />But the movie is watchable.  I just watched the beginning on cable again the other night.  But it wallows in excesses and never makes you care about anyone in it.<br /><br />To make my point: try to imagine how it would play if Tony Montana went into business with the Corleone Family from THE GODFATHER PARTS 1 and 2 (I don't acknowledge PART 3) or even the equally-violent but much better developed thugs from GOODFELLAS.  How does Tony stack up against real characters now?</p></body></html>

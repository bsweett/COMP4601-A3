<meta name="summary" content="Finally, A Movie That Lives Up To The Hype"></head><body><p>This is a movie that will surprise you(for starters, it's much more brutal than most expect...not that I had a problem w/this, but some have been surprised and turned off by it's harsh violence). Yes, the fantasy stuff is beautifully done, but it is the intense drama and branching conflicts within these storylines that will have you captivated. The other worldy elements combine with the the melodrama perfectly here, each playing an important part in the slow unraveling of a far more intricate tale than I expected. This is one of those movies where you know within the first five minutes you are onto something special; It's nice to actually see a film that lives up to it's critical praise, and in this case, even surpass it. Not to be missed!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First Chapter of Hannibal That You Don't Have to Read"></head><body><p>We have seen the earlier days of Batman and Darth Vader. Now a film about the beginning of another famous character arrives, telling us how Hannibal `Cannibal' Lector succumbed to the dark side of human nature, and became one of the world's notorious killers. Sadly "Hannibal Rising," which looks like a typical revenge story, wouldn't tell us much about it except that two females played important roles in his younger days.<br /><br />Not that "Hannibal Rising" is a bad film. The film, which begins with young boy Hannibal's harrowing experiences during the WW2, is competently done as long as its acting, production designs and cinematography are concerned. French Gaspard Ulliel may not be the most credible Hannibal after watching Welsh Anthony Hopkins or Scottish Brian Cox playing the same role, but Ulliel's Hannibal is creepy enough to convince us of his future as `Cannibal' Lector. Rhys Ifans is also great as a ruthless kingpin with sadistic traits.<br /><br />However, the script written by Thomas Harris himself has nothing truly intriguing about it except the some gruesome killings by ever-resourceful Hannibal. The film has little to say about his inner self expect two marginally interesting things: frequent flashbacks about Hannibal's younger sister, and the relations with Hannibal's aunt Lady Murasaki (Gong Li). As to the former one, things can be easily detected. As to the latter, it is yet again clich&eacute;d images of the Orient with the name of Lady Murasaki borrowed from the classic Japanese literature "Diary of Lady Murasaki" in the eleventh century. I like Gong Li and I admit her beauty and huge acting talent (see her films made in China ... any of them), but her roles is not substantial enough like the borrowed name of a classic.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" is an OK revenge story with familiar scenes where `bad guys' are given brief moment to talk in triumph before the vengeful protagonist when he should shoot him first. You will find many familiar plot devices such as humiliating school ward or a big boat in the canal. The difference is painful tortures and bloody deaths, which you can see here a lot. But if you're looking for suspense, intelligence or dark humor that has made "The Silence of the Lambs" something special, you will be disappointed.</p></body></html>

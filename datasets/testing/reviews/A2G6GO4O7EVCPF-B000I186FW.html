<meta name="summary" content="V For Vendetta is a great ride and Hugo Weaving is frickin' awesome"></head><body><p>Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the parlaiment many years back because it was corrupted. Swing to the future where people are being controlled by a "Hitler" type person played by John Hurt (Hellboy, Love and Death on Long Island) whos really an evil bugger in his role. People have a curfew. Evey played by Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer) gets mugged one night and thats when she is saved. Enter "V" played by Hugo Weaving (The Matrix Trilogy, Lord of the Rings Trilogy) a man who hides behind a mask...a Guy Fawkes mask. He sprouts poetry, rhymes and all sorts of good stuff. He's out to get parlaiment and well, do what Guy Fawkes didnt do all those years ago. Evey doesnt know if she can trust this guy because he manipulates with her. She finds out that "V" was part of a project that went horribly wrong and he was burned badly hence the wearing of the mask. The dynamic Stephen Rea (Interview with the Vampire, In Dreams) plays the dectective on the case looking to try to bring "V" down before he does any damage. Also starring Stephen Fry (Gosford Park, MirrorMask), Rupert Graves (Extreme Ops, Room To Rent), Sinead Cusack (Winter Solstice, Waterland) and Natasha Wightman (Revelation, Gosford Park). I'm sure a lot of people think this is aiming towards Bush and what not but I'm not big on politics so I just see it as an entertaining action packed joy ride from start to blazing finish filled with brilliant performances done by our main man Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman who releases herself from the druk that was Star Wars Revenge of the Sith last year. One of the best films that has come out this year. I recommend it highly</p></body></html>

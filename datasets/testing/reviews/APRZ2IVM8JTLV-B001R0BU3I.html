Script by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and that wild and crazy guy Steve Martin.<br /><br /> Starring Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce and Jeff Daniels.<br /><br /> Shamir Horn is a Muslim FBI undercover agent who has gone deep to infiltrate a Islamic Terrorist group. He is so deep that only one agent in the Bureau is aware of his existence and he is hunted as a terrorist by another. To continue his subterfuge, Horn perpetrates a bombing with the aid of the US govt and facilitates the terrorist group's efforts to pull off a massive attack in the mainland United States.<br /><br /> Will Horn be discovered by his fellow Muslims or captured by the FBI before he can stop the attack??<br /><br /> Or at least the above is what the filmmakers want you to think the film is about. In actuality, this rather tired and de riquer terrorist retread of DONNIE BRASCO is an excuse..a trojan horse to lure the viewer in thinking he/she is going to see a movie about the War on Terror but really so he/she can be subjected to quite literally.......as in one can practically hear the pencil checking the boxes on the list.........every single liberal/CAIR propaganda point about said conflict. Ergo lies and nonsense. Everything from how Muslims are really all warm and cuddly to how the terrorists are incapable of mounting any effective assault on the US.......unless the US actually helps them first. The terrorist group is, of course, a fictional one allowing the film to portray these terrorists as being the type who feel REALLY bad ala PARADISE NOW blowing up innocent people and hate themselves in the morning but what can you do? The United States is really a racist Empire who like to drop bombs on brown people and the Terrorists are just like the Founding Fathers during the American Revolution. The FBI is shown being especially helpless is fighting the terrorists and it is something only another Muslim can do so we should just give up the fight and let the Barbarians clean their own house. They have done so well thus far after all. We are given, at least, two supposed quotes from the Koran about how Muslims should not kill anyone which not only do I---who suffered through the damn thing..have no recollection of reading---but seem to be at odds with the multiple admonitions in the Koran about how you must kill the Infidels and Jews. All the Muslims in the film are shown being oh so respectful of women.........especially the terrorists. The terrorists are falsely compared to the Ku Klux Klan---which is falsely called a Christian terrorist group. And so on and so on. The only thing the film misses is the Bush is Hitler trope. Perhaps in the extended version??<br /><br /> What the film never touches upon even obiguely is just why is the US is at War with these Muslim terrorists and their state sponsors and why do these barbarians keep going around killing people? There is no mention of Wahabism. No mention of the rampant anti-semitism. There is no mention of the world wide caliphate or Sharia law. There is nothing at all.<br /><br /> A film concerning this subject would artistically, aesthetically, morally be obligated to address this matter to explain WHY WE FIGHT but again and again this is simply something that Hollywood is either unable or, more likely, unwilling to deal with.<br /><br /> Meanwhile the killing goes on.<br /><br /> Traitor indeed.<br /><br /> As such, this is not a film about the terrorist enemy but about the Liberal desire to return to the Clinton era policy of ignoring them and maybe they will go away. Muslims are our friends. The terrorists are vaguely heroic and we need to understand why they hate us. Give peace a chance.<br /><br /> The film is a fraud and a fake.......much to its detriment. No liberal would be caught dead seeing a movie about Islamic terrorists no matter how sympathetic and justified since that would acknowledge they actually exist and, in any case, they can probably recite the film's PARTY LINE by heart. No normal person would see it once it got out what the film is up to. Which is why it sank like a stone and no one cares.<br /><br /> Not a badly made film........but there is absolutely no reason for anyone on either side of the issue to see it.<br /><br /> Even Muslim Barbarians would be bored by it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The end is near in the DVD's extras"></head><body><p>Director Alfonso Cuaron has two remarkable films on the "Children of Men" DVD -- the dystopian feature and a startling half-hour documentary that explores the macro-global issues raised by the movie.<br /><br />"The Possibility of Hope" doesn't have much hope in it. Cuaron rounds up a half dozen philosophers and futurists who see overpopulation, economic repression and global warming sending the planet into a new dark age. These guys make Al Gore look like a gushing optimist. Future editions of "An Inconvenient Truth" should have this as a kicker in case anyone is cheered up by the Melissa Etheridge closing number.<br /><br />"It's not a matter of people surviving," says scientist and philosopher James Lovelock. "It's a matter of civilization surviving. ... It can easily degenerate into a dark age again. It's quite possible that will happen."<br /><br />The apocalyptic future always eluded filmmakers, but many tried, including the mighty Kubrick ("A Clockwork Orange"). None of the films felt truly possible, probably because the filmmakers overworked their visions. "Children of Men" succeeded by Curan's insistence that all scenes from his 2027 "show me the reference in real life." The movie -- about a world in which no babies are born -- easily holds up against all Oscar contenders for best picture. Clive Owens, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine star.<br /><br />"Children of Men" looks fine on Universal's single-disc release, the grit, grain and grays of the film all intact. The 1.85 widescreen images are enhanced for 16x9 monitors. (There is also a full-screen version.) The front-centered audio is Dolby 5.1 only.<br /><br />Other extras include an analysis of the film by philosopher Slavoj Zizek, who curiously calls it a remake of "Y Tu Mama Tambien"; a trio of deleted scenes, including one in which Clive Owen and Danny Huston wander nonchalantly amongst the great artworks of the lost civilization; a discussion of Curan's technique of long, "incredibly choreographed takes"; and a special effects study of making the film's miracle baby.</p></body></html>

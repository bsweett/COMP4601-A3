<meta name="summary" content="Real bears are not teddy bears........or did he forget?"></head><body><p>After reading his book and now watching this documentary, I began to realized one major factor in this universe that cannot be denied, Alaskan grizzly bears must be one of the most tolerance creatures on earth.<br /><br />Okay, now that the joke is over, I am musing why this documentary was made and for what purpose? In one hand, you have the friends of Timothy Treadwell trying to rise him into a mythical status. Then you have Timothy Treadwell himself as the main attraction who basically behaved like some sort of man-child who seem to be suffering from borderline paranoid schizophrenic who anthropomorphized wild bears. I think this is where Treadwell totally missed the boat for all to see. He forgot that bears and man don't mixed, which means he and the bears shouldn't mixed. When a bear get too comfort with a man, that bear usually dies by the hand of man and his rifle. That is one of the basic rules living in Alaska. In one of the great ironies of Treadwell is how possessive he was becoming toward the bears as if he had ownership rights and park services "don't care" about them. In this, Treadwell become an unarmed proacher himself, by interfering with the bears' natural state. It was also weird to listened to Treadwell talked about how dangerous bears can be and all that - but yet ignoring his own warnings, relying on some sort of special karma he thinks he have with the bears. His arrogance and ignorance is appalling to say the least.<br /><br />This DVD reflects the man who was willing to break all the rules to protect a host of animals who in his extreme paranoia, believed to be hunted down without respite. Over 100 hours of video tapes have par down to show us what kind of man Timothy Treadwell was when he was in Alaska and to most outdoorsy type Alaskans like myself, it wasn't a very pretty sight. I supposed you got give this guy credit, he was very stupid but also very true to his nature and cause. His end was almost poetic justice although it was with deep regret that he took an innocent life with him.<br /><br />Overall, a well made documentary, well edited and although it does dragged somewhat thanks to some dry spots like that interview with Treadwell's former girlfriend which I agreed with one of the previous reviewers, it served no purpose at all in this documentary. That time should have been spend on the woman who died with Treadwell, whose only major mistake she made in her life was trusting him.<br /><br />The DVD that come with this film is basically your stripped down version. There is a 50 minutes extra feature on how they created the soundtrack for this movie. A very dry and somewhat uninteresting segment. Then there is only the trailer for this movie and trailers for several Lion Gates films. The DVD image proves to be quite good, since much of it is from Treadwell's own tapes, super movie like sharpness probably cannot be attained. The sound is your basic 2 speaker Dolby Surround Sound. I would recommend this DVD only if to educated people how not to behaved around bears.</p></body></html>

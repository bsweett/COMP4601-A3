<meta name="summary" content="Just plain funny."></head><body><p>I saw this with my wife in the theaters, thinking it would be to "girly" for me, but it is actually quite funny. This follows about 7 storylines which are intertwined in one way or another through the christmas season.  The story lines are aged rocker past his prime, the single prime minister, the writer in a foriegn land, the troubled marriage, the widower and stepson, the single young man not living to his potential, and the newlywed best friend.  Well done, decent acting, and not a minute to long or to short (2 hours 15 minutes jam packed).  The bonus scenes on the DVD are nice, but needed to be cut.  Worth owning to watch over and over again.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

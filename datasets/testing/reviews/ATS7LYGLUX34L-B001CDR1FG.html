I've been a fan of The Hulk since I was two years old; The comics, the cartoons, the TV show, toys, everything. I tried to keep my pre-conceived notions to a minimum, and I was actually impressed by how well the screenplay did with integrating various important characters from the Hulk mythos, as well as the way it managed to stress the psychological underpinnings of the character in addition to the scientific aspects. But in the end, the movie will stand or fall depending on one thing: The filmmaker's ability to convince the audience the The Hulk is real. That's where I had a problem...<p>  Eric Bana plays Bruce Krenzler, a mild-mannered civillian scientist working on a top-secret Military project; Jennifer Connolly is Betty Ross, his co-worker/former lover. Krenzler is haunted by snatches of repressed memories from his childhood, and when a seedy-looking Janitor named David Banner (Nick Nolte) starts working nights cleaning the labs, Bruce's problems REALLY start. Seems Bruce is really Bruce BANNER, the crazy janitor is really his Dad, and Dad's not looking for a family reunion, either- He wants to see what effect his self-experimentation had on his offspring in the thirty years since they last saw each other. Bruce is accidentally dosed with radiation and nanobots in a freak lab mishap, and before you know it, his carefully controlled temper is taking on a life of it's own......A big, green life.<p>  I didn't hate the film, but I didn't really like it either. It just kind of....was there, I guess. Bana really isn't given much to do except be victimized, and that's a shame since he's a very talented actor, as he showed in Chopper. Connolly looks pretty and dazed, Nolte looks and acts crazy, Josh Lucas plays the pre-requisite Army creep...Only Sam Elliott really stands out as Betty's father, General "Thunderbolt" Ross. At times it seemed like he had wandered in from a different movie; His performance was THAT much better than the others. Or at least more lively; The rest of the cast seems like they just woke up. The film seemed overlong, and really dragged in spots. Director Ang Lee uses split-screen/picture-in-picture techniques to simulate the feel of a comic-book brought to life, and it works, to an extent, but to me split-screen in a movie has always seemed cheap-looking and pretentious, and after a while it really got annoying. I was stuck on one plot point, too- If Nolte's character is so dangerous, how about keeping tabs on him after he got released from prison? How did he get a job cleaning a top-secret facility? How can he get into seemingly restricted areas at will? Why doesn't Betty tell her Father where Nolte lives as soon as she realizes what he's doing? But as I said, my real problem was The Hulk himself: I just didn't believe him for a minute. The effects just looked cheesy, and I can't put my finger on any one reason. First off, he was WAAAY too tall; At times he looked to be about 15 feet tall, and seeing people running around at knee level just reminded me of a Godzilla movie. Wasn't the 8-10 feet range presented in the comics tall enough...? The height of The Hulk in the movie made all of the action sequences look oddly off somehow. Regardless, after the seamless integration of the CGI Gollum with live-action actors in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the bar was raised, and Hulk doesn't stack up. Gollum seemed totally real; Hulk seems like a cartoon brought into the real world, making his interaction with the "real" actors look like a Roger Rabbit-esque blend of live-action and Disney-style animation. I just could NOT suspend my disbelief enough, no matter how hard I tried. A few members of the audience I saw it with were laughing derisively throughout the film, which is never a good sign. And did we really need that French-Poodle...? The sequence in the desert wher The Hulk battles an armored column of Tanks was good, and the effects seemed more streamlined there, maybe because of the color scheme; I was surprised at the inclusion of a plot twist at the end that leads up to the big action finale, and comic fans will get a smile out of seeing a classic Hulk villain kinda-sorta brought to the big-screen, but overall I found The Hulk to be a joyless, overlong film that was more disappointing because I wanted to love it, but just couldn't. Maybe the sequel will be more my cup of tea.....</p></body></html>

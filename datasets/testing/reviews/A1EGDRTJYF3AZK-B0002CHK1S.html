<meta name="summary" content="GREAT FX FOR 1982"></head><body><p>Rob Bottin deserved an oscar for his fx work on the thing, he was ahead of his time and the obvious standard for future horror movies to come (Savini excluded). I love the paranoia that was created by Carpenter in the fact that nobody knew who was who or who was what. The movie has an overall feeling of a serious movie, no one liners, no quirkey characters just straight action and mystery.The Thing has earned it's spot in horror movie history as one of the best and also a pioneer in fx.Kurt Russell should be proud!</p></body></html>

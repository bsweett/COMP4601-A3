<meta name="summary" content="just ok"></head><body><p>i thought this was a good move for Jamie foxx after his roles in 2004,but the film is all over the place. Jake Gyllenhaal does a decent job in this film,but this film feels like a Music video in spots&just takes on so many cliches of service life&War without having a real central zone. the film felt long&just  didn't really move me in the end. there was a great story wanting to come out,but this film was nowhere in that neighborhood to me.</p></body></html>

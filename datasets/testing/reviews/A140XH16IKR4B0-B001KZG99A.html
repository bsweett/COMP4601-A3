<meta name="summary" content="Terrific and original, for a while"></head><body><p>Really enjoyed this film for the first 90 minutes, until it became a predictable super robot movie. Robert Downey, Jr. is technical whiz Tony Stark, the ne'er-do well scion of a weapons manufacturer. He has a social awakening after being captured by Afghan warriors during a product demo, and decides that his company must change course. One of his first designs is a power suit, propelled by a new source of his own devising.<br /><br />Downey is perfect for the job. His dry acting style and bad-boy persona are perfect for depicting the driven and hard-driving protagonist. He is completely believable with booze or blond in hand. Gwyneth Paltrow trots out her American accent to play Stark's all-knowing assistant. Jeff Bridges is completely believable as Stark's corporate partner, uniting uncleish bonhomie with more sinister motivations. The special effects are terrific, but made believable (and often funny) with scenes of Stark test-piloting his new equipment. A scene (shown in the trailer) of Stark outrunning a couple of stealth fighters is harrowing and plenty exciting.<br /><br />Iron Man does a lot (mostly thanks to Downey) with borrowed materials. There's a know-all female assistant (a la 007's Moneypenny), a technical wunderkind (a la Batman) and foreign bad guys (a la Vin Diesel). Still, the film is rocket-solid until about the 3/4 mark, when it tumbles securely into the old cliche mismatched superhero battle. There's never a question of who will win, and it would have been refreshing if the plot had allowed for fewer explosions, close calls and destroyed cityscapes.  A quickie, surprise ending would have been better than the 20-minute, predictable mini-Armageddon that threatened to drop this review to 3 stars.<br /><br />A fun ride, with a setup (after 10 minutes of credits) for what promises to be a lame sequel.</p></body></html>

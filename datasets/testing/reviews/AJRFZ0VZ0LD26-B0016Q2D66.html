<meta name="summary" content="Killed by social convention"></head><body><p>April and Frank and seemingly happy, handsome and successful suburban couple living in the well off suburbia during 1950s.  Their lives however, seem to be gloom: we see Frank following hordes of people to the train station that takes him to his miserable job in NYC where he sits in dreadful cubical.  April is stay at home wife, surrounded by every day mundane work and endless care for their two young children.  Their quiet disatisafction culminates with Frank's 30th birthday when he has an affair with the secretary from his firm and April's own desire to reconnect with her own youth and her unfulfilled dreams.<br /><br />On the whim, they decide to start new life in Europe.  They want to break with all social conventions of the time and reconnect with each other and find their own dreams in the process.  But as life never goes according to the plan, neither does their pact to go to Europe.  Outside world and social conventions continue to interfere, until it all falls apart. Irrevocably.<br /><br />Cast in the film is amazing.  Winslet and DiCaprio make great couple on the screen together and it is wonderful to see them together after their initial match in "Titanic".  Both are a little bit older and a whole lot better as actors.  Their supporting cast is out of this world too.  All of them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Jig Is Not Up"></head><body><p>Although the "Saw" series is billed as horror, it's more accurately described as torture porn with at least half a brain.  There's very little in any of the movies that can be called scary, but there is a lot of screaming, a lot of blood, and a lot of clever deaths.  Obviously there are folks who like that sort of thing, and who are willing to suspend a lot of disbelief in order to enjoy it.<br /><br />The pale and pendulous Tobin Bell returns as Jigsaw for this second installment with a brand-new velvet cape and a much meatier role.  He's still riddled with cancer, weaker than ever, but still capable of designing and building complex doomsday devices that appear inspired by equal parts Edward Gorey and Rube Goldberg.  Also, the man seems to have some serious connections in both real estate (how many houses does this guy own?) and toxic gas.<br /><br />Said gas is lethal but takes an hour to work its deadly magic (more or less).  It is being pumped into a multiply booby-trapped house in which eight people are trapped, told via Jigsaw's ponderous voice that antidotes to the nerve agent can be found by enduring a series of tests.  Meanwhile, Jigsaw plays a more personal game with a cop (Donnie Wahlberg), whose son, Daniel, is one of the prisoners in the Mansion O' Macabre.<br /><br />Tobin shows enough restraint to make Jigsaw a sympathetically evil man, but the other actors don't fare quite as well.  This is in keeping with the first film, which cared less about proper acting than it did about its harsh, flourescent stage.  The people in the house scream and fight and utter silly dialogue.  Donnie Wahlberg moans and emotes for his son.  Jigsaw parcels out his trademark bon mots about life, and preciousness, and how much better water tastes when you're about to die.<br /><br />I'm not going to test his theory.  I suspect it might be true, but that's not really the point of the movie, no matter how much Jigsaw tries to cram it down our throats.  The point is, obviously, the games that Jigsaw sets up.  In that sense, this sequel is actually better than the original; it's no more or less frightening, but it is much smarter, and it moves with a well-oiled precision.  The "Saw" movies, with their elaborate endgames and their gritty platitudes, will never really scare viewers, but they do give the prurient and the voyeuristic something raw and meaty to chew on.  In a world where it's vastly more entertaining to watch someone lose than it is to watch them win, that means bad news for Jigsaw's victims, but good news for "Saw II."</p></body></html>

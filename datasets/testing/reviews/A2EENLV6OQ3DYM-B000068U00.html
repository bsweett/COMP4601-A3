<meta name="summary" content="Who Let the &quot;Dogs&quot; Out?"></head><body><p>Before Quentin Tarantino made &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and became the most overhyped filmmaker on the planet (THREE movies in TEN years, please!) he made his ambitious low budget directorial debut with help from Harvey Kietel and one of the best casts ever assembled for a crime picture.  Kietel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Penn and Michael Madsen ALL give first rate performances that are all completely different.  Roth is haunted, Buscemi is manic, Madsen is amazingly menacing, Penn is slimy and Kietel is the &quot;moral&quot; center around which the rest revolve.  Tarrantino gets inside the criminal mind so completely, it is difficult to imagine that he was not himself one once.  The screenplay is brilliant, full of snappy dialog and witty reparte.  The action is quick and bloody and the ending is a classic.  <p>Overall, along with &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; this is one of the best crime films ever made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CHEMISTRY LEFT IN THE ACTOR'S TRAILER"></head><body><p>Unbeknownst to each other, Mr and Mrs Smith (Brad and Jolie) are assassins, very good assassins. They met "on the job", fell in love, and got married but kept their murderous alter egos secret from each other. Now, however, they don't like each other very much. When they both have the same "job" to do, their animosity turns into violence toward each other. MR AND MRS SMITH had good potential as a story but instead devolves into is a slick but pedestrian and superficial shoot-em-up. And you know what? I didn't sense any on-film chemistry between Brad and Jolie. They must have left their passion for each other in the actor's trailer before the shoots. MR AND MRS SMITH reminds me a little of THE WAR OF THE ROSES, a much better film about marital conflict that gets physical, although, of course, the plot lines are not that similar. Brad is always cool, but I don't get all the fuss over Jolie: she bored me as did the film.</p></body></html>

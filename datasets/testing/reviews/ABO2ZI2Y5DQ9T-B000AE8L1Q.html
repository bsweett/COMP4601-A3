<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 STARS) Brilliant Acting from Joan Allen Who Deserves a Much Better Story"></head><body><p>First let me say I really like Joan Allen. Anyone who has seen such films as `The Crucible' and `The Contender' knows her enormous talent, and in `The Notebook' she even gave depth and nuance to a character that could have been very flat. If real upside of `Upside of Anger' should be named, it is the presence of Joan Allen, who can grab your attention simply by sitting at a dinner table as Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, angry wife who has taken to drinking after her husband left her house.<br /><br />To her comes easy-going neighbor Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), a radio dick jockey and retired pro baseball player. The main plot involves the curious relation between two hard-drinking lost souls Terry and Denny with comical touch from Director Mike Binder, who manages to create some mirthful moments out of this unlikely couple. It must be said that to his credit Mike Binder (who also appears as sleazy radio producer) has successfully extracted excellent performances from the two leads, but as I said, as to Joan Allen who can shine even in action flick like `Face Off,' this is no news.<br /><br />Terry has four daughters (played by Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt, Evan Rachel Wood), and all of them provide sub-plots. It is regrettable that for all the names assembled here, none of these fragmentary sub-plots are interesting. These girls tormented by their mother are meant as the flip side of `Little Women,' but none of them are allowed to have their own recognizable voices as Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. The episodes about them are mostly forgettable ones, or at best misfires with failed comic attempts that fall flat.<br /><br />But in addition to its overlong story, the film also suffers from two things: one is the frequent allusions to wars or news from Afghanistan. Perhaps these footages suggest another nature of anger, `downside' of it, but I don't think the anger of a deserted wife, understandable as it is, could be equated to that of the people living in strife-torn countries.<br /><br />The other drawback is a simpler one. There is a surprise waiting for you at the end which I cannot disclose here. The surprise, I think, is meant for irony, giving another meaning to Terry's constant anger, but if Terry had done what a normal person, angry or not, would usually do, there would have been no such surprise as this.<br /><br />For all the brilliant acting from Joan Allen, I really want to ask you ... Can a person be angry for three years like Terry? Maybe he or she can, but the film would not tell us much about such people or Terry, whose hell-raising anger really makes her daughters miserable. Yes, some viewers would find it amusing to see the characters behaving badly to each other or in public, and I have no problem with that. But at the same time what kind of a film is it when it is based on a contrived premise and hateful characters whose portraits can show little insight or wisdom? But of course, it depends. I know. Still I think there are better ways for these talented actors to show the characters' anger than 'Scanners'-like 'head-explosion' episode or Kevin Costner's kicking down a bedroom door.</p></body></html>

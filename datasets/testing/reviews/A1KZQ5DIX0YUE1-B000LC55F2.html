<meta name="summary" content="Where's the REAL Magic on this one? (A BD Rant)"></head><body><p>In many cases, I end up doing reviews on BDs long after the DVD has been released. Sometimes, the reviews fall a bit to the wayside, indeed, since they are something of a sequel. But, in these cases, the review is almost as important as the film, no matter how out of time they are from the original material. So be warned - this is a rant that includes a review.<br /><br />Take the Prestige - a fine novel turned into a finer film by the Nolan brothers. In the theatres, the film captures our imaginations as it should. On DVD, there are many people who were just as like unhappy with the sheer lack of behind the scenes material, the prestige of the film, as it were. So now, a few years beyond this, we have the BD. Ergo, my review.<br /><br />Of course the film can be lauded for incredible acting and an amazing turn in cinematography, especially with the 1080p presentation. The sound is almost as nice, 5.1 as is the standard of the industry. But again, it is in the lack of the behind the scenes that dulls the brightness of this product. Don't get me wrong; they included a very nice 'Director's Notebook' that gave us the rare glimpse behind the camera. And there were three scenes, selected by the director for their arresting visual natures. And we get the same features from the DVD as well.Who are the people who decide how much bonus material we get on our DVDs and BDs? Nowadays, one would assume that the motto of "don't hold anything back" would have more drawn. After all, there are a large number of us who make our purchases on the merits of behind the scenes and extras.<br /><br />The Nolens are amazing magicians of film, and I hope they may allow for more of their own impressions to be made once their films gain their next life, beyond the lifespan of the theatre. As to the inevitable question in these cases: 'should I keep my DVD or upgrade to BD?' I would go with the upgrade, simply for the magnificence of the production value sunk into the sets, costumes, lighting and music. These elements live larger than life compared to it's DVD predecessor. But if you are hunting just for more features and optional footage, keep the DVD.</p></body></html>

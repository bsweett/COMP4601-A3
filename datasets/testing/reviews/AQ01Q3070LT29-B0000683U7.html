<meta name="summary" content="The gasping Mount Rushmore finale is unforgettable."></head><body><p>This film may be a bit complicated to follow at first, but quite simply it's another classic Hitchcock cat-and-mouse story.  This time it's Cary Grant on the run.  The gasping Mount Rushmore finale  is unforgettable.  This DVD version is not the squeezy widescreen, but is almost a full-screen.  There is a good documentary called &quot;Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North By Northwest&quot; hosted by Eva Marie Saint.  Also on this DVD is the Hitchcock trailers and the tv spot.  Alfred Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance is at the start of this film, so you can sit back and totally relax and enjoy the picture.</p></body></html>

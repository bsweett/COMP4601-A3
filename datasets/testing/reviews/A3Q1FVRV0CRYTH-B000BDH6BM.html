<meta name="summary" content="Gritty and Real, Four Brothers is better than expected"></head><body><p>And thats what you get with this film, something gritty and real and much better than to be expected.  The movie revolves around four brothers, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) the oldest, Angel (Tyrese Gibson) the gangster, Jerimiah (Andre Benjamin) the family man and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) the youngest, as they search for the man (men) that killed their mother (the woman that adopted them).  Due to the boys criminal past (All but Jerimiah) the police seem to not want to get off their backs.  Detective Green (Howard) seems sympathetic enough but his partner Fowler doesn't want to let up.  Bobby, Angel and Jack set off in search for theirs mothers killer while Jerimiah tends to his own set of demons.  Following gang member after gang member, beating on a few doors and killing a few thugs the three boys (err...men) uncover some secrets they wished they hadn't that may or may not incriminate their 'goody-two-shoes' brother Jerimiah.  Four Brothers is filled with the action and humor that makes it an entertaining film, and while not an oscar film the acting is quite good for everyone involved, but more notibly Marky-Mark who does an excilent job as the older brother who not only has to battle the fact that his mother has been killed but he also has to battle himself, trying to protect his brothers while avenging his mother.  He does well showing the vast ranges in emotion.  I'm not a fan of Howard, I don't see what the big attraction is and I was actually happy he only had a few scenes in the film...but other than that my only real complaint is the final showdown between Victor (our villan) and Jerimiah which resembles all too well the ending to Training Day and while Victor was yelling at his former associates all I could see was Denzel screaming "King Kong aint got $#!+ on me!" but all in all the movie was an entertaining ride and well worth the price of admition.</p></body></html>

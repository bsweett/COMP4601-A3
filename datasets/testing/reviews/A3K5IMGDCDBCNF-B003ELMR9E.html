I mention this simply because most of my conversations about this film have started like this: "What did you think of Insomnia?" And the answer would go something like, "It was good, but not as good as Memento." Well I don't think that is fair to this film, the performers, or, in particular, Christopher Nolan. Memento is an exceptional film, if not a great film. If Nolan had tried to plug his Memento formula into his next project we would have got another Jackie Brown, I prefer Insomnia. So what do I think? Insomnia is a studio film (a good one at that), a step in the right direction, and it has Al Pacino (The MAN). <p>Disclaimer: Please read someone else's review for a plot summary. I'm not going to spoil, but I just want to talk about why I like it. So, why I like it. Well first, and most certainly foremost, this is first rate filmmaking. Christopher Nolan is a star. Momento was brilliant on several levels, but it was a gimic picture to a certain extent (see it if you haven't). By this rational it is also an innovative film, but that separates it from Insomnia, they shouldn't be compared. However Nolan puts his stamp on Insomnia, much like he did Momento, i.e. Nolan is a unique talant, not a pan in the wash. His pacing is masterful, his visual style is purposeful and consistent, his story is engaging, and he has Al Pacino.<p>Al Pacino. He hasn't been on the screen since Any Given Movie and it was well worth the wait. This DVD has a unique feature on the commentary track. The commentary follows the shooting schedule instead of the narrative. This allows the audience to see how Pacino works. It is a great special feature, as good as any I've seen. It goes without saying that Pacino is an amazing actor, but to be able to see how he evolves and molds his character is such a gift. Watch how the camera envades his personal space, watch how Pacino embraces it. I thought he was excellent in this film. The other heavies are good, but this is Pacino's movie. He carries it.<p>One last thing, the daylight in this film. Nolan has made a dark film in constant light. Inspired.</p></body></html>

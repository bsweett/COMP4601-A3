<meta name="summary" content="First, they should have paid attention to the dog."></head><body><p>The Searchers  DVD<br /><br />This is John Wayne( the Duke) at his best in a John Ford film about a man whose niece ( Natalie Wood) was capture by the Comanch.  It is based on the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585470805">The Searchers</a>, which I have not read.<br /><br />It , also , stars Ward Bond as a feisty preacher and head of the local Rangers.  A couple of side comments.<br /><br />First, they should have paid attention to the dog.<br /><br />  Second, do you really think the Indians were stupid enough to identify their chiefs with that elaborate headdress?  The last army I can think of that did that ( identify their leaders ) was the British in the American Revolutionary War and they learned not to do that around American Sharpshooters<br /><br />Third, did you know that Texas hated the Indians so bad that they killed or drove out every last one of them?  There are no Indian Reservations in Texas.<br /><br />I thought I was in Love with Nartalie Wood when I was growing up.  Ain't she special?<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of the Classic western, John Wayne , and  Natalie wood.<br /><br />Gunner  February 2,008</p></body></html>

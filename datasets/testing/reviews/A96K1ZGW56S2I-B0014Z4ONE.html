In fact, it wasn't until the Indy 4 rumors stopped looking so much as rumors and started to become a reality that the company released the Indiana Jones films for the first time on DVD in this rustic-looking box set.  With the advent of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, the movies have since been re-released on DVD (and slightly altered as well).  Many people won't mind those changes, but I enjoy watching the films the way I originally saw them in the theatres.<br /><br />This DVD set includes the first three Indiana Jones movies (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE) as well as an extra Bonus Material DVD that is full of extra features.  The set is worth buying for the three movies alone (now that the films have been re-released and are about to be re-re-released you can get this whole set cheaper). However, the extra special features DVD is a very nice addition.  The Bonus Material DVD includes several documentaries and featurettes including "The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones", "The Sound of Indiana Jones", "The Stunts of Indiana Jones", "The Music of Indiana Jones", "Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy", the trailers for all three films, and some bonus DVD-ROM content.  I especially enjoyed the "Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy" documentary.  It's very informative and actually feels like watching a documentary film.<br /><br />As already mentioned, you can purchase all of the Indiana Jones movies separately now and even get a new boxed set with all four Indiana Jones movies.  However, this is the DVD set that is the best set to own. Well, at least until Lucasfilm re-re-re-releases the movies in another few years in the Ultimate Indiana Jones DVD Box Set.</p></body></html>

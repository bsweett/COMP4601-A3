Prepare to see a LOT of uses of the word "Somehow" in this review, because this movie is so full of unrealistic coincidences (especially for a sci-fi movie) that it annoys the hell out of me.<br /><br />Basically the last person on earth has died. Somehow this guy is idolized since there has somehow been a mass infertility rate for 18 years. Somehow he has a lot of fans. Somehow one of his "fans" killed him. We find this out in the beginning where numerous are gathered in a convenience store which somehow gets blown up (and we don't know how someone managed to somehow get a bomb in there.(<br /><br />Theo, a businessman who we don't know much about, was married to a beautiful wife played by Julianne Moore who is the head of a terrorist group somehow named "The Fishes". I did not make that up. Of all names for a terrorist group, she chose the name "Fishes". Society has collapsed in various parts of the world and, I'm about to use the dreaded "S" word again- somehow, London is the only place that soldiers on. Somehow, in the wake of all this infertility, a woman has miraculously gotten pregnant for unknown reasons. Thus ensues a ridiculously unrealistic story that almost never takes off.<br /><br />There, I've summed up the film, I can stop using the word "somehow" for a while.<br /><br />This film is well shot, I'll tell you that. It is interesting to look at, with its gloomy and depressing look that plays a character. That's really all I know I can say about this film that isn't negative. This film is just flat out awful. How it manages to get all these rave reviews baffles me. It's even in the IMDb Top 250, FFS. There's a good amount of cameos from good actors, yet they get killed off 5 minutes into their screentime to save money. There are tonnes of unrealistic coincidences that happen. I know it's a science fiction movie, but gimme a break.<br /><br />Like I said the movie is visually pretty, and makes good use of the blue hue (so if you put on a pair of 3D glasses and close your left eye, no you won't get anything). It's hard to believe people praise this pretentious pap.</p></body></html>

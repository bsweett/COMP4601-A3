Sure Titanic was great after watching the first couple times but when specials ran endlessly and that song(you know what one)was getting on your nerves, pretty soon that story of huge tragedy became a media event. Since then, we just get 2 and a half hour or movies that shouldn't be. Nothing really matches the epics of old, like Spartacus, Ben Hur or Lawrence of Arabia. This film may not match those, but it offers an alternative.<p>The film mainly set in 13th century Scotland, follows the story of William Wallace. As a boy, he had a father who fought for the freedom of Scotland, but soon, his father is killed on an apparent attack. He's taken in by his uncle who proceeds to teach him languages, history, and take him as far as Rome on pilgramages. When he gets back, fully mature, he just wants to settle down with his love, Murron. However, the King invokes the First Night law, a law where if a Scottish couple marry, one of the British officers gets to have the wife for a night. <p>Not wanting to share his love, William marrys in secret. However, an Englishman finds out and kills his wife. There he just sets off attacking forces for the freedom of Scotland.<p>Very powerful in it's message, and very brutal. Make sure kids don't see this, there's a lot of carnage images on the screen(including a briefly seen shot of a metal ball hitting a head. Let's just say his face looks...rather different.) But, if bad teen romances and gag humor films, aren't your thing and want something more extravagant, can't go wrong with Braveheart</p></body></html>

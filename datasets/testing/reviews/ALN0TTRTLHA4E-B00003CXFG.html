I rented the DVD for various irrational reasons and it was a reasonable science fiction thriller. Despite looking low budget in the previews the sets and filming are quite good. <p>The main attractions are the two leads, a convict played by Vin Diesel and a female pilot played by someone else. <p>The film is interesting as it has a female in the jock lead role and in doing so it is not artificial like Tomb raider. The actress playing the role is both effective an charasmatic. <p>Vin Diesel is also a pleasant surprise. In interviews he comes across as a little dull but he is able to give a multi dimension peformance to his role. You have in a science fictin film something unusual a interesting and rounded character. <p>The photography is good, lots of washed out tones which create the sense of an alient world. The &quot;monsters&quot; provide menance by only being shown for short periods and the way they are portrayed does not degenerate into comedy as can sometimes happen. Quite a reasonable DVD to play to while away a few hours.</p></body></html>

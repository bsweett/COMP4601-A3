Anthony Hopkins is one of the top actors in the world because he is able to play very good characters and very evil characters with flare and a lot of believability.  That, in a nutshell, is what makes him such an excellent and compelling actor.  I would agree with this reviewer:<br /><br />"The cast is top-notch, as one would expect from actors the caliber of Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman (Especially good as the loathsome Freddie Lounds..), etc. Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, and Anthony Hopkins are all spellbinding in their respective roles as Fed, Serial Killer, and Imprisoned Cannibal, and the actual depiction of the capture of Lector, as well as his infamous dinner party is a real treat."<br /><br />Fiennes was very chilling and his immense self absorption and egotism seemed very real on the screen.  These are not "lightweight" actors.</p></body></html>

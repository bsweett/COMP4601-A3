<meta name="summary" content="Aniston wrecks it again. What little there was."></head><body><p>With Jennifer Aniston, it always seems you know what's going to happen in a film. There's never a mystery of surprise in any movie I've seen her in. Terrible acting. Kevin Costner and Shirley MacLaine's parts weren't any funnier. I'll save you time here. THIS REVIEW NOT HELPFUL.</p></body></html>

The entire first half of the film could have been edited down to about two scenes and thus cut out useless and boring expositional material.<br /><br />Two British girls and an Aussie boy, all decent, if not snarky but not particularly bad, travel across the outback of Australia (why I don't remember being told) to get to a town inland. In a story not unreminscent of "The Hills Have Eyes" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" they come to a bad end.<br /><br />The second half of the film isn't particularly unique although it is filmed well and the acting isn't horrible. However, the script, maybe in an effort to prove its "Blair Witch" "reality" credentials, doesn't inform us about some of the background information on our killer that would make this film more frightening. We just know the killer's been at it a long time and no one has ever stopped him.<br /><br />Still, it's not as emotionally taxing as "Chainsaw Massacre", which let us become emotionally invested in the characters without almost an hour of very boring expositional material. I recommend fast forwarding this DVD until the three kids actually reach "Wolf Creek" at night. Even then, it doesn't really get moving for about another fifteen minutes, but at least you'll be caught up.<br /><br />And you thought movies from the 1970's took forever to get to the scary parts....</p></body></html>

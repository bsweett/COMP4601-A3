<meta name="summary" content="Power-ful Kiddie Entertainment"></head><body><p>Some of the best stories for children have presented their worst fears only to have the menace brought down to size.  "Jack and the Beanstalk" works that way perfectly.  'Monsters, Inc.' helps to tuck the kiddies in and give them the giggles, too.  Taking near day-glow colors, the Monsters in this fluid Pixar picture are hideously cute.  They live in a "green" world where the renewable resource of children's fright powers the Monster community.  Looking like the sorts in (Lucas Films, Ltd. is credited here) a 'Star Wars' bar scene, the film's focus is on the power company where the employees go through magic doors, their portals to children's bedrooms where the fright factor generates their power plant.<br /><br />Heading the troops is big blue "Sully" (John Goodman) a good natured monster, proud of his ability to be the equivalent of "Employee of the Month".  Keeping track of his generating power, he is out to set a plant record.  His green, one-eyed sidekick, Mike Wazowski, (Billy Crystal) has a Martian appearance, but his voice couldn't scare a mouse.  He is smitten by one-eyed purple princess, Shroopsy with hydra hair (snake braids).  They all face their competition with rascally Randall, (perfectly villainous, Steve Buscemi) the salamander-like monster with invisible capabilities.  Pivotal to the plot is Mr. Waternoose, (James Coburn) a tycoon who resembles a tarantula in a three-piece suit.  In the causality is 'Silkwood'-like contamination if any child or remnant remains in the Monster world.  (In other words:  Just like parents often say about insects or some animals:  "They're more afraid of [children], than [they] are of them.")  Sully and James come across "Boo" whom they find in their best interests to return to the dark realm of her own bedroom.<br /><br />Formidable to the fore, 'Monsters,..." takes a premise that could have been a dumb non-starter, and provides supporting plot structures with enough heft to turn the adventure on.  With Pixar animation, the movement is flowing enough to take the technological edge off the look, and Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson's screenplay keep the dialogue fresh and funny.  Director Pete Docter gives the movie proper assembly.  'Monsters, Inc.' is therapeutically good for children's dreamscapes as well as their funny bones.  (Highly recommended to rent and to own.)</p></body></html>

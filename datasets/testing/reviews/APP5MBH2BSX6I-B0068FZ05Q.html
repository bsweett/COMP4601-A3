<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good heart"></head><body><p>Here's the film &quot;Mission Impossible 2&quot; wishes it could have been.  It's the story of a near-corpse who is rescued floating in the ocean and can remember everything but who he is, what he does with his life, and how he got there.<p>Yeah, the amnesia angle certainly has a bad rep, but the stylish film keeps the action rolling and makes it work.  Unlike MI2, there's no rock-video posing, no plot holes the size of Hummers, and no escapes from sticky situations that would make 007 blush.  It all fits.<p>And ultimately the mystery is solved for us all, of course, in a legit fashion that shows this action spy flick to have a surprisingly good heart.  The endings (both of them) seemed a bit too cutesy for me, and in two or three places the pacing of the film seems like the editing was done with the theory &quot;Let's cut to some action so they can't think about what a stretch that bit of business was,&quot; but all in all this is certainly one of the better films of its genre in recent memory.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Hurt Locker"></head><body><p>The Hurt Locker presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. I have a friend that is EOD, and he and I watched this movie, he said that while this movie is a bit of a far cry as to how they really operate, it's still a really entertaining movie. He said military guys know, you can't exactly go rogue too many times, because the hammer of authority will come down upon you. The constant threat of dying, hot and heavy bomb suits, the robots, the tempermental personalities in conflict with one another, strained lives back home, and silly officers who filter into a situation with the idea of taking charge yet have no idea what's going on, now that is entirely true to life. But it makes for a good story. The acting is really quite good and the directing is awesome. For those who like military movies or just action movies, this one is a good.</p></body></html>

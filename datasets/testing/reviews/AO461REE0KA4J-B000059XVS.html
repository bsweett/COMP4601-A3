<meta name="summary" content="Review of 2001 2-disc DVD edition; notes on upcoming Blu-ray editions"></head><body><p>** UPDATED SEP-07-2012 **<br /><br />There will be several different Blu-ray editions of this 1961 desert epic film from the US and UK in the coming days and months, and they are expected to look spectacular due to the latest 8K scan/4K intermediate digital restoration.  They will be in BLU-RAY ONLY, not DVD.  If you want DVD, you have to settle for older DVD editions, such as the one I reviewed below, which were made years before the latest restoration and thus don't look and sound as good.<br /><br />Two Blu-ray Region-A editions will come from the US: a cheaper 2-disc edition that is hard to search for on Amazon (search for B008Y1YK0I in the search box to get right to it), and a much more expensive 4-disc (3 BDs, 1 CD) box set.  These 2 US editions will come out on Nov-13-2012.<br /><br />Across the Atlantic, the UK will also release 2-disc and 4-disc editions that are expected to be largely identical to the US counterparts.  The 2-disc UK edition will be out on *SEP-10-2012*, a full two months earlier, and it will be an all-region release.  The 4-disc UK edition will be out Nov-12-2012.<br /><br />The 2-disc editions will carry pretty much the same bonus features as the 2001 DVD edition.  The 4-disc editions, which cost 3 times more, will have an extra Blu-ray disc with new extras, plus a soundtrack CD and a slight coffee-table book.<br /><br />** REVIEW OF 2001 2-DISC DVD EDITION BELOW, APR-06-2001 **<br /><br />Apart from the slightly soft, washed-out picture quality during the opening credits of the movie, the DVD edition of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is superb.  The movie itself is spread onto 2 discs, with the disc break occurs just before Intermission.  The Overture, Intermission, and the exit music are all played to a black screen, as per director David Lean's original wish.  The picture quality looks as fresh and clean as, quite frankly, any film made in the 90s.  In the dramatic shot where Lawrence appears on the far horizon after he rescued his Arab companion, the higher picture resolution of DVD makes it possible for us to notice his tiny figure whereas on VHS tapes or laserdisc it is so small it is almost impossible to see.  Anyone who is serious about watching this film should get this DVD instead of any other version in order to appreciate the opulent cinematography and majestic atmosphere of this epic.<br /><br />The disc has over 100 minutes of old and new documentaries and news footage about the making of the film, plus two well-designed DVD-ROM features (for Windows PC only): a interactive map showing the various journeys undertaken by the real T.E. Lawrence, and a "split-screen" feature that simultaneously plays the movie and shows you text of behind-of-scene information of the particular chapter of the movie that is playing.  Since the DVD lacks a second audio commentary, being able to watch the film while reading facts about it is not a bad substitute.<br /><br />The included "booklet" is a reproduction of the 1961 program given to theater goers, we are told.  A nice touch: the disc case resembles Lawrence's diary in the movie.</p></body></html>

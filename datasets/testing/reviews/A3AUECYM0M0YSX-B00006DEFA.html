They should have told this to Milos Forman before he undertook his way-too-long director's cut of Amadeus.<br /><br /> It's become marketing myth that the "director's cut" or "special edition" is always superior. I was racking my brains the other day trying to think of one film that had been improved by "the director's version" of things. Aside from the re-cut of Judy Garland's A Star Is Born, which started the whole trend, I couldn't think of one: Lawrence of Arabia, The Abyss, the Star Wars Trilogy, E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Brazil...every movie I've seen was better in its original incarnation. And it's not just a matter of me liking what I am used to, because in some instances I saw the director's cut before the original, and still liked the original better. I don't know if directors are just not good at objectively editing their own work or what, but we always get more scenes that tell us nothing new, yet the sheep critics always say how much more "depth" and "resonance" (their two favorite sheep words) we get in the new version. Don't take my word for it--check out the reviews of any movie that had scenes restored.<br /><br /> Well, I don't see it in Amadeus, which may be the worst director's cut I've ever seen. The movie was long enough as it was, though I have nothing inherently against long movies. But this movie didn't need to be any longer. Despite the critical accolades, we didn't need a single new scene. They just told us what we already knew--with one exception, and that was better left on the cutting room floor. (Without providing spoilers, it revolved around Constanza bearing her breasts.) The sequence as it originally was cut was my favorite in the whole movie, because to me it marked the single biggest turning point in the film: Salieri's anger turns from Mozart to God. With the use of a flash back, flash forward and flash back again, it managed in a few minutes and a few deft cuts to move the story along in a quantum leap. The new version inserts an entire unnecessary trist in between the edits, that slow the plot down and have no effect upon the later plot. Some people have maintained you now learn more about why Constanza disliked Salieri so. What "more" did we need to know? There was already clear motivation in the previous cut: she went to him in a time of great need and begged him to help her husband. He was moved to tears by his genius, but instead of helping he walked out the door, purposely stepping on Mozart's manuscripts in the process. For those who need Jackie Collins-style melodrama we apparently do. The first cut was sublter, faster, and leaner.<br /><br />The change upsets the dramatic balance in other ways as well.  Originally, there was this clever irony in that while Constanza distrusted Salieri--based on her one lone encounter with him--her husband never really did, never realized Salieri was trying to thwart him, never saw the true man.  (Since Stanzi went there in secret, she presumably never told Mozart what happened.) In the third act, however, we got a clever reversal: It is Mozart who distrusts the man in the mask (Salieri), while Constanza takes him at his word ("Here is a real man, who puts down real money.") even though once again the motive is to thwart Mozart.  This clever construction is not present in the new version, with a different motivation for Stanzi's hatred of Salieri.  Again, the changes hurt, not help, the movie.<br /><br />Then there are repetitions in the plot that make this movie unnecessarily long.  After Salieri refuses to help Constanza on behalf of her hubby, Mozart himself goes and begs for a loan. Again Salieri refuses. (Surprise!) Redundant. After the scene where it is announced Mozart is engaged to Constanza and Madam Cavalieri shows her great displeasure, throwing her roses at Mozart and storming off in a huff, we get a scene in her dressing room where she blows off more steam. Nothing is established in this dressing room scene that wasn't already known before. Every new scene is like that. (We already know of Mozart's uneasy relationship with his father; we didn't need a line dropped in "What's the matter, aren't you glad to see me?" when Leopold first appears in Vienna. Obviously Wolfie isn't--we can see by the look of fear on his face. Is this the "Mozart for Dummies" version?)<br /><br /> If the recut film is a disappointment, the director's commentary is not. Forman may have made some questionable choices, but he's a lively narrator. The one-hour "Making of" documentary is also excellent, with many fascinating anecdotes.<br /><br /> It's too bad we can't get these extras on the disc of the original cut. As it is, I learned nothing new, found no new "resonance" and "depth," and in fact found one of my favorite scenes now diluted with a titilating sex scene (pun intended) pointlessly tacked on. As the Emperor Joseph II might have said, "Too many scenes. Cut a few, and it will be perfect."</p></body></html>

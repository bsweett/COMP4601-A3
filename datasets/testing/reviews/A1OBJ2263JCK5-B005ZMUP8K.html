<meta name="summary" content=""Perhaps, You Remember a Certain Pirate Named Jack Sparrow?" ("Captain Jack Sparrow!!")"></head><body><p>When I originally saw the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie in 2003, I had grave reservations that it would be any good. (It was based on a Disney theme park ride for goodness sakes!) But all my reservations were swept out to sea, when the film proved to be jolly good, popcorn munching, swashbuckling, summer movie, which featured a tight, entertaining script, excellent direction, an endearing cast and amazing special effects. Apparently about a zillion other people agreed, because it made gobs of money and a francise was born. It was inevitable a sequel would follow.<br /><br />That sequel turned out to be "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest". Expectations were high between myself and my young, five year old son (an admitted pirate fanatic) going in. I personally was disapointed the first time I saw "Dead Man's Chest" in the theatre (Though my son loved it!). The film seemed very long, flabby and over wrought, hard to understand, with multiple, complicated plotlines, that were hard to follow. To say I was disapointed coming out of the theatre, would be an understatement.<br /><br />But then something odd happened along the way. I bought the DVD for my son and and starting watching it with him. And believe it or not this film turns out to play quite well on DVD! With  a few viewings (and the sub-title feature on) the mulitple complicated, plotlines became untangled and are in fact, quite interesting. To sit and explain it all would be mind-boggling, but in the end it involves control of the high seas, the search for lost love, rescue and redemption, and of course Captain Jack Sparrow, attempting to get his scallywag b*tt...once again, out of one heck of a fix.<br /><br />Once, I had begun re-watching this film on DVD, I started noticing the artistry, that had gone into this movie. Gore Verbinski's direction is still steady and sure. I love the beautiful opening showing Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann's wedding being interrupted. The images of the fine china in the rain..its' almost poetic in it's imagery.<br /><br />The cast is all still uniformly excellent. Johnny Depp contines to create a memorable screen icon out of Capt. Jack Sparrow, that is now part of movie history. Kudos, continue for Orlando Bloom as the heroic, Will Turner and Kiera Knightley as the beautiful & gutsy, Elisabeth Swann. New cast additions include Bill Nighy as the terrifying Davy Jones, a half-man, half sea creature. Even under tons of CGI affects and makeup, Nighy gives a wonderfully, expressive performance, that is filled with both villiany and pathos. Also, new is Stellan Skarsgard as Will Turner's mournfully cursed father, Bootstrap Bill. He gives a pivotal performance, that gives gravity to the film.<br /><br />The film also shines with its' beautiful cinematography, art direction, costumes, and set design. I was especially impressed with the amazing visual effects (2007 Academy Award winner for "Best Achievement in Visual Effects") that are throughout the movie. The film's horrific, sea monster known as 'the Kracken' is a sight to behold. It makes you wonder about how far movie special effects have come in the last twenty some years!<br /><br />While this movie dosn't exactly come up to being the sleek, thrill-ride, that the original is... it is still mighty impressive. It is the rare, interesting, sequel that actually takes some chances. This is the type of film, that the DVD format was just made for. With each succesive viewing you will find a new plot twist, a new nuance, that you never realized before. Give it a chance. It just might be the pirate booty your looking for!</p></body></html>

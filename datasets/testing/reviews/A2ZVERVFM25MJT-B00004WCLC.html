Basically it's a sprawling drama which takes place over one day and looks at a variety of different characters that are in some slight way linked to one another.  Yes this is one of those movies, obviously inspired by Robert Altman, that takes a look at 'life' and what changes it.  Although each story is linked there are three main stories which the cast centre around.  Firstly there's a dying man (Robards), secondly there's the participants of a game show and lastly there's a police officer and a drug addict.<p>It starts off incredibly well, explaining what exactly effects our lives, be it coincidence, chance or divine intervention.  Then the movie glides in and out of these people's lives, which seem to be falling apart as they wonder where things all went wrong and how to get back on track.  Although at parts this can be sad and depressing and the movie as a whole could easily be called pretentious in its efforts to contain the meaning of life in three hours.  Yet it's so gloriously entertaining, moving and beautifully acted that it definitely stands out as one of the best movies of recent years.  Being a series of vignettes every watcher is bound to find some stories more interesting than others but as a whole this is really a superb piece of cinema.<p>Even in their relatively small roles the actors are absolutely superb.  The three that really do impress thought are Julianne Moore as a woman on the edge, Jason Robards as a dying man and Tom Cruise playing what is undoubtedly his best role as a insprirational speaker.  To anyone who thought that Cruise was just a pretty face, 'Magnolia' shows that he is not only capable of being a great comedic actor but also one that can really emote.<p>The soundtrack is almost completely made up of Aimee Mann tracks, which Paul Thomas Anderson even claims to have based the movie on.  Listening to the tracks this certainly makes sense, with Mann's tracks at times giving things a lighter tone and at times suggesting the emotional trauma that the characters are going through.  Indeed, what is one of the film's best points is that it does have a number of small characters that are genuinely funny and help stop it all getting bogged down in its serious tone.<p>This is one movie that is absolutely gorgeous and extremely involving, although probably not to everyone's taste, especially if you are offended by bad language.</p></body></html>

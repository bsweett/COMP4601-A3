<meta name="summary" content=""They can take our lives . . . .""></head><body><p>You know, this is a remarkable film not for it's historical accuracy but for its epic proportions. We used to make movies about people we knew little about. Joan d'Arc, Chanson de Roland, Arthur, El Cid. People . . . us . . . enjoyed them. Heck. We make movies about The Christ and that history is always controversial. I mean, do we really think that Christ had Stephen Hunter's blue, blue eyes?<br /><br />They were spectacular and as an art form, they were supposed to be. So Gibson, never one to shy away from putting his money where his mouth is, makes the story of William Wallace who led the Scots in a fight for independence in the 13th century. Borrowing not just a little from Shakespeare's St. Crispin Day speech, Gibson speaks in a loud booming voice to the troops at Stirling, asking them to consider the Shakesperean choice, 'lying on their death beds 60 years from now, would you not exchange all those days for the one chance to say 'you may take our lives but you'll never take our freedom!'<br /><br />Historically accurate? Probably not. Poetic license? Most certainly. Great movie? Absolutely.<br /><br />I teach a class in business leadership at a local college. It's well attended and has become popular on the campus. The first day of class I start out with William Wallace's speech to the troops at Stirling. Get's the blood flowing.<br /><br />5 Stars Mr. Gibson. You rarely miss. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

At about  the same time, the mysterious woman turns up with her husband, a  significant figure in the fight against the Nazis, who is in desperate need  of those letters of transit in order to make a quick getaway.  From this  wildly improbable plot stems quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.  The pacing is brisk, dialogue &amp; performances perfect, cinematography  phenomenal.  When a person watches it, the unlikelyhood of it all fades  away &amp; suspension of disbelief is instantaneous, because everyone  involved knew how to make a good movie.  Personal favorite lines of  dialogue: &quot;Why, Rick, how extravagant of you throwing away women like  that.  Someday they may be scarce.&quot;;  &quot;Tomorrow I will be in here  with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she  loses.&quot;; &quot;I am shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on  in here!&quot;<p>The DVD features pretty much the same extras as the  Aniiversary Edition VHS, which is a shame.  It would be nice to have a  commentary by a film historian.</p></body></html>

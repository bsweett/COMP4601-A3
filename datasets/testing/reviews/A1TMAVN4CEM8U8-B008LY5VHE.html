Bad idea!<br /><br />The excellent music composed by John Williams will always make me think of JAWS.<br /><br />The police chief, played by Roy Scheider is suspicious that it is a GWS but the mayor, of course doesn't want to believe him until it conclusive, which it is fairly soon.  The police chief wants to close the beaches, but that would costs too much in economic terms so he is vetoed.<br /><br />All-in-all an enjoyable movie, but not right before you go on vacation at the beach.<br /><br />Throughout the movie the GWS is anthropomorphized so that we / the movie makers give him almost human intelligence.<br /><br />Not recommended for anyone who wants to swim in the ocean.  For me it's swimming pools from now on, Baby.<br /><br />Gunner  February, 2008</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A deluge of CGI but only a tiny droplet of story and plot"></head><body><p>I had good expectations for "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" and was looking forward to seeing it ever since I saw the first preview. It seemed like a highly original, entertaining flick with a great story to go along. While it definitely succeeds with the former, it fails big time with the latter.<br /><br />This movie has some of the coolest, most innovative special effects you'll ever see, there's no question about that. I was nothing short of impressed with the CGI, not to mention the cool "retro" look portraying a futuristic society in the 1930's. Basically, this movie had everything it needed to be great: an all-star cast, big budget and stunning visuals. But unfortunately, a lousy script and hollow story take away its full potential, to the point where it cannot be overlooked. Let's start with the script. There were several instances where people in the audience laughed out loud at the contrived, silly dialogue from the characters. Not all the script was bad; but what wasn't downright lame was only mediocre, so that's not saying much. And then there's the story. Equally as mediocre and uninspiring. Everyone is a cardboard cut-out. The audience is never given the chance to really care about them. Just when you think there might be some character development, a CGI battle sequence comes into play. They were certainly impressive, but there has to be a balance somewhere. And oh yeah, there's also some shameless product placement (Coca-Cola and Wrigley's chewing gum, I think Double Bubble as well) although it's not as bad as "I, Robot."<br /><br />In terms of performances, everyone is adequate, considering that they were simply "acting" in front of a blue screen. The always reliable Jude Law does the best he can with the script he's given to work with. Gwyneth Paltrow is also good although her performance comes across as campy at times. Angelina Jolie phoned this one in, that is, during the whopping 15 minutes that she's actually in the movie. So for any Jolie fans, know that you won't get to see much of her.<br /><br />I wanted to like "Sky Captain" a lot more than I did. I'm a fan of every actor and was hoping that they could carry it. But the lack of an intriguing plot and disposable script were a disappointment. This movie plays out more like a comic book, and perhaps that's what it should have been instead. It's got plenty of excellent eye candy, and if that's the only reason you go to movies then you'll surely enjoy it. But for anyone else who expects and hopes for a good story to go along with it, you'll probably leave the theater feeling uninspired. "Sky Captain" is not a bad movie, far from it. It has its merits. It's just not as good as it could have been, with all it had going for it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable film"></head><body><p>Film biographies are always a bit tricky, in my opinion.  I always find myself wondering which parts are "true" and which parts are rearranged, condensed, combined, etc.  For example, in WALK THE LINE, there's a terrifically dramatic scene near the end when Johnny Cash proposes to June Carter.  The circumstances of the proposal are almost TOO perfect, from a storytelling / dramatic standpoint.  Did it really happen that way, or did the filmmakers take liberties because the truth would have been less cinematically interesting?  At least, when I watch fiction, I know it's all made up.  And when I watch "non-fiction", I know liberties will be taken...I just don't know where.<br /><br />That aside, WALK THE LINE is a pretty satisfying film bio.  First of all, Joaquin Phoenix is terrific.  He doesn't really look like Cash...I always thought Cash was a big man...Phoenix is not.  But we forget these surface dissimilarities almost right away, because Phoenix embodies the character in more important ways.  He creates a full-blooded character.  And the fact that he sang the songs himself is pretty amazing.  Again, his voice isn't a dead-on copy (he can't quite as low as Cash), but there are enough times when a particular phrase comes out EXACTLY like we remember that the viewer is completely satisfied.  It was great to hear some older Cash songs that I had forgotten I knew.  Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter, gives her best dramatic performance yet.  She has one great scene when she is shopping in a small general store in some town they are touring through.  First, she meets some admiring fans and her manner in being perfectly lovely to them while still cutting their conversation short is terrific, and moments later, she is confronted by a clerk who heartily DISAPPROVES of June's recent divorce...and Reese's face is wonderful to watch.  We see her shame and a smidge (just a smidge) of anger...and her response (well written, but REALLY well delivered) is great.  This is a time before everyone went around being sarcastic / ironic, and her reply is genuine and non-ironic and painful and totally appropriate.  There are times in the film when Reese's generic "perkiness" comes through a bit more than I would like...but overall, she's quite solid.  Phoenix should certainly get an Oscar nomination...Witherspoon is slightly less deserving, in my opinion, but I wouldn't put up a fight if she did get nominated.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the film plays out a lot of its drama right on stage.  The concert scenes are fabulously believable.  There's great singing and playing of great music, there's totally believable banter (I don't mean the banter is believable...it's totally "staged" for the audiences, but it feels exactly like what would have been delivered to audiences of the `50s & early `60s) and there's a LOT of subtext being played out.  Whether it's the looks Johnny gives to June as she waits off stage, or their chemistry when they sing together...you almost get all you need to know about their relationship by how the shows go.  When Johnny reaches rock bottom with drug use...we see it on stage.  When he's totally enamored of June, we see it on stage.  I love that the film makes this choice with its storytelling.<br /><br />I also want to mention a great supporting turn by Robert Patrick (X-FILES, TERMINATOR 2) who plays Cash's father.  I don't think his part has Oscar written on it...it's not that showy.  But Cash's father has a HUGE influence on Johnny, and Patrick plays him strongly enough that we can palpably feel how Johnny is affected by him.  It's a critical role, and Patrick nails it.  After TERMINATOR 2, his roles on film haven't always been the best.  I hope this gets him some juicier material...Agent Doggett will always have a soft spot in my heart.<br /><br />The movie isn't perfect.  I felt the Folsom Prison concert was just a bit of a dramatic letdown.  Yes, this is a famous album and famous moment in Cash's career, but the film tries to make an awful lot of it, and then they don't actually show us much of the show.  Also, the inevitable closing titles, when we are told in a few superimposed words about the rest of Johnny and June's lives are quite brief and uninformative.  Those two went on to rather amazing careers for another 30+ years.  The care and devotion they were shown in the film is quickly tossed aside in a few glib summary statements.  I think everyone in the audience would have happily sat and read a bit more...especially with some great Cash music in the background.  But these quibbles aside, it's a very entertaining movie and I would give it about 4.25 stars.</p></body></html>

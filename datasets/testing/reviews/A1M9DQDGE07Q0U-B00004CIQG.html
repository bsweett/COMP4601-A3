<meta name="summary" content="BLAST OFF FOR THE NEUROTIC AGE"></head><body><p>A byproduct of the cold war is that it provided Hollywood with enough fodder to celebrate espionage in a string of political thrillers. Some took the threat of Russian invasion quite seriously. Others chose a less credible, but wholly more satisfying route into pure farcical escapist entertainment. Of particular interest in this latter category is Stanley Kubrick's intense black comedy about the nuclear age; "Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb." "The film, frequently adorning "all-time best" lists, is a vapid spoof that teeters on political insanity and military incredulity.  The story begins as homage to the Cubin Missile Crisis, with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), an obsessed relic, launching his own personal assault on Communism. Ripper commissions a squadron of B-52s to bomb the USSR. Naturally, the big bad Russians launch their own counter offensive - the so- called "Doomsday Device." While the world holds its excess gas, U.S. President (Peter Sellers) enters into riotous hot-line negotiations with his Commi-counterpart. Always fascinating to watch, Sellers also interjects his own inimitable brand of craziness into two more roles; a British military attach&eacute; with a humorous tick and the psychotic bomb-maker, Dr. Strangelove. This trio of psychotics is fleshed out by Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants loose canon whose military advice boils down into two parts mass hysteria and one part factoid meaningless statistics.<br /><br />This is the third outing for "Dr. Strangelove" on DVD. As with its predecessors, this disc exhibits a stunningly rich and textured visual presentation. The B&W image has a marvelously balanced and remarkably solid gray scale. Blacks are velvety deep and smooth. There is some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but nothing that will distract you from enjoying this classic. Multiple aspect ratios are in keeping with the film's original theatrical presentation. The movie also boasts 5.1 DTS. This 40th anniversary edition also embellishes its extras made previously available with two more short subjects. Overall, there's little reason to run out and re-buy this title, although die hard fans will ultimately want the very latest from the military board room in the cockpit of their own libraries. Either way, brace yourself - its blast off time for the neurotic age!</p></body></html>

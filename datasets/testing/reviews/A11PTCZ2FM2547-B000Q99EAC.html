And there is no heavyweight champ--no matter how lousy his reputation is--that would agree to get into the ring with a fighter of six decades, exhibition or no exhibition.  Sorry, but I just couldn't get past the obvious before suspending my disbelief while watching ROCKY BALBOA, the final (we think) installment of the dearly beloved Rocky franchise.<br /><br />(Had this fight been sanctioned in some foreign country that wouldn't object to the massive risk involved--say the Philippines, or one of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula--the plot would have been more believable, but I digress.)<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone returns in the role he was born to play, only now he's sixty, a lonely widower, and has a son (Milo Ventimiglia) who resents living under his father's famous shadow.  Rocky, while pining away at his wife's grave, realizes he still has a burning rage inside him that must be exorcised--and only a boxing match will do the trick.  Because the video games (or whatever they're called these days) have him actually beating the current reigning champ, Mason Dixon (great fighting name, played by a stoic Antonio Tarner), why not have life imitate. . .recreation?  And the rest is standard Rocky fare, from the training music to the raw eggs.  The fight. . .um, yeah, okay.<br /><br />Sly is Sly, hair color or no hair color, yet this time he is curiously articulate and able to wax philosophical at the drop of a hat.  I kind of liked that.  Burt Young must be tired of playing a drunken idiot.  And the fight. . .um, yeah, okay.  But what raised the reviewing stakes of ROCKY BALBOA in the eyes of this reviewer from two to three stars was the film's ending, which was an impressive tribute to Rocky the movie icon.  After all, this is the last installment of the Rocky franchise. . .isn't it?<br />--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="2.5; Loud, big, dumb bad movie"></head><body><p>I seriously hope we get out of this comic book phase soon. It seems like for every top director that brings us a Batman Begins or X2: X-Men United, we get hacks and wannabes who think they can do just as well. After previously releasing (or is that staining the legacy of?) Daredevil, Mark Steven Johnson brings Ghost Rider to your TV set and like that other film, it's something you watch and all the while thinking of what director would've made this movie awesome.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze was a young kid in a father/son motorcycle duo working in a circus. Dad stricken by cancer, Johnny strikes a deal with the Devil himself, Mephistopheles, to cure him in exchange for Johnny's soul. But of course that doesn't mean Dad will be around long and Johnny grows up and becomes Ghost Rider, a flaming skeleton on a souped-up bike dishing out punishment to any evil. The Devil's son, Blackheart, is after an ancient contract which will give him lots of souls to overthrow his father and its up to Johnny to take him down so he can get his life back. Add in the complication of Roxanne, Johnny's old flame, and Johnny will have to save the day from evil.<br /><br />Sounds cheesy to read isn't it? Imagine watching it. Sure there's dumb dialogue right? They exist; just watch any recent Star Wars movie. But what makes Ghost Rider a pain to listen to is just how familiar it seems. You can practically make a checklist of all the cliche dialogue. And then there's the acting and at least we have Nicolas Cage who is either hamming it up for fun or he's trying his hardest but it comes across as being too cartoonish, even in a comic book movie. Eva Mendes is hot and I'm sure she can deliver good performances but this just smacks of bad acting direction, same goes for Wes Bentley. At least Peter Fonda and Sam Elliot bring some class and at least some chops into this thing.<br /><br />One thing I will say though: the effects have gotten better over the years. Remember that one shot where Wolverine spins around that piece of the Statue of Liberty but you can obviously tell the CG figure is way too fake? None of that here. While the facial additives look iffy, everything else from Ghost Rider himself to his riding and Blackheart's minions looks quite spot-on. As for the story itself, it's kind of hollow. One side character unexpectedly gets the axe and it's meant to be this big emotional denouement for them yet it just doesn't have the impact. Not to mention it's kind of...boring. No suspense or tension that's being built up and even in the extended cut, it just feels like adding or taking away, it's just a badly executed movie.<br /><br />My cousin is a comic book fan from X-Men to Spider-Man and Batman and even he was disappointed in this. Normally he finds at least something of merit in these movies (for example, he finds the equally-inept Elektra movie tolerable because "Jennifer Garner's hot"). Some big comic book fans will like it, others will be like "ugh, of all the Ghost Rider movies to be made, THIS one goes through".</p></body></html>

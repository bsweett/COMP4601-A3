<meta name="summary" content="Chicago...."></head><body><p>Chicago is a good movie.  I honestly wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  A good surprise.  I am not a fan of Catherine Zetta-Jones, but I will admit she is okay in this movie.  I however think Zellweger steals the show along with Gere and Latifah.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is that two ladies are on murderess row and Gere is trying to make them stars from there.  Yet, there is only one room for a legend.  In the end there will be a star, who will it be?  It is a great remake of a musical and I enjoyed the music.  I think the music shinned right along with the movie!</p></body></html>

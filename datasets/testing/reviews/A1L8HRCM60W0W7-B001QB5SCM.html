<meta name="summary" content="LEAPS RIGHT OUT OF THE FAMILY BONDING FORMULA"></head><body><p>I frequently judge a book by its cover and a movie by its titles. When Garbage's Stupid Girl started rolling in dolby, I knew the director's taste was very much on the ball for a theme where a high roller leaves a lucrative job to become a dog walker. As achingly familiar as the rest of the premise may seem (family folk coming together) this is an earnest, contemporary dramedy about adults -- ok, women -- that has little use for cynicism or oh-so-clever hipness. It chugs right along, all the three leads do their bit, especially Shirley McLaine who even steers Diaz to class hitherto unseen from her (although the shots of Miami could really have done without their glossy painful golden tint), and by the time you're done, you realize that this effortless little delight has in fact built up enough emotional curve to couch quite a touching statement about life and love. A bit like Wonder Boys, that shared the texture of this film. Which means I should probably caveat my gloating paean with the usual 'For discerning audiences only' as a film of this cadence may not appeal to those weaned on a steady diet of Something About Mary or She's the Man. Highly recommended rental if you covet meaning in your movies and don't mind a story that unfurls like a flower instead of a Jack in the Box.</p></body></html>

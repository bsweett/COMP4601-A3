<meta name="summary" content=""Best Gay-Themed Movie Since "Brokeback Mountain"!""></head><body><p>Probably the best thing Sean Penn has ever done in his acting career, "Milk" is a film everyone should see, not just the gay audience. While watching the picture ones get a glimpse as to what gay people went through, back in the 1970's, as far as recognition and respect is concerned. If we think things are tough now, the world was more difficult 30 years ago.<br /> Sean Penn plays Harvery Milk, who was the first openly gay person who held a position in public office in the history of the United States. He was on the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco, and he was determined gay men and women would obtain the same rights as heterosexuals. Harvey  was not only a gay hero, but a hero for all those who didn't have a voice. His bravery and determination is something that is rare in mankind. After watching "Milk" we could learn many things as to what makes people want to obtain that status that we all should have as God's people. The message in this film is clear- we homosexuals are no different than anyone, and when it comes to equal rights we will not stop fighting until those rights are obtained by us. Harvery Milk's work is still felt today, as we have come along way, but there is still work to be done, as homosexuals still cannot marry in America.<br /> Again, this movie wasn't made just for the gay audience- straights could learn a lot from watching this film. After viewing it people get a very good understanding of the hatred and bitterness felt towards gays from our heterosexual counterparts.<br /> The movie really works. The best part of the film is how we are actually put back to the late '70s, in which the producers use actual news footage from the American netwoks documenting the events of Harvey's plight as a poltician, and his work for gay rights. Anita Bryant, probably the biggest hater of gays, is seen in newsreels venting her anger and venom against people who are different.<br /> The picture also dramatizes Harvey's love life as well, as we see how he balances his work and personal life, sometimes often ending in tragic results.<br /> The cast is perfect, and Penn was made for this role. Josh Brolin is also impeccable as the man who untilmately destroys Harvery's life. The other roles too are performed by first-rate actors.<br /> "Milk" would go on to receive 8 Academy Awards nominations, winning Best Actor for Sean Penn, and one for cutie Dustin Lance Black for Best Original screenplay. The picture is also a boxoffice hit and sold millions of DVDs in the first few weeks of release.<br /> The DVD comes with a lot of bonuses, including deleted scenes, and documentaries on "Remembering Harvey Milk", "Hollywood Comes To San Francisco", and "Marching for Equality".<br /> There is also an excellent documentary on Harvery Milk, that came out in 2004 called "The Life of Harvey Milk", that is available on DVD. I would suggest watching that DVD first before watching the film, as it gives an insight into what made this man who he was.<br /> Focus Features, who produced and marketed "Brokeback Mountain", also released "Milk", and they should be applauded for the work they have done in releasing not only a well-dramatized film, but a great educational tool.</p></body></html>

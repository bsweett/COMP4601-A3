Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland are still in good form though. Douglas plays a secret service agent who finds himself wanted after failing a lie detector test. The presidents life is in danger and he is a suspect due to failing the test. Meanwhile his secret affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger) could be a good reason why he failed the test. Sutherland plays a former partner and friend of his that is now after him to bring him in. Eva Longoria is good too as Sutherland's new sexy partner in training who also looks up to Douglas' character and doesn't like having to chase him.<br /><br />  Newsday gave both Firewall and the Sentinel * 1/2 stars saying that Harrison Ford and Michael Douglas are basically too old for roles that have them in action. I disagree though, especially about Michael Douglas. He's in great shape here and looks pretty good for his age. I guess this isn't that much of a new role for him though. I mean how many movies has he done where he's having an affair ? lol. Still though it's fun seeing this guy in action, no not the kind of action we see him in, in Basic Instinct lol. He's good here as a secret service agent, maybe not as good as Clint Eastwood in In The Line of Fire, but still really good. While Sutherland is such a good actor that he manages to not be too Jack Bauerish eventhough he's playing an agent trying to stop this or that from happening. He manages to have David Breckinridge  a bit different than Jack Bauer. He's not as ruthless, that's for sure lol. He's good here but I admit he has a stronger presence on 24.</p></body></html>

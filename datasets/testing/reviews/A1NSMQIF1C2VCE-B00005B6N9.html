<meta name="summary" content="No &quot;Aliens,&quot; for better or worse"></head><body><p>I'd heard, over and over again, how &quot;Pitch Black&quot; was just an &quot;Alien&quot; rip-off. Apparently there's another version of the film going around, since the one I saw was in no way an &quot;Alien&quot; movie. If anything, it owes more to &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; but it's really just another example of a man vs. nature story (flashback to high school English class ...).<p>Of course, if it really was an &quot;Aliens&quot; retread, it might have packed a few more jolts along the way. Perhaps I'm jaded at this point -- it's certainly possible -- but this film was interesting and involving, but not really scary at all.<p>But for my money, it WAS interesting. The intertwined moral dilemmas of the survivors, the biology of the raptors, the cosmology of how that unnamed planet got plunged into darkness once every 22 years ... All solid stuff and more thoughtfully assembled than the last two &quot;Alien&quot; films were.<p>The film was also highlighted by the artistic choices, particularly the use of colored filters during the three suns sequences, the use of Australian actors and writing (&quot;Crikey!&quot;) and the star-making performance of Vin Diesel.<p>Diesel's character slipped once or twice into &quot;ooh, he's SO bad&quot; caricature -- or at least, his dialogue did -- but the moral dilemma he faced and the subtle performance he gave made him a pair of biceps to watch.<p>A good rental when you've decided that you just can't watch &quot;Aliens&quot; again, but want some smart science fiction survival horror. Not the best of its genre, but a worthwhile entry that doesn't deserve much of the criticism heaped upon it.</p></body></html>

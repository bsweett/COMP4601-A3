<meta name="summary" content=""There are people who will go after your humanity...""></head><body><p>Did he or didn't he?<br /><br />When Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) takes an interest in the only Black boy in school, Donald Miller (Joseph Foster) the Principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) makes accusations of impropriety.<br /><br />The Father has an explanation. Donald, an altar boy, was caught drinking sacramental wine. The kid's troubled, his father beats him, and he needs help.  Sister Aloysius doesn't buy it--well, in truth, she doesn't seem capable of giving any kind of warm fuzzy support to her students or her staff.<br /><br />"Leave my son out of this.  My husband will kill my son over one thing like this..." his mother (Viola Davis) begs. She wants her son in Catholic School until June so he can get into a good high school and she's not questioning the motives of someone who's been kind to her son when so few others have been. You see, Mrs. Miller believes her son is 'different' and that's the nature God gave him.<br /><br />Sister James (Amy Adams), a new nun, doesn't believe Father Flynn did anything wrong. She can't sleep after the accusations.<br /><br />"Doubt" is a powerful drama about human nature and tolerance. Father Flynn is not the kind of Catholic Sister Aloysius is--his fingernails are too long, he drinks three sugars in his tea, he wants secular music in the Christmas pageant, and he's openly affectionate to the students...Does that make him inappropriate or wrong?  So--did Father Flynn take liberties with Donald or didn't he?  Watch the film.  Decide for yourself. Perhaps you will have doubts....<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, April 2009</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Do you believe in fairies?""></head><body><p>Every once in a while, we get the opportunity to watch a film that shows what can be done when artistry is used in the way it is intended to be used. In this uncompromising movie, Guillermo del Toro goes all out to deliver a fairy tale that grabs the viewer's emotions and takes them on a rollercoaster ride. The R rating already indicates that this is not your typical fairy tale, but instead it is more in line with the more classic fairy tales of the past, like the uncensored tales by the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />Our main character, Ofelia, is a girl in her early teens who loves to read fairy tales and has a most vivid imagination. At the beginning of the story, she is traveling with her pregnant mother, Carmen, to meet with Captain Vidal in an encampment in the Spanish countryside. The Civil War has ended, but there are still guerrillas fighting for the Republic, and Vidal's task is to help annihilate them. He has forced Carmen to come join him because he is the father of the unborn child and wants the birth to occur in his presence; he completely disregards the dangers of the journey for Carmen in such a late stage of her pregnancy. This is just a glimpse into the Captain's personality, which will be revealed as the movie progresses.<br /><br />Ofelia lost her father in the Civil War, and now uses her fantasy world to endure the situation in which she is in, a mother debilitated by the pregnancy, and a stepfather that is an ogre. She creates an imaginary world based on a book she read and on a stone labyrinth by the military camp. In her fantasy, she meets a faun, who gives her three tasks to carry before the full moon. By completing these, she will become a princess. During these tasks, Ofelia faces monsters that she does not dare face in the real world, and we are exposed to a plot full of cleverly created metaphors.<br /><br />As the fantasy progresses, the clear line between good and bad in the real versus the fantasy world, starts to blur. The story gets darker and there is a fair amount of violence involved. I do not think that the use of this violence is excessive though, since it helps communicate the full extent of the evil behind some of the characters.<br /><br />Besides the great story and masterful direction, this film presents us with enchanting music and neat make-up and wardrobe displays. On top of that, the actors perform their roles convincingly, especially in the cases of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Baquero's performance is on par with some other great performances by kids in the past, such as Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood. Lopez is so good in his role that you feel like grabbing him out of the screen and beating him senseless. I highly recommend this movie, it is a masterpiece!</p></body></html>

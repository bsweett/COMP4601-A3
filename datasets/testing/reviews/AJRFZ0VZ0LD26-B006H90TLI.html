<meta name="summary" content="Why one should not steal money from the bad guys"></head><body><p>Texas heat and a slew of shady characters ornament this movie. As main character Moss runs into mess of human and canine bodies and finds $2MM drug money during his hunting trip, we get to see the determination of the former Vietnam vet to turn the life of his family around once he has a full possesion of his money. As he tries to avoid drug dealers, former special operations soldiers and a serial killer he gets on to fight for his life as if he is back in the war fields.  We track him pacing between US and Mexican border, beaten, battered and wounded attempting with all his might to preserve the money he found in order to ensure a better life for himself and his wife.  Javier Bardem plays a killer who kills indiscriminately everyone on his path.  He needs no other reason to kill them but the fact that people see his face or loose the coin toss bet to dispose of them.  He fights by the principals that are stronger money, power or any other values we are used to.  He makes his own rules.  Ending is somewhat unexpected, but than again this is a Coen Brothers' movie and they have their own way of presenting reality to their audience.  I expected more from this movie.  Josh Brolin shines in his role of a vietnam veteran and so does Tommy Lee Jones in his role of the tired police sheriff.</p></body></html>

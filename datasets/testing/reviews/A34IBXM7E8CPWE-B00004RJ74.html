<meta name="summary" content="This is a really COOL movie"></head><body><p>Is it horror....is it action.....what is this? I don't care, all I know is that this is a really cool flick! The opening dialogue between the Texas Ranger and the unfortunate store clerk is worth the price of the disk alone! I can't believe there are reviewers here who say that this story isn't original! Please name one other movie that mixes so many genre's together in such a successful way??!! When I first heard about "Dusk" I didn't have much hope for it, I mean let's face at the time this was released Clooney was still doing "ER", and basically any movie starring one of NBC's stars from a "Must See TV" show was to be avoided like the plague, "Fools Rush In" with Mathew Perry, or "Ed" with Matt LeBlanc anyone?? So I went to see "Dusk" with some reservation, and I was immediately blown away. I won't go into much detail about the film, because if you don't know what it's about....then buy it and watch without reading further!! Suffice to say, it will be money well spent, and you will get quite a few hours of entertainment from the film and it's extras. If you like horror films, you are gonna like this...Tom Savini's cameo is a real treat. If you like action, cops & robbers shoot 'em ups, you will like this as well. This may be one of the most original movies to pour out of Hollywood in the 90's, and one you shouldn't miss. Go into it with an open mind, and yes there is gore aplenty, but if you are familiar with Tarantino that shouldn't come as any surprise and does not get in the way of the story, any more than the blood quotient affected "Kill Bill". Just sit back and enjoy this bizarre and horrifying journey.</p></body></html>

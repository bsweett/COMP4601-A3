<meta name="summary" content="Spotlessly Mindrifting"></head><body><p>"Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind" is a great 2004 release starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and others.  This critically acclaimed film shows more of writer Charlie Kaufman's creative mind beyond his past works "Adaptation" and "Being John Malkovich".  Some may consider this his best work.  He stays true to his signature writing style throughout this film.  The unusual events chained to one another surprisingly fit, making this film much more groundbreaking.  The plot of Joel wanting to erase ex-girlfriend Clementine from his mind takes a unique turn.  As it explores the relationship between the two - backwards - the camera graphics deeply reveal the emotions of Joel and Clementine.  Meanwhile, Joel learns his past wrongs.<br /><br />The acting amongst the cast is amazing, namely Carrey and Winslet.  Carrey, as Joel, unbelievably holds back the signature slapstick comedy style and replaces it with his dramatic side.  This style is a big step from his previous dramatic effort "The Majestic".  He could finally receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  Equally emotional in her performance is Winslet as Clementine.  As always, whether she expresses free-spirit or sadness, she shows how great an actress she is.  The rest express their strengths in various scenes, especially Dunst after her character discovers a shocking secret about her own past.<br /><br />Such film quality makes "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" enjoyable for many audiences.  Those pleased with Kaufman's work should also watch his previous works.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Very Enjoyable Bond Film!"></head><body><p>Ok, so it's not "Tomorrow Never Dies" but Die another Day impresses more than people give it credit for. The action is amazing, the special effects are also very impressive, the acting is  great, the music is wonderful, the scenery and backrdrops are stunning... You get the point. Die Another Day really is classic cinema, and it should be apprieciated as so. Pierce Brosnan pulls of a stunning performance as James Bond, and Halle Barry is very good as Jinx.<br /><br />My only reservation is reccomending this film is some sexual content (much like any other Bond film.)</p></body></html>

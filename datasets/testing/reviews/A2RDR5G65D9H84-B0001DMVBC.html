<meta name="summary" content=""I want them out of my house""></head><body><p>After watching this movie with my wife I reached a very clear conclusion: this is not a film for everyone. Those of you that can stomach sadness and suffering will be able to admire all the wonderful elements this production presents, from the actors to the settings. However, if dramatic situations spoil the moment for you, you may be able to appreciate the quality of the production, like my wife did, but will probably end up with a bitter taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connoly) is a young widow that is being thrown out of her property for owing a ridiculously low amount of money in property taxes. But right from the start, we know that the ending of this story will not be all joy and happiness, since we catch a glimpse of the future. In this vision, Nicolo appears to be in shock outside of her house, surrounded by police and paramedics that are carrying dead people away from the scene. Following this revelation, we are presented with a collection of scenes that pique our curiosity: a young colonel (Ben Kingsley) cutting down trees that obstruct the view from his new house towards the Caspian Sea, an older colonel Behrani in the luxurious wedding of his daughter, and finally the same Behrani working with a crew on a highway and dreaming of buying a house that he finds in the classified adds.<br /><br />Behrani and his wife go through the effort of making everyone believe that they have money and a high economic status, with not even their kids being aware of the deceit. However, Nicolo's house presents a great opportunity for Behrani, since he is planning to buy it, make some improvements and then sell it at a handsome profit. When he achieves his goal of purchasing the property, he is in heaven, but everything comes tumbling down when Kathy's lawyer begins with his attempts for trying to repossess the house. That is when the hostilities begin and matters get complicated with other events, like a crooked police officer getting involved in the conflict.<br /><br />Firmly supported by a good performance by Connoly and an amazing job by Kingsley, which should have placed him as a serious candidate for the Oscar for Best Actor, this movie has all the required characteristics to provide a valuable experience. The plot is extremely engaging and it does not lack tense moments and its fair share of suspense. As I mentioned before, only those that are very sensitive to sad situations and suffering should stay away. For the rest of you, this should be a highly rewarding film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A GOOD OL FASION MONSTER MOVIE !"></head><body><p>Back when i saw this in the theatre i can remember walking out feeling a bit let down but since then after a few more viewings this film has seriously grown on me! What happend is i was making an AS out of UME being foolish & i went into it originaly thinking it was going to be a full on backwoods slasher film!?!my own fault! Anyway now that i have grown to except it for what it really is "A MONSTER MOVIE" i can with no doubts exclaim that this is an excellent old fasion style monster mash that has stuck itself to my horror fan ribbs & ain't let'n go,nor do i want it to!</p></body></html>

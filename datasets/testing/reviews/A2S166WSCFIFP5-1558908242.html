<meta name="summary" content="a fine piece of storytelling"></head><body><p>Pulp Fiction has often been hailed as one of the greatest films made-certainly one of the best in modern times (along with Fargo, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Star Wars trilogy). And it is easy to see why. Beside being a great film, it catapulted Tarantino into the public's eye, revived the dead career of John Travolta, introduced us to Tim Roth, reminded us of Harvey Keitel and Ving Rhames, gave us so many catch phrases, and ingrained itself into American pop culture. This is arguably Tarantino's best film (only Reservoir Dogs can compete with it) and after watching it, there is little room for doubt about the greatness of the film. As a film, volumes can be written on it, and I can't say enough of it here.<p>Now, on to the dvd... We've waited 10 years for a special edition. But has it been worth the wait? I think so. It is a 2 disc set, in an attractive slipcover case. Disc 1 contains the movie and an enhanced trivia track. No, there is not a commentary track, but the trivia track fills in (somewhat) nicely. I do wish Tarantino had chosen to include a commentary track. There is also a section called `Soundtrack Chapters.' Anyone who has seen Pulp Fiction (or any Tarantino movie for that matter), knows how important music is to the film. This option allows you to jump to the various music selections in the film. Disc 2 contains deleted scenes, a behind the scenes montage (weak), a documentary ("Pulp Fiction: The Facts"), the Independent Spirit Awards (where Pulp Fiction won), the Palm d'Or Acceptance Speech, a production design featurette, Siskel and Ebert's "At the Movies" segment on the `Tarantino generation,' Tarantino's appearance on the Charlie Rose show, as well as trailers, tv spots, stills, and articles and reviews. And it is loaded with dvd-rom extras. The dvd was worth the wait (even without a commentary track), and it is finally nice to see dvd worthy of the film.</p></body></html>

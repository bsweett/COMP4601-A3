<meta name="summary" content="this movie will unleash your inner beast."></head><body><p>this movie brung in a lot of green, I bet y'all anything. this is the best movie I bought. no cussing in it and no stupid pop stars in it. Eric Bana plays Bruce Banner, a scientist who becomes the Hulk after a lab accident. he was injected with nanomeds as a young child and then saves the life of a labmate by absorbing gamma radiation himself. Nick Nolte plays David Banner. David becomes a different creature by breathing in the chemicals and then exposing himself to the same gamma rays. later on, he gets electrified and therefore able to mesh with the environment. this is a good movie. why was it not called "The Incredible Hulk" like the TV series of the seventies?</p></body></html>

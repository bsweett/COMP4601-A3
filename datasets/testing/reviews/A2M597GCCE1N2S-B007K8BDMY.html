He spent more than a 100 hours of videotaping the bears and himself living with them in their forestes and fields. This is one of the best documentaries ever made about how this man lived and breathed wild life.<br /><br />The documentary goes on to show how Timothy lived and died with what he loved so much. His death was very tragic to both friends and family but even they say if he was killed by a grizzly bear it would be the one way he would have liked to have gone.<br /><br />The documentary is filled with hundreds of beautiful shots of landscape. Mountains, lakes, streams, grass fields, and forests show just what Timothy loved to do and film. He made friends with foxes as well as bears and had names for what seemed like 2 dozen different seperate animals. What amazes me is that he remember the names for each animal and didn't even once seem to mix them up. Thats how long he lived out in the wild.<br /><br />The documentary cuts from different shots of Timothy and what he dealt with besides videotaping the grizzlies. From yelling up at god, or allah, or "That floating Hindu thing" as he called it for a rainstorm to come so the salmon could swim upstream and the bears could eat, to watching people actually have the nerve to throw rocks at bears as they came to close as he hid in the bushes nearby.<br /><br />A lot of different people who knew Timothy talked about how they knew Timothy and what they thought about what he did and how he died. While some say he actually got what he deserved [I personally disagree] to others who say he hated civillization compared to life in the wild, everyone seemed to agree that Timothy loved what he was doing and that he would never hurt a Grizzly bear on purpose.<br /><br />The story is very gripping and just watching how Timothy talks about the bears and how he manages to approach them almost to where he could reach out and touch them is fascinating enough.<br /><br />This is one documentary that you need to see for many reasons; for the scenery, for the footage of the great bears and foxes, to seeing friends and family spread the ashes of Timothy in a emotional scene, this is definately worth checking out.</p></body></html>

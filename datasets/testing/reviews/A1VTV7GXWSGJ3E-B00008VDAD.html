Based on astronaut Jim Lovells book &quot;Lost Moon&quot; and directed by Ron Howard this movie takes you within the first 10 minutes from the tradegy of Apollo 1, and the deaths of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, right into the Landing on the moon by Apollo 11. With that as a setting it will focus on the events leading to the disaster and through the heroics efforts of both the astronauts and the ground crew.<p>Based on a time when America had become somewhat bored with Moon landings (although this was only the third scheduled) Apollo 13 takes you step-by-step through the story. Starting with the 3 astronuats (Lovell, Haise. and Mattingly) training for their mission and displaying the type of teamwork that is so essential to a successful mission, it then leads you to the last minute replacement of Mattingly by Swaggart due to potential health concerns. From there it shows the concern of Haise and Lovell as Swaggart tries to fit into their style. Swaggart never quite accomplishes this which would lead to a confrontation with Haise during the flight. The personnel of Mission Control are the real heros here though, from the leadership of Flight Director Gene Krantz to the efforts of every single person.<p>The cast of Apollo 13 actually made the movie come alive. Yes, the special effects were great, but without the perfect acting jobs by the strong cast this could have fallen into documentry standards. Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell displays the confidence that you would expect from the mission leader. Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly is wonderful, going from the excitment of pre-flight to the disappointment of being scatched from the mission to the results-driven savior. Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan round out a great cast.<p>Having read the book before seeing the movie it's interesting to note that while the movie is about a 50/50 mix of action between the astronauts and Mission Control, the book is about a 75/25 split in favor of Houston. Both approaches are correct. In book form the author can take the time to go into detail of all the heroic actions and efforts that the personel of Mission Control had to do to bring these men home safely. In the movie it's best to cover the essentials. However if this movie was interesting to you I would HIGHLY recommend the book. It gives you great insight into all that transpired.</p></body></html>

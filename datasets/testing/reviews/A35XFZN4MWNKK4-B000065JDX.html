<meta name="summary" content="CLASSIC TARRENTINO"></head><body><p>Quentin Tarentino stars as a deranged convict who, along with his brother, played brilliantly by GEORGE CLOONEY, kidnaps a preacher (HARVEY KIETEL),  and his two kids (which includes JULIETTE LEWIS of NATURAL BORN KILLERS)  and flees for the safety of a remote nightclub in Mexico, only once they're  there they discover that the club is actually a safe haven for blood  thirsty vampires! The plots twist was as surprising as ever as origanlly i  thought this was settling down to be a hostage drama but then thats the  genius of Tarentinos work. This movie is as compelling as ever with the  dialogue often being very darkly humorous, whilst the performances are top  notch and this film is certainly nothing short of one long, wild adventure!</p></body></html>

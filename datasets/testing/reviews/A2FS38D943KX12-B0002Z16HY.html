<meta name="summary" content="A study of disintegration, on both a national & individual level"></head><body><p>Simply put, one finds out a lot about people when the chips are down.  As it becomes apparent to everyone that not only are the best days of the Nazis behind them, but the coming end of the 1000-Year Reich can be counted in days rather than years, the assorted characters exhibit as wide a range of responses as is possible.<br /><br />Amost the entire cast of characters is portrayed.  The sycophantic Himmler pledges eternal loyalty & immediately attempts to cut a self-preserving deal with the allies.  Meanwhile, an equally sycophantic Albert Speer comes to the realization that, at long long last, enough is enough --- and defies Hitler's order to consign the German people to certain destruction.  Some subordinates realize, too late, that they have been following a false idol.  Others, like Magda Goebbels, never give up the faith & pursue their devotion to Hitler & National Socialism to its horrifying conclusion.  The generals, comprised at this point almost entirely of toadying yes-men, know that Hitler is ordering the movement of phantom armies & is totally divorced from the reality of the war, but their fundamental spinelessness prevents them, even when it is clear that all is lost, from telling their boss that he has no idea what he is doing.<br /><br />Other characters display flashes of humanity.  Some detractors have seen this, along with the portrayal of Hitler's warmer side with close associates, as evidence of a sort of German apologism, but it is only honest filmmaking.  Nobody is a one-dimensional cartoon figure, and even the worst of human beings have their good moments, despite their normally wretched personalities.  In some cases, the dire straits of Berlin's collapse result in some normally vile individuals displaying compassionate behavior because it truly is what the situation must call for.  By contrast, some people (and Magda Goebbels surely must come to mind here in probably the most heart-rending scene in the film) make the most sickening choices possible.<br /><br />What struck me most about this film was the study & portrayal of disintegration.  As Germany collapsed, Hitler's own mind & spirit rapidly unravel.  As Hitler collapses, his subordinates, who by following Hitler abdicated their responsibilities as members of the human race, are forced to make individual reckonings with their deeds and the disintegration of the artificial worlds they have created.  Collapse begets collapse.<br /><br />One will not easily lose the impact of this film.  It is often difficult to watch, but definitely worth it.</p></body></html>

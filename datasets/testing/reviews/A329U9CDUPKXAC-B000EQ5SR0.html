<meta name="summary" content="This is NOT Catwoman 2!"></head><body><p>Whoever says Aeon Flux is Catwoman 2 is an idiot and should be ignored. This is a very good movie. It's not without it's faults. The director isn't very good when it comes to action scenes and the acting is pretty dry. But there's a solid and original story here and the scenery looks great. Science Fiction movies like this can be extremely difficult to follow (The Matrix) but this director does a very good job of making a complicated story easy to understand.<br /><br />I actually think it was a good idea not to let critics screen this movie in advance. They all typically hate this type of movie. But for people like me, this is great entertainment.<br /><br />I give Aeon Flux an 8 out of 10.</p></body></html>

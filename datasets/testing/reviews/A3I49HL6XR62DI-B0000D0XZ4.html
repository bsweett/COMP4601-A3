<meta name="summary" content="I was prepared to hate this movie"></head><body><p>Based on critical reviews of The Hulk, I was prepared to hate it. I put off viewing the film for a long time because I believed that it was a poor film. WRONG! The special effect of the Hulk is terrific. The storyline is excellent. Casting is great, featuring Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte in striking roles. This is a long film -- 2 hrs. 18 min., but it doesn't feel like a long movie. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

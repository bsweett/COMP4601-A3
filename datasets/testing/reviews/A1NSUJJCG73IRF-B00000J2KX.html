<meta name="summary" content="The Shining  (1980)"></head><body><p>Director:  Stanley Kubrick<br /><br />Cast: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scotman Crothers, Barry Nelson, Philip Stone, Joe Turkel, Anne Jackson, Tony Burton.<br /><br />Running Time:  146 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence and language.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick is one of the best American directors who ever lived. No recent filmmaker has more effectively depicted ideas and created movies that literally defined generations; such films by Kubrick include "2001: A Space Odyssey," "A Clockwork Orange," "Dr. Strangelove," and most recently Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the psychosexual thriller "Eyes Wide Shut." Twenty years ago, this infinite artist completed "The Shining," one of the scariest movies ever made. The film, based on the similarly horrifying novel by Stephen King, is vivid in its characters and overpoweringly haunting with its terrifying undertones. Stanley Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed this thriller that is well worth the view.  Jack Nicholson is at his maniacal best as Jack Torrence, a failed writer who takes on the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, located high in the Colorado Rockies. He is advised by the hotel manager (Barry Nelson) that the big requirement for the job is that the person who takes it on should be able to handle five to six months of absolute isolation. One past caretaker couldn't, and went insane, killing his wife and two daughters with a hatchet, and himself with a shotgun.  Nicholson nevertheless takes on the job, and brings his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) up there with him for company. But Lloyd, blessed (or cursed) with extrasensory powers (the "shining"), is acutely aware of the Overlook's inherent evil, embodied in his mind by the ghosts of the two girls, and in Nicholson's ever-crumbling mind by a sinister barman named Lloyd (Joe Turkel). And once the winter snows shut the Torrence family in, these elements combine with isolation and claustrophobia to turn Nicholson into an axe-wielding maniac.<br /><br />Shot primarily on one vast soundstage in England, "The Shining" has some of the most awesome cinematography and production design ever made for a horror movie. The camera work (using the Steadicam, one of its first uses ever) is incredible. Kubrick's choice of music is also very savvy: dissonant works by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti, and, most ominously, Krzysztof Penderecki really give the film is epic sense of terror. While grand in scale is its beauty and terror, it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. Jack Nicholson extensively defines Stanley Kubrick's horrific masterpiece. His performance is outstanding, easily the best of his career. He intelligently depicts a character of intensity and raw barbaric depth. Also perfectly cast is Shelley DuVall, performing with fright-inducing intricacy. Danny Lloyd, best compared with today's Haley Joel Osment, is top notch as well.<br /><br />Although "The Shining" is a precarious, well-portrayed adaptation, its conclusion is disappointing in the highest regards. With such an effective first and second act and superior character development, we come to expect more than a lazy, disagreeable closing like this; "The Shining" does not execute the climax in which it builds.  All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.  Certainly one of the most engrossing and interesting films of the genre, "The Shining" will always be adored by some and scrutinized by others; it is this kind of enigmatic triumph that makes cinema so grand and so disappointing in the same breath.</p></body></html>

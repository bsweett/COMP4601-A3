I suppose this might be the case with those who like myself are not reading the books, but it is a wonderfully entertaining experience and I never feel any lessening of enjoyment when we put these on.  We are watching the entire series prior to the finale and I am again in awe of the subtle interconnections of plot, the threads of deepening themes, and mysteries to be later explained.  As always, it is a pleasure to see the actors grow.  This is the best series of sophisticated kids' films that I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good story but a BAD movie"></head><body><p>THE DESCENDANTS got a lot of press around awards time, and it deserved none of the accolades it received. I don't know if critics thought they had to like it since it came from Oscar winning director Alexander Payne, or if it was because it started Hollywood Golden Boy George Clooney, or if it because it had a nice, sweet, anti-business message. For whatever reason, critics got it wrong. It's unfortunate that this movie is a total bore, except for Sid (Nick Krause) and possibly Julie Speer (Judy Greer), the slacker boyfriend, because the story is a good one.<br /><br />The plot is simple. A man (Matt King, Clooney) is caring for his wife who is in a coma. He discovers she was cheating on him. She is going to die. King has to cope with losing his wife, and never getting to confront her about her cheating. He also gets a chance to meet the man who she was cheating with. The movie had all sorts of opportunities to create a story about forgiveness and reconciliation. Or, it could have gone darker and crafted a story of revenge and bitterness. Instead, it takes the approach of apathy. I'm not saying King or his two daughters (the non-entity Scotty, or the foul mouthed, cute 18-year old Alex) don't care about their mom or her cheating ways. I'm saying that the viewers have no reason to care. Perhaps one of the reason I cared so little is because of the stupid side story about the descendants. It seems King and his numerous cousins have descended from Hawaiian royalty and they face a big decision on who they should sell some property to and make millions. That story line added nothing to the plot.<br /><br />If this movie hadn't been lauded as one of the best of the year, I would have enjoyed it. Instead, I'm tired of watching movies Hollywood claims to be good and being bored out of my mind.  I remember reading a story about Matthew Lillard, who plays the man the wife cheats with, Brian Speer. It made it sound like his part mattered in the movie. But it didn't. He was hardly on screen at all. He didn't matter. Just like this movie. It doesn't matter.</p></body></html>

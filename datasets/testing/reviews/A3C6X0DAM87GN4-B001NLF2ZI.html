After Siliva Broome (Kidman) reports what she heard the secret service get involved (Sean Penn and Catherine Keener) and soon we are engaged in a guessing game of who could possible want to kill the African leader. So far pretty straight forward, right? What I dislike about the movie though is as it's setting up its characters we can tell who's going to do it. At first we think the movie is just trying to make us beleieve it's "so and so" but by the end of the picture we see that it actually is "so and so". The movie never should have done this. What this did for me was lower the suspense of the situation. The movie is actually leading us down the right path.<br /><br /> Another problem I have witht he movie is Nicole Kidman's performance. She has a murky past, and at first agent Keller (Penn) isn't sure he can trust her. She's keeping too many secrets. Now clearly the movie is doing this to create suspense and have us suspect Kidman but the way I interepreted her character was as someone who is non-cooperative and making things harder than they have to be. Kidman's character fears for her life and yet she will not fully cooperate with the police. What's wrong with her? She could die at any moment and refuses to tell the police what they need to know. After a while I lost all sympathy for her which is bad because now who does the viewer have to invest their emotions with. This cat and mouse game betwen Penn and Kidman, while interesting at first, becomes annoying.<br /><br /> Now I should point out my high opinion of the talent involved. I think with the exception of Naomi Watts, Kidman is the best actress working today. Sean Penn is without doubt the best actor of his generation. While he may not have the box-office appeal of a Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, I think he can dances circles around them. Performance after performance he demonstrates his wide range: "Mystic River", "21 Grams", and "Sweet and Lowdown". I also have a lot of respect for actor\director Sydney Pollack who has directed some films I've enjoyed very much. Given my opinion of the people involved you can imagine my disappointment.<br /><br /> Much has been made of the fact this movie was the first to be shot inside the UN. I think once we start paying more attention to the locations than the story we're in trouble. So what if this movie was shot inside the UN. I didn't think much was made of it.<br /><br /> I want to go back to Kidman's performance because I was bothered by it so. There's a moment in the film when Penn asks 'What do we know about this woman?' What's her religion? Does she vote? Is she a Democrat or a Republican? In short who is she? The question is asked but I never quite felt we get an answer. The movie spends too much time trying to hide her past and not enough time activately involving her in action.<br /><br /> But perhaps I'm being too hard on the film. I don't know. There were moments when I enjoyed Penn's performance and thought the film had some suspenseful moments, a bus scene comes to mind. Despite everything I even thought Kidman has one or two good scenes and Sydney Pollack does a nice job of holding everything together. He knows how to handle the material. But overall I just can't help but feel the movie doesn't quite live up to what could have been.<br /><br />** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br />p.s. I noticed a goof in the movie. Pay attention to Kidman's hair in the scene where Penn questions her about a photo and a scene in a bar. Notice how her hair shifts position.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Mildly disappointing film that has a wonderful cast that doesn't quite live up to what could have been. Has some goos scenes but left me wanting more.</p></body></html>

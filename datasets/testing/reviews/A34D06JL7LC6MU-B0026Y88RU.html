While critics didn't like it, audiences have responded to it really well which prompted me to watch it. This is not a movie that you're going to hear mentioned at Oscar time, but it's a perfect example of Saturday night entertainment. First off, it's obvious what movies have inspired it...Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects, etc. And it's not better than those movies by far, but it's extremely entertaining, has great actors in it, and has good dialogue. The latter which sometimes sounds like outtakes from Pulp Fiction. After a strange opening (which won't make sense until the end of the film), we meet Slevin (Josh Hartnett, 'The Black Dahlia'). Slevin is having a bad day. He got fired from his job, his apartment has been condemned, he's caught his girlfriend cheating on him, and a mugger has just broken his nose. Now, he's at the apartment of his friend Nick Fisher and Nick isn't there. After meeting Lindsey (Lucy Liu), a friend of Nick's, two gangsters show up and transport Slevin to a large building; Home to The Boss (Morgan Freeman), a mobster who's son has recently been gunned down. Turns out, Nick owes The Boss a lot of money and since Nick is nowhere to be found...Slevin is responsible for paying the debt. Problem is, he owes The Boss 96,000 dollars. Instead, The Boss offers him a deal. Murder a rival mob boss' son. Slevin goes back to Nick's apartment, but is picked up by two more gangsters and transported to the building across from The Boss'.Here is The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, great as always); The Boss' rival. Nick owes The Rabbi some money too and Slevin has 48 hours to deliver it. Add in a hitman named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who seems to be playing both sides of the table and you have "Lucky Number Slevin." One thing I'm surprised the film didn't get more notice for was it's complex, intriguing, and sensical ending. The ending is actually really unpredictable and makes sense. The film's biggest flaw comes from the fact that it drags slightly in the last 20 minutes. Not the ending, but the pace of the film just lessens. Anyway, while I'd recommend seeing Pulp Fiction or The Usual Suspects before this, this is a really good movie and proof that you shouldn't always listen to well-known film critics.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

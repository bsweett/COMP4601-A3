You get a very human side to the other side in this famous WWII battle.  The Japanese basically know the war is lost, but they still have their honor and want to protect their homeland.  The best way to do that is to deny the American's this island to use as a base to launch attacks on the Japanese homeland.  To the last man they intent to fight until the end.  Really incredible characterization which shows you the generals all the way down to the peasant soldier digging trenches.  The movie is mostly in Japanese, but don't let that scare you.  I am not a big foreign film fan, but I found the subtitles not distracting at all.  The acting is so strong, you could probably just watch it without the subtitles and still be able to follow the flow of the story.  The acting is that strong.  This is a must for any war film fan and any fan of a great movie.</p></body></html>

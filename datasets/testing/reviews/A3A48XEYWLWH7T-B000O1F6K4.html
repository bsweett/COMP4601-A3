This and Fools Rush In are my favorites of hers.  She and Antonio definitely have a great chemistry onscreen in this Mexican shoot-out noir.  Antonio, previously a mariachi, is on a revenge kick to kill the drug lords responsible for the death of his beloved and the loss of his guitar playing hand. The action sequences are marvelous and hold up well to the matrix style enhanced effects that came about later in the 90's.  Salma plays a strong willed and capable Latina book store owner, who crosses paths with the Mariachi, with a quiet fortitude.  She falls a bit too quickly for the hero as all hell breaks loose with the final showdown between Antonio, his two buddies [wielding guitar cases that launch rockets and double as machine guns], and the final drug lord.  A dark and not so subtle humour pervades, especially with Cheech and Tarantino.  Overall an effective, amusing, enjoyable action flick with a bunch of great ensemble cast.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE AWFUL CONSEQUENCES THAT SHAPE A MAN"></head><body><p>Excellent acting  --<br /><br />Jimmy seems to have just stayed in his life of mafia crime.  Heading up the Savage brothers.  All relatives.  Was his second wife egging him on.  Because of her daughters was there jealousy?<br /><br />How did he feel about the brutalizing of Davey?<br /><br />Dave, of course, was still living with the trauma he suffered as a child.  Yet he still seemed to be a loving husband and father.  Was he the last one to see Jimmy's eighteen year old daughter?  What was she doing at the bar anyway?<br /><br />Sean was having his own problems with his wife.  Yet he kept up an intense search for the killer of Jimmy's daughter.  It was spine-tingling to watch the clues unfold.  When you thought you knew who the killer was something else popped up.<br /><br />And was Dave's wife eyeing Sean?  Good thing his wife and daughter showed up.<br /><br />The character of Jimmy proves that mob control never leads to justice.  What a ratty character.<br /><br />Dave's trauma was powerfully moving - he had my sympathy.<br /><br />Sean seemed to be cool and controled in the midst of chaos even with his own problems.<br /><br />This was a combination of some very powerful acting of both the men and women involved.<br /><br />It must be viewed with sensitivity and an open mind to be able to catch all of the nuances of tragedy involved.</p></body></html>

A man and a woman basically fall for each other in a mansion. The man is accused of a serious crime by the younger sister of woman he loves. He goes to jail and after that becomes a solder in the war. The centerpiece of the film is a great visual of the Evacuation of Dunkirk. This was a famous evacuation during WWII that saved 338,000 Allied troops. If you are a WWII history buff this scene alone is a must see. In the process of the film the younger sister grows up and realizes she had wrongly accused her sister's lover. Deep instances of cinematic atonement ensues. The literary lesson at hand: leave no stone unturned.<br /><br />Atonement:Reparation for a wrong or injury: "she wanted to make atonement for her behavior".</p></body></html>

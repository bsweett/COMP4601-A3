<meta name="summary" content="The King of Cheese,"Hail to the King Baby""></head><body><p>The third installment of the Evil Dead series and for years and years...I'm hoping not the last.While this Evil Dead film is toned down and "comic booked up" quite a bit from its previous counterparts,it is all the more fun and entertaining.Ash is back(right where we left him off)-stuck back in time without a clue,his chainsaw,the Oldsmobile and his "boomstick" and more attitude and wise cracks to help rid the land of the "Evil Dead".This is a throughly enjoyable film and "kid friendly" from about the age of 10 and up.There are a few curse words here and there,but if your kid has Play Station games(unless they are "G" rated) he/she has already been introduced to an arangement of swears and curses(whether you have heard them or not).The Army of Darknss is great fun to watch,Sam Rami hasn't forgotten his roots and the three stoges humor and scares are abundent.Bruce Campbell is the ultimate "B" movie actor with phenominal comedic timing.Something honed to perfection from his relationship with Rami made many moons ago.Well worth owning,but will truely be enjoyed with the viewing/purchase of Evil Dead II,Dead before Dawn.I laughed until my sides split uncontrollibly as well as revelled in Ash's timeless one liners."Hail to the King Baby",the Evil Dead is here to stay.</p></body></html>

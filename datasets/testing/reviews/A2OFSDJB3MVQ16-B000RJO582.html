<meta name="summary" content="Splendid remake of Romero's '78 thriller"></head><body><p>I just purchased this remake of Romero's thriller in HD DVD at a bargain price and it's a winner in many ways, an improvement over the original.  Although the original had some political points to make, Zack Snyder's version is more focused on the myraid characters who find escape, temporarily, in the mall.  Also the acting is much better here than the original plus the wide screen and Dolby sound pull you in on the horror that is to come.  Definitely recommended for all horror purists and zombie enthusiasts!  Much better than the "28 Weeks Later" debacle.</p></body></html>

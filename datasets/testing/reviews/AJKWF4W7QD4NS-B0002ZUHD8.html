Clive Owen stars as Arthur; a Roman soldier stuck defending England against the invading horde of Saxons.  Even though there are tons of historical inaccuracies, twitchy logic, and even some sloppy editing; this King Arthur still manages to be entertaining and packs in so much well choreographed action that you'll ignore most, if not all, of the bad points of the film.  Owen is good as the heroic Arthur, and Keira Knightley is just plain gorgeous as warrior babe Guinevere, who loves arrows and leather straps.  Ioan Gruffudd is here as well as Lancelot, along with Stellan Skarsg?rd, Ray Winstone, and Ray Stevenson from HBO's Rome.  All in all, King Arthur is an enjoyable, pretty much mindless, action film that delivers the goods it promises, and is better than what you may think.</p></body></html>

This film has all the atmosphere, all the feverish guilt and anguish at fate, all the gory action.  The great difference is that the actors are uniformly superlative, not second-raters like Lon Chaney, Jr.  Of course, the effects are also superior.  Finally, the plot of the story diverges significantly from the original, which makes it stand on its own as something new, with somewhat richer themes than the original.  In particular, the psychologies of the various characters are complex and almost deep, which is great fun.<br /><br />TO say anything more would reveal too much.  I recommend this with enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

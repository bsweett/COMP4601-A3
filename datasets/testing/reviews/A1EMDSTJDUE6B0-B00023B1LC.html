<meta name="summary" content="Old Genre, Still Good"></head><body><p>This is certainly an old genre, but the movie turns out good. Although somewhat predictable, it has a much more realistic angle that most films of this type forget. We have a talented professional who forgets it all, which would be a blessing to many in the field, but who shows that what most of us really want (besides freedom) is to know ourselves and to be loved. This film provides both and does it at a good pace.</p></body></html>

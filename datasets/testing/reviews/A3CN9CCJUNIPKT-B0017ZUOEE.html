<meta name="summary" content="Eerie, not gory -- a fine, suspenseful ghost story"></head><body><p>Amid the current crop of slasherly, hyperviolent horror films, "The Orphanage," from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, stands out as an artful, restrained gem of the genre. The movie is driven by plot, personality, fine acting and gorgeous cinematography.  Although many elements are familiar (with wisps of "The Shining," "The Devil's Backbone," and numerous other classics...) the film still feels fresh.  Lead actor Belen Rueda's turn as a mother fighting to get her child back from the grip of supernatural forces is a powerful performance; indeed, everything about this film is well-crafted and intelligently assembled. Worth checking out!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></body></html>

If you are a fan of old cerels from the 70s you will love this movie. If I was 10 years old and I saw this movie I would be in love with it and it would be my favorite movie! But instead I am 17 and I love this movie as much as if I was 9 0r 10 again! Great DVD, transfer, and features make this a must buy for fans of the films "The Incredibles", "Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope" or "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"!!!</p></body></html>

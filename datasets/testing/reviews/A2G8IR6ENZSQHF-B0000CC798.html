<meta name="summary" content="Arguably the best comic book film ever"></head><body><p>I waited for three years for &quot;X2&quot; to be released, and I walked into the theater saying to myself, &quot;Please God, don't let this movie suck like Batman and Robin&quot;.  I walked out of it a happy person, as Bryan Singer continues the X-Men saga in high fashion.<p>&quot;X2&quot; is an improvement over its predecessor in almost every single way.  It is longer and the charatcers are given more screen time.  The action is better (the military attack on the X-school is probably the film's action highlight).  The script is tighter and more focused, and the film is overall much more ambitious.<p>Singer took some obvious risks with &quot;X2&quot;.  Its themes are very dark for a mainstream comic book movie- genocide, parental rejection, repressed trauma.  Magneto continues to be a great villain- not evil, but horribly misguided.  Forcing him and the X-Men into an uneasy alliance was probably Singer's best move.  The theme of the X-Men's curse is made more obvious here- they are doomed to protect people who hate and fear them.  However, beneath all the darkness, this film is still fun- there's a couple moments of comic relief, and Wolverine still exudes a playful charm.  Singer manages to strike the right balance here between welcome in-jokes and downright campiness, such as what the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise fell into.<p>To make things even better, &quot;X2&quot; is fully loaded with special features, including commentary and several making-of documentaries.  I would highly recommend this film not only for X-Men fans, but fans of good action films in general.  It's much better than most of the other stuff released this year, a welcome relief from the disappointments of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; sequels, and &quot;Terminator 3&quot;.  I simply love this movie.</p></body></html>

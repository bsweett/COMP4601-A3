<meta name="summary" content="I dunno who's been sniffing most glue, King, Koepp, or Depp"></head><body><p>In any event, some serious glue sniffing definitely was comorbid with the making of this movie.  The flick is bad beyond belief.  For starters, there's the opening shot of Depp's shack, with the camera panning in over the water.  Now, hasn't this panning-in-over-the-water-in-double-mix-up-type-thrillers thing been a little run into the ground?  The secret ground?  I guess not, because here it is again, ladies and germs, right on the fuggin screen at a multiplex near you.  At least you wont be startled by the unfamiliar.  And we Hollywood types know how nervous you bourgeois filmgoers get when something original happen, kapeesh?  Not to worry, this one's gonna be as well-trammeled as your brain.  You know those characters you seen Johnny Depp portraying, like in films long ago?  Weeeeel, he's gonna be portraying them all over again in this "new" flick.  Yep, you'll thrill to seeing Raoul Duke reincarnated as some kind of degnerate writer who shacks up in a cabin with a cleaning lady he cannot stand to have around.  Why don't he just fire her?  Hey, listen honeybabe, then we wouldn't have a picture, now would we.  On the subject of Johhnny Deppp, the poor fellow should be sent to quirkaholics anonymous, he done should.  He oughta kinda git up thar an' say, like, "Mah nayme is Joannna Deeapp an' ahhhm a quirkaholic."  While he's saying this he can flex his mouth muscles like he's got TMJ, raise his eyebrows meaninglessly a few times, widen his eyes... you know, the whole bit!  lISTEN, dEPP  I'm on to you.  You know who I am and if you don't you can find out by doing a little detective work.  I demand you come down here and slap my face.  You know, you can knock on the door while I'm taking a cr*p or something, and when I go to the door while the dogs are barking and say, irritated as hell, "Yes, can I help you!?!?"  You can say, "Uhh, yeah, this is Johnny Depp," in a voice that sounds like your jaw's been wired shut.  Then I'll open the door and you can slap my face.<br />Now, to change gears a hair, on the subject of Koepp, my diagnosis is that he did up a few tubes of glue in the car on the way over to the scriptwriters' meeting, then - during the meeting - went inno the bathroom and got busy with some aerosol cans.  This is the only possible explanation for the lousiness of this script.  You know, he goes back to the meeting and the writers are tryina tell him the script is lousy but he's flying so high on Frazee paint fumes that he don't hear a thing.  Hey, listen, Koepp, I've been there, knowhamsayin?  But listen, honeybabe, put the paper bag down, and step away from it.  Which brings us to the subject of Stephen King.<br />All I can really find to say about King is that if I was his wife, I would be getting pretty frookin nervous by now.  First the Shining and now this?  Noooooo, heee doesn't wanna murder his wife, noooooooooooo.<br />And I'm out.<br />P.S. really Depp, I mean it.  get your *ss down here.</p></body></html>

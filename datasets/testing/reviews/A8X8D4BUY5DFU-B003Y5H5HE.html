Love silents and this Georges Melies eulogy is truly wonderful in all respects. Hooray for Martin Scorsese. Another Ben Kingsly success, Baron Sacha Cohen's best role, and Asa Butterfield was fabulous. Now have seen this movie 4 times and it is just the beginning of a long relationship. My only criticism is the scene when Hugo he starts up the ladder and ends up going down into the clock. What did I miss?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good Gothic Halloween Horror show"></head><body><p>I liked this movie because it had a dark, gothic atmosphere. The whole movie draws you into a cold autumn town being stalked by the headless horseman. The movie had great gore and bloodshed in it The butchery is beautiful. It has a very good story line that was way more developed than the original headless horseman story. This is a great Halloween movie. Great sound, great picture</p></body></html>

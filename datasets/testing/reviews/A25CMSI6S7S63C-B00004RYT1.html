<meta name="summary" content="Psycho is the best horror movie, you should own at least one DVD of it"></head><body><p>I absolutely just love this movie ! This is one of the best horror movies of all time, and Hitchcock said he did it as a joke. This was his first horror movie, a huge departure from his crime & suspense drama's. Never has one scene caused so much attention and inspired all the slashers you see today. The most iconic scene ever is the shower scene,bar none. Nothing like this had ever been shown, a man who dresses as a woman due to a mother complex kills people who arouse him, and those who try to catch the killer. Anthony Perkins was typecast forever for his role of Norman Bates. Janet Leigh became an icon who refused to let her daughter watch this,of course that is Jamie Lee Curtis, who went on to star in Halloween. John Gavin is Sam Loomis, where else did you hear this name - why Halloween of course - Donald Pleasence - he is Dr. Sam Loomis - hmm.<br />This movie broke new grounds for horror suspense and even as Janet Leigh walking around in her under garments. This was Hitch's most serious horror so he appeared early (as he usually does in his films) but this movie was more subtle since this movie was not to contain any inside jokes. The music is fantastic, parts of it show up in Friday the 13th, Re-Animator,etc.<br />If you have never seen this movie, you really really must see this. A brilliant movie, in black and white, to show the grittiness of the picture. ULTRA HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.<br />The DVD that I have is the new book shaped case with all sorts of bonus features which to me are just fantastic. A lot of people still like the collectors edition, or the box set, or what have you. I went for the Legacy and I am quite happy with the transfer, features,etc. A double dip that to me was worth it.</p></body></html>

As the cliche goes...before you go in leave your brain at the door.  But in this case, that could be taken literally (as one scene in the film will explain that.)<br /><br />Anyway, is this film good?  No, not really.  Its premise is just as stupid as countless other Seventies Grindhouse-style films.  But what makes this one different is that it was made in the digital film age, so the special and visual effects are better than those achieved 30-40 years ago.  Of course, the aging, scratching, and even film melting effects are put in it intentially which actually disguises it to the point of it being such a bad movie thus making it somewhat of an instant classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another great DVD package for a Pixar classic"></head><body><p>I was sitting there watching &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; on DVD, the first time I had seen the film, and kept thinking it was a very good but not a great animated film.  Then we got to the ending and suddenly I find myself crying.  I get weepy over lots of movies, but rarely animated films (&quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; begin the exceptions that prove the rule).  I think this especially surprised me because I did not think that &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was going to be that kind of a film.<p>The story is about Monsters, Inc., a corporation in the Monster world that sends scarers into the bedroom of human children all around the world to capture their screams, which are used to provide energy.  James P. &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan is the best of the best, and Mike is his assistant.  They are going for the all time record when something really, really bad happens: Sully accidentally brings back a little girl from the human world.  At this point, wackiness ensues.<p>The promotion for this film really made it seem like it the main character was Mike Wazowski, the frenetic one-eyed green dude voiced by Billy Crystal.  But this film is really about James P. Sullivan, the hairy blue giant with John Goodman's voice.  I was sort of disappointed that Crystal was not really stealing each and every scene, sort of like Eddie Murphy did in &quot;Shrek.&quot;  But this film is clearly Goodman's show (how did they ever avoid giving this man an Emmy for his flawless work on &quot;Roseanne&quot;?), and he shows you what he can do with just his voice.  <p>Any doubts I had about the rating to give this DVD were quickly settled by the second disk.  You can read the list above of all the goodies you will find there, but the chief joys are (1) the hilarious &quot;outtakes&quot; Pixar always managed to come up with for their films; (2) the Original Treatment, which tells the earliest storyline about Johnson, the monster who dreams of being a star scarer; (3) an all-new animated short film, &quot;Mike's New Car; (4) &quot;For the Birds,&quot; the 2001 Oscar winner for Best Animated Short Film; and (5) a behind the scenes look at Crystal and Goodman recording &quot;If I Didn't Have You.&quot;  I think you will find that with numbers (1), (3) and (4) you might laugh more than you do while watching the actual movie, especially on (3) and (4).  My stomach hurt I was laughing so hard. <p>So, that's the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; DVD in a nutshell.  You cry, you laugh.  What more do you need to know?</p></body></html>

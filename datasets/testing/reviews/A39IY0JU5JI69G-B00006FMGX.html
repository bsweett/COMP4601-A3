Well, it is a crime thing and Tom Hanks is the cop (FBI) and Leo DiCaprio is the robber.  But it's anything but grim!  Speilberg chose to tell this story, which could have been tragic. in a completely light hearted way.  The only terrible scene is in the beginning when DiCaprio is languishing in a French prison.  From there on, it's all up.  The colors are bright, the atmosphere is light.  And yet there's a lot of depth to it, as well.  It talkes  a really good director to pull it off so well.<br /><br />First of all, the story is amazing!  We all know it's true; no one would make something like that up!  Then, the cast is all-star!  DiCaprio shines as a complex, tortured kid who is, at the same time, having the time of his life!  The relationships are touching and so well handled.  Christopher Walken is superb as the dad.  Tom Hanks plays the 'alternate" father---as serious and humorless as the first one was charming and irresponsible.  Hanks, DiCaprio and Walken, directed by Speilberg, in this terrific story---how can you miss?<br /><br />The DVD I saw had a bonus disk with great extras---including lots of footage of the original Frank Abegnale.  After seeing the movie, I really wanted to see the real deal and he is obviously quite the guy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cute movie"></head><body><p>I watched this movie with really no expectations, but I did laugh a lot. Will Ferrell is super funny as Ron Burgandy, a hip, kinda (sexist) clueless, immature local newsguy, and Christina Applegate really brings Veronica Corningstone to life, she knows what she wants and is tired of being belittled and given fluff assignments in the age of women's lib. Trouble is, she falls in love with Ron and their rivalry on-air ends up costing him his job. There are lots of funny moments, a lot at the expense of dimwitted weather guy Brick (Steve Carell from the Daily Show) and the big street throwdown with the different newcasters from the area (including Vince Vaughn as Ron Burgandy's rival, Ben Stiller as the Latin newsguy and Tim Robbins representin' PBS).</p></body></html>

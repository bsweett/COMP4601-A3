<meta name="summary" content="Longer But Time Flies"></head><body><p>This movie is a little longer, but the time flies. If you liked both &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;The Abyss&quot;, you will probably like this movie. Enough character building to make it interesting, but the beat-the-clock action is what is gripping. The performances are excellent and realistic (being a &quot;geek&quot; that has worked with this type equipment and scenarios). Suitable for all audiences, it is a pleasure to view.</p></body></html>

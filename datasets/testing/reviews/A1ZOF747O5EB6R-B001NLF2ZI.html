<meta name="summary" content="The Interpreter - Surprising"></head><body><p>I was unexpectedly surprised by "The Interpreter".  I had been led to believe that this film was a bit of a pot boiler that should have gone straight to DVD.  In fact, I only saw it by accident when the DVD was left with me.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays an African interpreter from the Republic of Matobo who overhears a threat to the life Matobo's dictator.  She is assigned protection from Sean Penn who plays a federal agent.  The plot is ultimately foiled although not without some close shaves along the way.  Both actors a totally plausible, especially Kidman, who seems relaxed "in the skin" of a young bookish woman with a background in languages.<br /><br />Much of the film is shot on location both in New York and actually within the United Nations building in Manhattan.  I understand that this is the only time that the U.N. has actually given permission for such filming.  Even Hitchcock's opening scenes for "North by Northwest" were shot in a studio.  The U.N. location certainly gives the film some added cred.<br /><br />See this film.  It is a real surprise.  Director Sydney Pollack has done his job well.</p></body></html>

Trevor built a quarantined world around him and the last remaining humans but something wasn't right with this world and there are a team of rebels sworn to finding out what isn't right with this world and fixing it.<br /><br />Enter Aeon Flux the most deadly radical of them all with her high tech gadgets, deadly kicks and sharpshooting she is the perfect assassin.<br /><br />That is all i am telling you about the movie itself but let me tell you about the even better high points. Stunning & flawless special effects, constant action that gets you excited and Charlize Theron looking stunning as usual.<br /><br />This is a great movie and regardless of what other people say i would strongly recommend it.</p></body></html>

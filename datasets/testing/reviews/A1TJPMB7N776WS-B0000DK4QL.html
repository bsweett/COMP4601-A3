In many surface ways it is like the Tim Burton "Batman": with even the daylight scenes taking on a muted, smoky, fuzzy ambience probably as a way of showing how our blind hero views the external world.<br />Daredevil is like no other Super-Hero of recent memory though, for his human traits out number his extraordinary ones: he is first and foremost a feeling human being searching for a way to avenge the death of his father and doing it in the only way he knows how...by killing off all those who have done his father wrong.<br />Ben Affleck plays the Daredevil as a vulnerable man prone to all the usual human foibles even though possessing super-human traits: hearing, smelling and interpreting voice and motivation. Affleck is a conflicted hero, prone to seek the guidance of his priest and feeling flummoxed and unsure by all that he does.<br />Jennifer Garner plays Electra, Daredevil's love and ultimately his nemesis with a physicality and sexual allure only hinted at by her TV series, "Alias."<br />Garner and Affleck are like Superman in that they are above reproach in their behavior in the world that they inhabit. It is up to Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to throw a wrench in the proceedings with his over-the-top prerformance.He kills as sport and stands for everything that Daredevil and Electra do not: rampant humanity gone berserk. Farrell is disgustingly assertive, aggressive and repulsive: a great, physical performance.<br />"Daredevil" is a success because it takes itself very seriously and does so without the least amount of adherence to any known code of ethics. It creates an extraordinary world and inhabits it with characters that have the ring of truth and substantial humanity that strike us as reality, though perhaps jaded, in our world as it stands today in this year, 2003.</p></body></html>

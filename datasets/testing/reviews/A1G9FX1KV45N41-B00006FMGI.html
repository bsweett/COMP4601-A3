<meta name="summary" content="Lots of thrills"></head><body><p>Ok, the lines are cheesy, no one can deny that, and the romantic picks up lines used by Bond are actually quite nauseating!<p>Though there are more witty plays on words like the name of the island where Cuban doctors' harvest stolen human organs-Isla Los Organos.<p>Having said that there is plenty of fun and thrilling action. The North Koreans and Red Chinese make such perfect villains (because they are in reality total villains (even if it is no longer politically correct in the sad post-cold war era to recognize that reality).<br />Pierce Brosnan plays the role of James bond with great panache.<br />I thought Haile Berry was incredibly sexy and thrilling in her role as American agent, Jinx you would think butter wouldn't melt in her mouth), as was the gorgeous fencer Rosamund Pike as the treacherous Miranda Frost.<br />John Cleese and Judy Dench are great as M and Q respectively.<p>Then of course there are all the gadgets and the exotic locales like the Ice Palace in Iceland.<p>A lot of Bond filled fun. I enjoyed it , especially seeing those North Korean Stalinists get chopped up.<br />That's why the movie was banned in that prison camp state-which makes it worthwhile seeing for that reason alone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Worst hyped film ever"></head><body><p>Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot?  This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer.  I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so.  I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.<br /><br />I didn't understand, or care, why any of the characters were acting the way they did; or what was going to happen to them. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something.</p></body></html>

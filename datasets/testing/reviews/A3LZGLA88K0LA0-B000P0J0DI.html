Avoiding a lot of the standard western cliches, Eastwood has fashioned a dark character study in which one's past resurfaces and no matter how hard you try to justify it, the truth wins out, and once you've killed, it's not so hard to do it again.  Clint has assembled a fine supporting cast as well:  Morgan Freeman (who would later work with Clint and win an Oscar in "Million Dollar Baby") is fine as Ned, Clint's former partner who joins him for one "last" job; Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sheriff Little Bill, whose moral code is singular and unquestioned; Frances Fisher (a former Mrs. Eastwood) as the rebellious prostitute who wants to mete her own kind of justice; Jaime Woolvetz as the young gunfighter who idolizes Clint and killing; Saul Rubinek as a writer who finds out the truth isn't always what it is said to be; and Richard Harris as British Bob, an English assassin with tales taller than the Sequoias.  Although I found the film to drag in places, it's finale is riveting and Clint is reminiscent of Dirty Harry Callahan in his showdown with Hackman.<br /><br />UNFORGIVEN resurrected a pretty dead genre with this 1992 film, and its four Oscars helped plant Eastwood in the hall of great film makers.</p></body></html>

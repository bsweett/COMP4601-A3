<meta name="summary" content="4 1/2 stars for Ridley Scott's jump start of the "Alien" franchise. Updated for Blu Ray"></head><body><p>If asked what my favorite "type" of movie is, I'm apt to respond science fiction.  Yet the genre is a relatively small percentage of my film collection.  The fact is that they are rarely done well.  Having said that, a few rank high on my favorites list.  Two were directed by Ridley Scott ("Alien" and "Blade Runner").  Scott's "Prometheus" will join that list.  It is no secret at this point, but this film is a prequel of sorts to "Alien."  Not that there is a direct linkage, but as Scott says there's common DNA.  Indeed human DNA is a source for this story.<br /><br />Numerous discovered cave art from across Earth have been analyzed to suggest a common cluster of stars and perhaps the origin of human life.  Two prominent scientists, who happened to also be romantically attached, are hired by Wayland Corp. (also from "Alien") to travel to a distant moon to investigate the possibility.  Wayland's representative on the trip is a stone-faced Meredith Vickers played by Charlize Theron, reenacting a similar sinister character from the recent "Snow White and the Huntsman."  As in all the "Alien" films the corporate representatives are never there to help.<br /><br />Other key characters include scientist Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) a true evolutionist and God-fearing girlfriend scientist, Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace ("The Girl Who Played With Fire") in another memorable performance.  The other performance to watch is the amazing Michael Fassbender ("Haywire") as the android called David.  In an early scene check out how David acquires his "personality."  He emulates blond Peter O'Toole from his favorite movie, "Lawrence of Arabia."<br /><br />Ridley Scott's return to the franchise allows him to follow-up on the neglected sequence when the "Space Jockey" is found in the original film.  Who was he?  What was he after?  How did he die?  Where did he come from?  Some questions are answered.  Some will have to wait for a probable sequel and before we get the direct connection to "Alien."  Scott, who always seems to direct films with strong female leads, makes no exception here.  Rapace's Dr. Shaw is no shrinking violet and takes the most courageous actions of the ship's crew, aided by Captain Janek (Idris Elba).  She even undergoes a self-directed but machine automated surgical procedure which will get you squirming in your seat.<br /><br />There are some ever engulfing scenes of the ship (Prometheus), the vastness of space and the confines of caves that are in a word, magnificent.  I saw this movie in 3-D and it looks great.  There are few, if any, in-your-face effects but the overall quality of the camera work is excellent.  The 3-D adds depth to many of the shots and doesn't darken the picture.  Ultimately, the film doesn't answer all the questions, but gives us enough to conjure plenty of ideas.  More please.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (10-11-12):  I wasn't surprised to find this Blu ray transfer to be near perfect.  Since I don't have 3-D at home yet I opted for the Blu ray/DVD/Digital copy version.  The video is in 1080p as you would expect and has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio nearly identical to the original theatrical release.  Lighting is a major factor in the film.  It is dark (takes place in space) so director Scott and his crew had to manage cameras and lighting to get the proper intensity.  The transfer looks beautiful. Stunning.  Gorgeous. Spectacular.  Detail is excellent.<br /><br />The audio is likewise perfect.  The prime track to sample is the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.  If you have a properly set up rig, this soundtrack will knock your socks off.  The subs and woofers will get a workout, but none of the small sounds are missed either.  The great orchestral score washes over the entire picture.  Optional audio includes Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks with Enlish descriptive, Spanish, and French.<br /><br />There are plenty of interesting special features as well.  Audio commentaries are provided by director/producer Ridley Scott and another by writer John Spaihts and writer/executive producer Damon Lindelof.  There are 14 deleted/extended/alternate scenes that total about 37 minutes.  Finally there is a segment called "The Peter Weyland Files." This consists of some video files reflecting some insider info on the fictious Weyland Corp.  Great movie and Blu ray package.</p></body></html>

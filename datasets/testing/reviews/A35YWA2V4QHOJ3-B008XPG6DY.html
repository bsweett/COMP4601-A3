It's obvious that she's trying to break away from being stereocast as an actress for comedies.  Looks like she's got her wish!  This is a remarkably different role for her, and she pulls it off nicely.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is how two people meet up on a train heading to work.  Both are married but end up fooling around anyway.  It turns out to be the biggest mistake they'll ever make, and not JUST because their spouses might find out.<br /><br />What ensues is a chaotic nightmare that seems to just get worse & worse. Things are not all as they seem, and the story scores very high on the guage of sadistic intent.  The story makes you feel like you're sinking in quicksand.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of erotic thrillers, this one is certainly worth a look.  I'll bet you'll pay your own fare from now on!!</p></body></html>

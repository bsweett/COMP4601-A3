<meta name="summary" content="A Good Action Film"></head><body><p>When I first saw the trailers for Van Helsing I was not very impressed with what I saw; it seemed overloaded with action and had no story.  Out of curiosity, I saw the film and enjoyed it.  I think that this is a film that one better appreciates after viewed more than once.<br /><br />The film is a hi-tech version of the old Universal movies from the 1940's that featured Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman; such films as The House of Dracula and The House of Frankenstein.  Much of the criticism of the film that I have read ignores that it is a parody of horror films, and meant to be fun.<br /><br />Van Helsing has the loudest soundtrack that I have yet hear with a lot of loud drum pounding.  The story is flimsy: monster killed who has no memory set out to kill Dracula in Transylvania.  But this is not a movie that was put out so we could measure it for credibility: it is two hours of entertainment: it is a movie that does not pretend to be anything but entertainment.  It is not meant to be a classic horror tale nor a comic book.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is perfect as Van Helsing.  I don't think that another actor could create the same presence. Kate Beckinsale is good as Anna Valerious even if her accent sometimes seems forced.  It was interesting to see David Wenham as Carl after his role as Fairimir.  He brings off the part nicely, even if it takes a little to get used to seeing him as a frisky friar.  An equally interesting part is Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster, who makes the creature into a credible and sympathetic personality despite the heavy makeup.  As for Richard Roxburgh as Dracula, it took a little while before I could see him in the role.  He may not be as obviously sinister as some vampires but he has a menace that fills the role when required.  The Brides are well cast and the special effects when they are flying are probably the most spectacular of the film.  Kevin O'Conner, who as Benny in The Mummy, is equally good as Igor.  His half-weary delivery of the line "Yes, Master" is a comic part of the movie.  And Samuel West, in the small role of  Dr. Victor Frankenstein, does a good imitation of Colin Clive saying "It's alive! It's alive!"<br /><br />So, I can recommend Van Helsing for the unashamed piece of entertainment that it is.  Why analyze such a movie? The story of bringing to life unborn vampire offspring is patently fatuous.  What rules does a movie have to follow just to entertain you?  If you are fast forwarding or are moaning that your favorite monsters are being "misinterpreted" you have missed the point.  This is a movie to sit back and watch for the ride not fault it for something it was never intended to be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Top notch in every way"></head><body><p>I'm not a Nicole Kidman fan, but she is stellar in The Hours, in which she plays Virginia Woolf during the 20s as she begins to write Mrs. Dalloway, her first great novel. Then there's Julianne Moore playing Laura Brown, a repressed, depressed, and frustrated suburban mom during the 40s (and her very frightened, preternaturally `aware' young son) who begins reading Mrs. Dalloway and starts to question her own life and its goals - and wonders if it's really worth going on. And then, in modern-day NYC, there's Clarissa (named for the title role in Mrs. Dalloway and played by the incomparable Meryl Streep) acting out the book itself as she buys flowers and plans a celebratory party for her friend and former lover, played by Richard Harris, who is dying of AIDs.<br />It's a convoluted movie, and while we can easily make the connection between Virginia Woolf's life and Clarissa's NY life, Laura Brown's place in this trio is unclear until the very end, when everything ties together so beautifully that it leaves you breathless.<br />See it now. Then read the book, and of course, if you haven't already done so for some college lit course, read Mrs. Dalloway.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the 1951 version."></head><body><p>I'm sure, special effects-wise, this modern DVD version will look spectacular.<br />However, if it's a good story with a point you want, this is Not the one to watch.<br /><br />I saw this 2008 version on television and was very disappointed.<br /><br />On later reflections, I thought it could have been better in ways not yet mentioned here, such as: if it were Helen's touch to the sphere that is Earth's savior, because, as is usually the case in real life, it's the Women who have to stop the violence and who must clean up afterward.<br /><br />Also there are inconsistancies here that are baffling, notably the speed of Humanity's destruction by the sweeping swarm - in the blink of an eye; yet when the boy Jacob becomes 'infected', the scene takes long enough for Klaatu to save him.<br />This 2008 version wraps up and ends too quickly too, without resolving anything.<br /><br />I like Keanu Reeves, but here he is so stone-faced as to evoke little in response to him. In contrast, Michael Rennie [1951 version] was much more effective.<br />The same goes for the young boy, much better done by the boy in the 1951 version.<br /><br />> get the 1951 Version instead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful fantastical story with a hefty  dose of realism"></head><body><p>Since I am 1/2 German, this reminded me of the fairy tales by Grimm, with which I grew up. Although there are many sweet and innocent parts in this film, overall, it appears cruel, sad and jarring, which is different than most fantasy type films. The power of the child's imagination is juxtaposed very effectively against her ultimate defeat in the end, but the metaphor of her death and the rejoining of her parents resonates with many fantasies we have with the afterlife experiences in many culture. This film does an excellent job of blending several genres together. Visually the film is startlingly beautiful, the PQ is absolutely amazing on the HD DVD. The characters are believable and invoked a significant amount of emotion, a fantastic accommplishment, and in the often time "cookie cutter" hollywood arena. Great film, highly recommended and a "different" kind of intense film experience.</p></body></html>

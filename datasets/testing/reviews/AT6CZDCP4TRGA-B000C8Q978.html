<meta name="summary" content="beautiful, haunting, classic Jarmusch"></head><body><p>Like all of Jim Jarmusch's movies, "Broken Flowers" is above all a journey: sometimes quick, sometimes slow, sometimes interesting, sometimes fascinating, but always random, unpredictable, and deliciously impenetrable.<br /><br />Really strong cast all around, from Jeffrey Wright (who supplies some awesome Ethiopian pop music) to Sharon Stone (in a non-bimbo role for a change) and Jessica Lange.  As with most Jarmsuch movies the soundtrack is excellent.<br /><br />I won't bore you with a plot synopsis, because many others here have done so already, and also because this movie is really not about plot at all.  It's more about the absence of plot which is really the plot of all our lives...IF we are awake and aware and open enough to realize it.  Yes, there is a strong Zen flavor to this film.<br /><br />Unlike your typical linear 3-act, conflict-and-resolution movie (not to mention the moronic Hollywood mass movies Murray used to star in), "Broken Flowers" is a film you can come back to and watch over and over again and still find something new in it every time.</p></body></html>

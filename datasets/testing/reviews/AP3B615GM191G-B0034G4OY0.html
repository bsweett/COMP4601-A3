<meta name="summary" content="Too Slow; Too Understated"></head><body><p>By no means is Clint Eastwood a flashy director.  As evidenced by films like "Gran Torino" & "Million Dollar Baby", Eastwood prefers gritty, emotional human drama over contrived drama any day of week. However, with "Hereafter", Eastwood fails to instill even the most basic amount of drama to make us care about the storyline and main characters in any meaningful way.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Hereafter" splits its focus on three different, seemingly unrelated events involving a retired psychic (Matt Damon), a French journalist puzzling over a near-death experience (Cecile de France), and a young child desperate to speak to the "great beyond" (Frankie McLaren).  Of course, those events turn out to be not quite as unrelated as they seem.<br /><br />While not a glaringly bad film by any means (Eastwood would never quite sink that low), this film fails to impress for two reasons:<br /><br />First, it doesn't develop the characters enough to make the audience truly care about them in the film's climax.  Yes, we know things about their recent past and why they act like they do, but it just never feels as if the characters in this film are anything more than pawns in a bigger scheme.  As such, it is tough to really "get into it" in the end.<br /><br />Also, when the film does discuss issues of the afterlife, it is far too brief and flirting to ever truly be meaningful.  I am a bit disappointed by Eastwood in this regard, as he usually attacks such high-profile issues instead of shrinking from them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, then, "Hereafter" fails to captivate on any high level.  It's nowhere in the league of "Baby" or "Torino", and doesn't even live up to its predecessor "Invictus".</p></body></html>

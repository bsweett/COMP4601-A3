<meta name="summary" content="An ideal example of the timeless classic!"></head><body><p>Having made quite an impact on audiences from the time of its theatrical release to the present day, Steven Speilberg's &quot;E.T. The Extra Terrestrial&quot; is one of the great movies of all time, a classic that lives up to the hype and popularity it has attained over the last two decades. Here is a movie that has proved itself as a true success, a standout film that still has not lost its ability to dazzle the young and old with its touching story and likeable characters. <p>I remember years ago to my childhood, when Thanksgiving was just not Thanksgiving without watching the movie play on television each year, to be replaced later with modern, though less enjoyable, holiday films. As a child, the movie filled me with a sense of awe and wonderment, tickling my funny bone while at the same time evoking dread and suspense as it draws near to its spectacular and unforgettable conclusion. Watching the movie today allows me to look back at this experience and realize that the movie still carries the same emotional strings for me. <p>The story of a young boy named Elliot who befriends a space alien left behind on Earth embodies great spirit, carrying with it the lessons of friendship, devotion, and love. Elliot, who names his new friend E.T., begins teaching the arrival the ways of humankind, sharing the secret with his siblings, who are equally entranced by the terrestrial. <p>These are some of the warmest moments in movie history, burning themselves into our hearts forever. The child in all of us easily finds a soft spot for the short-statured creature, who waddles along in a manner that steals the heart. One cannot help but instantly fall in love with E.T., whose thirst for knowledge is evident in his wide, endearing eyes. His innocence, and the warm nature of his friendship with Elliot, make the movie's final act a tour de force of emotion, from suspense of tears, sadness to joy. We will always remember the bicycle ride, a stunning display of special effects that actually have heart and soul to them, and an ending that is warm and meaningful.<p>Just as the creature earns a place in history, so do the human characters, acted under some very effective performances. Henry Thomas possesses terrific talent, and his performance as Elliot remains emotionally sweeping even by today's standards. Dee Wallace Stone is great as Elliot's mother, while Robert MacNaughton and a young Drew Barrymore are wonderful as his siblings. <p>&quot;E.T.&quot; has earned itself a place in movie history, and deserves its praise and more. The film is a composition of sheer brilliance, a feast for the eyes and the heart that is captivating and enthralling. Watching it as a child proves to be the best experience, though those who watch it later in years may be tempted to recall their first experience with the film, which has an endearing nature that outshines most other films.</p></body></html>

The letter box screen opens your eyes, a normal format seems like a blinder, blocking your peripheral. It sucks for those who own small televisions, but even still, buy this version. You never know when you'll upgrade (you poor, sweet things.) This film came as a surprise to me. Although It shouldn't be. Raimi is a proven director, at least to me. The casting is appropriate, Thanks goodness all of them signed on again. Toby is known to have trouble opening up on the screen. He's naturally quiet I hear. But I don't agree. In cider house rules you see a disturbed querry in his performance. In Spidey 1, he grew in physical bearing, and he pulled off a convincing teenager. I mean, you won't hear him being nominated for an Oscar any time soon, but who does with these sort of movies. Best actor's always are won by the less popular roles, Like that of the disabled. The second installment says hello to a hero that is bothered by stress. And even Super Hero's crack under stress! His hidden passions dibilitate his web slingings. If only he would just open up more, Peter that is. A great action flick with a dramatic zest. Personally, I was expecting the Hob goblin for this movie. Will you see him next movie?-jeff</p></body></html>

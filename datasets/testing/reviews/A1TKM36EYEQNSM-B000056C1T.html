<meta name="summary" content="I give it Two Thumbs Off"></head><body><p>This is a movie to watch especially around the 4th of July.  Gibson does an admirable job of being a father beset by the loss of his son and having to decide between loyalty to a country he fought for and the land he lives in.<p>There is some gore in the movie.  However, like braveheart, you may get a sense of reality and being in a battle that is around you.<p>This is a movie where a father cares for his family, alone, yet he has an extended family and his fellow countrymen and women who he can rely on.  <p>You get feeling in the movie that it is okay to fight oppression and greed and there is a time to make a stand for what is a good and proper cause.  <p>One interesting thing about this movie, not many movies have been made about the Revolutionary war and never have I seen one from the perspective of the South.  Most of our history has been oriented toward Washington, the Delaware and Philadelphia.  <p>This movie give a view that the war was much larger in scope and had a myriad of events and situations, battles, outcomes and even murder.  This is a movie of the triumph of the human will to be free.</p></body></html>

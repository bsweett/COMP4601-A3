I can't blame her - she must be as tireless as the Energizer Bunny.<br /><br />That out of the way....<br /><br />The Forgotton, on its face, starts out feeling like one of those outrageously scary/creepy/bizarre Japanese horror films. When it ends, you feel cheated. You realize it's nothing more than an expanded episode of The X Files.<br /><br />Moore's got a kid, she knows it. Then she doesn't. No one else remembers her having a kid - but she can. Something's up. What's going on? Ed: Now that IS scary! Imagine feeling like you're going nuts and knowing that you're not. Knowing you have a child but the child is no where to be seen and no one remembers you ever having a child. Jeez - that's creepy stuff.<br /><br />This is a bit of a chase movie...it's got a little bit of X Files, a little "They Live!" and far too much of a television feeling for my sensibilities.<br /><br />I won't give the lame conclusion away. However, suffice it to say that you'll be able to figure it out about 15 minutes in and you'll keep telling yourself, "Surely, they won't do something that lame, that stupid, that much of a cop out."<br /><br />Oh, but they do. They did. And I wanted my money back.<br /><br />Forget the Forgotten!</p></body></html>

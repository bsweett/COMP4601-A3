<meta name="summary" content="Wild Hogs"></head><body><p>Think of City Slickers crossed with Easy Rider with a dash of Middle Aged Crazy and you have WILD HOGS<br /><br />The combined  talents of John Travolta, William H Macy, Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen mesh so well in this film, you have a four-tier house of true acting muscle. In many films, with this type of A star talent, it  is usually a toss up between a losing piece of cinema or a slam dunk . . . in this one, it is a master grand slam dunk. All these actors are on their A games in this comedy and it shows.<br /><br />The motorcycled  middle life crisis has been done before on film (look for the drama Prey for The Wildcats). However, in this film, the plot seems semi fresh ground and seems to work well. The script seems to sag in the middle, but regains itself at the end when it is needed to bring to the climax to good close.<br /><br />This is a  cute film like City Slickers, but there is no calf named Norman<br />for heartwarming cuteness<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

First of all, the premise seems smart but by the end of the film I am confused by all the chracters never shown in the climax. Connelly is a wonderful actress and she is perfect for the part but I wish her character had more to do rather just puttering around the apartment all day. This film is not terrrible, it's just so-so. Decide for yourself on this one.</p></body></html>

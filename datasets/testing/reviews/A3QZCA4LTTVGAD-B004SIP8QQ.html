Uma Thurman returns as the survivor of a bloody massacre.  She continues her rampage of revenge and hones in on the target named in the film's title.  The story shifts back and forth in time as we learn more about our heroine's life before the massacre.<p>Once again director Quentin Tarantino delivers an exciting, action-packed and stylish cinematic triumph.  KB2 is a richly textured film in which every element--music, cinematography, costumes, etc.--unites to create a total cinematic experience.  <p>The film's superb cast delivers some real powerhouse performances.  Darryl Hannah brings an icy fury to her role as a vicious one-eyed assassin.  Michael Madsen invests his character with a world-weary, working class quality that nicely complements some of the other outrageous characters.  As the title character, David Carradine has both gravitas and a cool, serpentine grace--he's simply mesmerizing.  But make no mistake: it's Uma Thurman whose performance gives &quot;Bill&quot; it's biggest bang.  It's a powerful, multifaceted portrayal that's full of muscle, sweat, and emotional force.<p>The intelligent, clever script makes intriguing references to superhero mythology.  Tarantino and company strike an effective balance among humor, human drama, and mythic sense. And the action scenes deliver; one outrageous swordfight stands out in particular.  Overall KB2 is a fitting companion piece to KB1.  Together they tell a stunning, multicultural epic saga that is rich in larger-than-life characters and unforgettable images.  KB2 is a gem of virtuoso filmmaking with surprising emotional power.</p></body></html>

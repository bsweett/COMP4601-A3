But on the other hand, really, sometimes you still gotta try as a humanitarian and human being to try and convince innocent people. If you want to miss that hurting feeling I get (like a fastball in the dirt that ricochets up into the nards) you get from a lasceratingly bad ending, please hear it here or from anyone else with sense enough to write about it. It is so shoddy that you get vomity with it. I want to say that down to its purest form cinema is the feeling you take with you and that usually, USUALLY, lies in the impact of the climax or that area near the end. Sometimes upset people want to put there own two cents into the ending, or, more tactfully, some seasame street like message of the day at the end that makes adults feel like go-retards. I'm like eighty percent of our country in that I'm A) not suffering from infatilism, and B)well,...I'm not a kid anymore. So please dont sugar coat, don't rape the action scenes and charaterization that sent us through rings of JOY before! Notice, and I know you have, how I gave this film THREE stars. This isn't an exact science, but something in me, maybe that part of the brain that belongs way back to the caveman days when we NEEDED to be excited with things like 'fire' and 'cool shaped rocks' cause there wasn't t.v., well something in me from that part remembered the 'excitement' of the kingdom earlier in it. I don't enjoying axing a film apart, but I'm being forced into it this time by basically wasting something like an hour and some heavy change.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nicholson's Been Better"></head><body><p>This is not a criticism of Jack Nicholson's work here as a writer with OCD,however, for him it is an average performance.  He has been better, most recently in "About Schmidt".  Jack has spoiled us throughout his career with performances of such high calibre that anything less, at least for me, is a disappointment.  I also bring this up because Nicholson won the Oscar for this role when he didn't bring home the gold for better work, but that's the nature of the beast.  Helen Hunt, on the other hand, gave the best screen performance of her career as the struggling waitress who relunctantly allows herself to fall in love with Nicholson's headcase.  I remember when this film came out that I found it implausible that Hunt could fall for Nicholson's character.  The women I related this to who had seen the film were emphatic that she could, that woman are not as superficial as men in that regard.  Such is my knowledge of the opposite sex.  It should also be noted that good work is delivered by Greg Kinnear as a gay artist, a change of pace for him from the usual cads he plays as well as Cuba Gooding Jr. as an art dealer.  This is a very good film but in retrospect I'm not sure it is worthy of the best picture nomination it snagged in 1997.  On the flip side, it is light years better than the bloated overrated vehicle named "Titanic" that did win that year.</p></body></html>

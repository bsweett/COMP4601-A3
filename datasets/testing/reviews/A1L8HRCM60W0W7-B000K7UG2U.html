But I may be one of the few who like the pacing, the look and feel, and the general acting of this new one better. It's just easier to watch on the DVD and the theme is easier for me to relate to. Sure, the script could have packed more punch and pastiche (certainly our present world lends very well to notions of impeding danger, both on a national and corporate scale) but as it were, taken on its own merit, this is still a very taut thriller. Certainly a decent rental, at least, as just about anything with Meryl Streep usually is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DEFINATELY One To See Before Someone Gives The Ending Away"></head><body><p>I saw "Hide And Seek" knowing very little beyond the basic premise (a little girl, played by Dakota Fanning, loses her mother, after which her father - played by Robert DeNiro - moves them to a quiet country town to try and heal; whereupon the little girl begins having conversations with an imaginary friend.)  I didn't even know Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue were in it, two performers whose movies I seek out.  I knew DeNiro was in it (a drawing point) and I knew Fanning was here (this is the first movie I've seen her in and what a performance!) but that's it.<br /><br />  I was quickly very thankful I knew so little going in, because "Hide And Seek" moves and grows in original and very unexpected ways, not even letting you know where it plans to settle along the horror/mystery/drama/supernatural thriller arc; keeping all its possibilities wide open.  Despite appearances of elements from classic horror movies like "The Amityville Horror" in the first few minutes, it ends up not forging through familiar territory at all, but breaking through innovative ground with shocks and imagination. The whole thing is bolstered by great production and uniformly excellent performances.  DeNiro of course is outstanding (I don't think this guy could turn in a weak or even an average performance if his life dependeded on it)and Shue and Jansen are likewise great, but it's Fanning who arguably gives the best performance.  Anytime you can say that about any actress or actor co-starring with DeNiro that's bloody high praise indeed.<br /><br />  A smart, scary, multi-faceted movie; watch with something like "Dead Again", "The Eye", "When A Stranger Calls Back", "Identity" or "In The Mouth Of Madness" for a night of real suspense, surprises and shocks.</p></body></html>

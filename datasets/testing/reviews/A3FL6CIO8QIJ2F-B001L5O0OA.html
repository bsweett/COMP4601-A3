Not a critical hit either upon its release, the movie has now become the most touching and heartfelt Christmas motion picture of all-time thanks to numerous showings on cable stations such as TBS, TNT, and pay channels like HBO. At one time the movie was so popular the film was actually shown in a continuous 24 hour marathon. Given a modest budget, "A Christmas Story" tells the simple story of a young boy named Ralphie who wants only one thing for Christmas: a bee bee gun. The film is set around the 1930's or 1940's and features an excellent cast of adult actors, but it's the young child stars that steals the film, most notably Peter Billingsley who plays Ralphie. What person wouldn't love Ralphie, what with his cute smile and big round glasses. The DVD has many bonus features, but it is the informative commentary that features Billingsley and director Bob Clark that is the crowning jewel. They both offer insight into the making of the film. One neat tidbit from the commentary is when Clark states that Jack Nicholson was his original choice to play the dad. Upon viewing this treasure "A Christmas Story" will become a part of your Holiday viewing pleasure for years to come.</p></body></html>

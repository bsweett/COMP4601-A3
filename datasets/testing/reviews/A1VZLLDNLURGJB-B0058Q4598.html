This film had little in common with the original movie except for the names of a few key characters and the general premise of the story.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the way that premise was revealed in this new film, the ending of the original was far more moving.  I was hoping I would be able to say that I enjoyed this movie almost as much as the original and was only unhappy with the special effects.  However, the remake had disappointing special effects and a very disappointing ending.  Remakes of films are often disappointing, even for those fans among us who are rooting for them.<br /><br />I still enjoy Keanu Reeves and feel the script was at fault with this poor remake. By the way, the special effects reminded me of those used in the remake of the mummy just looking for a new home. I did not especially like the very human form that GORT took in the remake and was amazed at how much more effective an oversized foam rubber costume looked in the original than modern CGI in the remake. The very pretty CGI looked like art work or anime and not believable or anything to be afraid of. I did like the idea of the nanobots used to "end the world".</p></body></html>

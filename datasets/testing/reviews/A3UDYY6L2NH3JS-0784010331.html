It plays on reality and virtuality, on recollection and fantasy, on what is true and what is maybe true or untrue. That game is at times surprising because there is no solution to a real illusion or a false reality.<br /><br />Mars is a paradise for mining corporations that have total and free hands to do ,what they want, which means exploit those who work, do not control environmental conditions so that more and more mutants appear that are trapped in some zones where they can survive if they manage to bring in some income through gambling or prostitution. The new slaves of this future world, free slaves that can die by a simple decision of the boss of the planet, the boss of the main mining corporation: just cut their air and they die.<br /><br />Beyond that it would be spoilers and spoilers, but what is interesting is that the danger this world is obliged to face is the greed for money of course but also for power of those who are supposed to manage the planet. The danger is not outside once again but inside, inside the system that uses free enterprise to be competitive, to the point we may wonder if these films are not speaking for public control of these natural resources.<br /><br />And yet they are not because public control of natural resources remove any possible choice and competition and then corruption is dominant. We can note that this film does not show any political personnel and we can wonder if that is not a picture of sovietism, the good old but dead thanks God sovietism where the political personnel had full control of the economy of the country, which destroyed the system eventually because they maybe were good authoritarian of not tyrannical politicians but they were null economists.<br /><br />The second element is that some extraterrestrials or aliens had come to the planet before terrestrial humans and had found and built the solution to produce oxygen and an atmosphere by melting the underground ice and breaking it up into gases, Oxygen and Hydrogen, but the most lucrative commerce on Mars is the sale of air, so you can imagine this alien invention and technology is banned. But once again the danger is not outside, in fact the solution and salvation are coming from these aliens.<br /><br />Once again, many people considered in the 1980s these films were Cold War films justifying the capitalist system and encouraging all kinds of segregation. And today we are able to look at these films with different eyes. Of course they are entertaining films but their ideological meaning is more mixed, ambiguous and I would say that the main fink, traitor is a mutant, black what's more though the salvation comes from a strange mutant as the main leader and many others who finally find some courage to oppose the mining establishment.<br /><br />It is this ambiguity that probably makes these films more durable than John Wayne's westerns that are all openly racist and segregative and in no way open to any criticism of the colonial system that ethnically cleansed the Indians to let a wild jungle take over that John Wayne tries to idealize and make shiny and bright, admirable in one word.<br /><br />I love gangsters but I can't help it I prefer those who get them down, especially when the gangsters are on the side of the law: corruption, you say?<br /><br />Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

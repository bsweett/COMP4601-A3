<meta name="summary" content="A Perfect Rendering of a Fascinating Book"></head><body><p>"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", a book by Stieg Larsson, that I greatly enjoyed and reviewed for Amazon, has spawned a movie version that is extremely well done and is a very faithful rendering of the book. It's in Swedish with English subtitles. If you haven't read the book, the film is a standalone, a very clear film which doesn't require a reading of the novel. It's a very intense, gripping movie that, I think, is going to grab and hold you.<br /> Magazine owner and investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, has been found guilty of libeling a big industrial magnate and is sentenced to three months in prison. He has to take a leave from his magazine, and while he's waiting to serve his sentence, he is hired by wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger to find out who in his family murdered his niece, Harriet Vanger, forty years before. Some of the Vanger family, a mean and nasty bunch, live on a private island with him.<br /> Mikael moves to the island and later joins forces in the investigation with the tattooed girl. The girl of the title, Lisbeth Salender is very strange with piercings on her face, and she wears very severe-looking tight-fitting jeans and jacket. Her make-up is stark, and she seems menacing and creepy as well as beautiful. She's a computer hacker who investigates cases for a security agency. She can get information that few others can dig up. The investigative techniques and the research procedures are handled very well in this movie. It's fascinating to watch her and Mikael delve into family secrets. Some members of the Vanger family were Nazi sympathizers.<br />The violent, torture and s and m scenes in this movie are almost unbearable to watch, so beware. This is definitely not a movie for the kiddies. Mikael gets deeply involved in the investigation and at one point, he gets shot. Serial killings, mutilations, and serious cases of abuse come up during the probing, and devastating family secrets are brought to light. Flashbacks add to the suspense.<br />The acting in the film is excellent, and the cinematography is outstanding with some sweeping views of the austere Swedish landscape.<br />The book and its two sequels have become international bestsellers, and this movie has been a considerable hit in the world market. Two movie sequels are due soon. It's fitting that the original title of this book was "Men Who Hate Women." Lisbeth is a victim who knows how to mete out vengeance.</p></body></html>

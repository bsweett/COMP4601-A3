I mean he used it in Close Encounters, etcetera etcetera.  And is anyone sick of his terrible plot.  Watching his movies are like reading Stephen King.  Lots of fluff and amazing pyrotechnics by no story, no plot.  He just be banned from movie making.  What was this movie about?  A monster is trapped on earth, and waits to the movie to be made to build a spaceship?  What?  Stupid.  Just plain stupid.  And by the way, the little vignette of a Super 8 movie of the title made by the kid main characters and shown at the end with the credits was far better than the stupid movie which preceded it.</p></body></html>

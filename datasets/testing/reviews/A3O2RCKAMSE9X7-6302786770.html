<meta name="summary" content="THE GOOD & B & U is very good indeed"></head><body><p>Before Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone began to collaborate in the mid 1960s with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, the western epic had been pretty much running true to form for more than fifty years.  The lone cowboy rides into town to chase out the outlaws and saves the populace.  These movies, usually starring John Wayne and his clones, were fixedly predictable in their portrayal of the laconic hero.  Except for Gabby Hays, humor and style were too often lacking.  In the first two of Leone's homage to the sprawling western, he tried to break out of this tried and true mold.  Eastwood star charisma allowed Leone to fashion a new prototype, but it was not until Leone added Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to the mix that he found exactly the right note of violence, humor, music, and camera angles, all of which still mesh as perfectly today as they did back in 1967.  <p>The plot has been borrowed from dozens of oaters.  A trio of gunslingers seeks to recover a hidden cache of gold with only one emerging triumphant.  What sets TGATBATU apart from its predecessors is a sense that despite the crushing reality of the harsh Civil War days, there is a leavening humor that keeps it from being squashed flat by the violence of both sight and sound that assault the senses in nearly every other scene.  Eastwood plays straight man to Wallach's Lou Costello, feeding him lines that are truly funny.  Their continuous interaction that bounces back and forth from mutual self interest to several aborted instances of near murder keep the emotional focus of the film on track. Eastwood's face is frozen into a featureless frown, while Wallach's radiates a goofy grin even as both dispatch legions of inept cowboys with gunshots that reverberate as loudly as thunder blasts.  Lee Van Cleef is the 'Bad' one of the title, and he is bad indeed.  Eastwood kills to stay alive while Wallach does so with a flair that Jack Nicholson would later emulate in THE SHINING.  But Van Cleef manages to infuse his killing with a viciousness that well suggests his rat-faced persona.  <p>During the course of the movie, all three work variously, singly, in twos, and in threes, but the thrust of their interaction leads inexorably to the triangular showdown that in its blending of sight, sound, and action, has never been equalled.  This is a long movie, as any epic should be, but it never drags.  From the opening scene where Van Cleef blasts a family apart to the closing delicate balancing act of Wallach on a grave cross, the audience is carried along and finds itself teetering with Wallach in sympathetic rhythm.  The fact that the audience can overlook the obvious Italian flavor of cast and crew is a memorial to the seamless melding that Sergio Leone has established as the pinnacle of the western epic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still A Classic"></head><body><p>This movie is just a year younger than me, but even after all of these years, this movie still holds up today. The suspence and pacing of the film is amazing and watcing it the 30th time is just as fun as watching it the first. You gotta give credit to Arnold, he is probably the best cyborg on screen ever. A lot of the praise goes to Schwarzenegger, but Micahel Biehn makes for an excellent hero as Kyle Reese. His dialogue and scenes like when he is being interrogated by the police make the movie. I have to admit that the end of the movie when we see the Terminator as his true skeletal self, it still gives me the creeps. Just him walking and almost making it through the door before they close it is really terrifying. Overall, you just can't go wrong with this movie because it will never get old.</p></body></html>

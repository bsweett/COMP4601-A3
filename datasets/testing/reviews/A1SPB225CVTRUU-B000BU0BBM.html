<meta name="summary" content="An Eye-Candy Neglected Good Characters and Story."></head><body><p>I must say that I had expected Broters Grimm to impress and entertain me as much as Sleepy Hollow, but it turned out to be a rather boring fantasy/horror/comedy movie. The set designs, costumes, and special effects deserve more credits in this film, while the story and performances were mediocre or even silly at times. What was Monica Belluci doing here with merely less than 10 minutes of screentime? I mean afterall, she's the current "It" girl in European movie industry.<br /><br />Wil(Matt Damon) and his younger brother Jacob Grimm(Heath Ledger) are so-called con artists who make a living pulling off tricks on unsuspecting witch-terrorized peasants. One day, the brothers are hired by the people of Marbaden Village to retrieve their missing girls. With no real training whatsoever, the brothers set out into the nearby forest to find the missing girls. They are assisted by Angelika(Lena Hedey) who had some knowledge and skills to protect herself from the evil-enchanted forest. Her two younger sisters were also abducted myteriously by unseen force in the woods and her father had been missing for many years as well. During the mission, the brothers and Angelika encountered strange things and gets attacked by moving trees and a powerful wolf that occasionally gets transformed into human form. To her surprise, the wolf turned out to be her father who had been rescued and controlled by the powerful Mirror Queen(Monica Belluci) who had been the leading force in the abduction of the girls in order to perform a ritual that would reverse her old age to youthful beauty again.....<br /><br />Johnathan Price gives a striking performance as a arrogant and powerful French authority. He was a bit of a comic relief with a pretty realistic accent, but his character is somewhat on the sidetrack from the main plot.  Heath Ledger had a hell of time trying to display numerous clumsy mannerism and behaviors. Matt Damon occasionally failed to maintain a perfect British accent and he never quite managed to deliver the jokes effectively. What was more annoying was the brothers had to go through very amateurish looking fight scenes that certainly required no stunt doubles. The sultry and beautiful Monica Belluci was willing to don on two looks; the fairest of them all and the oldest and ugliest of them all. Gotta love her elaborate headpiece and cleavage revealing costume! I was also disappointed by the not so climatic happy ending. No wonder this film got postponed for so long before releasing this summer.</p></body></html>

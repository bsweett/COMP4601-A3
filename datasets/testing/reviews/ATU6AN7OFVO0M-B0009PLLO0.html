The only truth in this movie was that the Persian empire Had 4/5 of the known world of that time!<br /><br />This movie Shows everywhere exept persia! Babylon was not the original part of persia. in that time it was a country that had been captured by persians, later in the time of partan and sassanid empire, till 18th century it became an original part of persia. persian empire had 3 capitals, perspolis, now near shiraz in iran, ekbatan, now near hamedan in iran and shoush, now near ahvaz in iran. babylon was only a city. not the capital of persia and was never that crowded in that time!<br /><br />there was several wars in the center of persia, some of them was very heroic that small parts of iranian patriots, stopped alexander army for 6 mounths in the central persia mountains. the main city with huge amount of treasures that alexander captured, was perspolis, near shiraz that was the main capital of persian empire, and he destroyed it. there is no sign of any persian capital in thisd film, I bet oliver stone doesn't know that the persia is iran! in a scene we see him in a battle with persians, and what a ridiculous scen! the worse battle snene i've ever seen. from there, he jumps to babylon and from there, he flies to hindokush and india, what did oliver stone done? he hase changed the history, insulted millions of persian peole, fooled milions of american and world's people, and at the end, he couldn't make too much mony of this freak he made!</p></body></html>

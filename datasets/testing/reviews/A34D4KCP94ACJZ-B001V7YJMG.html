<meta name="summary" content="An Elegant and Heartbreaking Horror Film"></head><body><p>Let the Right One In, or L?t den r&auml;tte komma in, is a film directed by Tomas Alfredson (Four Shades of Brown).  The story is based on a novel of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312355297">the same name</a> by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also penned the screenplay.  It is about an unpleasant and tender, but relatable twelve year old boy named Oskar.  It deals with his many problems; from his careless and divorced parents who neglect him, to his classmates who mentally and physically abuse him.  Oskar has angry tendencies but you can hardly blame the poor guy.  As the film unfolds Oskar finds some light in the dark cold nights of Stockholm.  He forges a profound bond with a lonely and desheveled girl around the same age as he is.  Her name is Eli and she is a vampire.<br /><br />This is not your normal horror movie fare, nor is it in any way reminiscent of mainstream vampire fiction that I can think of.  It is afterall, first and foremost, a romance story and because of that the moments of horror were only in the back of my mind, and they work far more convincingly than I expected.  Continuity is also rare in horror films and the consistency of the characters and the performances of the actors who played them only worked to enhance the film overall.<br /><br />An aspect of Let the Right One In that seemed exceptional to me can only be explained by mentioning a scene.  As retributive as it may sound, some of Oskar's bullies get their due in brutal yet satisfying fashion.  The scene is incredibly violent and is done underwater, but within the context of Oskar and Eli as characters, and at that point in their relationship, the scene works to be equally as beautiful as it is horrifying.  In the end I pity Oskar, but at the same time I'm not sure he has known any relationship better than one with Eli, and he probably never will.  There is a bittersweet feeling throughout.  I can't think of any film that brings a sense of romance to such extreme horror but this one pulls it off quite nicely and with little direct effort.<br /><br />There has been talk about an Americanized remake of this movie, but it will actually be another interpretation of the novel, so I expect something dramatically different.  Either way, see this one, whether in its limited release here in the states or when it comes to DVD and Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Let the Right One In left an impression on me that no horror film has since perhaps <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000524CY">The Exorcist</a> and it is probably, along with Hertzog's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YJMX">Nosferatu: Phantom Der Nacht</a>, the most compelling portrayal of the vampire myth that I've ever seen in film.  This is an amazing movie and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</p></body></html>

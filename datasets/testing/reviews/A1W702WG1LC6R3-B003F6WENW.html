<meta name="summary" content=""Great Comedy!""></head><body><p>Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Christopher Walken<br />star in this 2005 comedy. Two pals crash a wedding finding love with<br />two women. This is hilarious and Owen and Vince are terrific together.<br />This dvd not only has nice picture and sound, but features rated and<br />unrated versions plus neat extras. I recommend this great comedy.</p></body></html>

There is really nothing new in `Wrong Turn' besides the cast and a ridiculous tree hopping scene.  That said, to me there was no point to watch this, to make it even.  It took the same scenario's of many of the `good' horror films (Hills Have Eyes and Texas Chainsaw for starters) and recycled them into pointless fluff.  If it weren't for Dushku being as hot as she is this film wouldn't have been worth the wasted two hours I spent last night, and even then it's a stretch.  I don't understand why cannibals have to be mutated and uneducated woodsman who look unhuman and grunt instead of speak.  Remember Hannibal Lector?  Remember the remake of Texas Chainsaw in 2003?  The cannibals where much scarier when they looked like you and me.  These inbreds looked so fake it was ridiculous.  I gave it two stars for Dushku and the few creative death scenes, especially the one in the trees and the barbwire thing...gruesome as they were, it's a horror film so gruesome is welcomed.</p></body></html>

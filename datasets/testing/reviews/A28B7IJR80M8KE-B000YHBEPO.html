<meta name="summary" content="Tom Cruise can still deliver"></head><body><p>Much has been said about Cruise's outrageous antics in the past year, but despite that, he can still make a good action movie, MI:3 is what one would expect from a summer movie, the action is intense, almost as intense as the second, In this one Ethan Hunt has settled for a normal life, he now trains others in the field, but is called back to action after one of his former students is captured(Keri Russell) who looks better here than she has before, what follows is potential double-crosses along the way in which he chases an arms dealer(Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who appears to be in cahoots with someone from the orginization Hunt works for, Laurence Fishburne(Matrix) is here as Hunt's boss who suspects this, & even suspects Hunt himself, won't spoil it here, but to say this is one cool movie, Ving Rhames returns as Hunt's computer man, all in all the building sequence is cool as Hunt leaps across, my only two gripes are the fact that Hoffman is nowhere near as evil as Dougray Scott is in MI:II, by comparison, Hoffman is a weak villian, & Michelle Monahan is nice to look at, but favors Katie Holmes too much, Scarlett Johansson would have been better in this role, who was originally slated to play Hunt's fiance, but was scared off by Cruise's fascination with Scientology, other that this, this film is a real winner in the action department, I hated the first one, but love the second & this third one, they should stop here though, II & III can't be topped.</p></body></html>

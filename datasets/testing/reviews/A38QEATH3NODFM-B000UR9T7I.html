<meta name="summary" content="Decent movie, bit slower than other to develop, so many characters."></head><body><p>This being the third in a series, Spiderman 3 has really created a lot of buzz, and criticism, and continues to break box office records.  I movie was good, but I'll admit it was slower at the beginning, and it was hard to figure out how they would tie the whole thing together, but the did a fair job, and of course left it open for another film. I guess their is a plan to do 5 movies total.  So, as expected, this being the third movie, the plot may be slower, but hopefully it will be a good building block for 4,5, and 6 (planned so far).  3 villans was a bit much, Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin-harry osbourne, but agian it was tied together at the end. I did feel this was a bit more violent than the other 2 films, so parents, i would watch this first before having the kids see it.  So for those who are worried about all the criticism, think of it in similar terms as the star wars trilogy, they have been out for many years, and millions of different answer are around at which one is the best, but together they are a film dynesty that will live on forever regardless of the pieces.  Spiderman will be the same, so think of this as another piece in the set, awaiting completion.  Must see in theaters, definitely will be on the shelf when able to purchase.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This one should be in everyone's library"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that really makes you think. The events in the film (for the most part) are as they actually happened. <p>This film follows the crew of the Apollo 13 lunar mission, when something goes terribly wrong with the spacecraft, threatening the mission, as well as the crew's lives.<p>The actors in the film do an excellent job, and with good reason. Many of them have been nominated for oscars, and some of them have won. Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon are just two of the high quality actors in this film.  Ed Harris and Gary Sinise play supporting roles, but do it flawlessly. The acting is so good, that parts of the film make you feel as though you are there in the capsule with these men.<p>This was the first DVD I bought after getting my DVD player, and saw how crisp and clear the picture was. I was a bit fooled by this, as a lot of DVDs aren't this good. The picture and sound are crystal clear.<p>I recommend this movie to everyone with a DVD player. It is acceptable for children, and might even teach them a thing or two about the history of manned spaceflight.</p></body></html>

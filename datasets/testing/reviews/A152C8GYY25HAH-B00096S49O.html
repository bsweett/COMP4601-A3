<meta name="summary" content="Excellent formula comedy"></head><body><p>I generally don't like formula movies. "Hitch" is a comedy based on a formula going back decades and decades - boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. Yawn! But Will Smith is such a great actor that he's able to take a stale script and turn this movie into something quite enjoyable. Add to his performance a great comedic turn by Kevin James, and you've got one very predictable but very funny movie.<br /><br />Smith plays Hitch, A New York City matchmaker. Gauging from his lifestyle, he's a success. His latest client is a big, goofy guy [James], who's secretly in love with a beautiful heiress. Hitch grooms the guy in all the right moves. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a girl [Eva Mendes] who will turn his life upside down.<br /><br />The plot is absurd. It's the performances that make this movie work. Smith and James make it something both touching and loud out loud funny.</p></body></html>

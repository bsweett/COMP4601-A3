Seriously, I had to put off writing this review for a couple of weeks because I was speechless. Once again Mr. Day-Lewis takes complete control. This is a great movie... Even better than I could ever describe. The story is great, the directing and scenery... it's all great. But the acting is out of this world. A lot of people said this is a slow and long movie, yet I was captivated from the very first second. When it was over I felt like it only lasted a few minutes. At first I couldn't figure out what was going on... was the main character a caring and feeling man? Did he truly love his son? I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say that this movie had me going back and forth the entire time until the very end. The film has everything I love... especially the whole God debate. I truly enjoyed this movie and it is worth probably about 12 stars. Let's face it, we are lucky to live in this period where, in my opinion, we are treated to the greatest actor in history making films for us to see. This movie and Daniel Day-Lewis are perfect as perfect can be. There Will Be Blood is absolutely a movie you should own. Oh, you gotta see this!</p></body></html>

He enlists the help of investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who thinks he is on to something. He needs an assistant and employs the talents of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) in the title role. Lisabeth is a savvy psychotic bisexual computer hacker/investigator who provides us with a dark bizarre subplot.<br /><br />During the investigation they uncover hints that point to a serial killer, who kills Jewish women based on quotes from Leviticus. The mystery isn't too hard to figure out with the numerous clues that they give you. The movie is best when Rooney Mara is on the screen.<br /><br />F-bomb, rape, sex, nudity (Rooney Mara)</p></body></html>

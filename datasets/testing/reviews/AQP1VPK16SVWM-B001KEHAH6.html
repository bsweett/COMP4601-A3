Allen) hates being a tween. When her 13th birthday rolls around, she's excited and invites her best friend Matt (Sean Marquette) as well as the girls from the most popular click at her school to her party. There's no adults allowed so, of course, it'll be the best 13th birthday bash ever. Not really. Before the party Matt gives her Jenna's dream house in miniature with figures representing Jenna, Rick Springfield and, of course, Matt. Oh, he also includes some magic dust so she can make all her dreams come true.  Lucy the "leader" of the click ditches her and embarrasses her. Jenna's angry and kicks Matt out of the house. As she settles into the closet where she's put her wrecked dream house, she wishes for nothing more than to be 30 not 13.<br /><br />The next morning Jenna (Garner) wakes up in a strange bed with a strange man. She doesn't quite understand what's happened. Yesterday, she was 13 and now she's the co-editor of  her favorite fashion magazine. It seems strange particularly when she discovers that Matt's no longer in her life and everyone generally regards her as a supreme bitch.  She's confused not sure she's happy and misses Matt (Ruffalo). She looks him up in Greenwich Village and discovers he's a talented photographer who hasn't seen her since her temper tantrum 17 years before. Gradually, she discovers what she really wants is what she has denied herself; Matt and a life where she didn't turn out to be a nasty person.<br /><br />Despite all the extras that crowd on to this single dual layer disc, "13 Going on 30" looks terrific. Overall, the picture quality is stellar and the 5.1 sound makes you want to dance along to the music from the 80's no matter how bad it really was.<br /><br /> Boy did this girl go shopping. Included in this bag of treats from the most fashionable haunts of Hollywood are 18 deleted/extended scenes, a blooper reel, two vintage music videos that play prominent roles in the film (although Michael Jackson's "Thriller" is missing). The two featurettes are the most fun. We get to see the stars of the film when they were 13 and get their take on how geeky they were when they were that age. It's charming and fun to see Jennifer Garner in her band uniform and Ruffalo going on about his bad fashion sense. We also get a "Making of" featurette which is pretty good and gives some insight into some of the complex themes buried beneath this busy comedy. The most fun, though, are the last two features. "The 80's Outfit Challenge" allows you to piece together the "ultimate" outfit based on the standards of the time. We also get "Then and Now" which compares current modern conveniences to their 80's counterparts. The blooper reel isn't bad but it doesn't have the bust-out-loud quality that many of these do.<br /><br />With two excellent commentary tracks featuring director Gary Winick and producers Susan Arnold & Donna Arkoff Roth (both the daughters of film people-Arnold is the daughter of director/producer Jack Arnold while Arkoff Roth is the daughter of z-movie king Samuel Z. Arkoff), the commentary tracks are more than a cut above the norm with fun, witty asides and interesting insights into the making of the movie, Garner's performance and other tidbits.<br /><br /> A very funny comedy of errors, "13" excels primarily due to Garner and Ruffalo's strong performances and the able support of Judy Greer and Andy Serkis. Ironically, "13" has the same weaknesses as "Big" did with a story that's a little too familiar and pat in its conclusion. Still, it's a fun entertainment that will keep you chuckling.</p></body></html>

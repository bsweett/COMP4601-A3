<meta name="summary" content="Actually a 4.5 star....  get your popcorn ready !!"></head><body><p>And i tought they could'nt make good movies anymore...i was fooled.<br /><br />Get your munchies and popcorn ready cause once the movie starts you<br /><br />will not want to pause it for too long..  Great sets, good acting,<br /><br />good script, excellent visuals ....need i say more.<br /><br />  Sorry...this movie is not about gore, nudity, gun battles and<br /><br />boring racing cars....its like a giant fairy tale brought to you<br /><br />by  a experience director and a crew that cares making it a delight<br /><br />to watch.  Those who have a lack of imagination might not like it...<br /><br />too bad.  Enjoy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Splendid Fantasy Series for American Television"></head><body><p>"Lost" is unquestionably among the best television series currently airing on American network (not cable) television. It works as a spellbinding character-driven fantasy and science fiction series about a group of forty-odd survivors of an airplane crash lost in a remote mysterious Pacific island. As a character-driven series with an overarching plot arc, it resembles most closely "Babylon 5", with a cast of characters as complex as any aboard the 22nd Century space station. These include Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), a former Iraqi soldier, Hugo "Hurley" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), the unexpected winner of a lottery,  Kate Austin (Evangeline Lilly), and Jack Shepherd (Matthew Fox), the doctor who unexpectedly becomes the leader of the survivors. Veterans of other science fiction and fantasy television shows and films are included in this cast: Daniel Dae Kim from "Crusade", portrays the enigmatic Korean businessman Jin Kwon; Terry O'Quinn, whose roles include "Star Trek: The Next Generation", portrays the equally enigmatic John Locke; Dominic Monaghan from "The Lord of the Rings" is drug-addicted rock musician Charlie Pace. Each of the episodes have focused in depth on one or more of these main characters and others in the cast, confronting secrets as diverse as a mysterious man-killing monster and Danielle (Mira Furlan from "Babylon 5"), the lonely half-mad French survivor of another plane wreck on the island. While some may find that the plots seem to drag out needlessly, most will instead appreciate how well the cast and creators of "Lost" have built up the show to an intriguing climatic first season conclusion which may or may not resolve the fates of several in the cast.</p></body></html>

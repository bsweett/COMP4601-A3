<meta name="summary" content="BLU-RAY Edition of Nightmare Before Christmas"></head><body><p>Wow, wow, and wow...the Blu-ray version of this film blows all the others away. I have recently converted to Blu-ray, so I am still basking in the glow of the clarity of this new format, so bear with me! Inspired by the classic Rankin-Bass stop-motion animation Christmas classics & "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas," Tim Burton's film tells the tale of Jack Skellington, a kind mis-guided soul who falls in love with Christmas, and attempts to put his own Halloween spin on it, wreaking havoc when the two holidays collide. The characters are memorable: Sally (a Bride-of-Frankenstein-type rag doll who attempts to escape her maker, the twisted Dr. Finklestein), Jack's ghostly pet dog, Zero, the evil Oogie Boogie (a green sack-like boogie-man addicted to gambling), the Mayor of Halloween Town (who actually has two faces that spin around according to his mood and what he wants to show the town!), and Lock, Shock, & Barrel (mischievous trick-or-treaters who kidnap Santa!). The emotion that is able to be achieved by Burton's crew through the puppets is nothing short of astounding, and Burton's Germanic-stylized sets are a visual feast.<br /><br />Bonus features include:<br /><br />New! "What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour." This featurette takes you through Disneyland's Haunted Mansion from start to finish with the Nightmare Before Christmas Holiday Overlay. Options of watching the featurette with or without trivia popups (which are very fun and interesting).<br /><br />New! Tim Burton's original NBC poem narrated by legendary horror actor Christopher Lee.<br /><br />New! Film commentary by producer/writer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick, and composer Danny Elfman (also of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002MYXZ">Anthology</a> fame!).<br /><br />New! Tim Burton introduction to "Frankenweenie". If you've never seen this early Tim Burton short, you will love it! Way out and wacky homage to "Frankenstein," stars Shelly Duvall and Daniel Stern. Burton has filmed a new intro to this short and tells how he is in the process of creating a stop-motion animation version of this movie. Sketches are shown as well.<br /><br />"Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" - available on previous editions, this behind-the-scenes documentary gives you a greater appreciation of what went into making this classic. Models had to be moved by the crew 24 times for each second of film...do the math!<br /><br />"The Worlds of  Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas": see the creation/sketches of each of the lands from the movie: Halloween Town, Christmas Town, and The Real World.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes, Storyboard to Film Comparison, Theatrical Trailers/Posters, and complete stop-motion animation early Tim Burton short "Vincent," narrated by Vincent Price.<br /><br />Exclusive to Blu-ray version: Special introduction by Tim Burton<br /><br />Audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital on DVD, and 7.1 D-TRU HD/5.1 Dolby Digital (48k-24 bits) for Blu-ray<br /><br />1:66-1 Original Theatrical Presentation (Anamorphic Enhanced for 16x9 TVs)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Miss Teschmacher!""></head><body><p>Believe it or not, I didn't catch "Superman" until April, 2004. It's a great flick with a lot of wit, well worthy of its reputation. Although a couple of things are understandably dated -- like the flying sequences and Clark Kent's glasses (which are so BAD they're laughable) -- the movie definitely stands the test of time. In other words, there's no reason to do a remake -- they got it RIGHT the first time.<br /><br />For a good review of "Superman" just breeze through the many fine critiques here at Amazon; for example, "thornhillatthemovies" just below me has a nice, thorough review.<br /><br />The reason I'm writing is to point something out that no other reviewer has mentioned: Lex Luthor's girlfriend, Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine, is incredibly voluptuous and gorgeous! Is it just me or has anyone else noticed this? WATCH OUT for the pool scene wherein Ms. Perrine is wearing a green one-piece bathing suit -- her God-given curves are stunning! I caught this scene on TV late one night and it convinced me to buy the flick.<br /><br />Another thing occurred to me while watching the film that few reviewers mention: "Superman" is not just a comic-booky superhero flick, it's a powerful piece of SCI-FI cinema! The outstanding Krypton sequences of the first half hour confirm this. These scenes are highlighted by the magnificence of Marlon Brando, one of my favorite actors, playing Superman's father Jor-El. So, if you're a serious Sci-Fi fan, don't skip "Superman" just because you assume it's some mere superhero movie. No, it's more, much more. In fact, the screenplay was obviously written with absolutely no concern about cost, so MANY are the great F/X sequences. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

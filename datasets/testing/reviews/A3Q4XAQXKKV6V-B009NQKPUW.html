In fact it's a checklist of pretty much every scifi movie ever made...the entire run of this was so nostalgic, from bringing an alien specimen on board (which is always a bad idea, and has a predictable outcome) to the indispensable robot who in the end is the one man for the job.. are people really this forgetful? The casting, other than the Bishop/Aliens ripoff were simply not memorable. I didn't identify with or care about ANY of these characters -- even WITH their names plastered unnecessarily on their heads.<br /><br />Spoilers --<br /><br />Lets not even mention the giant continuity problems like the scientist lady who bares some type of octopus formed alien, then the Borg looking "baddie" alien (who shares our EXACT DNA so therefore should produce an identical style alien) bares a -- wait for it -- classic alien model just in time for the credits.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily say skip this movie, but you've seen it. It has some impressive visual effects for someone who has never played a modern videogame, but it lacks any sort of soul and the script could definitely use a strong central character..but I suppose when you've cast 9 unlikeable actors - who would you choose?<br /><br />PS - couldn't they find an OLDER actor to play the part of the old man? The "old guy" visuals looked really poor..and they kept out someone who possibly could have made this film seemed a little more grounded.<br /><br />''Hi---- I'm REALLY OLD. I want to find an alien species because they MUST KNOW how to stop aging -- even though I have no proof they know anything of the kind.. if they even exist AT ALL."<br /><br />''HI, I'm hot and blonde and my dad is 75 years older than I am."<br /><br />did anyone watch the movie -- or just the holographic pretty lights?<br /><br />"Hi, I signed up for a mission I didn't know didn't allow guns -- apparently we never discussed the parameters of the mission."</p></body></html>

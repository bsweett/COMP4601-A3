<meta name="summary" content="Blanchett and Kapur reign supreme in newest ELIZABETH"></head><body><p>Cate Blanchett has outdone even her own self.She has mastered a role that many actresses have also played,but SHE has become Her Royal Majesty Elizabeth even more so in Shekhar Kapur's newest installment ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE than she was in the first ELIZABETH in 1998.Blanchett is the perfect combination of ice and fire,vulnerability and bullheadedness,sensitivity and rageaholic and masculine and feminine to bring England's savior to the screen.Ms.Blanchett is so in control of herself that the corset  stays tied, but the fear and passion always dwell just below the surface.She is Queen.At one point,Blanchett,in a rage at the Spanish Ambassador screams "I have a hurricane within me"....and she does,because Blanchett does.<br />Blanchett may well see her first BEST ACRESS Oscar this year.She has a Golden Globe and another win would be no surprise.This film has many magnificent qualities going for it,but ultimately it is Cate Blanchett's astute and finely tuned skills as an actress par excellent that carry this film to victory.<br />The year is 1585.Spain is eying the English throne.Sequestered up in Fartheringay Castle in Scotland,Mary Stuart the Queen of Scotland (an amazing and convincing Samantha Morton performance as always) also has her own designs to usurp Elizabeth,"that bastard whore." Elizabeth is still advised by her chief counselor Francis Walsingham (again Geoffrey Rush reprising his brilliant role from the original).Walsingham still has safeguarded England as a Protestant country.Philip of Spain and Mary Stuart, though, are Catholic, and are set to unseat Elizabeth as Queen.But another usurper enters early on;a usurper of the heart,Sir Walter Raleigh (a well made up and swashbuckled Clive Owen).What Kapur does so beautifully with all of these players is to reveal the immense struggle that existed for Elizabeth not only from without, but also within.As Queen she must rule and be obeyed; but she is also a woman who has a heart, and that heart has denied itself many  of life's pleasures in order that she may "be married to England." This is the single brilliance of Kapur's film;though he needs to fit in historical facts to tell the actions that  do indeed occur between the countries and their monarchs, Kapur always keeps his focus always on Elizabeth, the ruler AND the woman.Even as Elizabeth "allows" (somewhat)her chief lady,Bess, to be wooed by Raleigh that she states, "live my adventures through you" or when Elizabeth, clad in armour atop a white steed proclaims to her troops, "We shall not be defeated.Whether in Heaven or on the field of battle,(that was a loose translation!) we shall return victorious" ,our focus is always on this miraculously strong and clever woman whose reign brought prosperity to England that would last three centuries.Kapur is confident in his Queen "Cate" to deliver the goods...and she does.Kapur has his Elizabeth calmly slip her royal signet ring onto her finger and has her in an almost Moses-like stance facing the raging winds and the thunder and lightening as she surveys, in her night clothes, the fighting ships in the Channel.Here Elizabeth is the warrior and the woman in one...powerful and mighty to withstand the Spanish onslaught.<br />The battle between the British and the Spanish Armada off the white cliffs of Dover is awesome and powerful to behold. The Channel is ablaze with blasting canons and "fire ships".One scene that Kapur vividly implanted in my mind is that of a white mare jumping from one of the Spanish ships.Kapur's camera follows the horse from underneath,swimming in the fiery waters, while Roman crosses and goblets fall to the Channel floor along with the bodies of dead warriors.This is a very arresting piece of camera work and symbolism of the Spaniard's defeat from which they never recovered.<br />I would be remiss if I did not mention the totally engrossing soundtrack that propelled all of the action forward while never over-asserting itself.That is the hallmark of a fine soundtrack.<br />Did I love it? ABSOLUTELY.<br />Would I see it again? DEFINITELY.<br />Will I purchase the DVD? Yep (but it is awesome on a big screen and will be significantly diminished!)<br />Will Cate Blanchett get her first BEST ACTRESS Academy Award? So far,POSITIVELY.<br />What else makes this movie magnificent? Costumes,Sound,Cinematography,Original Screenplay,Editing,supporting actors.<br />Yeah...it was THAT good!As a sequel, it fulfilled all my hopes.</p></body></html>

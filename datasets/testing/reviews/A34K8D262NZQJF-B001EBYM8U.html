Denzel Washington is one bad motha... and jus' look into those piercing eyes and you can tell that if 'you' stab him in the back you probably won't live when you try to take two steps. Ethan Hawke plays and excellent rookie cop learning the ropes and doing things that make you wanna say 'stooooooooooopid' but it's that type of curiosity he has that makes Denzel's character unravel his covering of his bad side. Anyways I think this movie is and excellent buy and I am probably gonna get burned owning this copy cause I smell a special edition or something coming on the horizon! Still worth the look though!</p></body></html>

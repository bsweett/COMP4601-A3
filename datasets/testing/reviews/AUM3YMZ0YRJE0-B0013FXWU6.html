<meta name="summary" content="horrible and dark indictment of frontier capitalism"></head><body><p>This is the story of one of the most eccentrically evil and heartless men that has ever been put on film.  DDL exudes the alienation and hatred of a psychotic achiever, who will stop at no humiliation or violence to achieve his goal of building a house as he remembers it from his childhood.<br /><br />The portrait of a raw Texas, shorn of romantic myth, is unbelievably vivid and graphic.  From the silent work that DDL carries out in a dank mine, you get a feeling for the lack of all social structure and decency in the greedy poor.  As he works his way up, he leaves a trail of damaged people in all his achievements.  However, this work of art is no caricature.  The characters are realistic and believable, if uglier than we care to imagine much of our past to have been.<br /><br />DDL creates a truly unique character.  He hates and uses everyone, even the son he adopts, letting no one close, especially women.  His one unguarded moment leads inexorably  to murder.  His alcoholism and seething rage are all that he has, beyond his oil wealth.  It is truly frightening.<br /><br />Recommended.  THis is a true artistic success,  but I would recommend renting it rather than buying it:  you will only want to watch it once.</p></body></html>

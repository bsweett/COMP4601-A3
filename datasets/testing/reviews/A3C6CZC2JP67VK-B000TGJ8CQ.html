The good news about Next is that Nicolas Cage turns in one of his better performances. No one does the disaffected outsider like Cage, the oddball guy on the fringes who couldn't care less about what's going on around him. Unfortunately, he often takes that persona to such as extreme that he appears to be sleepwalking through his role. This was particularly apparent in Ghost Rider (2007), in which Cage slouched through the whole production, seemingly bored by everything in sight, trying to pass off a bad Elvis imitation as a "character choice." As Cris Johnson, Cage brings his bored detachment up a notch, to cynical self-interest. At least he seems more involved in the proceedings this time around, and he's actually a fun character to watch.<br /><br />Julianne Moore reprises her Clarice Starling role from Hannibal (2001) here, as tough-as-nails FBI agent Callie Ferris, a no-nonsense government hound who, one suspects, would have been perfectly home at Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib. Moore seems a little uncomfortable barking orders, and her performance comes across as somewhat forced and unbelievable. She lacks the fire and the intensity for a role such as this, and she makes it way too obvious that she's "acting" throughout.<br /><br />What can one say about Jessica Biel? She's eye-candy, pure and simple, with little else to do in this film besides providing a sounding board for Cage and serving as the damsel in distress. For what was required of her, she's fine in this role.<br /><br />The premise as presented, that someone could constantly see every possible outcome of every possible action and still be relatively functional, is a tough one to accept, but if you can get past that and suspend your disbelief for 96 minutes, Next can be a fun film, filled with some great action sequences.</p></body></html>

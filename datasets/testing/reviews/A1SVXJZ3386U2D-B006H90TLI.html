<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing"></head><body><p>After a steady diet of older movies and foreign movies, I rented a recent American release; "No Country for Old Men".  My initial reaction was one of emotional exhaustion.  This movie held me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end but gave me nothing that I could hold on to.  To elaborate more might spoil part of the effect of "No Country for Old Men" and I guess I benefitted from being totally unaware of what was going to happen next throughout the whole movie.  Therefore, without discussing the plot in any detail, what makes this an excellent film?<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" has many strong attributes including a constant onslaught of dramatic action and suspense.  We start out with a situation that demands explanation and we are constantly confronted by successive scenarios that demands explanation and/or resolution.  The cinematography, at times, was brilliant.  However, for me, the key to "No Country for Old Men" is the casting and that includes top billing to honorable mention.  Woody Harrelson seemed to not fit the bill until I realized that he was everything his character was supposed to be (including being somewhat cocky and obnoxious).  My nominee for the Best Supporting Actor was the guy at the gas station.  That was another one of those scenes in which had several possible outcomes and it was this guy who made the scene such a memorable one.<br /><br />The problem with the movie, for me, was What are we supposed to get out of it????  Evil reigns supreme???  The ending underscored the lack of any coherence.  What was that all about???  I realize that there is a connection to the film's title but that would be either too shallow for what we had just seen or too distracting.  I guess the key to all this munderstanding is to remember the producers.</p></body></html>

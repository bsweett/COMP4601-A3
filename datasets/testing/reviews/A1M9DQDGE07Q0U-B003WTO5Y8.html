<meta name="summary" content="EAT YOUR HEART OUT (or perhaps, liver) WITH THIS GREAT DVD!"></head><body><p>"The Silence of the Lambs" needs no introduction.  A masterfully told suspense/thriller with a diabolical twist ending, this is the movie that made cannibals cool and reinvented the careers of both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is, of course, Hannibal Lecter, the psychiatrist who ate his patients and is serving out a life sentance in a maximum security, clinical facility.  Foster is Clarise Starling, a fledgling FBI agent sent to pick apart Hannibal's mind (no pun intended) when copy cat crimes start surfacing.<br />MGM's remastering effort of this important movie is nothing short of a revelation.  Both Criterion and Image tried to give us an adequate print.  Neither were anamorphically enhanced and both suffered from insufficient contrast levels, shadow delineation and color separation.  This DVD fixes all of those problems.  The image quality throughout is superb.  Colors are well balance.  Film grain is kept to a minimum.  Edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are nonexistant.  The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is incredibly stirring, especially in its music tracks.<br />Extras: a really great documentary that, unfortunately does not involve the participation of Jodie Foster (what's with her any way?), some deleted scenes and test footage round out the extras, including bios, theatrical trailers, television spots and an audio commentary track.  Three cheers.  Much better than Criterion's bare bones junket and far less expensive!<br />BOTTOM LINE: A DEFINITE MUST FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES FAVA BEANS OR JUST BEING SCARED IN THE DARK!</p></body></html>

I'm glad he came back  to his roots after his semi-serious stint in Peter Jackson's "King Kong".  Physical comedy is what he does best because he throws his all into it fearlessly.<br /><br />Nacho Libre is a Mexican Friar serving as the bored orphanage cook longing to be a famous wrestler.  He teams up with a homeless man who serves as his hapless yet loyal sidekick.  Nacho strives to be the best wrestler, even with the misgivings and caution of the lovely Sister Encarnacion whom he harbors feelings for.  She eventually supports his endeavor.<br /><br />While the movie is predominately geared towards Jack Black's physical comedy, the directorial style is vey much Jared Hess's.  Occasional one-liners come out like in "Napolean Dynamite".  Either way, the blend was spot on and made for a very funny film without being over campy and completely ridiculous.  The musical accompaniment is comically heroic as well as heart-warming.  Worth the watch.</p></body></html>

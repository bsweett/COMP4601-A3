Too bad. I watched a couple of clunkers prior to watching this really good movie.<br /><br />I'd not heard much about Lucky Number Slevin's plot other than what I read on the outside of the DVD case. And that little blurb on the DVD case really wasn't that compelling. That's good because, as it turns out, the movie really captures the viewer with a where-the-heck-is-this going plot.<br /><br />Lucky Number Slevin is full of action, comedy, high suspense and moves along at a pace that keeps you in your seat for the full run. It has tons of very good performances by very good actors and the dialogue is captivating.<br /><br />After showing up at his friend Nick's apartment, Slevin is mistaken for Nick and thrust into a war between two crime lords where he's asked to either kill or be killed. Not much choice for the desperate Slevin. And that's all I'd venture to offer for fear of spoiling this flick with some great surprises and twists.<br /><br />Be warned, indeed other reviews here and elsewhere mostly have unnecessary spoilers and that's a shame. It's also a shame that a movie as good as this didn't do as well in the box office simply because the producers needed to make the promos deliberately ambiguous so as not to reveal any of the twists and turns. Kudos to them, because this is a film that is much more fun to view without too much upfront plot knowledge.<br /><br />If a good, action-packed thriller is your cup of tea, then Lucky Number Slevin is right up your alley. Worth the purchase.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Does Not Deliver Bold Statement..."></head><body><p>King Arthur opens with a statement that declares that this is based on the truth behind the legendary myths surrounding the tales of King Arthur and his knights.  This is a bold statement, in fact, it is bold enough to bring the tale to its ruin before the film has even begun, as most people consider it folklore and fairy tales.  It seems as if the purpose is to draw the audience's attention to the story with a false statement and declare it to be the truth in an attempt to falsely advertise.  Those who are educated in the matters know better, but those who do not might not.  The falsehood of the tale is upsetting, as it could very well one day serve a similar purpose for some who want to change the view of history.<br /><br />Antoine Fuqua's version takes place moments before the Romans withdrew their troops from Great Britain as the Saxon's were invading from the north, and the Britons where raiding convoys.  The Britons are led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), who is not a wizard, but a tattooed leader of the poor Britons that fights a war with Guerilla warfare.  When the Saxon's approach from the north, Merlin decides that joining forces with Arthur against the Saxons is the best solution, as Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights are sent to rescue a couple of Roman's.<br /><br />Arthur arrives to the Roman camp and he discovers that the people have been unjustly treated and in anger he responds by freeing those who have been unjustly treated in the name of God.  It is, however, extremely strange that he has never seen any unjust treatment of people prior to his visit to the Roman camp.  Consequently, the escape away from the approaching Saxons begins, which is very similar to Fuqua's Tears of the Sun (2003) where a group of Navy Seals disobey order by helping local populations from genocide.  The story continues with brave warrior's fighting for just causes, as they fight for a higher cause -- freedom.<br /><br />The original tale of Sir Arthur and his knights brings the audience wisdom and valuable lessons, which would be seemingly fitting for the time when the story took place.  Nevertheless, King Arthur seems like a parody in the way the knights tackle political issues in a way only contemporary heroes do in films.  Despite the awkwardness in the film, King Arthur offers some valuable lessons in what could only be a self-righteous attempt in recreating a frequently told tale, which is displayed through the vibrant colors of Ireland and grand war scenes that only shadow Gibson's Braveheart (1995).  In the end, King Arthur offers an awkward cinematic experience with some lessons, but overall leaves the audience with a disappointing experience.</p></body></html>

I'm happy to say that the wait was worth it.  This film has a great cast of actors including Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Lian Neeson, Laura Linney and Hugh Grant---whose characters are all dealing with different levels of love and relationships.  There is Emma's character dealing with her husband being unfaitful;  Liam's character dealing with the death of his wife and his endearing relationship with his stepson; Hugh Grant's priminister falling for a young lady from the wrong side of the tracks; and Colin Firth's character dealing with love and the barrier of two languages.  The director seams the stories together nicely and leaves the audience with a renewed faith in love and a realization that love comes in many forms---love for a sibling, love for a stepchild and, of course, romantic love.  Not every story in this film has a perfect ending but the overall effect is that love is all around us.  In a time when we seem to focus on the hatred and wars of the world, this little film gives a small sample of what we all need--love!</p></body></html>

The romance and mystery of the Authurian legend is replaced by the mystery of how Guinevere kept clothed during battle. She only wears a few well placed leather straps. How can they claim historical accuracy and redefine Guinivere in this way? When we first meet G., her fingers are all out of joint and Arthur painfully puts them back. In less than a few hours, she is Robin Hood. Killing evil  Roman Christians and Saxons with a bow and arrow. She is almost starved to death and dehydrated by the Romans, but in less than a few days she's gripping swords, out dueling opponents three times her size and running half naked to battle. She has pretty impressive recuperative powers.<br /><br />The acting of Clive Owen is the only decent thing about the movie. He plays King Arthur in a nice understated way.<br /><br />An undefined "Freedom" becomes the highest good. Freedom replaces truth, justice, chivalry, and duty of the Arthurian legends. The movie investigates the idea of freedom, but never really defines it. True freedom is no boundaries, I think. The movie steals from Braveheart, The Patriot and the Lord of the Rings. The battle scenes go on way too long. There are several scenes of Merlin with the wind blowing through his long hair. It is less than impressive.<br /><br />I could go on, but why bother.<br /><br />I would add 1/2 star. After I wrote this review I saw a special on Bouddicca. She led a charge in England against the Romans. So the warrior princess idea is well-founded in fact. I still think no warrior would dress that way and her recuperative powers were too amazing.</p></body></html>

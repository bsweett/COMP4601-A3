"The first epic horror film" was its tagline.  I'd read the novel and ate up the hype and saw it opening day...and then left the theatre a little confused: it didn't scare me.  At all.<br />The critic for Newsweek said that THE SHINING made THE EXORCIST look like ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET BEELZEBUB.  Really?<p>I will say that THE SHINING is probably the most beautifully photographed horror film ever made.  The scene where Jack Torrance sells his soul for a glass of beer to the patient, creepy Lloyd the bartender hints at the evil behind the Overlook Hotel.  Satan closing that simple deal in the cavernous ballroom is one of the film's highlights for me.<br />But the movie never gets any momentum.<br />I've read as many Stanley Kubrick biographies as I can find (some good, some really bad) and I believe the reason THE SHINING doesn't work is fairly simple: Kubrick never believed in an afterlife.  He believed in evil in the world, evil in human beings, but the idea of Satan, ghosts, the supernatural eluded him.<p>Stephen King said in an interview back in 1980 that Kubrick would call him at all hours to pepper him with questions during production.  Questions like, "Do you believe in God?"<br />(In the Argosy article back then, King said that he told Kubrick that he didn't.  Since his horrible accident, King now tells the same story--except that he now says he told Kubrick he did).<p>And, in my opinion, when you keep this in mind while watching the film, you understand that Kubrick's normally razor-sharp perceptions as a filmmaker appear a little vague and out of focus.  The emphasis shifts from a malevolent haunted house to one guy losing his sanity.<p>The DVD is worth it for Kubrick's daughter's documentary, "The Making of THE SHINING."  As a lifelong Kubrick fan (DR. STRANGELOVE is, in modern terms, still Da Bomb), I'd never heard the reclusive director's voice until this DVD came out a few years ago.<br />What I really missed though was the second trailer from 1980, the one they played on TV just before the film was released.  The DVD includes the first trailer--the single shot of the elevator opening to release a tidal wave of blood in the hotel--but does anyone remember the TV commercial?  Wendy Carlos' throbbing main title plays as different shots from the film roll.  No dialogue.  And one of the last shots is Jack with his face pushed through the shattered door--but not the shot from the film!  It's some alternate take (and there were a slew of them).  He's laughing hysterically, his face locked in satanic glee, all teeth and eyebrows...and his eyes are dead with evil.  Somebody, please dig that out!  Over 20 years later and I still remember that!</p></body></html>

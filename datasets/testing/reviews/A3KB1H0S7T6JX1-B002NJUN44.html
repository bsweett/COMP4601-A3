<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad, but Not Great either"></head><body><p>Eragon was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, and Djimon Hounsou among others, though by no means is it a bad movie.<br /><br />A young farm boy comes across a strange stone that holds the key to the past, the present, and the future...<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but really nothing great), the dialogues are weak, the plot is average, the setting is good, while the special effects are very good.<br /><br />On the negative side:<br /><br />1) The unoriginal story/plot, which is heavily "borrowed" from LoR, Star Wars and the Dragonlance Chronicles by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis (all three being AMAZING btw...)<br /><br />2) The rather poor choice for the lead actor.<br /><br />3) Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle being given poor lines and majorly cliche roles to play.<br /><br />4) Djimon Hounsou looking completely out of place in this film.<br /><br />5) John Malkovich counting 2-3 minutes of actual play.<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />1) The Fantasy setting<br /><br />2) The very good special effects; Saphira was great!<br /><br />3) Sienna Guillory (!) who definitely has potential.<br /><br />So it's an average plot, weak dialogues, decent acting, an interesting setting, respectable music (though it could have been better), and a good cast, which when put together fail to take off.  The potential for a great movie was definitely there and although it's far from being a masterpiece, it will provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

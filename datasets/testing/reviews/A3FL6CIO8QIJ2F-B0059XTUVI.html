The film is told in flashback as we learn of Margaret's upbringing, her interst in political life and her ultimate postion as Britain's first female head-of-state.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep's performance here is nothing short of astonishing: her speech, facial expressions (helped by inventive make-up) and her mannerisms are dead-on. Streep had never met the real Thatcher, but was able to view old film's from archives from the BBC and other sources and it was from watching Thatcher that Streep discovered how to play her.<br /><br /> It took Meryl 29 years to win another Oscar thanks to this role. As a huge fan of hers I have to say "The Iron Lady" is my favorite of all the performances Streep has done.<br /><br /> Simply an A+ film.</p></body></html>

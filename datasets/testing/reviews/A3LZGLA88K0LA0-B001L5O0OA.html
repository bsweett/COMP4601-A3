<meta name="summary" content="A CHRISTMAS NECESSITY"></head><body><p>Twenty years after its initial release, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; remains one of the most heartwarming, human and enjoyable Yuletide tales ever.  The casting of Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin was truly inspired and are at the heart of this classic.  Billingsley's unabashed imagination, his wide-eyed awe of all that goes on around him, his desire to get that beebee gun, and his joyous love of life is one of the best children's performances on celluloid.  Melinda Dillon's Mom is a joy to behold---witness how she gets little Randy to eat his mashed potatoes and meatloaf--what a marvelous performance she gives--her love and admiration for her husband and children is evidenced in so many sublte ways and Dillon captures and embodies the wonder of motherhood.  McGavin, needless to say, is awesome.  Childlike, foul-mouthed, but the biggest kid in the movie.  This movie alone shows what an underappreciated and fine actor Mr. McGavin is.<br />Christmas' true meaning and its simplicity and joy have not been captured any more effectively in this Christmas gem.<br />Have yourself a merry little Christmas and watch this one every year!</p></body></html>

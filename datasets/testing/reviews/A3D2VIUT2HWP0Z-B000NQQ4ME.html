Oddly enough, it is also one of the few films with depth that can also evoke immediate responses. As testament to that, you can see the many visceral reactions that came out at the time of the films release.<br />Oddly enough, as impactful as the film is in terms of the violence and the ferocity of the performance, I can still safely say that many aspects were held back, I would guess for censorship reasons, and probably because Mel Gibson wanted the film to do well at the box office. The Combination of Actors, animals, practical effects, animal puppets, over 400 Visual FX shots, give rise to a near perfect illusion of the frenetic paced action which is this story.<br />I can but urge you to see this film. Then listen to the DVD  commentary, and see the far too short Features on the one disk.<br />THE DVD: Great Visuals, great sound, and another near perfect film done by a Master Craftsman in the world of popular film.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

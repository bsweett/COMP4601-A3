<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely horrible"></head><body><p>I was looking forward to this all year long.  What a great premise for a film.  And with one of my favorite actors in it, Hugh jackman, how could they go wrong?  Unfortunately, they do.<p>Jackman produces a fairly good character in Van Helsing.  He's likeable, a bit brooding, and mysterious.  Unfortunately, we don't know anything about him.  How strong is he?  How can he fight monsters when other humans can't?  This isn't explained in the film though.  Just one of the MANY plot holes that make up this movie.  And this movie is filled with them.  Director Stephen Sommers tries to build a romance around the two main characters, but literally waits until the last 5 minutes fo the movie to start.  There is not a single spark of interest between the two characters before then.  They might as well have both been male for all the romance there was.  There are numerous other relationships that are hinted at during the film but never explained.  Not small relationships, but seemingly major plot developments that are not explained.  They're not even set up appropriately for a sequel.<p>But Van Helsing doesn't appear to be about a good story.  After all, it's a summer blockbuster.  I can be content with a good popocorn movie.  "The Mummy" was horribly written too but it was enjoyable to watch in the theater.  Van Helsing isn't.  160 million on this film.  Where did it go?  Certainly not in the special effects.  The CGI is decent in some parts of the movie, and in others just plain absurd.  It looks unfinished, and there are effects that I could have done a better job making with a flipbook and some crayons.  <p>If you watch Van Helsing, be prepared to suspend your belief in the laws of physics.  At one point, a team of 6 horses jumps almost 100 feet over a chasm.  They actually show this effect from a distance, which further emphasis the absurdity of it.  It might as well have been Santa's sleigh because that's exactly what it looks like.  And this is just the most obvious flaw.  Characters jump 20 feet in the air, climb up walls like Jackie Chan, and accomplish other feats only possible with the help of computers and a bad script.<p>One of the most atrocious aspects of this film is the acting.  Tremendous melodrama from Dracula and his brides.  He might as well have been wearing a cape, rubbing his hands together and saying "mwahahahaha."  Jackman and Beckinsale are the only actors who don't do a horrible job with the already horrible script they were given, although beckinsale is close.  And don't get me started on Van Helsing's trusty sidekick, Carl.  This guy is a dictionary of bad puns and one liners.  They could have replaced him with Shaggy from Scooby Doo and you wouldn't have noticed much difference.  Heck, the animation would have even looked better.  This character should have been cut from the film completely.<p>Overall, a film I wanted to enjoy, but just couldn't.  The novelty aspect of all of these monsters together didn't even hold up for me.  If you like mindless action and don't think too much about movies or care about the realism of them, and if you are a fan of "The Mummy" and "League of Extraordinary Gentleman," you might enjoy Van Helsing.  But for the rest of us, there comes a time when you can't just sit back and ignore a crossbow with a never ending supply of amunition or a team of flying horses.</p></body></html>

This movie is awesome!  You get pulled into the movie at the opening when you see Vampires watching the city and then they go in for the hunt because they see Lycans are in the city and following someone.  It starts out with action as they start a whole scene fighting one another.  It is not your typical love story it is more based on Vampires vs. Lycans but you get a sense of love with Kate and Scott.  But it in now way takes away from the action you feel in this movie.  You will not be displeased with this movie it has a lot of cool special effects and the blood going into Viktor  was neat.  I love when they also walk into the house and the cool techno music was playing and the Vampires were just all sitting around while they crew walked through.  It is a great movie with great heart.  I read some reviews and not sure why so bad I usually hate movies like this but I love this one!</p></body></html>

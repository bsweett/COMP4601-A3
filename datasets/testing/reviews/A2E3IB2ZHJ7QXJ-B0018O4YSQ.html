There's little character development, , and the movie is pretty much a series of chases, running around that basically piles evidence about the big picture that can be summed up in a paragraph (and also loses the mystery and the jolt moments after you see it again).  How can a movie with a story like this possibly even warrant a good grade?<br /><br />Well, Dark City does, and it does so with ease, thanks to the visionary directing of Alex Proyas, the art style, some fine performances, and execution.  Excellent, excellent execution.  Director Alex Proyas was responsible for that turd Knowing, but I always thought that the directing was very good in a sense.  However, it was it's totally unimaginative in all aspects and really bored me to death (and the movie didn't even explain why those things were even there!).  Dark City, however, doesn't bore you, thanks to it's one of a kind world that it creates.  Sure, Dark City may not be any way significant or have anything to say, and it's frequent comparison, The Matrix, even said a lot more, and I find that movie to be little more than psuedophilosphy (don't get me wrong, I dig the Matrix, I just don't believe it's worthwhile social commentary like A Clockwork Orange)<br /><br />Even though the story isn't the most profound of science fiction I've seen, it's miles better than garbage like The Day After Tommorrow, Armageddon, and even Alex Proya's own Knowing.  It's not terribly complex, and the movie almost seems like a game of Myst regarding it's plot.  However, unlike, say, Knowing, Dark City features some explanations that are at least interesting and gives us some insight on the creatures, who can do all kinds of crazy things and are merely just curious.  It's not among the most memorable stories out there, but at least it has some grounding in creating interest and some insight.<br /><br />However, Dark City really elevates itself to it's execution, from it's acting to it's sound, and most of all, it's visual style. The acting is reasonable as it makes the characters believable and somewhat likeable even though they don't develop much (but actually works because of the plot), but it's the two senses that make Dark City a great movie to behold (inspired by German Expressionalist Films) Borrowing from such movies as Metropolis (1927) (though I really can't see much of the influence of M and Nosferatu, to be honest).  A special note is the effects, which are great to see.  The climax of this movie, in particular, is awesome.  I still can't believe they were able to make a movioe with a visual style like this in 1998, a decade before big budget CGI fests flooded the Hollywood market.<br /><br />Dark City does have it's influences, but it still is a good movie that should easily complement movies like Brazil, Blade Runner, The City of Lost Children, and The Matrix, and not replace them (and those movies should not replace them either).  Dark City may not have many mindblowing secrets, but it sure is a place worth visiting again and again.  This DVD makes the movie even better, as it includes 3 commentaries, a theatrical trailer, cool production shots, and two documentaries totaling an hour and a half.  It also adds fifteen minutes of footage to the movie (and movies)  Whether or not you get the director's cut or not, the trip to Dark City is worth it.<br /><br />B-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good Superhero Movie - Recommended"></head><body><p>"Watchmen" is a surprisingly good Superhero movie. Set in an alternate timeline in 1985 where Richard Nixon is on his fifth term as president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. I missed it in the theaters but managed to catch the Director's Cut on Amazon "Video on Demand".<br /><br />This a world where some of the "heroes" are far darker than Batman and are significantly more morally flawed than any of the comic book heroes of my childhood. That being said, these are much more human and therefore much easier to understand, with the exception of the often naked Dr. Manhattan who started as human has become very alien indeed.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the story centers on the very disturbing hero Rorschach as he tries to figure out who is killing retired (forcibly, by law) masked avengers. Also appearing are The Comedian, Silk Specter II, Night-Owl, and several other retired heroes. All of this takes place against the backdrop of impending global destruction as the US and Soviets prepare to heat up the Cold War.<br /><br />The cinematography is nothing short of amazing, the mood is set perfectly by the camera shots, lighting, and soundtrack. There are also some outstanding special effects that really add to the realism of the movie. Other than the somewhat gratuitous scenes with Dr. Manhattan's digitally created glowing full frontal nudity, there was very little I didn't enjoy with the technical side of the movie.<br /><br />The movie has a very graphic love scene and shows a lot of actual human nudity. There is also a good bit of graphic violence and gore, as well as questionable application of vigilantly justice.<br /><br />Recommended, with the above caveats.</p></body></html>

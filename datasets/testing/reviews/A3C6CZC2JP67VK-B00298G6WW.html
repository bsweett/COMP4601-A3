<meta name="summary" content="This is what happens after the life of Bond"></head><body><p>I see that it's tough for actors who play cultural icons to get work once they end that phase of their careers. George Reeves committed suicide after failing to find work after his 50's portrayal of Superman on TV. Adam West never got a good role after the campy '60's "Batman." Even Sean Connery had a period of obscurity after his James Bond period. This brings us to Pierce Brosnan, another James Bond: movie-star handsome, perfect in the role of the urbane, suave, and emotionally distant Agent 007. Brosnan tried to move beyond this typecasting with "The Tailor of Panama," but didn't quite succeed. Going to a more extreme character in "The Matador," Brosnan proves he might have a career ahead of him. He's going to need more plausible scripts, though, because none of the key plot points in "The Matador" are credible.<br /><br />I still don't know why they call it a thriller when there wasn't any tension or suspense in here. You kind of knew what was coming except, perhaps, in several instances and there wasn't much tension or suspense in those instances. One of the good aspects of this film was the decision for Brosnan to roughen up his looks. His scraggly beard, bad hair, yellowed teeth, and the wild edge in his smile make him a credible, burnt-out, hit man. Additionally, he takes to his role with gusto. His fear as he begins to have nervous breakdowns, his desperate attempts to booze and whore his way back to sanity, and his life-saving grab to make a friend out of mild-mannered, middle-class Danny, are believably pathetic. I felt twinges of sympathy for this killer going over the edge. Their initial and unlikely acquaintance is believable only because it's in Mexico. The relationship between these two males is under constantly episodic humorous tension throughout the movie which is a plus in this film. Hope Davis also turns in a fine minor performance as Kinnear's character's wife.<br /><br />The script was pretty good, the bright colors and bold cinematography and banners are reminiscent, in a good way, of Quentin Tarantino at his best. To some extent, the scenic and cinematographic movement is what gives the movie a strong sense of action as much as character movement. The plot almost feels as if it has a life independent of the characters; as if the characters are acting out a minor sequence in a bigger sweep of `Story,' which almost seems like a `Character' in itself. Sound weird? Well, I guess it is, in a way. But it sure seems to work for me. Still, it's a good buddy-flick that's worth your time but try to leave Bond out of your mind before you watch this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dramatic and Intense"></head><body><p>Black Swan is one of the most intriguing films to come out of 2010.  Natalie Portman plays the ballerina Nina Sayers, the vexing main character who is overly obsessed with perfectionism and landing the lead in a revamped version of "Swan Lake." The film is enthralling and thrilling to watch because of the dramatically intense expressions, dialogue, and sensuality displayed by each character within each particular scene.  And there is also the relentless images throughout the film that will make viewers cringe as they see Nina gripping and peeling away what appears to be a struggle between imagination and reality.<br /><br />Indeed, it is the coupling of Nina's ballerina nemesis Lily (Mila Kunis), a somewhat rock and roller type of character who adds a bit of the hard-edge elements to the film and ballet director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) who attempt to dispense the freedom that is lacking in Nina's ballet routine as well as to unleash her inexperience and insecurities so that she could play the part of the Black Swan.  But in the process, it is her own personal dilemmas, immaturity, and overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey) who appears much more as a coach rather than a nurturing figure that suggests origins of where Nina's stagnant personal and professional growth may derive from.  And as the film progresses, Nina grapples with expectations that eventually collide with her perfectionism.<br /><br />Director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler) and screenplay writers Mark Heyman and Andres Heinz are attributed to providing the artistry and intensity to the character of Nina.  What appears to be a typical storyline of an over ambitious dancer hungry to the play the lead part of the White and Black Swan within the first 30 minutes of the film, transforms to a downward spiral of hallucinogenic and psychological proportions within the last hour that are highly thought-provoking and shows Nina shockingly unraveling to deterioration right before the viewers' eyes; the climax of the film is deserving of an Academy Award nomination for Portman.<br /><br />Overall, Black Swan is a film filled with unpredictable twists and turns.  And one does not have to enjoy or have an interest of the ballet in order to understand the storyline that speaks for itself because of the artistic and dramatic contributions of the characters.  It is a film worth watching.</p></body></html>

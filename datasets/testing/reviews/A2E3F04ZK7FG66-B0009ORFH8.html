<meta name="summary" content="The best movie ever made in Pittsburgh"></head><body><p>Along with "Carnival of Souls", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.<br /><br />Many people have talked about the plot in detail before, so I won't continue to belabor the details. I will mention that the movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.<br /><br />Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, is the sole survivor of the group. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. However, in the end, as morning arrives, Ben is sitting near a window of the farmhouse as the posse that is hunting down, shooting, and burning the zombies finally arrives. Happy to see his rescuers, Ben makes a movement, hoping the posse will see him. Unfortunately they do, and they shoot him dead. The film ends with Ben's body being carried from the house and being put in a pile about to be burned. He survived the whole ordeal for nothing. This begs the question, would the posse have shot first and asked questions later had they seen a white person waving from the window? Did they automatically assume - perhaps subconsciously - that there was no good reason for a black man to be in mainly white rural Ohio and therefore just assume he was a zombie? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignor.</p></body></html>

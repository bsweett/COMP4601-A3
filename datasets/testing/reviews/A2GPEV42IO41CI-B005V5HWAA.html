<meta name="summary" content="How can a thriller be this dull?"></head><body><p>As the movie opens, Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is being honored as the Man of the Year.  A successful businessman with a loving family, Earl is  a pillar of his community.  What people don't know is that Earl has a secret:  He can't stop killing people.  He knows he's addicted to killing, but he also knows he won't stop, because the little voice in his head (William Hurt) keeps egging him on.  So, Mr. Brooks has it all - family, money, and a little hobby that makes him happy - until someone sees him commit his latest murder.<br /><br />I thought this movie would never end.  It just kept going and going and I honestly hated every minute of it.  It was so crushingly one-note, and that one note was boring.  All of the actors play it deadpan; there's no excitement or fear or drama.  It's just unremitting blandness all the way.  Costner, of course, has often been accused of being a wooden actor, but this time it isn't his fault.  His character is completely without feeling; he is actually dull. Demi Moore is featured in one of several tiresome subplots, playing the detective on Mr. Brooks' trail; she's angry, unappealing, and poker-faced.  We never learn why Mr. Brooks is a killer or why he has an alter ego talking to him all the time, and none of the storylines are resolved; the movie just ends.  Granted, there are a few scenes that made me jump, but that was because of loud noises - especially the gunshots.  Way too loud.  I kept hoping the plot would get better, but it didn't.  Too bad; it should have been great.</p></body></html>

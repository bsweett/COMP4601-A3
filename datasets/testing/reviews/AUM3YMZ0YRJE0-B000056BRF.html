<meta name="summary" content="a superlative box set of one of the great films of all time"></head><body><p>This is nothing short of a spectacular deal:  with the images newly crisp, beautiful sound, and plenty of extras, I think this is the best bluray that I have ever purchased.<br /><br />I have nothing to add about the quality of the film's theme and plot.  You identify with Ben-Hur as he goes through an extraordinary journey, both physical and spiritual; it is so emotionally real that I must struggle to keep from weeping every single time I see it.  There is action, big ideas, and psychological and spiritual growth.  No other film does this for me - I am an atheist, or a non-believing christian, if you will.<br /><br />SO far as the film print version goes, I think it is the best available.  The transfer is better than all previous versions.  The extras are fun, in particular the complete 1925 silent version that has many basic differences from the 1959 version, e.g. Simonides, Ben-Hur's loyal slave, is afraid to recognize him in the earlier version, as it will enslave his daughter Esther.  While I tire of the self-congratulatory documentaries, which are softball papp of the genre, "oh, everyone was so wonderful and talented", but there is interesting info in them as well.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  Interestingly, I got the British version, which was the equivalent of $15. (With 3 disks, I am not certain that this one has all the things that the American version does, but it has commentaries, music only tracks, outtakes, etc.  The essential, of course, is the film.  It is region 2, I believe.)</p></body></html>

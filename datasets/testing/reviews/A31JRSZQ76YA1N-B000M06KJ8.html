Wish she'd tackle Dietrich.<br /><br />Others worth viewing?  The Shearer version [also a great and timely turn by Miss Norma].<br /><br />There's always "The Affair of the Necklace" as well as the severely underrated "La Nuit de Varennes".<br /><br />..... however the old bloodlines that matter still continue [fortunately] and la petite madame de Royale did survive it all!<br /><br />QUEENS STILL RULE~~~ including the fabulous one currently on the Dutch throne!<br /><br />PS. Go for it Kiki!</p></body></html>

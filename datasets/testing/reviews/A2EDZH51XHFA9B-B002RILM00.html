<meta name="summary" content=""Desecration" is too kind a word."></head><body><p>The Wicker Man (Neil LaBute, 2006)<br /><br /> I have come to the conclusion that Nicolas Cage is a man with impeccable taste. First, obsessed with Begotten, he tabs Elias Merhige to direct Shadow of the Vampire. Then, when he wants to jump on the horror-film-remakes bandwagon, he chooses a brilliant, literate movie that easily ranks among the finest ever made.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, taste does not necessarily translate into talent. "Desecration" is far too tame a word to use for what Messrs. Cage and LaBute have done with this Wicker Man remake. I have seen a good number of the recent horror-film remakes, and I have seen a lot of them that were awful. The Wicker Man is by far the worst of the lot.<br /><br />The story remains the same: a mainland detective, Edward Malus (Cage) gets a frantic letter from one of the residents of the secluded private island Summerisle-- excuse me, SummersIsle-- stating that one of the island's young girls is missing. When he gets there, he finds an island out of time, as it were, one where the inhabitants live by their own laws. Malus fights to impose the outside world's system on theirs with increasing desperation as he tries to find the child, whom no one on the island admits even exists (save Malus' old girlfriend Willow (Chopper's Kate Beahan), the child's mother).<br /><br />What makes the original movie great is the detail Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer paid to the religion and customs of Summerisle, and how well Edward Woodward's Sgt. Howie fits into its life there-- as a strict Catholic, he understands the idea of fervent worship, and the religion presented there is a powerful temptation for him. (To go any farther with this analogy would constitute a spoiler for the original movie-- which, if you haven't seen, you must.) Everything is consistent down to the last detail, and it all fits together-- when you get to the end of the film, you realize that all that "gratuitous" shocking material was actually an integral part of the plot. None of this can be said for the remake. LaBute (who also wrote this new adaptation) replaces Howie's faith with an allergy to bees. Really. He also monkeys with the mechanics of the kid in order to, presumably, give Malus a more personal reason for trying to find the kid, and in doing so unravels a vast portion of the tapestry that holds the entire movie together-- replacing it with something so slapdash it seems they didn't even notice everything was falling apart until they were shooting, and simply had Ellen Burstyn improvise a line or two.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of Nicolas Cage's acting. Perhaps the less said about it the better, but if we was trying to convey the same intensity and duty of Sgt. Howie, he badly missed the mark. Howie's expressions of horror during the climax of the original film ring so true that it's hard to imagine a viewer questioning that, at the very least, Edward Woodward was so into the role that he really felt the disgust and despair in the exhortations he made to his God to save him. Cage's Malus, on the other hand, is laughably bad. It doesn't help that the script breaks so very, very many rules of writing decent dialogue (for the love of god, man, "ow, my legs!" was about the worst line of dialogue, given its placement, I've heard since Night of the Lepus), and that Cage overacts every one. In contrast, Ellen Burstyn's Lady SummersIsle (and the addition of that "s" may actually be the most annoying detail in the entire movie) has none of the vitality and charm Christopher Lee brought to the role of Lord Summerisle; she seemed as if she were trying to reprise some odd combination of Judi Dench's character in As Time Goes By and any given screen incarnation of Jeeves. It's absolutely pathetic, and just when Burstyn's career was undergoing a well-deserved revival.<br /><br />As for all that not-so-gratuitous explicitness, kiss it goodbye. The schoolroom scene, one of the more shocking in the entire canon of seventies film, does exist here, but as a shadow of its former self. I think LaBute stuck it in for the sole purpose of appeasing the people who were going to compare this one to the original. If so, well, frying pan, meet fire-- it would have been better without the scene altogether, and I say that as a blind, drooling devotee of Molly Parker, who plays the schoolmistress here (and would otherwise get so little screen time in the movie as to not really deserve an acting credit.) (Oh, and what was with the twin thing? Was the importance of that scene, assuming it had any, left on the cutting-room floor?).<br /><br />I could go on listing the vast catalog of reasons this is, to date, the worst movie I've seen so far this year, but what's the point? It all boils down to one thing-- avoid this mess and find a copy of the 104-minute print (the most complete available) of Robin Hardy's 1973 original, one of the finest films ever made.

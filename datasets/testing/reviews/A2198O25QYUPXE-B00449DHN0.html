<meta name="summary" content="Brutal gangs in a changing social climate"></head><body><p>"Gangs of New York" is a historical action drama film set in the mid-19th century.<br /><br />The narrative captures a time in American History where the streets of New York were essentially ruled by criminal mobs, and the hostile environment of the time is brought to life with eye-catching set and costume design.<br /><br />There are several themes presented by the story, which includes: calculated vengeance, displacement due to personal loss, and attempts to seek order in amongst the mayhem.<br /><br />The movie doesn't hold back with fierceness, and this is used as a means to convey the harshness of the story events and time period.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

I remember listening to the audiobook of Stephen King's novella when I was younger. I picked it up because it has this great cover of some tentacle reaching up under a door and boasted of a "fully surround sound experience".<br /><br />The Mist was directed by Frank Darabont who directed The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Two Stephen King books that translated very well onto the big screen. I was looking forward to another Darabont/King collaboration.<br /><br />Starring Thomas Jane (The Punisher) as David Drayton, Marcia Gay Harden (Mystic River) as the religious-crazed Mrs. Carmody, Laurie Holden (Silent Hill) as Amanda Dumfries, and William Sadler (The Green Mile) as Jim this movie was held to a strict budget and time frame which created the perfect mentality for a horror film.<br /><br />Following a freak electrical storm, a mist creeps into a small town. David and his son travel to the grocery store the next day for supplies. While there a man, bleeding from his nose, comes running in warning the people to stay away from the mist.<br /><br />The crowd looks on as the mist envelops the parking lot.<br /><br />There are those who aren't sure what to do, some who want to go home to their children, and others who think something sinister at work. Mrs. Carmody believes it's the wrath of God come upon the town for their sins. Before the end of the film, she will have converted a large following to her beliefs.<br /><br />How will anyone escape the mist? Whenever someone tries to escape to their car, they are "taken" or eaten by whatever inhabits the mist.<br /><br />There is alot of foul language in this movie and the graphic content is high as well. Plus the ending may not be what you're expecting and, depending on how you look at it, could very well upset you.<br /><br />The film makers did a fine job with what they had.

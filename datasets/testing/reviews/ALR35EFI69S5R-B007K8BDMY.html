<meta name="summary" content="Frightening Yet Absorbing Look At A Man At The Edge!"></head><body><p>One of the most troubling aspects of contemporary American culture is the way in which it seems to engender an enforced emotional estrangement from the natural world taken in its own context and substitutes solipsistic fantasies on its citizens. Thus we have nitwits so completely out of touch with the realities of the natural world beyond man's realm that they try to keep Bengal tigers as house pets, or release alligators into local ponds. Yet nowhere are the tragic consequences of such a debilitating divorce from natural reality more evident than in "Grizzly Man" an absolutely compelling, artful, and horrific cinematic look by renowned director Werner Herzog at Timothy Treadwell, a man who attempted to bridge the gap between the world of man-made artifice and the natural world of nature.<br /><br />Herzog focuses his lens and his fascinating documentary on the life and death of Treadwell, a man who leapt quite suddenly and unexpectedly from his boring and evidently stultifying suburban lifestyle to quickly and famously establish himself, literally in mid-life, as a singular personality, a self-fashioned and self-educated grizzly bear scholar, as indeed, the one man who manages successfuly to live among the bears. This is as in 'grizzly bears', the largest, most awesome, and most terrifyingly predatory mammal this since of 19th century hominads.<br /><br />For those of us raised on the over-sweet sacharrined sensibilities of Television-land's Grizzly Adams, a handsome and rugged cuss whose best buddy and constant companion is a congenial and photogenic grizzly bear named Gentle Ben, a more accurate look beyond this Hollywood confection into the terrifying reality of just how powerful a force of nature these bears represent is mind-boggling, and is done with both considerable dramatic flair and a dollap of deadly detail offering a heady if troubling glimpse into the edgy psyche of someone over-the top enough to attempt this wild-eyed venture into the habitat of the grizzly bear, a man who manages successfully to reinvent himself as a born-again naturalist-celebrity, one minute covorting on the David Letterman show and promoting his colorful monographs detailing the world of the Ursus Terribilis, and the next minute treading with abandon, panache and pluck into the lair of the bears.<br /><br />Werner Herzog directs and produces this film in a way that lays out in all its compelling complexity the remarkable irony of Treadwell's star-crossed life, someone who on one hand seems so relaxed, so knowledgable, and so lovingly concerned with the bears, and yet on the other hand appears to have been a man  whose own personal recklessness and interpretation and understanding of the natural world is somehow romanticized to an extent sufficient enough for him to suffer a fatal mauling by a bear after pitching his tent unknowingly in a grizzly feeding ground, a fact which the director obviously feels to be directly related to Treadwell's dreamy and sometimes arrogant indifference about his precariously presumptuous relationship with the bears. Substitute the term 'grizzly bear' with that of 'great white shark', and one can begin to recognize the preposterous nature of this continuing attempt to live among the bears. Without being too trite, think "Jaws" with claws, and you can understand the all-too predictable nature of his eventual mauling, murder and ingestion by a 1000 pound male grizzly bear.<br /><br />Finally, then, the author's final fate is dealt to him by the very impersonal and cruel indifference of nature that he so casually misunderstands, and one feels in viewing the film that this unoftunate end to Treadwell's life was a highly predictable event, although it seems to be an especially lurid and even sensational avenue that offers the film-goer a unique opportunity to investiage and explore the margins of Treadwell's admittedly brilliant albeit unconventional attempt to bridge the gap between the world of humans and those of the natural world. Unfortunately for the "Grizzly Man" of the title, Treadwell attempted once too often to interact on his own terms rather than those of the bears. So, while it is sometimes a bit too graphic and blood-thirsty (as when they are describing a re-creation of the six-minute plus mauling and eating of the author and his companion), it is a wonderful movie, one that serves to remind us in quite powerful terms that out in the natural world, beyond the man-made artificialities we all mistake for incontrovertible reality, there still live such terrifying creatures for whom we are nothing more substantial than the afternoon's groceries.

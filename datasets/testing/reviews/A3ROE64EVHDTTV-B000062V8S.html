<meta name="summary" content="It Was Inevitable"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Lots of great action and special effects.  It's hardly ever dull.<br />*Storyline relatively fits.<br />*Still lots of serious and lots of funny parts.<br />*Characters are not bad.<br />*The Terminatrix is an excellent enemy.  I like the fact that she combines the best of all previous terminators; it's a very systematic solution.<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not as many memorable lines.<br />*Some things in the franchise have become convuluted.  This film introduced certain elements (like John Connor having a wife) that probably should have been left out.<br />*John Connor's character is weakened.  And now that I've seen "Carnivale," I will probably always look at the actor Nick Stahl as a reluctant farm boy instead of the future leader of the resistance.<br /><br />I never expected this film to have any more action than T2, but I was ultimately surprised as to how much there was.  The first half had loads of great scenes, including one of the coolest car chases I've ever seen.  The Terminatrix impressed me as well.  The film had a fair amount of both drama and comedy.  Some parts remain ambiguous or convoluted, but still fits okay with the other films.  It's not perfect, but it is enjoyable, and for the movies, brings everything into a mostly-full circle.</p></body></html>

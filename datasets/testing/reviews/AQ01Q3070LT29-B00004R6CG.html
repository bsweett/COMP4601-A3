<meta name="summary" content="The restoration is beautiful and breath-taking."></head><body><p>This review is for the DVD version itself.  The restoration and color is beautiful.  Breath-taking.  The wide-screen is almost a full-screen.  It is not as irratating as the DVD version of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;.  Of all versions I have seen, this DVD version made me give &quot;Vertigo&quot; a second look.  Colors are important in this restored version because the color of say a door or the clothes that Kim Novak wears explains the psychological state of the character.  One of the bonuses is a fine documentary, originally seen on American Movie Classics cable network, about the films' restoration and includes new interviews with Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Roger, get  your head together, we got a lot of versions of dawn, why blu-ray?  Perfect, baby.  Perfect.""></head><body><p>One of the greatest horror films of all time, director George A. Romero's masterpiece gets the high def treatment.  Anchor bay has given the film every other kind of treatment as well, maybe not as much as the Evil dead series though.  For a film like this I really don't mind double dipping.  If your looking for extra features I'd go with the Ultimate edition which contains the U.S theatrical version, extended version, European version, and a ton of extras.  If you want the most pristine transfer go with this blu ray version.  I'd suggest both, and this blu ray title is reasonably priced when compared to other titles.<br />Another thing I've found with blu ray titles is to buy them online via Amazon or other sites, the prices in the store are even more ridiculous.<br />Most are familiar with the story's plot, zombies are taking over and we follow four survivors in there helicopter to the mall where they try to adapt and make a life for themselves.  Besides being a freaky horror film with real scares and gore it's writer/director George A. Romero using satire to make a statement in 1978 about American consumerism, people die , turn into zombies and are drawn to the mall to subconsciously walk with there zombie strut with their blank facial expressions, ready to "consume".</p></body></html>

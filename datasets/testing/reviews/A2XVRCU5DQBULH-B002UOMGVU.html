<meta name="summary" content="A legendary film..."></head><body><p>After &quot;The Godfather parts 1 and 2&quot; were released, it was hard to believe that Hollywood was ever going to produce a gangster movie that would even equal the quality of those two Hollywood gems. Enter director Martin Scorcese and actors Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta. These four made a film that not only expanded on the qualities of the first two &quot;Godfathers,&quot; but also provided different characters and situations not seen in gangster movies of old. Needless to say, it was an instant classic. The four have gone on to become film legends (though DeNiro was already there) and the film is a cherished gem in Hollywood that is still not even 20 years old. Many people cite this film as Scorcese's best, although &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; was a bit more poignant. But no one denies that this is an excellent film with imagination, scope, and a take-no-prisoners attitude. One of the coolest films ever made.</p></body></html>

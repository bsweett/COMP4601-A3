Evans' previous project behind the camera was the 1992 movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009AOBM">Kuffs</a> with Christian Slater.  After 15 years, he helms "Mr. Brooks."  Perhaps by 2022, he'll direct again.  While he did have an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for "Stand By Me" & is one of two writers for this film, the major flaw for the movie is its premise.  One cannot successfully have a main character through which the audience views the action that is a serial killer.  Whoopi Goldberg tried it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LAZ5">Homer and Eddie</a>, playing a character whose brain tumor caused her to kill.  That film didn't work either.  The fatal flaw is that you can't root for a serial killer.  Yes, Earl Brooks does TRY NOT to kill, but he isn't successful.  Trying to suggest prescriptive screenwriting, we could twist motivation where the character is killing for a higher purpose, such as a soldier in war or a patriotic spy on a mission.  The screenwriters could have shifted viewpoint and seen the movie through Tracy Atwood's eyes.  But as is, "Mr. Brooks" simply doesn't work.  It is a well-done failure, but the film does not work because of the screenwriting.<br /><br />Demi Moore may or may not have been the actress chosen if her character Tracy Atwood had been our focal point.  Moore has had some great films including the classic "Ghost" and a couple of very interesting films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NVDE">The Butcher's Wife</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006472Q">The Scarlet Letter</a>.  She even played bad girl in "Charlie's Angels."  As Tracy Atwood, she has an edge, going through a divorce.  She plays a detective who is wealthy and yet has something to prove, which causes her to catch bad guys.  One of the thrilling film sequences comes from a convict's vendetta as she is abducted in a great car chase.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is the star of the film.  As a movie star, we like to root for Kevin.  His Oscar is for Best Director for "Dances with Wolves," and we like to see him cast as the good guy.  As Mr. Brooks, he's simply too nice.  He is not the quiet guy next door.  He's the man of the year.  He heads a major business.  The part could have been written for a man bored who needs sport to add spice to his life.  Instead, we have a psychologically splintered murder addict.  The screenwriters try to make him nicer, even sending him to AA meetings.  The scariest part of his performance is when at several times he breaks out into a big laugh at something that's not funny.  Other than those few moments, he seems sane.<br /><br />William Hurt plays his alter ego Marshall that urges him to satiate his craving.  Hurt won his Best Actor Oscar back in 1985 for "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and was nominated in 2005 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQLZ0Q">A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series)</a>.  As Marshall, he is creepy.  Maybe if we'd seen Marshall enter Brooks' body and actually commit the murders, the film might have worked better.  Hurt does a good job playing someone who is not actually there.<br /><br />The supporting players do good work.  Comic Dane Cook who had the small part of George in "London" is immensely unlikable as Mr. Smith.  Marg Helgenburger who has two Golden Globe nominations for TV's "CSI" looks great as trusting wife Emma.  Danielle Panabaker from "Yours, Mine & Ours" & "Sky High" is somewhat spooky as Jane.  The film never totally lets you know if she's actually inherited her father's penchant for gore or not.  There is always a question mark.  Jason Lewis who had a small part in "The Jacket" has a cameo as Tracy Atwood's husband.  He looks good and does an adequate job in a small role.  Reiko Aylesworth who has played on several episodes of TV's "24" does a VERY nice job as Jessie's lawyer, anxious to screw Tracy Atwood financially on behalf of her client as well as some extraneous screwing around.<br /><br />From cinematography to sound, the technical aspects of the film are excellent.  It does provide a few scares along the way.  Unfortunately, while well done in many ways, it is fatally flawed because of the screenplay.  Taxi!</p></body></html>

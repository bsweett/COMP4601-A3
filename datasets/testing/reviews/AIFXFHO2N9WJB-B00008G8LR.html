Well, the search proved not to be in vain as director John McTiernan provided the perfect solution with his 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger action/monster film "Predator".<br /><br />"Predator" tells the story of a squad of commandos led by a man named Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who are sent into a Central American jungle to rescue South American officials who have been kidnapped by guerillas.  As their search goes on, the commandos discover that the guerillas may not be their greatest concern in this jungle, as they find themselves being hunted by an apparently invisible being.  As the team of commandos gets picked off one by one, Dutch eventually finds himself face-to-face with the very being responsible, a grotesque alien hunter, heavily armed with advanced war-fighting technology that is beyond anything this world has ever seen before.<br /><br />With the great success of "Predator", director John McTiernan proved himself the right man to bring Fox's newest monster franchise to life.  It is somewhat surprising that 20th Century Fox entrusted their hopes of a new franchise with McTiernan, since he had yet to truly prove himself in Hollywood (it was 1 year later when McTiernan was propelled into superstardom with his Bruce Willis actioner "Die Hard"), but even without having much experience under his belt he succeeded with flying colors.<br /><br />The story for the film is essentially summed up by the film's title "Predator", with that one word, and the fact that Arnold was the main star, most people knew that there's bound to be plenty of action to go around.  Even with all of the action in this movie, there is still plenty of story, some critics felt the plot was rather thin and that all the action covered that problem; personally I didn't feel the plot of the story was weak in any way.  I thought that the story, though not difficult to follow or extremely complicated by any means, was still entertaining and provided enough character development and substance to keep the movie from feeling like it was simply one fight after another with no real purpose.  Obviously the film's story must have had enough substance to form a groundwork mythology for these alien creatures that was spawned off into a sequel, and also into numerous books and comic books that have further expanded upon these Predators.<br /><br />The acting was good for an action film, not Oscar worthy, but these types of movies never are.  Arnold's mastery of the English language had improved from his performance in 1984's "The Terminator", at least you can understand him better, but it's by no means perfect.  The cast does well with their respective characters, some of the performances were a little over the top in places, most were clich&eacute;d, but so were their characters, and what else would you expect in an action film.<br /><br />One of the biggest praises that can be given to this movie is for the special effects work; which still hold up well to this day.  The use of infrared for the Predator's vision was a neat touch and somewhat surprising for the audience to actually be given the monster's view of the world.  Even the invisibility effect, though primitive by today's standards, was very well done when you consider that it was an effect that hadn't really been done in that way before in cinema.  The costume department did what was possibly the best job in special effects for the movie with their work on the Predator costume.  The costume was so realistic, it was clear that the creative team on this movie had payed close attention to "Alien" and "Aliens" in terms of bringing monsters to life.  Had the creative teams behind this movie not rose to the challenge set by the aforementioned movies, I don't believe the film would have been as successful with audiences.<br /><br />With all that being said, "Predator" is definitely a classic among action movies and monster movies for that matter (though this film is more action oriented), and is a film that fans of the `Alien' franchise should definitely watch.<br /><br />"Predator" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hanks at his finest..."></head><body><p>Everyone that I know either loves this movie or hates it.  They either find it completely engrossing or mind-numbingly boring.  I'm kind of in the middle.  I find it a tad long, but I find Hanks to be surprisingly riveting (I'm not always sold on his talent) and his strong performance carries the film for me.  It has to, since he is the only person on screen for nearly the entire running length.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Chuck Noland, a FED-EX systems engineer who finds himself stranded on an island for four years after the plain he is on crashes into the ocean during a terrible storm.  He survives, obviously, but the experience has a lasting effect on Chuck.<br /><br />For me, it is hard to really build a film based solely on a man's solitary survival.  There is not a whole lot you can do, and while the film's execution of Chuck's adventures are startlingly engaging, when the film ended I felt as if it was just beginning.  For me, the most intriguing aspect of this story is how Chuck survives AFTER he comes home to find the life he left behind a mere memory.  Yes, his escapades on the island are necessary to establish growth and that survival instinct (and the way that Zemeckis films the island itself perfectly establishes to `gravity' of the whole experience) but when all is said and done, this is about how this experience CHANGES a person, and I feel like we only witnessed to very beginning of that change.<br /><br />Alas, I still really like this movie.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Tom Hanks is not an actor I am usually drawn to.  I find a lot of his work highly overrated and even gimmicky and amateurish (his two Oscar wins themselves are disgusting) but here he transcends gimmick (I mean, this is a gimmicky character) and develops a REAL man.  He commands the screen 100% of the time, and never resorts to taking advantage of the situation, but sells himself the entire time.  This is a powerhouse performance, one that rises in the ranks with me the more I see it.  I think that Hanks' performance is also a reason why I hate the ending of the film.  He was doing such a riveting job that I really wanted him to sink his teeth into Chuck's `afterlife' SOOOOO much (no, he doesn't die...by afterlife I meant `life after his rescue').<br /><br />If I could reshoot or reedit this film I would be so happy.<br /><br />Anyways, in the end `Cast Away' is a very good film.  It has been mentioned (and I agree) that this film lacks a tad of the emotional punch (emotional `human' punch) that it tries to convey, but I feel that that punch would have been achieved had Chuck's story continued.</p></body></html>

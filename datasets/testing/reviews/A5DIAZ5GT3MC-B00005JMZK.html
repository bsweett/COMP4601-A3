Predator" is the people who have to sit through it than they certainly should be rewarded for honesty. Fox's latest attempt to cash in on the success of dueling movie icons that caught on with last summer's "Freddy Vs. Jason" could not be more shameless and embarassing if they added Jim Varney's Ernest character to the mix. I can say from the very start that I wasn't expecting this extraterrestrial grudge match to be anything special, especially considering its "PG-13" rating but despite my low expectations, this one talk "bad" to a whole other level.<br /><br />"Alien Vs. Predator" involves a billionare who hires a team of random weirdos to go on an exploration of an Antartic pyramid. As it turns out, the title creatures are waiting for them. The Predators, a team of alien hunters who use invisible cloaking as a camoflauge are the first to attack. Anderson more or less recyles all of the killings from "Predator 2" but waters them down to the point where you feel like you're watching a bad made-for-cable movie. He also seems to conviently throw in new ideas for both creatures that lack any logic whatsoever. The "aliens" in this film seem to grow in minutes while in every other "Alien" film, it took many hours. Subsquently, while in the past, the Predator almost never came out of camoflauge during its hunts until the final act of the film, it seems to like to give away its locations at inappropraite times to give its human counterparts a chance to escape and its less-technical enemy a fair chance to kill it.<br /><br />Speaking of the humans, if there were ever a more boring set of characters thrown together for a monster movie, I certainly have never seen it. Sanaa Lathan's female hero is no Sigourney Weaver and it's amazing that despite all the damage she takes, she doesn't seem to have a scratch on her. She is punted like a football across the pyramid by the Predator but manages to run away after and even parades around in zero-degree weather in a T-shirt. Of course, all the characters are given pointless backstory that has nothing to do with the story at all. Ewen Bremner's obnoxious character in particular can't shut up about his two children. Even the reliable Lance Henriksen is all over the place as Charles Bishop Weyland (a "wink at the camera" homage to his android character from the Alien movies).<br /><br />"Alien Vs. Predator" isn't just a traditional bad movie, it is bad on an epic level. The first act is tired and dragged out with the characters explaining all of the pointless elements of the plot for about forty-five minutes. The second act has the humans, Predators, and aliens going at it with one another with no regard for logic, the series mytholigy, or good filmmaking. Not only are trademark elements and characterstistics from both series either toned down for the MPAA or just all together thrown out the window but Anderson manages to come up with his own cheesy rules for both. By the third act, anyone who loved both or either series has either gone crazy and walked out of the theatre or just begun to laugh out loud. I opted for the latter. Without giving away anything, I will say that the concluding act of this movie is so outrageously ridicilous that I honestly think Anderson just gave up and let his nine-year-old son write it. Think "Jaws: The Revenge". By the time the movie has ended, we are treated to a Queen Alien that moves like the T-Rex from the "Jurrasic Park" movies, a Predator that seems more like a poor clone of the ones used in the other films, and a sequence where face-huggers dive out in "bullet time".<br /><br />You don't need to have seen any of the "Alien" or "Predator" movies to watch this (apparently Anderson didn't when he wrote it) but it helps in enjoying the all-out rape of both franchises. Paul Anderson got a lot of negative criticism before this film came out for being a hack. I felt a lot of it was unfair as "Mortal Kombat" and "Resident Evil" (both of which he directed) were at least slightly entertaining. After watching his work as both a writer and directer on this project, I am starting to understand why there was such a collective moan from many fanboys across the world when he was signed on for this one. Fox will end up being the real winners here as they stand to make a great deal of loot off this embarassing mess of a movie.</p></body></html>

Burton is a creative director with an eye for whimsy and colorful as well as strange and macabre-but you feel none of that when watching Alice in Woderland. Yes it is vivid and full of color and wonky shaped objects fill every screen-but it never really resonates with you. There is no mystery or 'wow' factor. It's sort of pretty to look at, but that's all it is.<br /><br />The actual story is a tad confusing as well as you're not really sure if you are watching a sequel to anything or a retelling. It just feels sort of hasty and rushed in certain parts. There is no flow or direction and then your at the end of the film and it all just feels...strange. And speaking of strange, I just found the ending (after she leaves Wonderland) really weird and pointless, unless I missed something entirely while watching the very beginning.<br /><br />In regards to characters and acting, Helena Bonham Carter is the star of this production, by far. She's crazy, delusional and utterly perfect in this role. Even hearing "off with their head!" didn't get stale after so long. Johhny Depp as the Mad Hatter was a dissapointment. He's supposed to be loony, but there are times when you think he knows exactly what he's doing. His accent is distracting and overall, I just wasn't feeling the performance. Anne Hathaway has a short but cute part as the White Queen, the evil Queen of Heart's sister. It's slightly over the top but works for her. As for the Alice herself, played by Mia Wasikowska, well to be honest, I barely remember her. She was very passive and bland throughout the entire film and didn't really emote , well, anything. I can't review this film properly without including Mr. Alan Rickman...He plays Caterpillar, of course, and though his role is very small, it is also quite enjoyable. It's amazing what that man does with his voice. He flawlessy goes from berating to indifferent to sarcastic all in the span of a sentence. Just brilliant.<br /><br />All in all I was dissapointed. What should have been a slam dunk for Burton turned out to be a bore-fest. All the ingredients are there-but he just didn't cook up a good one this time around...</p></body></html>

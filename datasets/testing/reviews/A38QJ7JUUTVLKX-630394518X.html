It's a mix between a murder mystery, crime drama, suspense film, and horror film. Yes this is a slasher film, this is a body count film. This is a slasher film with class. Director David Fincher doesn't want his audience to be comfortable for a moment while watching "Seven." Shaky camera shots, dark sets and a disturbing script that takes its characters to the extremes of emotion all contribute to the film creating a unsettled feeling that stays with you for a couple hours after the credits roll. The first time I watched this, I didn't like it, but that is because I wasn't really paying attention to it, and the sound and color on my t.v. wasn't working right. Anyway, the film begins with the overused premise of a young cop (Brad Pitt) being teamed for a murder investigation with an veteran on the verge of retirement. The two quickly develop a tense disrespect for each other, Pitt being the cocky smartass type and Freeman the hardened, pessimist New Yorker who has seen it all. Their investigation of a bizarre murder, in which an obese man is forced to eat himself to death, turns into a hunt for a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins -- gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath as his calling card. The second victim, a rich lawyer, is the not-so-subtle tip off "greed" is written in blood on his carpet. What gives "Se7en" it's unsettling impact is the way the film connects deeply with each character, even the victims who are never seen alive. Freeman, Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife are all in top form here and the audience comes to know them intimately whatever affects them, affects the viewer equally. This is especially true of Pitt, whose character struggles to maintain his optimism in the face of the horrors he sees. The killer is played, by a well-known actor who is not named in the opening credits (the producers want to keep his identity a surprize), with a calm but explosive demeanor conspicuously reminiscent of "Silence of the Lambs." The tension is so well played that even though the unsatisfying conclusion becomes obvious a good 15 minutes before the climax, it doesn't diminish at all. Because of the way it assaults the emotions, seeing "Se7en" should not be taken lightly, and must be taken seriously to fully appreciate the film. This film has good acting, excellent script and a chilling soundtrack. I recommend buying or renting this film today, and watch it alone in the dark.</p></body></html>

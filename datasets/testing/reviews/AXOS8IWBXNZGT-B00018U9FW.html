It stars Jack Black and Joan Cusack, with some cameos from some folks you'll recognize, and some talented kid actors. I was actually pleasantly surprised by this film. With Jack Black, one has this preconception that it's going to be over the top, but the film is rather understated. Essentially this is the story of an out-of-money rocker, who poses as his teacher friend and substitutes at an exclsuive school in order to earn some cash. He ends up turning his young class into a rock music class, teaching the kids about rock, and forming them into a band as a class project. Along the way, he becomes a better person, though it's only apparent in the little touches along the way...and he makes his students realize their potential as well. When his cover is blown, all heck breaks loose, but the band goes on to compete in the local Battle of the Bands anyways.</p></body></html>

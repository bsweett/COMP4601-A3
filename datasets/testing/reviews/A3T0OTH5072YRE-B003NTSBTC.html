<meta name="summary" content="Shutter Island"></head><body><p>I had only seen small previews of this movie and had never really paid attention to it or had an interest in seeing it.  However, when it was on the discount rack at the local movie store I decided to give it a try.  Directed by Martin Scorsese it should have been a good movie.  And while it wasn't too bad, I'd rate it a high average compared to some of his other excellent works.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, an FBI agent who has been sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of one of the inmate/patients there.  You see, Shutter Island is home to the Ashecliff hospital for the criminally insane.  Most of the people sent there never leave and are too dangerous to hold near the general population.  In fact, the woman who disappeared is accused of murdering her three children by drowning them in the lake.  His partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) is along to help him solve the case.  The problem is, things keep going from bad to worse when they start suspecting that no one wants this case solved after all.  Not a single person is being helpful and Daniels starts to suspect that the head psychiatrist (Ben Kingsley) is out to make sure he never leaves the island and expose their deadly secret.<br /><br />There is a lighthouse on the island and this is where Daniels thinks they are doing horrific experiments.  The head psychiatrist Dr. Cawley claims they only use medicine and therapy, but Daniels believes they are doing lobotomies in this horrible place as well.  He is determined to get to the bottom of it even though when the missing woman is found there is no reason for him to stay on the island.  However, strange things keep happening to Daniels (his dead wife keeps haunting his dreams) and he can only hope he won't fall into the madness that is Shutter Island.<br /><br />DiCaprio does a good job in this movie.  He's believable and while he does come on as an incompetent character sometimes (only because he couldn't hear me screaming at him to get out of there!) he plays a pretty deep complex character and does fair job of getting the nuances just right. As a whole I'm not a big fan of DiCaprio as I think its too easy to remember his previous films when he's acting and that can be mildly distracting. His partner doesn't have much of a part aside from a few side things so I didn't really feel I had enough background to critique his part in the movie.  Kingsley is always fantastic and it was great that he easily made the watcher suspicious of him from the get go.<br /><br />There was quite a bit of music in this movie and it does have an impressive score.  That said, it wasn't my type of music and therefore wasn't very memorable for me.  The genre of the music was mainly classical.<br /><br />An interesting premise. but it can be quite predictable at time.  Because of this I really didn't feel surprise at the end and some of the scenes in the movie could get quite boring as they were trying to build story without anything happening.  Definitely three stars, it wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent either.  I did enjoy the locale of the movie as well, it was hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010</p></body></html>

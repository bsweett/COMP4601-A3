<meta name="summary" content="Not great but more watchable than Hannibal"></head><body><p>Hannibal Rising can best be described as disturbing, gruesome and totally insane. It's also well made and creepy. Gaspard Ulliel plays Hannibal Lector who wants revenge on starving soldiers who ate his little sister right in front of him when he was young. Once he starts killing he starts to enjoy it a little too much.<br /><br />  The movie plays a little like Batman Begins. He gets some training in the way of the sword. Then all of a sudden he's ready to be a killer and it comes easy to him. "Spoiler", he kills a guy that disrepects a woman he has feelings for. She's even a bit out there, she acts as if receiving the head is like getting a dosen roses and says "you shouldn't have done this for me".<br /><br />  Things like that are a bit silly but Gaspard Ulliel still does a good job carrying the movie as Hannibal Lector even if he is no Anthony Hopkins. His expressions basically make his performance though. He has fun in the movie playing Hannibal and throwing out one-liners here and there. But I doubt viewers will have as much of a good time with all the over the top violence. So for that I can only mildly recommend this movie. Also eventhough Gaspard faired well as Hannibal, I rather see Anthony Hopkins back one more time to make a better movie than Hannibal. I know there's Red Dragon but I rather see another sequel than a prequel.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Riveting, sensational, and horrific"></head><body><p>As advertised (and Academy-awarded) this movie contains a brilliant, startling and sensational performance by Charlize Theron as the true-life prostitute/serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Theron is over the top yet at the same time so totally controlled that her character is beautifully--if horrifically--realized.  Opening as a much-abused street hooker who is treated like trash by almost everybody, Theron morphs "Lee" into a swaggering, macho murderess in a manner sure to chill many viewers straight to the bone.  Yet all the while Theron conveys the vulnerability of a tragically twisted person who was never loved, only beaten, raped and tossed aside.  The sordidness of her life and the hopelessness of her future are indelibly etched upon our memory.<br /><br />Much of the credit for this once in a lifetime performance must go to director Patty Jenkins who also wrote the script, which is itself quite a sensation.  Jenkins books no compromise with propriety or with the audience's sensitivities.  She rubs our face in Aileen's dehumanized life as a street hooker picked up by strangers who treat her like filth and abuse her in ways that are unspeakable.  Central to the irony of the film is the fact that her life is that of a likely serial killer victim herself, since women who ply their trade in such a way are most vulnerable to sadistic attacks.  But "Lee," inspired by her passionate and first-in-a-lifetime love for Selby, her mousy lesbian girl friend, played with sly and sneaky sparkle by Christina Ricci, turns the tables on the sickies who pick her up and finds a measure of short-lived empowerment by blowing the johns away with a large revolver.<br /><br />Jenkins uses quick and deft strokes to establish who and what Aileen is, and just as deftly establishes Selby as the church-going wallflower at the local same-sex bar.  Jenkins's technique thrusts the viewer headlong into the story as Aileen drags herself out of the rain and into the bar to meet Selby who immediately latches onto her.  Quickly they become friends, and then in a compelling and entirely convincing scene, fall in love while roller skating.  This is followed by a steamy alley engagement in which both "Lee" and Selby discover their wild passion for one another.  Both scenes are among the best of their type that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Although Theron got the major share of the glory for the success of this movie, and Jenkins most of the credit, Ricci was not far behind.  Her character too is etched in my mind.  How wonderfully cast were the two, the one physical and manlike, the other weak, naive and femme.  And how lifelike the chemistry and how tragic the conjoining.<br /><br />Yes, this is an American tragedy thurbo'ed up for sensation-seeking audiences, presented with relentless views of violence and sensuality, featuring humanity at its most debased.  So over-the-top were some of the scenes that I found myself unaccountably laughing in surprise at the sheer hutzpa of Jenkins's savage treatment.<br /><br />Be forewarned that this movie leaves little to the imagination, and when it does, it makes sure you know exactly what depravity you are to imagine.  As such I would not recommend that anyone with delicate sensibilities view it.  It is a study of the character of two women who find first love and first real passion together, but it is so thoroughly laced with violence and depravity that for many that love will become nothing more than ignoble animal lust.<br /><br />See this for both Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, two of cinema's most gifted young actresses.</p></body></html>

The character of vengeful Blake could be scarier with modern prosthetics, and the deadly fog that sneaks in on the townspeople could be more atmospheric with today's special effects. Revolution Studios seems to have thought the same way, but sadly something went terribly wrong while making the film itself.<br /><br />What is wrong? The answer is clear. That is the film's incoherent storytelling, which made me dizzy while watching it. The original's story about the ghosts seeking revenge remains intact, and the film presents how they show up at the quite seaside town (or an island ... whatever) shrouded in a fog. So far, it's good, but the problem is how to tell this story.<br /><br />Apparently the fog is so whimsical that it appears and disappears without particular logics behind its random actions. It can sneak into a kitchen, but not a fridge. It can turn a human into a mummy-like corpse in a second, but it uses that trick not much, because it seems to know that the CGI is costly. The lack of consistent logics just helps make the film scare-free.<br /><br />Slow and sleep-inducing pace of the film only makes us realize the impossibility of the film's plot. In horror films I usually don't expect much from the characters, but the behaviors of them here are incredibly stupid. If you find a video camera that might prove your friend is not a killer, you won't hide it from the police and give it to your girlfriend. Forget the law of physics here. If your car crashes, overturning several times before finally plunging into the sea, you would get seriously hurt. Not in this film, because of the driver happens to be the star of the film.<br /><br />New version of `The Fog' is not scary. Well, the original was not that scary, but it was moody and stylish. They certainly did change some part of the original, but none of the changes make sense. So ... why did they remake it?</p></body></html>

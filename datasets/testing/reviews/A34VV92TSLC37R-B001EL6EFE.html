In fact, this computer-animated feature had the least amount of adult humor of any other one I've seen.  The only character that is really funny on their own is Mehlman the Giraffe, voiced by David Schwimmer.  And the only reason he's funny is because his character has a gimmick.  There are a few funny moments throughout, and the pack of lemurs are fairyl entertaining, but there really was no story at all, and the animation wasn't all that great compared to recent features.<br /><br />I'm sure children love this film, but for me it was the same old schtick, different title.</p></body></html>

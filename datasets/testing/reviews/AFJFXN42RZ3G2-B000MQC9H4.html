<meta name="summary" content="The Joy of Company"></head><body><p>The Holiday is this season's romance comedy.  No doubt, the main premise of the film involves the ups and downs of being in relationships.  Kate Winslet (Iris Simpkins) and Cameron Diaz (Amanda Woods) star in the movie along with Jude Law (Graham) and Jack Black (Miles).  The film has two major storylines, but the majority of the film intermingles Iris and Amanda's personal predicaments, that emphasize the meaning of friendship and the pleasure of being in the presence of great company.<br /><br />The film runs a little over two hours with much detail.  The movie takes viewers on a transcontinental trip that crosses from the picturesque and almost Thomas Kinkade-like wintry English village scene where Iris resides to Amanda's posh Beverly Hills surroundings.  The women decide to exchange living quarters in order to heal from dysfunctional relationships.  But the comic relief comes from Amanda's character who never seems to escape from her job as a movie trailer producer because throughout her uncompromising situations, she worries too much and her worries play out like movie trailers.  The only odd part of the film involves the storyline, which involves Iris befriending retired screenwriter, Arthur Abbott (Eli Wallach).  Nevertheless, the surprising and touching part of the film comes at the end with Jude Law's character.<br /><br />The Holiday is one of those films to sit back and relax to.  There are a lot of laughs as well as tugging at the heartstrings.  If you enjoyed Love Actually or Bridget Jones's Diary, and films that add a little seasonal atmosphere, you may like The Holiday.</p></body></html>

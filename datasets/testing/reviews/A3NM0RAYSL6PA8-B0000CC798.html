<meta name="summary" content="Pleasing effort, but many small and not so small flaws."></head><body><p>I thought the first X-Men movie was a mess.  I liked bits of it, particularly Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, and some of scenes were electrifying, including the "cage" match and the train sequence where Magneto lifts Wolverine into the air and gives him a stretch.  What was wrong with it?  Tone deaf story-telling, for one.  I'd come to expect that from Bryan Singer.  After watching Apt Pupil, I had low expectations about his ability to know a plot hole if it smacked him in the head.  I was right.  The dialogue was mainly lame, as well.  Add to that a rather stupid story with inexplicable inconsistencies.<p>But enough of X-Men the first.  What of this effort?  It's a better movie.  Significantly so.  It still has big problems, and small ones (like Wolverine standing in the frozen tundra and exhaling with no "breath" to be seen).  But the dialogue is at various times snappy, funny, and energetic.  There must have been a new screenwriter involved, because X-2 has no lines that make you want to burst out laughing.  (Remember in X-Men when Storm and Toad have a dreadful exchange about the effects of lightning?)  The lightness of some of the lines provides a terrific counterpoint to dramatic and intense evil that the film depicts.  I, frankly, never expected a menace as dark and deep as Stryker and company, nor did I expect the fascinating twist at the end.  Frankly, one of the things that was missing from X-Men was a depiction of the vainglorious side of Magneto, in which his pride and arrogance go hand in hand with almost god-like powers.  This is a truly "magnetic" persona, one who can call and army of followers with his grand ideas and charisma.  McKellan does a star turn in this one (even though he still can't help but mumble some lines).<p>Jackman, as expected, is terrific (although his hair looks just plain stupid in some of the scenes--in what appears to be an effort to mimic the comic books; it isn't the hair so much as the silly appearance that detracts from the scenes).  Anna Paquin is as insufferable and whiny as in the first film.  Rebecca Romijn does a really great, nuanced performance as Mystique (not to mention a drop dead gorgeous scene where she appears as herself, without the blue skin).  Alan Cumming is wonderful as Nightcrawler, who comes across as closest to the selfless superhero mold.  And Aaron Stanford gets an honorable mention as a terrific Pyro.  Brian Cox makes a formidable villain.<p>I could run through the story problems--there are a few--and the fact that this movie could have been so much better.  But, I'm content to leave those points unmentioned.  Go in for a roller coaster ride with interesting plot twists, fun lines, and some great performances.  And then, for me, say a prayer that Halle Berry and Anna Paquin don't make it into X-3.  That, alone, would improve the franchise immeasurably.</p></body></html>

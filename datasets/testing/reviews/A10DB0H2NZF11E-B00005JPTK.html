<meta name="summary" content="A Good Movie but Not Great - Worth the Rental"></head><body><p>OK, this movie was pretty good but, not great. Oh...it was CREEEEPY!  :)<br /><br />Will Smith does a great job of acting (5 stars for him)<br /><br />The plot is good - kept us engaged but, somebody dropped the ball. There were a few things that would have made the movie much better like showing how smart the "mutants" were, more flashbacks etc. 20 more minutes would have solved this. (4 stars)<br /><br />Special effects were...."so so". (3 stars). The mutants were obviously CGI and not believable.</p></body></html>

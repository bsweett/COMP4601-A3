<meta name="summary" content="Indy is still THE MAN!!"></head><body><p>As Steven Spielberg observes in the bonus matter, the fourth Indy film almost never got made at all, and we probably have Harrison Ford to thank for the fact that it did.  Ford, 66 when the movie came out, is a little heavier now, a little softer around the jawline, a little grizzled, but he clearly shows that he still has what it takes to recreate one of his most beloved characters.  The year is 1957, and Indy, after a distinguished career in World War II (he served in the OSS and attained the rank of Colonel) and several "years spyin' on the Commies," is kidnapped by a task-force of Russians headed up by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett in an inky-black Prince Valiant haircut) to help them find a set of "mummified remains" which he helped study 10 years earlier (most viewers will guess at its connection to the famous "Area 51" case, and indeed the warehouse the gang crashes is so emblazoned; one wonders if the Ark of the Covenant is in there too).  Though he's unable to prevent them from getting away with their swag, Indy soon finds himself drawn back into the case when a motorcycle-riding youngster who calls himself Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) approaches him and explains that his foster father (John Hurt), an old schoolmate of Indy's, has disappeared into the jungles of South America in a bid to return a mysterious artifact to its proper resting place.  Mutt's mother is also among the missing, and he fears she and Prof. Oxley are in danger.  Which they are, because Spalko and her followers aren't just looking for remains.<br /><br />Reuniting Ford, Spielberg, George Lucas, Karen Allen, John Williams, and various other key figures in the Indy saga, this may be the best of the entire series.  There are so many fantastic scenes I can't even begin to decide which was my favorite, yet none of them have the grue of Satipo's death or the melting Nasties, I mean Nazis, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a>.  The pace barely lets up for a moment--there are just enough quieter moments to give you a chance to catch your breath between crises--and the SFX are, of course, incomparable.  You may also want to read the novelization<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545007011">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a> and buy the soundtrack CD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171MNM4">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>.</p></body></html>

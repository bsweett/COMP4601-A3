<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good"></head><body><p>I am normally hesitant about a remake.  I held my breath when read that the original Korean edition, Il Mare was going to have a Hollywood makeover.  Whilst the original movie was good, it got some bits that remained unresolved and probably would have been done better.  I'm pleased to say that this Hollywood version made the transition smoother & more cohesive.  Supporting cast is outstanding.  Special features of the movie was the extended outtakes that weren't used.  Highly recommended for the romantic hearts out there.</p></body></html>

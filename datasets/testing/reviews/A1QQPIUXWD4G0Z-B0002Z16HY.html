A gripping film based mostly on the memories of Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara.) An outstanding yet harrowing film showing the final stage in Hitler's realization that his megalomanic dream of a Greater Germany was in its final throes.<br /><br />The film follows Adolph Hitler's (Bruno Ganz) mind as he ponders on what to do in the face of certain defeat. The film shows how Hitler continued with his typical hysterics in ordering his generals to fight to the death and not retreat one inch; how he ordered Speer and others to destroy all infrastructure in Germany; how he had little interest in evacuating the citizens of Berlin arguing that they had brought this upon themselves; and, that the only Germans who would be left would be the weak ones who were worthy only of death. The film correctly shows how Hitler vascillated between these extreme maniacal and paranoid fits to being briefly sympathetic with others who were with him. The most interesting is to see Hitler's relationship with his devoted henchmen, Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and Himmler(Ulrich Noethen.) One can clearly see that each of them were complete sociopaths who had absolutely no grasp of reality at that point. Even Himmler's idea to settle a peace with the US was senseless as neither the US or USSR had any need to negotiate a conditional peace at this late hour. Perhaps the most convincing demonstration of their insanity is when Goebbels and his wife decide to murder all of their children on the basis that a world without Nazism isn't worth living in. The film presents Albert Speer in a favorable light in his refusal to obey Hitler's sabotage orders but doesn't really delve into his previous dealings as Reich Minister for Armaments for which he was sentenced 20 years in Nuremberg. The film is also rather light as to the atrocities committed by the Soviets in their siege of Berlin. The most touching perhaps were the parts showing fanatical Hitler Youth or other children fighting in block-to-block engagements against Soviet T-34 tanks and infantry closing in on the city. As this a German film, all of the details of the period were closely followed in terms of clothing, mannerisms, etc. As the film shows, most of the German soldiers at that point were equipped with the Sturmgewehr, the first modern assault-rifle to be used in war: Kalashnikov was a tank crewman during that time and took one of these rifles back to Russia with him and modeled the AK-47 after it.<br /><br />This is a great film as it is depressive. The scenes in the damp bunker with sounds of pounding artillery above certainly gives one the impression that the end is coming closer and closer. The scene where Eva Braun is celebrating and dancing while the Soviets are less than 1 Km away from the Reichstag is quite surreal. The acting in this film was top knotch and the screenplay is faithful to the events that transpired in those last few days of April in 1945. I strongly recommend it.</p></body></html>

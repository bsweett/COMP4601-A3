<meta name="summary" content="Story of an unlikely hero-lover and a cad."></head><body><p>Sideways is a romp of two aging baby boomers cutting loose in wine country in Northern California. This unlikely duo, Miles and Jack, sets out to enjoy the last days of Jack's bachelorhood.<br /><br />Miles is a soft, balding, middle school English teacher with aspirations to be a published author. Jack is an aging actor whose career had declined to doing voice-over bit parts. Jack's character is a caricature of the glory-bound hunk of yesteryear; an incorrigible skirt-chasing, on-the-prowl predator. Miles is the alter ego: intellectual, nerdy, wallflower type. The only thing that seems to unite them is having been college roomates freshman year. Two more unlikely friends would be hard to find.<br /><br />Therein lies the story. The relationship of these two and the people they meet take twists and turns toward the inevitable. Sort of.<br /><br />The film is set against a backdrop of California wine country and wine becomes a metaphor for their lives. There are some funny, moments - "If anyone orders merlot, I am leaving!" - and touching scenes of life, love, and treachery.<br /><br />warning: male nudity</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Way better than Flags and a good war film overall"></head><body><p>To be honest, I was enthused to see Letters but not completely excited. I thought its companion Flags of Our Fathers was a dramatically empty war film that seemed manipulative as it was banal. Everyone was saying how great Letters From Iwo Jima was and while I knew it had to be better than Flags, I was curious as to the extent on how better it was. I sometimes find Clint Eastwood films (aside from Unforgiven) to be a little too emotionally distant and a bit too calculated. While a couple of points knock Letters down from being a classic war film, it's still better than anything since Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai, Batman Begins) plays Koribayashi, a General stationed on island Iwo Jima during World War II. American forces are quickly approaching the island in hopes of taking it over and it doesn't help that the Japanese forces on the island are quite outnumbered and lack of support from the mainland makes things worse. Saigo is a young soldier who's not as battle-hardened and like many of the soldiers, he wants to get back to his wife and baby. But when 2 governments say war must go on, how do you end up stopping something you don't even want to be in in the first place?<br /><br />I have to get the negative out of the way. The film has a slight sluggish pace to it. Even though we get scenes of character development as well as war scenes, the whole vibe feels a little bit more serious and maybe not as accessible. Ever watch a movie that just feels long? That's kind of what this felt like. Even though longer movies like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now were lengthy, they never once felt their length whereas this film you get the feeling the world slowed down a tad. Granted, it is a war film and it's not meant to be some popcorn fun, when you consider films about war being better paced, you kind of notice it here.<br /><br />One problem I always have with Paul Haggis scripts (Million Dollar Baby, Flags and notably Crash) is just how fleshed out the characters feel. His and other scripts by other writers have what I call "plot puppets": characters that don't really live and breathe that we care for but rather just tools to say dialogue and deliver dramatic scenes without the emotional backing to support it. Letters corrects that very problem Flags suffered from and we feel a lot more for these soldiers this time. Maybe it was that film's more recognizable cast or maybe here they just feel more complex than the other film.<br /><br />Even though it's about an entirely different conflict, it's hard not to compare Letters to Spielberg's Private Ryan, what with the color desaturation but you can make a case that this is probably one of the better crafted war films lately.</p></body></html>

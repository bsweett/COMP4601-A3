<meta name="summary" content="Good except for the Ending"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the movie. The sets and scenary were beautiful. The acting was excellent. Tom Cruise created a complex character. The battle scenes were reminscent of Braveheart. The comparison to &quot;Dancing with Wolves&quot; is fairly accurate. Both movies argue the thesis that other cultures are inherently superior morally and spiritually to the spiritually bankrupt Western European/United States culture. There was a lot of spurting blood. The fight scene between ninjas and Samurai was good.  <p>The clash of cultures was interesting. I do not know enough about the history of this period to judge its historical accuracy. I know the broad strokes were true. The Japanese Emperor hired Civil War veterans to modernize his armies and the Emperor had to put down the Ronans because they refused to modernize. There are probably far better Japanese movies of the period. <p>My main gripe about the movie was the ending. The movie went on too long. I enjoyed the movie, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.</p></body></html>

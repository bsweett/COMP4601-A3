<meta name="summary" content="Fear captured in a bottle and exposed to the light..."></head><body><p>Before Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser became household names (well, maybe Diesel is the only `household' name, but the others are at least bigger stars now) they all starred together in `Pitch Black', another title in the vast sea of science fiction action horror films.  What sets `Pitch Black' apart from the rest of the pack though is the way director David Twohy is able to create a true sense of dread and misery, a feat much like Scott created with `Alien'.  Instead of just randomly giving the audience high amounts of gore Twohy instead builds a slow yet steady dissention into genuine fear.<br /><br />`Pitch Black' finds a group of space traveler's crash landing on a deserted planet that is scorching hot thanks to the presence of three suns.  Amongst these travelers is a very dangerous criminal known as Riddick who is being transported by drug addict cop William J. Johns.  When Riddick escapes custody shortly after their crash landing, the crew believes they are in grave danger.  They are right; danger lurks right around the corner, but that danger is far graver than Riddick alone.  The crew soon realizes that this lifeless planet is on the verge of a total eclipse, and the creatures that are waiting to come out upon nightfall are ravenous and looking to feast.<br /><br />I remember when I first saw `Pitch Black' is was put off.  I was expecting a high octane action film with large amounts of gore and special effects.  `Pitch Black' is not like that though.  The film is more along the lines of `Alien' than `Jurassic Park'.  This is a film about fear and suspense as apposed to bloodshed and over stylized creatures.  Don't get me wrong, there is a high body count and there are some very interesting and effective looking aliens but they are not the focus.  In fact, you don't even get a good look at the aliens until halfway through the movie, and the actual `action' sequences of the film don't hit until the film is about the end, but the constant feeling of dread follows you from the opening of the film until the credits begin to roll; and then some.<br /><br />There is a scene when the group is traveling across the barren planet in the dense darkness with just a dim light guiding them and keeping them safe from the imposing creatures.  In that scene we can see the aliens crowding at the outskirts of that light, keeping just far enough away for not be bothered yet close enough to make their presence known.  That scene defines well the overall feel of this film.  As the audience we know that death is right around the corner, just beyond our line of vision.<br /><br />The acting is actually very well done here.  Vin Diesel is obviously built for action films, but he demonstrates a decent understanding of character development, allowing his rough exterior to give way to a nicely crafted criminal who is understandable and believable.  I think that Cole Hauser has a decent chance at becoming a great movie star.  I see that potential in him, although I am let down by his consistently mediocre selection of film projects.  Here he is outstanding as the drug-riddled cop Johns and delivers my favorite performance in the film.  Radha Mitchell has turned into the best actor of the bunch.  Her performance here as ship captain Carolyn Fry is strong and respectable, but what she's done with her career since is even more commendable.  Her strong performances in `Finding Neverland', `Man on Fire' and most notably Woody Allen's `Melinda and Melinda' have proven her to be a very reliable actress who is moments from `household name' status.<br /><br />In the end I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoy `Pitch Black'.  While I was turned off upon my initial viewing (I was young and na?ve and expecting something different) upon subsequent viewings `Pitch Black' surpasses what one could hope for and becomes a above average sci-fi film that is effectively horrifying and memorably satisfying.</p></body></html>

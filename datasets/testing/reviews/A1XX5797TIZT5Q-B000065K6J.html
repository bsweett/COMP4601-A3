<meta name="summary" content="Ridiculous, badly written and directed."></head><body><p>Writer/director James Wong (The One) helped make the first Final Destination, with its far-stretching premise and myriad of coincidences, work with a clear internal logic.  More important, the first film was able to create characters you cared about, so that their impending doom made for some great nail-biting moments.<p>Final Destination 2 goes to show that the concept in the hands of lesser talents pretty much falls apart under its own weight.  The scripting is just ridiculous, especially in the last 20 minutes when everything seems to happen with no orchestration whatsoever.  Characters make up conclusions that make no sense, and director David R. Ellis is so preoccupied with designing cool-looking visuals that fully three quarters of the cast look like they came straight out of their first week of acting school.  Lead actress A.J. Cook may be pretty -- she looks like a young Kimberly Williams -- but she spends so much of the film whimpering and crying that the character remains a blank, with none of her actions generating either character growth or catharsis.  Ali Larter brings some spark reprising her role as Clear Rivers, but the character is also a flatline after her first 10 minutes.  I'm not surprised that director Ellis' C.V. is filled with stunt credits.  Most of the stunts in this film do look pretty good, but without any character sympathy to speak of, there is no emotional stake to all the violence.  You see a lot of explicit gore (impaled heads -- two of them; a Robocop-style human pancake; incineration in a close-up; a human tri-section with intestines showing), but you never feel much threat because these aren't people you care about.<p>But I did derive some diabolical pleasure out of seeing these screaming, whining, cardboard-cutout characters chopped to pieces.  This film is so bad at times that you just have to laugh at the blatant incompetences and corniness.  If the filmmakers' intentions was for the audience to laugh *at* them rather than *with* them, then they've succeeded in spades.  &quot;You did it...you defeated death&quot;...that's got to be the most ridiculous moment I've seen in a major studio release in years.<p>Two stars for the wild stunts, the bad yet amusing humour, and Ali Larter.  Treat this movie with the contempt it deserves, and I think you'll be able to have some fun watching it.  Got to be one of the dumbest films ever made, though.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Ladies and gentlemen, look at Kong-- the Eighth Wonder of the World.""></head><body><p>Anyone seeking to dismiss the original production of KING KONG as hopelessly flawed need look no further than the beast's fur, which appears in constant motion from being touched by the animator's hand for every frame. But for those wishing to experience or re-discover a classic among all monster movies, you've found it here in this story best summed up by that venerable truism: "T'was beauty that slayed the beast!"<br /><br />KONG TRIVIA--<br />The pilot and machine gunner that kill the giant ape are the film's director, Merian C. Cooper and producer, Ernest B. Schoedsack.<br /><br />The heavy-set native woman who sees Kong at her window is Etta McDaniel, Hattie's sister.<br /><br />The Great Wall was originally used in Cecil B. DeMille's silent epic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNGA">THE KING OF KINGS</a> (1927).<br /><br />Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe has a cameo as a native dancer.<br /><br />Jean Harlow refused the lead in this picture.<br /><br />The 60th Anniversary edition of KING KONG includes a documentary.

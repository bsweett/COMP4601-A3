<meta name="summary" content="My Milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard..."></head><body><p>While not one of my favorite Ben Stiller movies, it definitely was funny.  I enjoyed the comic oddity scenes, with many freaks,and geeks.  I thought the whole idea of Professional Dodgeball, was pretty hilarious.  Does this even exist?  I hear you can't play it on school grounds anymore, but maybe that's just a rumor.<br /><br />I loved the characters in this one, as well as the main characters.  The "Marcia Bradey" look-a-like was also nice. Too bad she didn't have any nude scenes.  I could have continued my adolescent male fantasies into modern time.  But I'm sure you don't want to read about that.<br /><br />The last segment, where Ben Stiller was dancing to "My Milkshakes" was worth the price of admission. It really was extremely funny.<br /><br />I suggest you buy or rent this immediately.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!  It rocks!</p></body></html>

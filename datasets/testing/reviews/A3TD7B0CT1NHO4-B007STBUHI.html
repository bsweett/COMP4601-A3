<meta name="summary" content="Visceral Terror!!!"></head><body><p>"Don't go into the water!"  Thus is one of the lines in this classic film with Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and others, in what has to be the best terror film of modern times.  Not in the slasher sense, but in the visceral sense, as this is all too real, and it still plays out on certain beaches of the world every year.  Of course now we have to watch out for crocodiles and their ilk, but overall, this is one of the best.  So hold on to your seat, and get the popcorn popping, and belt in for quite a ride.  You won't be disappointed!!!!</p></body></html>

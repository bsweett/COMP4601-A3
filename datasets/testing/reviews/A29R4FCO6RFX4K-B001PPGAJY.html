<meta name="summary" content="Even better the third time!"></head><body><p>Surpassing it's rival, the over-hyped MATRIX RELOADED in terms of action, story, spectacle and SFX, X-MEN 2 is one of the (Very) rare sequels that actually manages to turn out better than the original. Pitting the good and bad X-Men against a military scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox), the story is more involved than X-1 and has better action and some good humour thrown in for good measure. And fans are kept happy with some great mutants from the comics. Building on his fantastic persona, Hugh Jackman does a terrific job as Wolverine, who finds out more about his mysterious past. And he kicks some serious butt in this movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magneto are great, and new mutants Pyro, Iceman, Nightcrawler and Lady Deathstrike. My favourite character, Magneto is even better and Mystique provides both eye-candy and action-woman role. John Ottman's comic book-esche score gives the films a whole new layer of mystery and excitement, and Brian Singer's steady hand makes this one that is not to be missed on the big screen. Building on itself to the amazing finale, the only problem with X2 is that once it's over, you want to see it again. An incredible action event and one of the best movies of the year so far. 5-Star entertainment.</p></body></html>

Human beings need each other to survive.<br />It also showcases Will Smith's talented acting. It's heart-wrenching to watch Will kill his beloved dog after it was infected with the disease.<br /><br />The specical effects are spectacular in the scenes showing lions roaming New York. However, the "zombies" look fake. They don't look realistic like the creatures in Lord of the Ring.<br /><br />The last half of the movie is exactly like other movies of this genre, i.e. 28 days later. So, I was able to predict it.<br />It's definitely worth renting.</p></body></html>

I admit to being a fan of Steven King, but this film had it all: a great story, a wonderful cast, great acting, good sets, fine filming and editing, great special effects, a haunting musical score and so on. It was far superior to The Stand (which I loved), and which many King fans think is his best film.</p></body></html>

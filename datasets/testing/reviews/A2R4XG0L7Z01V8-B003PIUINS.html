I got the sequel for Christmas, and watched it almost straight away; eager to find out whether it was better or worse than the first one. (I know someone who HATED the first one, but liked the second, so I wasn't expecting to like it.) I've watched the first one quite a few times, so I practically know it off by heart, and sometimes even get sick of watching it. <p>But the sequel - the deaths are gorier, bloodier, and every last possible death you can think of has been used. And talk about weird and unusual deaths. Forget being run over by a bus; forget being strangled in a bath. Those are old news. There's a lot more blood; the camera is focused more on the deaths, so you see what you least expect to see. I got the feeling that someone had been looking at those health &amp; safety pictures, where you have to guess what the danger is in the picture, and then a light bulb went off above their heads. And boom, you have a film.<p>The first Final Destination threw you right into the action, and you didn't know what was happening. With a sequel, you know what's going to happen, so you sit back and say, "bring it on". It took a few minutes for the film to get started, recapping the events of the first film, and then you sit up, jaw dropping. With the deaths being more imaginative and very, very, very graphic, you didn't know what was going to happen. You just knew a lot of the cast wouldn't be appearing in the next sequel. <p>We find out in this film that Alex Browning (Devon Sawa - there's actually a very good lookalike in this!) has since died (a very mundane death) and left Clear (the brilliant Ali Larter) locked up voluntarily in a mental institution. Ali Larter is the only cast member left from the original and is up against a whole lot of unknowns, which most of the original cast were - and still are. It was great to see at least one original cast member back for more, rather than just start with a fresh new cast with no links to the previous film - but you'll have to watch the film for yourself to find out whether that's true or not. <p>The premonitions are more realistic this time, and not a brief glimpse in a window, which none of the audience watching catches. This time, you have longer dream sequences (think the plane crash dream at the beginning of the previous film), and more drawn out premonitions, where you feel like you're in the premonition. This time round, you're trying to work out exactly what's going to happen before it happens on screen. <p>This is your typical slasher movie, with a twist, and you'll find out how if you watch it - I thought this "twist" was great, and it made it all the more better. Ali Larter is a great actress, although . . . Nah, we won't go into that! <p>There are two things I'm worried about - that the directors might decide to make a trilogy, which might not be a good thing, although they could go all out and bring back Devon Sawa. And the fact that the production designer is Michael Bolton . . .</p></body></html>

With Brokeback Mountain, we are seeing the same level of intelligence and sensitivity in a mainstream movie. The fact that the two main characters are cowboys, a traditionally masculine image, makes this all the more powerful. Yes, you can be gay and macho at the same time.<br /><br />This is a long overdue, stereotype-breaking movie. While this was initially set in the early sixties, we still live in a society in which there are definite limits to 'acceptable conduct', based on gender. Even today, if two men greeted each other with a kiss in a supermarket setting, the way women often do, they would be seen as nancy boys. Traditionally, men are only allowed to be affectionate with each other on the sports field or on the battlefield.<br /><br />Full marks to the writer, the cast, and Ang Lee above all for their courage and vision.</p></body></html>

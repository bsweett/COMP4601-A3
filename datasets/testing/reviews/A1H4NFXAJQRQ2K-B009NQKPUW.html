<meta name="summary" content="Zionist Propaganda"></head><body><p>Saw the movie again, the Zionist overtones made me see it again to re-access my view of the film since the last scene left me with a bad taste, "this is Elizabeth Shaw signing off in the year of OUR LORD" blah blah whatever. After watching it again, references to the holocaust, focussing on her christian faith over and over, demanding her crucifix back etc. I now hate the movie completely as a British Zionist propaganda film. There is no room for Zionism in any science fiction film for me. I have lost almost all respect for Ridley Scott, the film Alien and Prometheus shamelessly rip-off Planet of the Vampires, but pollute a simple science fiction film with pathetic Zionist overtones, and in light of the wars in the middle east this type of holy crusade indoctrination is completely objectionable to me. If Scott had simple left off with a benign neutral statement of the folly of using weapons of mass destruction and them coming back to haunt and destroy their very creators, I'd have thought it a great theme, BUT Scott CHOSE to make the Shaw character blatantly take the stance of a blindly devote christian holy warrior marching off into the unknown, "in the year of OUR LORD 2098" or whatever. Huge mistake, and ruined a fine science fiction movie completely. I cannot separate the blatant Zionism from the material as a whole... since Britain is the home of the Zionists and give power to Israel etc.</p></body></html>

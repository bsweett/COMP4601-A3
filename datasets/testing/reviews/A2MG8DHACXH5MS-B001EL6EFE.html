<meta name="summary" content="Madly Hillarious .... a laugh for children and adults"></head><body><p>If New York is your kind of town then Madgascar is a great date movie with kids involved. It has a good mix of adult and children jokes that will have you howling. I giggled as loud as the children in the movie theatre!<br /><br />Four pampered New York Central zoo animals - a zebra, a lion, a hippo, and a hypochondriac giraffe enjoyed a peaceful existence in the heart of Manhattan. Alex, the lion, is the star attraction and gets the best steak in the zoo as a reward for drawing in the school trips. Alex's best friend Marty, a zebra dreaming of the wild, isn't so content with the easy life and runs away to experience freedom from captivity. When Marty's friends escape to bring him back all hell breaks loose and ends in a confrontation with animal control at Grand Central Station. Before they know it, the four friends are shipped off to a wildlife reserve in Africa at the urging of animal rights activists. Then the fun really begins as the street smart New Yorkers must forge their own way in the wild without the help of people. When Alex's predator instincts awaken it seems that the wild gets more frightening than the other three ever thought.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Behind every good man........"></head><body><p>This is a riveting movie which chronicles the life of Johnny Cash.  He is shown as a boy who admires his older brother Jack who plans to become a minister.  When Jack is killed in a tragic accident, his father turns on Johnny in his grief.  This puts an indelible impression on Johnny who feels that he is never good enough for his father or for anyone else.  The movie jumps ahead to Cash's life in the military and his attempts to be a door-to-door salesman.  From the earliest days his passion is music and eventually he makes a success of himself by singing songs which he has written.  His marriage suffers from long separations when he is performing on the road, and he gives in to the temptations which fame brings.  He has a longstanding admiration for June Carter, which grows into love, but she resists being connected to a man who is addicted to pills and other women.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon shine in the starring roles and the chemistry between them is evident, especially when performing Johnny Cash songs such as "Ring of Fire".  This movie is highly recommended viewing.</p></body></html>

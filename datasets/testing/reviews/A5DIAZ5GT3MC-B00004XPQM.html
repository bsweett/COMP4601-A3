<meta name="summary" content="FINAL DESTINATION 2 Review"></head><body><p>Fans of the original FINAL DESTINATION will find a whole lot of the same in this graphic retread of the first film. Story is pretty much the same. Freaky premonition causes the would-be victims of a massive tragedy to escape death but death doesn't take the loss with pride and violently hunts them down one by one.<p>A.J. Cook is our protagonist, this time, as she hunts down the only original survivor from the first film, Clear Rivers, and attempts to understand how to defeat death. Also back for the second go-around is Tony Todd as Death's mysterious messanger.<p>The return of Larter's character is uneccesarry, done more for the marquee value of the sequel than anything else. Hell, she doesn't even color her hair in this one. One thing that does help is the uncomfortable forewarning of violent death which haunts each character. The closthrophic intensity makes for some excitement, even if the story is very predictable. If you've seen the first one, you will be able to pick this one apart from the opening credits. All in all if you enjoyed the first movie and you're looking for some cheap thrills, this is worth a viewing or two.</p></body></html>

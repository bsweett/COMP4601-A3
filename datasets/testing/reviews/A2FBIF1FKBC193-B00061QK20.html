<meta name="summary" content="An easily foregettable film ....."></head><body><p>The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of what this DVD wasn't .... what it wasn't was a remake of 'Crouching Tiger' which I certainly will never forget .... that walking on leaves stupidity was only outdone by the poisoning scene that dragged out more than Steely Dan's Revival disks ...<br /><br />OK so Hero has what the great modern Chinese films have, colour, pagentry and a sense of history. What is lacks is writing skill and character development....in trying to appeal to a broad based US audience I guess the writers and directors took the brains out of the movie .... At least they didn't walk on water since there's only one character in my mind that can bring that off convincingly !!!<br /><br />Forget it ..... wait for this on Showtime .....</p></body></html>

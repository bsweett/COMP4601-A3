Cheadle plays a devout Muslim and his character battles personal conflicts and principles all the way through the movie.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)<br /><br />1.

He joins them and starts having a blast, but with serious misgivings, and for good reason.<br />6. Guy Pearce plays the FBI Special Agent who gets wind of Horn's activities<br />7. Explosive ending<br /><br />Samir Horn: You know that the Qu'ran says that if you kill an innocent person it's as if you've killed all mankind?<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 3, 2009</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best (If Most Frustrating)Romantic Comedy of All Time"></head><body><p><p>That is the spirit in which I can approach a film like Richard Curtis's LOVE ACTUALLY.  It is so close to being my favorite romantic comedy I almost wished that my own stupid sense of right and wrong didn't mess it up for me.  This is a movie that's so good that it's flaws are doubly illuminated. <p>Love is everywhere or at least that's the premise that Hugh Grant's (About a Boy) opening narration claims.  Then the movie goes on to prove just that.  We watch as 10 or 15 delightful and charming people fall in love.  And in the end each of these people is also connected either directly or indirectly to the other characters in the movie and so in the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a small microcosm of British society. <p>The film has charming written all over it.  Hugh Grant again plays that charming and debonair lady-killer he's gotten so good at playing.  Colin Firth (Bridget Jones's Dairy) plays this charming writer who falls for his maid, who doesn't speak English.  Emma Thompson (Junior) plays a mother and wife trying to come to grips with a tragedy in her own mind.  Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) play a widower who's young son has fallen "desperately" in love.  And While all this is going on, Alan Rickman (Dogma) and Laura Linney falls people in their office and Keira Knightly (Bend It Like Beckham) marries the man of her dreams, only to discover a little secret about his best friend.  As you can see a lot is going on here.  I can best be described as if you took a hundred romantic comedies and jammed them together.  Kind of a silly and romantic version of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.<p>Thankfully most of the major characters are fun, charming, and bring their own little piece of life to the film.  There is scene after scene of inventive fun.  I also liked how the film was full of silly cameo's that didn't destroy the overall structure.  Sure I saw Billy Bob Thorton, but the film didn't try to jam him down my throat.  I found my self momentarily going there's Billy Bob, but he embodies his character (The US President, think George W. Bush with Clinton's Libido), he's not playing Billy Bob.<p>The most interesting story arc follows Grant and his secretary (Martine McCutcheon, TV's Eastenders).  It's pitch perfect.  Every scene of him and McCutcheon made me smile.  I wanted to the see the outcome. I truly wanted these two people to fall in love.  It's hard for me to want to think that about characters in a more vapid rom-com.<p>It's scenes and characters like Grant and McCutcheon that make the weaker moments of the film fail miserably.  Most notably the stupid segments involving the stand-in's on the porno movie set and the dumb scenes involving the annoying British boy who goes to Wisconsin.  I wanted to watch characters that were involving.  These two story arcs were built on cartoon premises.  They're both weaker, like two bad jokes in an utterly flawless comedy routine.  They were both to silly, and did not have enough development to warrant their inclusion in this film.<p>The film also suffers from an overload of characters.  With so many interesting people to follow, it was difficult to dwell on one set of characters.  In the end you wind up getting the Cliff's Notes view of all these people. This hurts the Laura Linney (Maze) story most notably, because Curtis's screenplay tries to introduce dramatic scenes that are barely touched upon.  This makes at least one heart-wrenching scene in a mental hospital feel a little out of place.  Like it was tacked on cause every comedy needs a dramatic moment.<p>I also hated that the screenplay glossed over much of the Rickman's characters humanity.  Leaving the final outcome of his story arc vague, cause god forbid we leave the movie hating one of the main characters.  If you're going to waste time creating tension only to keep us in the dark in the end don't waste my time.<p>In the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a wholly frustrating and equally a great film.  It's chock full of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching.  <p>I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary. He plays an aging rock musician who's re-written one of his classic tunes into a Christmas song.  Sure he's sold out, but he sure won't promote it as if he did.  If Oscar has a funny bone, this performance is worth a supporting actor nomination.<p>Listen if you can shut out the flaws, LOVE ACTUALLY will leave you satisfied.  If you're like me, then you like the movie with maybe a few too many reservations.  LOVE ACUTALLY is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time, and one of the best (if frustrating) movies of the year.<p>****1/2 (out of 5)</p></body></html>

Having now seen the film I ask the film's critics what they have been smoking.  Nicholson and Freeman riff off each other like they've been working together for years.  What were they expecting, "Hamlet"?!  Nicholson and Freeman are in their golden years and this is the perfect vehicle for the both them.  Considering that the film deals with cancer patients it could have been maudlin and saccharine.  "The Bucket List" earns every ounce of emotion and tears it engenders from the audience.  Defy the critics and check out this gem of a movie.</p></body></html>

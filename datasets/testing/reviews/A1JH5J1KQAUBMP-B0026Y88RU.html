He is informed by a mobster known as the Boss (Morgan Freeman) that he can erase a $94,000 debt by killing the son of his rival, the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).  Feeling he has no alternative, he agrees.<br /><br />For me, this film fails on every level.  Its enigmatic opening tips us off that nothing is as it seems to be, which can be intriguing if handled correctly, but here it comes off as if director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Jason Smilovic are trying to be too clever for their own good.  The revelations at the end throw everything we have seen up to that point into doubt.  While I'm not interested enough to go back and watch it again with the benefit of knowing the ending, I'm pretty sure some pretty big plot holes still exist.  For example, wouldn't a powerful mob boss have some way to identify a man who owes him nearly 100K by sight?  Otherwise, people could skip out on their debts merely by changing apartments.  The dialogue is awful, too.  It's supposed to be terribly witty, but it comes across as the product of a writer who is far more amused by his own cleverness than I am.  Obviously, a lot of people disagree with me about that.  If you look this movie up on imdb.com, lots of people have posted their favorite lines.  To me, each one is worse than the last.</p></body></html>

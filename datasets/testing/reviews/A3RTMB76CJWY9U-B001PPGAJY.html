<meta name="summary" content="Fun, High-Quality Comics Adaptation--Best of the X-Men Series"></head><body><p>X-Men 2 is the best of the X-Men series (through part 3 thus far) and one of the best comic-based films of all time.<br /><br />The plot of the film concerns the U.S. Government's response to the events of the first film, and one rogue politician who is determined to wipe mutants, good, evil and otherwise, off of the face of the Earth.<br /><br />The strengths of this film are the strengths of the series: wonderful casting (Patrick Stewart as Professor X is simply perfect, Hugh Jackman *is* Wolverine, etc.); stunning special effects; clever plot twists and turns; a beautifully nude, if slightly blue and unnerving, Rebecca Romijn. This film, in particular, allows us to spend a little time with some of the "secondary" characters and really builds up their personalities, particularly Ice Man and Pyro. Nightcrawler is a wonderful addition to an already strong ensemble cast.<br /><br />I do wish that Cyclops had been given more--his character is probably the most poorly used of the series--but other than that, there is little to complain about in this film. It's a whole lot of fun and well worth the watching.</p></body></html>

A disappointment for the cast and the director Stephen Norrington who directed the first Blade. Sean Connery (Dr. No, Entrapment) who shouldnt be in this catastrophe, plays Allan Quatermain. Him, Tom Sawyer, played by Shane West (Tvs ER, A Walk To Remember); Mina Harker, played by Peta Wilson (La Femme Nikita, Mercy); Captin Nemmo, played by Naseeruddin Shah (?); Dorian Gray, played by Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned, Shooting Fish) who is only redoing his corny ass Lestat impression; Skinner The Invisible Man, played by Tony Curran (Flight of the Phoenix, Blade 2) and last but least Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde played by Jason Flemyng (Snatch, Layer Cake). Dr. Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde is laughably stupid and the guy who drinks all the potion at the end and turns into that cartoonish special effect is even more stupid. So, these band of heroes go out to try to stop The Phantom (No it is not Billy Zane's The Phantom) played by Richard Roxburgh (Van Heling, Mission: Impossible 2). I thought of this as the Van Helsing of it's year because Van Helsing was pure and utter crap just like this. The action scenes are badly staged and as for the story and script....nothing is there. Think before you write something like this....man! What a waste of time this is.</p></body></html>

A jarring jet crash, polar bears in the tropics, an invisible monster, hatches buried in the ground, a plane full of mummified heroin smugglers, a crippled man rising and walking, a scary villain kidnapping a heavily pregnant young woman for purposes unknown, a spoiled blonde rich chick bickering 90210-ishly with her stepbrother, a Republican Guard veteran who turns out to be a good guy---in the George W. Bush Age? Whoa! Nothing like it had ever been seen before! Season one was golden, and here it all began, the original concept, the original cast, just an unlikely group of jet crash survivors and their addictively intriguing back stories. Lost has come a long way since season one, but it's great to look back on the beginnings. Also unlike most TV series on DVD, the extras are actually worth watching. There's the eight-minute long Art of Matthew Fox, in which the actor does voice over of photos he took of the cast, crew, locations, from season one. There's also the cast gathered at Comicon, shots of the massive undertaking that was acquiring, dismantling and shipping an actual jumbo jet to Hawaii, all with the intent to make the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 that much more realistic. All the episodes of the first season of Lost are here, plus about eight hours of special features. Yep, it's engrossing entertainment that'll keep you busy for weeks: just don't forget to come up for air sometimes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good B movie"></head><body><p>Nothing really original here... Bruce Willis plays a hostage<br /><br />negotiator that fails to save a young boy and his mother, and<br /><br />decides to move out to a safe little town and become a small<br /><br />town sheriff. What happens? You guessed it... He runs into the<br /><br />same type of things that he ran away from in the big city.<br /><br />The film takes you think a ride of action and over the top<br /><br />drama... It does enough to keep you interested despite the<br /><br />fact that it is not really believable. It's pretty well<br /><br />acted considering what it is... The action is good of course,<br /><br />and some of the chacters are interesting such as the deranged Mars....<br /><br />The problem is that some things just doesn't make sense.. Like<br /><br />how the 3 teens so easily get by the high teck alarm system?<br /><br />Also, I think we should have seen more from the family.. It's<br /><br />hard to feel anything for the some of the chacters when they<br /><br />aren't together long enough. These things could have been<br /><br />fixed... But it's like they wanted to cut right to the action<br /><br />and drama.<br /><br />As a B movie it gets 4 stars... Other than that, it is only<br /><br />worth 3. Take it for what it is... A good b movie with holes<br /><br />in the plot.</p></body></html>

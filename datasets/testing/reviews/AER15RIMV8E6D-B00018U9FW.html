I've been meaning to write this review for quite some time, but I never got around to it, because I watch this movie on tv whenever it comes on. This movie is extremely hilarious, and has an awesome storyline. Jack Black stars as a rocker named Dewey Finn. When Dewey is kicked out of his band, he tries to find a job so his roommate won't kick him out. When his roommate, Ned Schneebly is called to be a substitute teacher, Dewey impersonates Ned in order to make some money. When he hears his fifth-grade class in the music class, he comes up with an idea to start a new rock band. During class, Dewey has them singing, and rocking out to try and win Battle of the Bands. I highly recommend SCHOOL OF ROCK!!!</p></body></html>

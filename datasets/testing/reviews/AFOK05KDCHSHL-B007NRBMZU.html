<meta name="summary" content="Deeply moving parable, fine dramatic debut for Ashton Kutcher"></head><body><p>THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT<br /><br />(USA - 2003)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br /><br />A young man (Ashton Kutcher) is 'cursed' with an ability to travel back in time to a series of traumatic childhood incidents and change the course of history, but his thoughtless actions have far-reaching - and often painful - consequences...<br /><br />Astonishing, complex film, distinguished by Kutcher's heartfelt performance as the haunted character whose attempts to rectify past transgressions meet with disaster at every turn. The emotional pay-off is quite profound (especially in the director's cut, much better than the theatrical edition), though viewers are advised that the material is often VERY heavy indeed - you have been warned! An unexpected masterpiece.<br /><br />Followed by several in-name-only sequels, beginning with THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT 2 (2006).</p></body></html>

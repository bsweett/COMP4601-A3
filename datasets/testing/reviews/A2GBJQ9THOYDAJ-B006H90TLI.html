<meta name="summary" content="Best thing the Coens have EVER done"></head><body><p>Wow. Just, . . . wow. I've long been a fan of the Coen Brothers, but this riveting treatment of Cormac McCarthy's novel is the best thing they've ever done. Josh Brolin is absolutely believable as Llewelyn Moss, a West Texas welder and Vietnam vet who's out hunting pronghorn one day and comes across a drug/money exchange gone sour. Lots of dead bodies, lots of vehicles full of shotgun holes, and a briefcase with a couple million dollars in it. He should have walked away and called the police, but he gets stupid and grabs the money, thereby becoming the target of psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh, played with evil intensity by Javier Bardem. Moss is on the run, Sheriff Bell (played perfectly by Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to find him before Chigurh does, and the bodies accumulate. Woody Harrelson is competent as Carson Wells, hired to find the money by the drug people, and Kelly Macdonald, who doesn't get enough screen time, nails the role of Moss's young wife. I know West Texas, and the cinematography is extremely evocative, especially in the early scenes. The accents are perfect -- even Macdonald's, and she's a Scot. I know some people don't like the ending -- or lack of an ending. Did Carla Jean die? Did Moss escape? What happens to Chigurh after the accident? We'll never know. That's just how life is.</p></body></html>

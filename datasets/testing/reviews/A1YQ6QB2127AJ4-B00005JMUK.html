<meta name="summary" content="The True Story of the US's First Female Serial Killer"></head><body><p>&quot;Monster&quot; is one of the most talked about films of 2003, not just because of Charlize Theron's groundbreaking performance.  This is one of the most daring films released that year.  It desplicts the life of the first female serial killer in US history, Aileen Wuournos.  It explores the time between Wuournos moved to Florida to her meeting girlfriend Selby to her making her first killing to the conclusion.  The brilliant plot digs deeper than just a woman who kills.  It shows how she became so angry of life, influencing her murders.  Contrary to popular belief, the crew assures that they do not symphathize her murders.  The chain of events has the level of direct impact to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.  The powerful theme never fades for a moment throughout the film.<p>Charlize Theron's performance as Aileen Wuournos is one of the best in many years.  Film critic Leonard Maltin once said that this is the best performance in cinema history.  He may be correct.  There was never a year that any actress was as well-deserving of every Best Actress award in existance, including the Oscar and the Golden Globe.  Such acting quality goes beyond gaining thirty pounds and abandoning the Hollywood glamour for a while.  She almost literally became Wuournos.  Her facial expressions, her physical mannerisms, her vocal style, and her presence resemble the real-life Wuournos.  Therefore, she clearly researched her role thoroughly.  Theron never loses that presence for a moment.<p>Christina Ricci's underrated performance as Wuournos's girlfriend Selby is wonderful.  Her character's compassion and her anger is well expressed in the film.  Thought the role is not as demanding as Theron's, she still proves that she is a rare young talent.  All other actors present themselves wonderfully.<p>The physical surroundings, including the buildings and the make-up, greatly add to the gloomy film theme.  It wondefully desplicts Aileen Wuournos's extension to her life.  The make-up team wonderfully transformed Charlize Theron's face and skin into Wuournos's, making Theron resemble her much closer.  Such accomplishment also offers a deeper to Wuournos's painful past.<p>&quot;Monster&quot; is an unforgettable experience for its audiences.  It is sure to please them for a long time.  The special features are great, interesting pieces that explore the film's production.  Those wanting to learn more about Aileen Wuournos should also read the book &quot;Deep Ends: The Pursuit, Conviction, And Execution of Female Serial Killer Aileen Wuournos, the Damsel of Death&quot; written by Michael Reynolds.</p></body></html>

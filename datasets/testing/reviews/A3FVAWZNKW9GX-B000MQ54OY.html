<meta name="summary" content="Fun the First Time, Probably Not Twice"></head><body><p>"Happy Feet" is fun, somewhere between Bambi for penguins and, as many have said, a musical version of "March of the Penguins" with a social message.<br /><br />What it is not is lasting. The best animated movies, like "Aladdin" (also starring Robin Williams), "Beauty and the Beast," "Snow White," and the aforementioned "Bambi," have more going on than shtick. "Happy Feet" relies too much on shtick. This makes it entertaining the first time through, and probably not the second.<br /><br />The animation is often much better than "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc." The wry humor is as good as, or better than, the best of the Veggie Tales shorts (way better than "Jonah: The Veggie tales Movie"). The music will make an interesting soundtrack.<br /><br />What's the shtick? A dancing penguin. Great premise, but the animation's timing is weak. The sound of the tapping does not equal what is on screen. The dance routine becomes exactly that, routine. We see it once, twice, three times. The fifteenth time, I was bored with it.<br /><br />The food chain is explained well, as is the competition for food. Penguins, birds, humans, all eat fish. Some birds also eat penguins. When humans eat more fish, birds eat more penguins, and the penguin population naturally declines.<br /><br />When the penguins suffer, they look for solutions. Some ideas are silly, and blame the conservative side of penguins -- very 1950s-style Soviet communism (with a dose of Native American animism and a weaker dose of 1890s Christian revivalism). Others are survivalist, requiring endurance of characters. Mumbles becomes an unwilling solution finder. He is not looking at the big picture, he presses naively through hardship to ask simply if the humans (he thinks they are aliens) can help.<br /><br />Survival of the fittest is clear here. The struggle, the ingenuity and resourcefulness of survival is played well.<br /><br />The music, especially the introductory songs, are great fun. It will appeal mostly to fans of late 1970s and 1980s music. Its brilliance is in the mixing of songs so well that a first time listening might not realizing it is a medley.<br /><br />Williams is better than he has been recently, especially with his Barry White styled guru penguin, Lovelace.<br /><br />Characters are not always well-explained. They come and go, occasionally for no reason. This could be bad writing or editing, but, either way, left me confused.<br /><br />"Happy Feet" could be considered a movie in which the main character tries to find himself. Or, if the audience wants to think more heavily than intended, Mumbles the dancing penguin is Martin Luther, an artist, an unwilling revolutionary, or a gay activist. It flirts with all of this, but never enough to dominate the message.<br /><br />I saw it once, had fun, should have waited for the DVD. Should you see it? Sure. You too will tap your feet, laugh a little, but it is no great animated movie.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></body></html>

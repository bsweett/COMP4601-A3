<meta name="summary" content="Uneven Quality CGI & Art, Limited Story, Just Rent It."></head><body><p>The underline message makes for a good family movie. But the graphics and art are unimpressive. The main character has great quality art/CGI, like facial expressions. Supporting characters have limited quality art, the rest are poor. With few exceptions, the music and scenes are forgettable. Last, the story seems to run out of steam midway into the movie.</p></body></html>

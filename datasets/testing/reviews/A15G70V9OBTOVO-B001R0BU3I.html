<meta name="summary" content="Quite good"></head><body><p>Traitor tries to be both character study and action so it will probably disappoint both audiences.  But I thought it was a hell of a try, well told and acted, with the appropriate dose of melancholy.<br /><br />The Guy Pierce character was a little too enlightened and Jeff Daniels wasn't believable, but these are small matters.<br /><br />If you are looking for a star vehicle, I'd go with Body Of Lies.  But if you're looking for something that feels like it could happen and what it might be like to get caught up in it, I think you'll like Traitor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not the best film in the series, but still fun"></head><body><p>"Ocean's Eleven" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I really enjoyed "Ocean's Twelve." Unfortunately, I don't think "Ocean's Thirteen" measures up to the first two installments in this movie trilogy, although aspects of the film were quite enjoyable.<br /><br />In the latest Ocean adventure, the gang rallies together after vile casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double-crosses Reuben (Elliott Gould). Led by Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan (George Clooney and Brad Pitt), the con men devise a massive plot to rig Willy's new casino on its opening night and cause the house to lose for three and a half minutes straight, thus breaking Willy Bank's bank.<br /><br />The premise of the story is great, and I love the fact that this scam is set in Las Vegas, just like the first film. This time the group is forced to enlist the help of their longtime nemesis, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), which adds a fun new twist to the situation. However, in spite of all that good stuff, I was still disappointed with this film. The first hour or so really dragged for me. There aren't a whole lot of subplots going on like in the first two films, and everyone's attention is focused on the technical details of planning the scam, which gets kind of old after a while. The fact that the characters of Tess and Isabel are absent from this film also takes away from everything. I knew that Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones weren't slated to appear in the film, but I was still hoping for a cameo, at least. There weren't really any fun cameos in this movie, unlike the first two films, which was a major bummer. Many of the jokes didn't seem as funny this time around, and although the pace really picked up once the con officially was underway, it just wasn't as fun of a movie as the first two were.<br /><br />Another complaint I have about "Ocean's Thirteen" is that it's an incredibly predictable movie. Everyone knows that no one's going to trump Danny Ocean and his crew, and even when seemingly unbeatable obstacles spring up or integral characters start getting arrested, we know it's all part of the plan and that the scam will go off without a hitch. Many of the casino staff members and FBI officials are in on the scheme, too, but that wasn't a surprise at all because the same trick was used in the first two films on multiple occasions.<br /><br />Still, all my griping aside, I enjoyed the film. Things really picked up after the first hour or so, and there are some very funny scenes in the movie (unfortunately, though, I think most of them ran in the trailer). The Danny/Rusty/Oprah crying scene is hilarious, as is the little "inside joke" scene at the very end with Pitt and Clooney. All of the actors did a great job. Pacino is a very nice addition to the cast, as is Ellen Barkin, although I think her character was kind of watered down and could have been a lot stronger. Also, the Vegas shots are great. I especially like the scene where Rusty and Danny are conversing outside of the Bellagio: there are some beautiful shots of the Strip in this film, which makes Vegas lovers like myself very happy.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think the main problem with this film is that the script is very weak, which is a shame. Fortunately, everything manages to come together in the end, and Clooney and his costars make the movie entertaining to watch.</p></body></html>

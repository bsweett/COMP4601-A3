It is a simple, moving story about post-apocalyptic life with a protagonist who through his faith manages to bring a particular faith to others who may otherwise not have it.  I'm not going to say much more  because I do not want to spoil it for others who have as yet to see it.  What I will end with is that there are no "Holier than thou" or overly preachy elements in the film The Book Of Eli, yet it is an easy (faith wise), beautiful and poignant film... beautiful musical score too.  One of my new favorites!</p></body></html>

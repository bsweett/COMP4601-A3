<meta name="summary" content="A Good Film With a Great Plot and Script"></head><body><p>"The Butterfly Effect" was a great film despite it's negative reviews from reviewers in the newspapers and such.Ashton Kutcher whose performance people have insulted alot did a pretty good job in the film although he's no where near Oscar nominations.<br />But the film is about Alex Treborne(Kutcher) whose childwood was severley damaged and now an A student in college he begins to read his childhood journals in an attempt to recreate the the childhood all in the hopes of saving his girlfriend Kaylie (Amy Smart).The flashbacks are very interesting getting you hooked on the story right away and the characters are well casted with Kutcher perfectly fit for the role.Also smaller characters are great too such as a kiddie pornographer played by Eric Stoltz.<br />The film was very entertaining from the first frame to fade out and was worth the six dollars and fifty cents it cost to get in.<br />Go see this film,you are not wasting your money.But another thing I should bring up is the fact that this is not really what you would call a horror film,it is more of a drama but it will be likeable for horror freaks.B+ for the movie,B for the acting.<br />Enjoy!!!</p></body></html>

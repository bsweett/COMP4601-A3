<meta name="summary" content="KickWhat?"></head><body><p>Kick... is an entertaining movie I have some issues though with a Little Girl cursing like a sailor(hopefully not the stereotypical one that we know now)and being ultra-violent, I have no qualms with violence and violent movies but not when a Kid is the one,besides that and a horrible performance by Nicholas Cage I enjoyed most of it,except the beginning of course and that it was basically a bunch of dweebs.I have not read nor will Read the material it's based on,I think the re-do the whole superhero thing and make it like this ruins the Superhero Genre,yes the Superhero movie has been done to death sadly,and Hollywood is to blame but this is not the answer,it is different and that can mean good or bad I watched it and was not impressed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE GREATEST HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE"></head><body><p>A BIG SHARK TERRORIZES A NEW ENGLAND SHORE RESORT AND IT'S UP TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF [ROY SCHEIDER], AN ICHTHYOLOGIST [RICHARD DREYFUSS], AND A SHARK EXPERT [THE LATE RICHARD SHAW] TO STOP IT. A BONAFIDE MOVIE CLASSIC THAT PUT STEVEN SPIELBERG'S NAME ON THE MAP. AFTER THE HUGE SUCCESS OF THIS MOVIE, JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER SHARK MOVIE ALL TURNED OUT TO BE WEAK IMITATIONS OF THIS MOVIE. THIS ONE STILL LEADS THE PACK TO THIS DAY. HORROR FANS DEFINITELY WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED. FOLLOWED BY THREE SEQUELS.</p></body></html>

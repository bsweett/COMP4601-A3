<meta name="summary" content="Thrre Years on the Moon: Well-acted and Imaginative Sci-fi Mystery"></head><body><p>Here is a job you might be interested. Three years in a lonely mining station on the moon, harvesting and sending to Earth helium-3, new energy resources for the futuristic society. You are totally alone during the time and a super-intelligent computer GERTY will maintain the entire facility and also take care of you.<br /><br />Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, terrific as always) is the current worker. His three year stint is coming to an end and he is looking forward to meeting his wife Tess left on Earth again. But Sam realizes something is not right about this mission. He is not feeling well these days, and there are a few other things Sam is yet to know about the isolated station he has been living in.<br /><br />The visuals and narrative of "Moon" harkens back to an old-fashioned style of sci-fi films like Douglas Trumbull's "Silent Running," films made with a low budget but whose creators had a lot of imagination. The interesting stories have a message or two about our society, which is thought-provoking, but not preachy. Incidentally, "Moon" is directed by Duncan Jones, son of the star of "The Man Who Fell to Earth."<br /><br />"Moon" is part mystery and part sci-fi, but the film's success is due to the dramatic tension between the characters including the computer GERTY (voice by Kevin Spacey). Maybe not the most scientifically accurate film, but "Moon" offers an interesting story and unique visions of the future.</p></body></html>

The temptation to focus on special effects over characterization is usually too great to resist.  With HULK, director Ang Lee completely disregarded the tension that resided in the comic version of Bruce Banner's split personality.  On the inked page, artist/lettermen Stan Lee and Steve Ditko presented a dichotomous soul that drew in the reader, always making him wonder how the kind but ineffectual Bruce Banner could survive his transformations into the green Hulk without losing his inner self in the process.  On the celluloid screen, what the viewer sees is a mess that includes (in no particular order) a troubled youth's attempt to bury horrific memories, a warped father/son relation that results in two, rather than one, monsters, a love interest that fizzles for lack of chemistry, a raging green golem that offers no rationale for that rage, and a series of special effects that are so patently computer enhanced that the viewer cannot submit to that essential willing suspension of disbelief that is always needed to make any far-fetched plot work.  Eric Bana, who plays Bruce Banner, bears a stunning resemblance to what Toby McGuire of SPIDERMAN might look like in the next decade.  Bill Bixby, who was the original television Hulk, managed to invest his role with the needed mixture of pathos, tension, and repressed rage.  Bana simply sleepwalks through his rages which lasted only for as long as it took for the computer Hulk to make an appearance.  Jennifer Connoly, as the love interest, shows none of the zip and zowie that she showed previously in A BEAUTIFUL MIND.  Sam Elliot, who plays her four star general father, is your typically one-dimensional military man who can see the creature but not how to make that creature worthy of a hunt.  As a hunter of escaped fugitives, Elliot could take a few lessons from Barry Morse, who, in his FUGITIVE days, knew how to invest his hunter's persona with bedrock personality.  It came as no surprise to me that HULK tanked at the box office in only its second week.  For a comic book hero to make the successful leap from the printed page to the celluloid screen, that hero ought to do more than merely leap mindnumbing distances.  This mindnumbing, in HULK'S case, rubbed off on the film as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="snip two scenes and it becomes a timeless classic"></head><body><p>I was surprised how much I enjoyed this visual feast of a film. The timeframe is 1939-1940 - we know this because we see Polly Parker (Gwenyth Paltrow) viewing "The Wizard of Oz" on the big screen at Radio City Music Hall. She is a sassy professional journalist and amateur photographer in a mostly male-dominated workforce... but it's war time and no one is arguing.<br /><br />The film has almost a dream-like quality of old silver-gum prints that have then been hand-colored. You must see it to appreciate it. Every frame is like the saucy 1940 serials with Art Deco robots and technology.<br /><br />The robots look like Metropolis meets Gort - very artsy-fartsy, yet very ominous at the same time. These are giant 15-story-tall robots, some can fly, and they attack the city, tearing up buildings and streets, leaving with steel and generators, leaving the war-torn nations of the world without materials. No one knows who is behind this until they call Sky Captain (Jude Law) who has his own incredible James Bond-esque plane that can swim under water as well as fly. He and Polly end up trotting across the world, searching for the source of the robots. This same enigma is obviously also behind the disappearance of several of the world's most renowned scientists and no one knows if it's the Russians, the Germans, the Japanese or just some nut that's behind it.<br /><br />Thanks to two lewd comments and constant referral to a supposed incident of cheating on the Sky Captain's part when he was once dating Polly, the innocent, time-capsule quality of the film is lost. If just these few little scenes were snipped (all adding up to about 45 seconds), the film would be a timeless classic. I don't want to give up the plot of the film, but it's an interesting sci-fi genre from the time in which it emulates.<br /><br />This film is an epic achievement on a grand scale and a feast for the eyes and the nostalgic. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

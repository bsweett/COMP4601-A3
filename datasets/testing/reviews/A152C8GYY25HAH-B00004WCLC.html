<meta name="summary" content="Ambitious, mesmerizing, challenging"></head><body><p>With the sprawling and ambitious Magnolia, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson establishes himself as one of the most gifted film makers of his generation. Over three hours long, the movie will prove too much for some viewers, but I found this look at a day in the lives of some San Fernando Valley residents to be fascinating. Some of the characters' lives are interconnected to other characters, while others are connected in only coincidental ways. The movie spends a lot of time dealing with the differences between coincidence and fate. <p>Jim [John C. Reilly] is a cop who earnestly tries to do good. He is desperate to be loved, and when he meets Rose Gator [Melinda Dillon] during a domestic disturbance call, he is seemingly oblivious to her problems, which include drug addiction and a lot of mental conflicts. Rose hates her father Jimmy [Philip Baker Hall] with a passion bordering on the homicidal. Jimmy is the host of the longest running game show in TV history. He has recently been told he has two months to live and is trying to right some of the wrongs he has done to his wife and daughter. The show is called What Do Kids Know? and it pits three kids against three adults. The current child contestants are close to setting a money record, led by Stanley [Jeremy Blackman], an eleven year old who is miserable because he knows he is nothing but a freak to the audience and a meal ticket to his father. Across town, Donnie [William H. Macy], who was a champ on the show thirty years ago, is trying to make some sense of his life, which has gone downhill ever since his short experience with fame. The show's producer, Earl Partridge [Jason Robards], is also dying in his luxurious home, tended to by a wonderfully altruistic nurse, Phil [Philip Seymour Hoffman], who will do anything to grant the man's dying wish, which is to see his estranged son, Frank [Tom Cruise]. Frank long ago changed his name and has become wealthy by creating a very odd self-help program, which claims to give men control over women...  <p>Magnolia was passed over at the Oscars this year, though there are a number of award winning performances. Of particular note are those of Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. I never thought I'd be saying this, by Cruise really should have won Best Supporting Actor.<p>Much has been made of the movie's startling and unconventional ending. I thought it was perfect, though many people disagree. I will note that there are clues all though the film that tell you that the event depicted will probably occur.</p></body></html>

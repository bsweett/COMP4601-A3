<meta name="summary" content="Feeling Lost?"></head><body><p>I've been watching Lost this past TV season. The season finale was last night. I have to say that this show is one of the few TV shows which offers intelligent, detailed storytelling these days. The cast is strong and varied as well. The episodes all offer flashbacks to previous events in the characters' lives, before the airplane crash which left them stranded on a rather strange island in the Pacific, and this has a way of making the characters richer...fuller. Not all of the characters are likeable; all have human flaws and issues which make the whole story more real.<br /><br />The supernatural strangeness of the island also has a way of pulling you in. From the character which shouldn't be able to walk, but does, to the airplane wreckage which is pulled away into the ocean, leaving no traces, to the mysterious numbers which have drawn people to the island, you know that something's not right, but the characters have little time to spend to figure it out, as they are struggling to survive. And struggle they must, for limited resources, for shelter, and against the island's monster and the islands other, mysterious, vicious inhabitants.<br /><br />Now, with the first season over, and few of the mysteries really resolved (though, one of them, being what the island's monster looks like, has been at least partially answered), and I've been left wanting more.<br /><br />It's a long wait until the fall.</p></body></html>

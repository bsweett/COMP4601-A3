Although it did have its scary and whiteknuckle scenes, overall it wasn't a great movie.  Siblings Darryl (Justin Long) and Trish (Gina Phillips) are on their way home from their freshmen year at college.  Their trip home begins to turn dangerous when they see a man in a trench coat and a hat that covers his face dumping something down a pipe. They recognize him as the man who tried to run them off the road earlier.  Like going into a basement in a horror movie, Darryl decides to see for himself what was dumped down the pipe.<br />Soon they realize they're being chased by an ancient demon known as the Creeper.</p></body></html>

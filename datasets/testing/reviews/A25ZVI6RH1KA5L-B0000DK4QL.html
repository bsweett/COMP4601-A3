<meta name="summary" content="Justice is blind. So is he."></head><body><p>When I saw this movie in the theaters, it didn't impress me as much as I wanted it to, but seeing it again, it's starting to grow on me.  While having a few issues with the movie, I think it was fairly well done.  Being an avid comic book reader in my youth, I was very familiar with the characters, so I did have preconceptions of how I thought the movie should have been, and maybe that was the problem.<p>The movie tells the story of Matt Murdock, a blind, idealistic lawyer who does a leather outfit and seeks justice at night, played by Ben Affleck.  As a young boy, Matt is blinded in an accident by biohazardous material, but his four remaining senses are subsequently augmented to superhuman levels.  This includes hypersensitive hearing to the point where he can visualize sound waves reflecting off objects allowing him to 'see'.  We also learn how his father, a professional boxer by trade, was murdered because he refused to participate in a fixed fight by taking a fall.  This sets up Matt's motivation for becoming a superhero of sorts, using his special abilities to help those who can't help themselves, both in and out of court.<p>After all this origin stuff is laid out for us, we fast forward to the present, where we see Matt in court involved in a case against a particularly nasty sort of fellow who manages to get acquitted of a rape/abuse charge.  Later that night, Matt dons his outfit, and begins to seek his own justice against this fellow.  <p>We also get to meet Matt's future love interest, Elektra, played by Jennifer Garner.  We find out her father is involved with a major crime syndicate run by Carlton Fisk a.k.a Kingpin, played by the ever enormous Michael Clarke (The Green Mile).  Her father wants out of the business, to which the Kingpin decides to set him up for a fall and make it look like Elektra's father is really the Kingpin.  Fisk calls in a hire assassin, Bullseye, played by a baldheaded Colin Farrell.  He goes after Elektra's father, and ends up getting into an altercation with Daredevil.  During their fight, Bullseye manages to kill Elektra's father and make it look like Daredevil was responsible, so this sets up a fight between Elektra and Daredevil.  I don't want to go further into the story than I already have as not to spoil anything, but, as you can probably guess, Daredevil and Bullseye end up having a climatic fight at the end of the movie.  Oh yeah, and Kingpin gets his due, also.<p>There were some major and minor differences between the comic book and the movie.  The biggest was Kingpin.  In the comic book, he's a fat, bald white guy while in the movie he's a large, muscular black guy.  Was this a good or bad change?  It didn't make a big difference to me, but I didn't feel like Michael Clarke's character could have been the head of a major organized crime syndicate.  Ben Affleck played his role well, but his performance always seemed a little off the mark.  He just didn't seem to really get into the character to me, like a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit.  Jennifer Gardner was probably the best in this movie, as she seemed to really fit in with the character I remember from the comic, although the comic book Elektra had black hair and seemed a little more ethnic in her Greek background.  And her fight with Bullseye...what was up with that?  She was an expertly trained fighter, and Bullseye's main ability was to be able to turn almost any object into a deadly weapon by way of being able to throw it and always hit his mark.  In the comic, he was not an amazing fighter, but in the movie he was able to hold his own against Elektra and Daredevil.  Whatever....Colin Farrell did all right, but just didn't seem right in the part.  And that bullseye brand on his fore head...man, that was goofy.  Also some of the music just didn't seem to fit the scenes...like the scenes were filmed to fit the music, and not the other way around.<p>I guess if you liked Spider-man, then you will probably like this movie, as the formula is the same, but the chemistry just doesn't seem to work like it did in Spider-man.  This movie is a little darker, and doesn't have the whimsical element of Spider-man, but it seems to try and stay true to the comic book, which I appreciated.<p>As far as extras go, there are tons.  Like 8 hours worth.  There are some extras on the first disc along with the movie, and then the whole second disc is all more extras.  One extra I thought was pretty cool was the running visual commentary, like the old Pop Up video show on VH1.  There is also an enhanced audio track for the visually impaired, of which I am not really sure what it is, but reminded me of that Python bit on the Holy Grail movie where they had a guy shouting things for the hearing impaired.<p>Oh yeah, once the movie ends and the credits roll, keep watching as there is a bit more of the movie about half way through the credits.  I missed it in the theaters, but caught it here.  It's worth it.</p></body></html>

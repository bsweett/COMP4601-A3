<meta name="summary" content="The greatest adventure of all time!"></head><body><p>Conceived by two of the greatest film-makers of our time, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's inspired concept to remake the old 50s TV serials into a swashbuckling action adventure movie proved to be one of the best ideas in Hollywood since Zorro. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and the two subsequent sequels; INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE did massive box-office success and propelled star Harrison Ford to super-stardom in the 80s. Adored by fans, RAIDERS is perfect movie making. And while some purists claim that TEMPLE OF DOOM is the lesser of the trilogy, the action quota is higher than that of the excellent LAST CRUSADE. Together, these 3 movies have become some of the most famous and still greatest adventures in cinema history.<p>RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is my all-time favorite movie. And one major reason is the incredible opening ten minutes. The ominous jungle setting, Spielberg's brilliant framing revealing the man in the hat. A mysterious cave with booby traps, shady guides who chicken out thus upping the impending threat, Indiana's swagger as he strides into the eerie cavern. Dangerous spiders, avoiding fatal spikes, carefully walking up to the antiquity, then it's grab and run as the cave begins to collapse, the hero betrayed by the shifty guide, dodging arrows, swinging over the chasm with whip, sliding under the quickly closing wall, the shifty guy is dead, and as he picks up the artifact an immense boulder starts thundering after the hero with ever-increasing pace, he swings out of the way cheating death by seconds... only to be faced by his arch nemesis, Belloq, and is forced to relinquish his precious find to the fiend. A tense moment, and suddenly twenty natives race after the hero, shooting arrows after him. Swinging on a vine to safety accompanied by John William's heroic score, he catches his plane. Cinema par excellence.<br />The success of RAIDERS is in the genius of it's design. No film since (Not even the sequels) has ever managed to pull off the idea of the whole film being one fantastic string of action sequences without being tedious or repetitive. The story is the best of the three movies, with Indy chasing after the lost ark of the covenant before the nazis get there. Here Spielberg shows why he is the best at what he does. And similar to another work of art in the Spielberg cannon; JAWS, John Williams is the 'fifth actor' in the film, with his brassy, heroic score underlying the action and continually giving momentum throughout the entire running time.<br />As all fans know, Spielberg originally wanted to direct a Bond movie. With Lucas' great writing and Spielberg steady hand, they not only blitzed the 007 movie of the same year, but ushered a whole new generation of film-makers, inspired and influenced to raise the bar in action movies.<p>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM follows the standard trilogy rule: the second movie is the darkest. Like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, the second adventure (Or third, since this is actually a prequel) sees Indiana in much darker territory. This time around, Indy's plane crashes in India, where he has to retrieve the stolen Shankara stones and save the children of the village. The action is the film's high point, especially the Shanghai action scene (Set in club Obi Wan) and the fantastic mine car chase. However, it does lose points with it's over-indulgence in dark horrors with human sacrifice and torture. Spielberg himself has said that when he watched it, he felt it was too violent. Compared with recent films, it seems somewhat tame, but still retains it power. But it is comic book violence after all, and therein lies the idea of the film. It's just a movie. But a very good one.<br />For the third installment, the dream team of Spielberg and Lucas came up with another inspired idea. With the casting of Bond vet Sean Connery as Indiana's father in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, a new layer of hitherto unseen emotion and clever humor makes this one a fantastic entry in the franchise. the action is great, and Indy's dad calling Indy 'Junior' never fails to be funny. This time, Junior is on the trail to find his father, who was kidnapped by the nazis in a plot to find the Holy Grail. Indy must rescue his dad and the race is on to find the artifact before it falls into the wrong hands. While there are less action set-pieces than in RAIDERS, when they do come, they are amazing. Thrilling boat chases, plane chases, the tank chase, and the finale, a fitting end to the most incredible trilogies of all time. No wonder there's still talk of Indy 4. I can hardly wait...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad -- Will Entertain Some People Much More Than Others"></head><body><p>With the success of "Harry Potter" and "The Lord of the Rings," it was inevitable that another British fantasy classic would be shipped into theaters to ride the latest wave of interest in Anglo entertainment (or, perhaps, the latest invasion of Anglo entertainment, as the English seem to have a stranglehold on entertainment imported to the U.S.)  And like these other films, "The Chronicles of Narnia" scores high points in aesthetic achievement:  it's a generally beautiful film to look at and listen to.  Its actors are competent, if not nearly as appealing as those of, say, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks," "Dragonslayer," and other Disney fare plumbing the same basic material.  Where it suffers is in its uneven storyline, from characters that are sometimes annoying in their inconsistency (the "smart" older sister seems pretty dumb and rather annoying all around, for instance) to a Christian allegorical framework that includes - and I'm not kidding - Santa Claus handing out deadly weapons to children.  In fact, I thought it a little disturbing in these trying times of religious extremism to see a film that on one hand purports to have spiritual overtones while at the same time advancing the notion that only through all-out bloodletting can that spiritualism be preserved.  (I'm not sure westerners wouldn't be decrying this idea if the religion were a different one.)  In the end, though, "The Chronicles of Narnia" is good but not great entertainment.  The buildup to the climactic, technically well-conceived battle scene seems to take forever to reach, as the thinness of the plot - a group of displaced British children find a passageway to a secret frozen world through the back of a wardrobe - couldn't quite hold my attention.  Maybe I'm just overloaded on the Anglocentric stuff, or maybe I should read the book, as a friend tells me it's much better.  I'd give it three and half stars, though with Amazon's ranking system, I'll call it even at three.</p></body></html>

A sort of "1984" crossed with "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The Count of Monte Cristo" (the last of which is a major motif in the movie), "V for Vendetta" is the often gripping tale of a masked avenger wreaking havoc on the leaders of a brutal, neo-Fascist totalitarian regime in mid-21st Century England. Murderously intolerant of anyone who isn't a straight, fundamentalist Christian right-winger, the dystopia of "V for Vendetta" has parallels to those created in "The Handmaid's Tale" and "Fahrenheit 451," as well as some uncomfortable parallels to political and social realities in present-day England and America. McTeigue gleefully ransacks images from art, literature, theater and cinema to create a film that is never boring and often compelling, even when--particularly toward the end--its story doesn't make a lot of sense. The Wachowski Brothers' script is less interested in creating a cogent rationale and timeline for the story than in creating opportunities for making things fall down go boom; the final scenes, though visually brilliant, pose more questions than they answer. (Sure, the brothers are portraying a society in chaos, but the screenplay itself can't be chaotic.) It's a big help that the supporting players are some of the greatest talents in British Rep. Actors such as John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Rupert Graves, Stephen Fry, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Standing and Sinead Cusack play their roles with absolute conviction, adding immeasurably to the film's impact. As the masked avenger, Hugo Weaving works wonders with his body and voice, but can only partially overcome the handicap of the smirking, immobile Guy Fawkes mask he is forced to wear throughout the movie. As the young woman who becomes the avenger's helpmate and confidante, Natalie Portman is not as good as she was in "Closer" (a movie pretty much not worth seeing except for her), but vastly better than she was as Princess Padme in the "Star Wars" movies. In all, "V for Vendetta" is an entertaining if not totally satisfactory entry in the action-comic book movie genre.</p></body></html>

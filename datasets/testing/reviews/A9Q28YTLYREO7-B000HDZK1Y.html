<meta name="summary" content="Boring"></head><body><p>watched this film recently&didn't find anything funny at all. Jack Black just basically plays the same character in all of his films. now he has a moment or two here&there,but this mess never gets off the ground. no chemistry between the actors&Actress poor writing&no direction whatsoever. this film just wasn't funny&didn't make any sense to me.  another example of a Over-hyped film.</p></body></html>

It's true we've seen him in this role before (and many a time at that) BUT this is still a hands down entertaining, and suspenseful movie that won't have you wondering if it's time for bed yet, though great art it may not be.  The formula of wronged family man, as I mentioned, holds true here, set this time in the information age of banking.  In spite of his years, Ford still manages to deliver the goods and does more than a decent job of portraying an I.T. bank security manager whose family has fallen hostage to an elaborate scheme to have him rob the system he designed.  All in all, it was a fairly intense ride and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />An original role for Harrison?  No.  A fast-paced, intelligent thriller in a role that he does best?  Yes.  Better than Air Force One?  Much.  As bad as some of these reviews make out?  No way!  I suppose it depends on what you're looking for.  I should probably give it 4 stars all things considered, but for entertainment value alone, I'm giving it 5 stars, Gene.  Harrison's still got his chops, and this is a decent movie.</p></body></html>

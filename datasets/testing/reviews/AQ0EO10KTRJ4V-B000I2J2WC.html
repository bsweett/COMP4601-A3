<meta name="summary" content="Ever played MYST or SYBERIA ?"></head><body><p>In terms of the mechanics of film making this was an OK movie......... BUT........ Oh what a tedious effort to sit thru hoping something interesting or thought provoking would happen.<br /><br />The dialogue was tough to follow with either heavy accents or worst yet bad sound on the English speaking actors that made it sound like everybody was mumbling or had marbles in their mouth.<br /><br />This felt less like a movie and more like a very, very, very slow moving version of a PC-based adventure game like MYST or SYBERIA where you walk around looking for clues and keys to play the game.<br /><br />In the end.... it was hard to really care what was happening to any of the characters in the least.</p></body></html>

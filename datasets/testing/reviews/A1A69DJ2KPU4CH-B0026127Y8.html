<meta name="summary" content="A Great Action Movie About A Horrible Subject"></head><body><p>First before I start off with a review, I want to say Taken is all about a man's struggle to rescue his daughter from a European sex slave ring. The human sex trafficking industry is absolutely atrocious, and unfortunately it's very real, and it's big business. It's a worldwide industry too. Any research into the industry will reveal the absolute worst of humanity, with the poor women kidnapped and trapped in the industry treated like animals, human cattle all for the sake of a making a buck. The torture and abuse the women experience at the hands of these animals is simply unimaginable. To add insult to injury the poor women trapped in that industry who try to escape, then have to worry about having their family members killed. These women are kept in the most inhumane living conditions, worked up to 16 hours a day, starved, sleep deprived, beaten, tortured, etc. Man's inhumanity to man, and to animals (pit bull fighting rings, whale, seal, shark killing, animals used for cosmetics testing, minks tortured for their fur etc.) is enough to make me think that maybe we are due for a big extinction level event. The experiment has failed, time to wipe it out and start over. That may seem like an extreme view, but there is so much inhumanity and violence in this world that I really don't think humans deserve the right to inhabit the earth any longer. We pollute and torture the planet, torture fellow man, and torture the other animals who inhabit the planet with us, that I think the good in humanity is far outweighed by the bad. I don't know where we are headed as a civilization, but an extinction level event may be just what's called for to end the evil in this world, and maybe start over with a new model of man.<br /><br />Okay, now that I'm done with the heavy, preachy stuff, on to the movie. Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor, there is nothing I've seen the man in that I don't like. Taken really could have ended up being just another action movie were it not for Liam's fine acting. Make no mistake though, Liam is a one man army in this movie, killing his way through overwhelming odds, and always winding up on top. I shudder to think what the headcount was in Taken. The subject matter is treated with great respect, and the horrors of it aren't down played at all. It's a brutal glimpse into the world of sex slave trafficking, and is not for the feint of heart. The movie has a very simple plot, a former CIA paramilitary has to use all of his skills to rescue his daughter, who becomes kidnapped while in Paris by a sex slave ring. With much trepidation he allows his daughter to go to Europe with her best friend, but he becomes visibly pissed when he finds out she actually went to follow U2 around Europe for the European leg of their tour. We learn pretty quick in the film, Liam's character is no one to mess with, as he very quickly and efficiently disarms a knife wielding attacker while working security at a concert for a big pop princess. While I enjoy shoot em ups as much as the next guy, I'm always more interested in what the hand to hand combat will be like. I have trained in the martial arts for many years, with the majority of those years studying the Filipino art of Kali, which is a weapons based art. So I'm very versed in the realities of knife fighting and empty hand combat in close quarter situations. To my great surprise, the empty hand choreography in Taken was fantastic, equally as good as the empty hand work in the James Bond film Casino Royale and the follow up. The fighting is in close, with short, but powerful strikes, and quick trapping/disarming techniques. Really well done close quarter fighting choreography.<br /><br />The acting in Taken is very good, but really this is not a drama, it's an action movie, and the director wastes no time getting going with the action. I would say 15 minutes into the movie and fun begins. This is a movie where you will really root for Liam's character, just because of the heinous nature of the villains he is fighting against. It's a joy watching him dispatch the human animals one by one, in many different fashions. My absolute favorite is a scene with a particularly nasty trafficker tied up to a makeshift electric chair and forced to give up information. I loved watching Liam flick the switch, and the end of the scene is just great! I won't give away the ending, but I will say anyone with any experience in the action movie genre, should know from the beginning how it's going to end. I just really liked Taken, it's a well done action flick. It doesn't require much thought, but it leaves you entertained from start to finish. Liam elevates the movie by his presence, and I'm not sure how well it would have worked without him. If you enjoy action movies with good acting, exciting hand to hand combat, cool technology, and a very fast pace, Taken is for you!</p></body></html>

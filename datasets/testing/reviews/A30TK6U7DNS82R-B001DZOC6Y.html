<meta name="summary" content="The Wind Cried Mary"></head><body><p>From the reviews I knew the movie was going to be a letdown, but we had fun watching it and got suckered in by the spooky, melancholy sound of the wind stirring the grass and the leaves at the top of the incredibly tall trees.  From that standpoint the film's technical credits get high marks.  I even liked James Newton Howard's score, but I have a weakness for overemphatic film music--at least I thought that Howard understood the plot of the film, possibly better than MNS himself.<br /><br />TIRAMISU SPOILER AHEAD!<br /><br />The movie made us examine our own lives as Plato urges us to do.  We walked a mile in the other man's moccasins thinking that if a rare virus sprung up on the wind and made us try to kill ourselves, how would we do it?  It's not as easy as it sounds!  Sure, you could slide a hatpin out of your long hair and stab yourself in the throat with it, but most of us don't have that sort of hair ornament.  You saw what happened when Philadelphia comes to a standstill and an armed cop falls to the ground, his pistol clattering on the cobblestones, and a woman picks it up, then the gun falls again, well, that gun gets a lot of use, it's because people are literally starving for ways to kill themselves.  First off, I decided, I would smoke a carton of cigarettes and enjoy a pitcher of margaritas...  then see what happened.  Maybe a heroin overdose?  In the movie we marvelled how the characters managed to off themselves using just the tools at hand, like McGyvers in revsrse--I never would have thought of lying down on the lawn and letting a mower tear me to shreds....  though jumping out of a building is a natural.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, Zooey Deschanel were all uniformly terrible, and Betty Buckley brought back memories of Carrie, where she played the girls' understanding gym teacher...  does she ever survive till the end credits in any of her movies?<br /><br />Most of all I thought M. Night misplayed Zooey Deschanel's secret.  We knew she was harboring a guilty secret, but why did it have to be something as banal as sharing a tiramisu dessert with "Joey"?  Why couldn't they have had sex like most guilty lovers?  Did he died for this dessert sin?  Or is he still alive at the end of the movie?  We were all ready for the twist ending in which it would be revealed that A;ma's pregnancy was the result, not of that one dessert date, but of a long campaign to drive Mark Wahlberg mad with their deceit--so the twist ending would be, "You told me you had dessert with him and now I found out youre having his baby!"  "But you seemed stressed otherwise I would have told you sooner, I just made up that part about the tiramisu."</p></body></html>

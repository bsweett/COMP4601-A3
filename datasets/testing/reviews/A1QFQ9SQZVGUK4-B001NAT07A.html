<meta name="summary" content="Not that bad of a movie."></head><body><p>Eventhough it completely goes against the Batman Catwoman, if you look at this film as an outside entity, then it really isn't that bad. I had my misgivings about the costume, but in this city, in this storyline...well it does work. Halle is serviceable as Catwoman and Sharon Stone is just plain embarassing as a washed-up model. I loved the scene where Catwoman was cracking her whip in the middle of that techno club. Scenes like that worked because it was able to stand on its own. On the flipside, the CGI effects were awful. It was like watching an X-box game on the big screen. The CGI cat that &quot;re-awakens&quot; patience was equally terrible and I was a bit bummed that the cat did not stick its head in her mouth liek the one in Batman Returns. In all, not as bad flick...but the true Catwomen are Julie Newmar and Michelle Pfeiffer.</p></body></html>

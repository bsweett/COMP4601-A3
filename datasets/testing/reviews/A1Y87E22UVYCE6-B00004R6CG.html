In that period he directed, amongst other films, "I Confess" (1953),  "Rear Window" (1954), "Vertigo" (1958), "Psycho" (1960) and "The Birds" (1963) any of them deserves to be ranked as "one of the best suspense movies" of all times.<br /><br />"Vertigo" touches many different subjects and Mr. Hitchcock blends them with masterful hand: a detective's story, paranormal experiences, love affair and obsession.<br /><br />From this mixture the Suspense Master extracts a film that keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat.  The story involves a retired police detective that is hired by an old acquaintance to follow his wife, which he suspects is going mad. From this start onwards events start to get complicated, pointing out to such weird issues as possession and compulsion.<br /><br />In a film with very few main characters, three of them give a hallmark performance: James Stewart as Det. Scottie Ferguson, Kim Novak as Madeleine Elster and Barbara Bel Geddes as Marjorie Wood.<br /><br />Stewart's Detective is a strange character in his filmography; he depicts a man troubled first by a vertigo syndrome, then deeply depressed and finally obsessed by a dead person. Not quite the "good and straight fellow" that he usually fleshes.<br /><br />Kim Novak is fascinating in her troubled, mysterious and dubious double impersonation of Madeleine and Judy. She gave the character a definitely sexy and classy touch.<br /><br />Barbara Bel Geddes as the "girl around the corner" in hopeless love with Scottie is just perfect.<br /><br />This is a film to be enjoyed by Hitchcock's fans and any detective or mystery film lover.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

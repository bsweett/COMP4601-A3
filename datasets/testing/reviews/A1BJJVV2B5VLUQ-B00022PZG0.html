Would you ask Picasso to sell his guitars?"></head><body><p>This was a script written for Jack Black... comic zaniness mixed with loads of classic head banging rock and roll. No doubt the hidden basis for this movie was so that Black could play his own music. Writer Mike White (Ned Schneebly in this film) nailed Jack Black (Dewey Finn) to a tee. The story follows Dewey shreading on a guitar solo (just a tad long and over done), and being exiled from the band the very next day. His roommate (Ned) and annoying girlfriend (Patty - played perfectly by Sarah Silverman) get on his case about responsibilities and paying the rent. Dewey receives a phone call at home one day (meant for Ned)... the high priced private elementary school needs a substitute teacher. Dewey acts as Ned - and the fun and musical fusion begin. This movie is a &quot;toast to those who rock!&quot; The main kids in the band, Zack-Freddy-Lawrence-Katie, are all accomplished musicians in their own right and were picked to play their roles for just this reason. Not to mention Joan Cusack was a great pick as Priniple Mullins. Musical tributes to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin abound. If you're a Jack Black fan, as well as a classic rock fan - I guarantee you will truly enjoy this film. Extras on this DVD include often funny commentaries with Black as well as the kids; a short pitch to Led Zeppelin for permission to use a song in the movie, trailers and a music video. Ever since Black was able to let loose in John Cusack's &quot;High Fidelity&quot;... I just look forward to everything he does. This is a great and upbeat movie for all audiences.</p></body></html>

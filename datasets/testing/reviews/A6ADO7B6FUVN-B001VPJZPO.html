<meta name="summary" content="Exceptionally Eerie Horror Lingers Far After the End..."></head><body><p>Skeleton Key delivers a fascinating horror film with a chilly atmosphere that forces the audience to peek behind the couch to see that there is nothing surprising sneaking behind.  It is with crawling motion that the film advances while it occasionally brings to mind the southern mood from Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).  However, it does not have any of the gore that director Robert Aldrich exploited in his 1960s psychological haunting tale.  Instead, Skeleton Key slowly builds up an eerie atmosphere that will reach its peak in the final crescendo where the film will subtly shake the audience's perception of reality in a profoundly spooky manner.<br /><br />Detached from society, the film opens in a nursing home; a place where many elderly people seek their final destination before parting from the living world.  Here Caroline Ellis (Kate Hudson) sits and reads out of Treasure Island for a man who is about to take his last breath to the fading words by Robert Louis Stevenson.  Unlike Stevenson who accomplished a literary success and fame left something behind while the man dies a lonely death without anyone caring about his existence.  The scene suggests several different notions, which also has to do with the film's main theme - death.  However, it also taps on the idea of dying an anonymous death, as if the person lived a meaningless or unknown existence.<br /><br />Caroline's desire to become a nurse for the elderly and those who soon will cross into the next world stems from her father's passing.  She missed her father's death, which has caused her to set out on her own mission by providing company to those who are about to pass on.  It is a noble thought, especially when the audience learns about the many people in Carloine's nursing homes that pass away without the care or affection of relatives at the final stage of their lives with nowhere to send the deceased's belongings.<br /><br />Through an ad in a newspaper, Caroline finds a good paying job, as a live-in hospice caretaker.  The drawback with the job is that it is located in the remote bayou south of New Orleans.  Nonetheless, she takes the job with the old couple Ben Devereaux (John Hurt) and Violet (Gena Rowlands), as she is supposed to care for Ben in his final stage of his life after having suffered from a serious stroke.  The couple lives in an old plantation manor that has seen its glory days a little less than a century ago, and where each room has a different lock on the doors.  In order to move around freely in the mansion she receives a skeleton key, as it can unlock all doors of the house.  The skeleton key also provides a symbolic notion of having the power to uncover secrets, which makes more sense in the end.<br /><br />Strange things begin to happen, as the supposedly paralyzed Ben has ability to grasp and occasionally make some form of communication.  Unhurriedly, Caroline discovers one secret after another such as a message for help and a hidden door in the attic.  With the skeleton key, Caroline has the power to unlock the secrets and to find out what is truly occurring at the Devereaux mansion.  Behind the locked door in the attic, she discovers strange and bizarre equipment.  These tools and trinkets including a creepy record somehow connect with hoodoo, a traditional magic that originated in the southern United States.  Hoodoo has its roots in African, European, and Native American folklore and botanical ingredients that a person applies to control supernatural forces to help with everyday life.  However, all of its power is meaningless, as it can only influence people foolish enough to believe in it.  The combination of supernatural forces and strange brews begin to unveil that the old man that she takes care for desperately tries to flee and get her help.  The question is how can she help him, and convince someone to believe her that magic is in the works.  The only person that she can turn to is the young lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard), who first has a hard time believing her.<br /><br />Skeleton Key displays a delightfully frightening atmosphere that intentionally lingers throughout the whole film, yet it also triggers the audience's curiosity.  However, the truly terrifying notion emerges after the film when the audience begins to ponder what happened in the end.  The director Iain Softley exhibits that a horror film can be thoughtful while also revealing that fear can be so much more than simple head chopping and serial killing.  In addition, Softley succeeds to bring together to opposite characteristics such as fear and curiosity that boil into an eerie nightmare that will haunt the audience in a cerebral manner.  Some elements within the film feel a little awkward during its progress.  However, these knotty moments smooth out through the clever ending, an ending that literary delivers the concept - "curiosity killed the cat."</p></body></html>

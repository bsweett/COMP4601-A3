<meta name="summary" content="Tom Cruise kills and Jamie Foxx is along for the ride"></head><body><p>Michael Mann returns with this edgy masterwork of a movie about an ordinary taxi driver who gets caught into the world of a contract killer. It was like any other day and night for taxi driver Max, a superb Jamie Foxx (RAY, Held Up) Foxx picks up a grey haired mysterious man named Vincent, played with ferocious intensity by Tom Cruise (the upcoming War Of The Worlds, The Last Samurai), and after he picks him up things start to turn a little weird. Cruise is a hitman, who needs to kill 5 people he was hired to kill, so Cruise takes Foxx hostage. A nicely done character study with the two stars giving one of their best and believe me Foxx gives it all his best and when is Cruise ever dull as a villain?. Lots of action and excitment especially the scenes when Cruise shoots someone. Mark Ruffalo (In The Cut, 13 Going On 30) and Peter Berg (The Last Seduction, Aspen Extreme) play cops on the case. Ruffalo looks in good form and Berg looks tired. Also starring along for the ride is Jada Pinkett Smith (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) who is the 5th mark on Cruise's list, Bruce Mc Gill (Animal House, Rosewood), Debi Mazar (Space Truckers, Nowhere), Bodhi Pine Elfman (Mercury Rising, Enemy Of The State), Javier Bardem (The Dancer Upstairs) and a quick and unbilled cameo by Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular) at the beginning. A fast ride worth taking. One of the best movies of the year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Release the Kraken!"></head><body><p>Mythology has always interested me even at a young age, the stories of mythical gods and creatures where and still are fascinating to me, Medusa, Pegasus, the Kraken and more.  It was only normal that I wanted to see what this movie made of these legends. This version of Clash of the Titans is a remake of the 1981 movie of the same name. Most film remakes today are criticized for particular reasons and this one falls into that category as well. Of course it's different from the original Class of the Titans, which is good because I don't want to watch a remake that's  exactly like the original, if I did I'd just watch the 1981 movie. As with almost every single remake this one left out some things but followed the story close enough, just not as well perhaps. I don't think this particular remake was awful or that it was excellent but it falls somewhere between the two, a good popcorn movie is a proper way of describing it.<br /><br />CotT follows Perseus, half-man, half-god and son of Zeus lives in a time where man thinks he is bigger than the gods and where prayers are not welcomed. Hades convinces Zeus to let him create conflicts between humans for them to convert back to the gods. Perseus being the son of god is said to be the savior of man and must fights titanic creatures to save his kind. Nothing complicated as far as storytelling goes. What's interesting is Perseus doesn't want to be acknowledged as the son of Zeus, he doesn't embrace his destiny even if he does what is expected of him. Those who are familiar with mythology already know that there some things are not totally accurate but the movie remains an entertaining one if you can get over that fact. The scenes where the action is, the fights against the creatures, are the high points obviously. The scene with Medusa was a highlight for me; I thought it was great that they kept her in the same way as the original.<br /><br />CofT has mostly been slammed by critics and didn't earn high ratings, here on Amazon it is currently rated an average of 3 stars which is a fair rating in my opinion and it is also how I rated the movie. To be honest this remake is entertaining but whereas the visuals were good the film falls short in the story department (I feel the story was executed in a better way in the 1981 version). Clash of the Titans is not a terribly bad movie but it's a little far from completely satisfying and it's hard not to compare with the 1981 original, which I feel is the better one. If you have seen the original or are simply interested in watching it I suggest that you do because it truly isn't as bad as some are reporting it to be, but I would advise to rent before buying. 3/5 stars.</p></body></html>

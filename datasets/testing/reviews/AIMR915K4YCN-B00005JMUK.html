The only reality she's ever known is that of abuse, violence, exploitation, rape, and utter betrayal. She is the product of years of hammering on the soul-destroying anvil of street-life and selling her body for money. Moments away from commiting suicide, Aileen meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci) in a bar and sparks fly, leading this hopeless woman to believe she might actually find happiness. Aileen attempts to run off with Selby and save her from her hyper-religious family. She hits the streets in order to make enough money for them to get away, only to be viciously attacked by a sadistic john, who is bent on torturing and killing her. Aileen shoots him to death in self-defense, which hurls her into a downward plunge that she'll never be able to escape. She becomes an avenging angel of death, executing johns and stealing their cash and cars.  Selby watches as Aileen falls deeper and more unreachably into darkness. However, this is not the typical Bundy / Dahlmer / Gacey serial-killer tale. Aileen Wournos is a sympathetic / empathetic character who kills not only out of rage and vengeance, but out of a sorrow so deep it has become lethal and uncontrollable. Based on the true story, MONSTER is the all-too-human tale of a desperate woman's last gasps before dying. It's not pretty, but it is totally genuine and believable. I kept rooting for Aileen and Selby to somehow rise above it all, even though I already knew the outcome. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

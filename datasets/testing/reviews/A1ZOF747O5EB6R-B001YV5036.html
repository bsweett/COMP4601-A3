It is a tale of heroism in the face of adversity, a victory of stoicism and a truly heart warming story.  It is far better than I expected and a credit to the direction of Ron Howard and the superb acting skills of Russell Crowe.<br /><br />The plot is based, as is said in Hollywood, on a true story.  James J. Braddock is an up and coming boxer in the late 1920s in America.  However, his rise to the top is plagued by injury until he loses his boxing license at the time the world was plummeting into the Great Depression.  Braddock's family is slowly worn down by the economics of the situation in which they find themselves.  Bills pile up, the power is cut off and hunger lurks.  Braddock is forced to beg for money to tide him over.<br /><br />When things look as though they can get no worse, Braddock is offered a one off fight for a $250 purse.  He leaps at the opportunity even though he is not fighting fit except for the benefit of having worked some time on the New York docks.  To everyone's surprise, including his, Braddock wins the fight.  The rest, as is said, is history.  Bigger prizes await.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film to all.  It has real cred while, at the same time, it tugs at the heart strings.  Russell Crowe is absolutely magnificent.  He is James J. Braddock.  Have no doubts, this is a great film!</p></body></html>

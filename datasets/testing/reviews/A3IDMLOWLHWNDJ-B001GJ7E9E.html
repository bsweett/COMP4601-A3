<meta name="summary" content="True Lies "Smith" Style"></head><body><p>"How many times hav-"<br /><br />"Ten."<br /><br />- Ten is the magic number for "Mr. & Mrs. Smith"<br /><br />"Mr. & Mrs. Smith" is one of those action films that survives on one thing - it's stars.<br /><br />The film opens with Mr. & Mrs. Smith in there first session of marriage counseling. The couple have been married for 5 to 6 years. They met in a third-world country, got married right off & had a happy homelife, at first. But with the ensuing years they both slowly became distant, succumbing to there hum-drum lifestyle.<br /><br />Business picks up when both of them find out a dark secret. Each of them is a trained assasin, working for competing firms. Of course both of them are angry at each other for not telling the other about this & what's worse their latest hit is each other. After the Smith's try to off each other unsuccessfully they decide to team up & figure out how to get out of the mess their in.<br /><br />"Mr. & Mrs. Smith" reminded ao much of the James Cameron film "True Lies" that I was waiting for the Govenator to make a guest appearance. From the dancing scene to Vince Vaughn's funny sidekick, I couldn't help but think that this must have been an early draft for "True Lies 2".<br /><br />The action scenes are pretty cartoonish & aren't to believable (that's an ongoing problem with action films today the bigger the bang the more unbelievable it is).<br /><br />Pitt & Jolie are fun to watch & are what make "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" worth the rent. Sadly, I can smell a sequel coming.</p></body></html>

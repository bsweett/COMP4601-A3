<meta name="summary" content="AN ASTONISHING MASTERPIECE 9.75 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Continuing the epic saga of Beatrix Kiddo, this movie basically tells how she finishes off the last three assassins who tried to kill her. While this movie is less violent than its predecessor, it's more story driven, but it doesn't feel any less epic in its massive scale. The action is still awesome, it's still humorous, and it's actually emotional. There is no way any real movie lover should hate this awesome movie. It's always greener when you try something totally out of the ordinary when it comes to movies.</p></body></html>

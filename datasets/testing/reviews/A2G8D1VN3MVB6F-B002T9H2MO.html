What this movie does, does and very, very well, is portray the feelings of the main character. This character is a lonely miner stuck on the moon. A man without any human interaction and working under a false assumption that he is himself. Through the movie he finds that what he thought was true is a lie, and then must deal with the emotional fallout of this realization. This is what this movie portrays so, so very well. So well, in fact, that you will feel his suffering and anger. Get this movie and see emotions on display with little being held back.</p></body></html>

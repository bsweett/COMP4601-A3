<meta name="summary" content="A Wonderful Adventure!"></head><body><p>With all the wonderful films that Pixar has produced over the years, it takes a special film to stand out among the others. Up is that film. I wasn't sure what to make of the preview, which featured this grumpy old man sitting on a porch of a floating house held aloft by thousands of baloons. The film is so much more than that. It's rediscovering the adventure of life when you think there's nothing left. The opening montage, which shows how two people meet, marry, and grow old together, is perfect. You understand how this old man is the way he is. The adventure begins when his home is threatened by urban development, and his ingenious and original way of dealing with it. Ed Asner is the absolute perfect choice for Mr. Frederickson, and all the voice actors are spot-on with their roles. The speaking dogs are wonderful, and how they speak is a refreshing take on how to portray talking animals. The visuals are stunning, which is what we've come to expect from Pixar, but these are exceptional. The attention to detail is down-to-the-minute-detail. I saw this film in 3D at the theater, which was an experience, and I maust say there really isn't anything lost in viewing it in regular play. The sound is just right, without over-whelming the voice tracks, which happens a LOT in movies anymore. You know what I mean; you're listening hard to catch the dialogue then get blow out the back wall by an explosion or gunfire. I didn't get that in this film. All in all, this film is one of Pixar's finest, and that says everything.</p></body></html>

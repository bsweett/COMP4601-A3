<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's direction turns this into a masterpiece"></head><body><p>I've seen this 1958 film before and was therefore familiar with the plot.  Watching it now, I was again impressed with its complexity and the way that Alfred Hitchcock made sure that the audience understood it.  Knowing the plot, however, added to my enjoyment of the film because I could relax and concentrate on the performances and the skill in which the entire film was put together.<p>Jimmy Stewart plays an ex-detective who's terrified of heights.  It's his Achilles heel and the bad guy in the story takes full advantage of this. Stewart's a fine actor and he's outstanding in this role, which requires him to show weakness and neurosis.  Kim Novak is cast in complex duel role, which calls for a both an icy mystery around her as well as earthy sensuality.  She's a competent actress, but she is so strikingly beautiful that her physical presence overshadows her acting abilities.  Barbara Bel Geddes is cast in a comedic role as a friend of Stewart's who can't hide her attraction for him. It's a small part and she plays it well.<p>It's the story itself and the way that Hitchcock directed it that drives the film and turns it into a masterpiece.  There are the camera angles and the sense of vertigo created by zooming forward and tracking backwards.  There's the use of color and filters to give a dreamlike quality to many of the scenes.  There's scrupulous attention to detail in the choice of costumes and there's hypnotic music throughout.  The DVD explains all this as well as the painstaking job of restoring the original film.  I was intrigued by it all as it added depth to my understanding. <p>I highly recommend Vertigo, especially on DVD.  It hasn't lost any of its original luster.  In fact, it's gotten even better through the years.</p></body></html>

It struck a chord with us armchair dreamers that with a little incidental knowledge of the most arcane trivia we could be instantly rich.  Some nights without the pressure of the lights and the goading of Regis I knew all the answers and others I exhausted all my lifelines by the $1,000.00 question.  Director Danny Boyle and scenarist Simon Beaufoy ingeniously tap into this wish fullfillment and transplant it to India, a country that contains some of the most unimaginable poverty.  Reading some of the other reviews it appears that their film runs the gamut of love it or hate it.  Some feel that they are exploiting the suffering in India for commercial gain.  Others react to the plaudits the film received at the Oscars this year.  I don't have an answer to either criticism.  I can tell you I was engrossed throughout.  I think the critical and commercial success of the film is a response to the Cinderella aspects of the story which serve as an anecdote to our tough economic times.  History is the ultimate judge of a film's artistic worth.  Divorce yourself from the hype and appreciate the innate qualities of "Slumdog Millionaire".</p></body></html>

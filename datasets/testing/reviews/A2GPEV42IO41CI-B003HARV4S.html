<meta name="summary" content=""Make us disappear!""></head><body><p>It is 1900 in Vienna, and the Chief Inspector (Paul Giamatti) is telling the story of a peasant boy who was once the secret playmate and love of little Countess Sophie; they planned to run away together, but their plan was discovered and they were separated.  The boy traveled the world and learned the secrets of magic, returning  home as "Eisenheim, the Illusionist" (Edward Norton).  He is reunited with the Countess (Jessica Biel) again, quite by accident, during one of his shows and they resume their romance, even though she is soon to marry the ruthless Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell).<br /><br />One never knows for sure what is real or illusion in this story, and it kept me guessing until the last scene.  Norton's powerful and  charismatic performance carries the film.  He has the piercing glare and smug confidence of someone who knows all the secrets and is quietly controlling all the action.  Giamatti's character is oddly compassionate and kind-hearted for someone with his power.  He should have been more menacing, like Sewell's completely odious Prince.  Both Giamatti and Norton attempt unconvincing European accents, the story is too long, and it would have been better with more romance, but I still enjoyed it.  The period sets and costumes are lovely and those who love magic will be delighted.</p></body></html>

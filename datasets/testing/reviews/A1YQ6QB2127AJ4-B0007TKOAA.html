<meta name="summary" content="A Hilarious Ride"></head><body><p>"Sideways" follows the journey of two middle aged men Miles and Jack as they drive to vacation before Jack walks down the aisle.  Jack determined to have one last fling gives this vacation a more problematic twist.  Miles is a wine expert, and he intises this hobby as he meets a local waitress who he has seen time by time.  Little do Miles and Jack know is that how their female finds will affect them in the next few days and even their lifetimes.  This becomes more than just a journey.  This is a journey of them finding themselves and why their lives are so dramatic.<br /><br />"Sideways" proceeded to win several awards, including two Golden Globes and one Oscar.  It stars Paul Giamotti ("American Splender"), Thomas Haden Church (TV's "Wings"), Virginia Madsen ("Candyman"), and Sandra Oh (TV's "Grey's Anatomy").  This film was well adapted from the book version with its soft-headed humor with a dramatic twist.  This unique storyline combines love, reflection, and alcohol finely.  It contains the style that of old-fashioned journey films and modernizes it with the alcohol hobbies.  This technique combines well with all of the themes and turn of events.  This allows the characters to have a motive to bond so well instead of just cause.  Therefore, this comedy is not just an action comedy; this is a thematic comedy.<br /><br />Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen make terrific comebacks in this film in their Oscar and Golden Globe nominated roles (both supporting performances).  Not just did they make comebacks; they performed the best roles in their careers.  Paul Giomatti proves his acting capabilities with the second consecutive outstanding performance in a film (the first being "American Splender").  His performance notes the overall film theme the truest.  Though Sandra Oh didn't receive many award nominations for this film, she still gave great essence to it like her fellow cast members.<br /><br />Such film quality gives "Sideways" the worthiness for becoming a classic in the following years.  It will surely continue pleasing many audiences as it already has.</p></body></html>

Kudos to director Luc Besson for putting together such an eye-popping, funny ( often hilarious ), adrenalin-charged rush of a space-opera. Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman are all excellent, but Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod steals every scene he's in. The CGI work on this film is spectacular. I loved it.</p></body></html>

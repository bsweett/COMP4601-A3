<meta name="summary" content="It's unbelievable"></head><body><p>Really - it is!<br /><br />The stunts in this movie range from "okay, that could happen" to "no freaking way", but the one thing it has going for it is the non-stop action.  Hunky Jason Statham is the main (the only) reason to watch this movie, and this time the delivery man with nerves of steel is slumming it as a chauffeur (as a favor to a friend).  Things get complicated when his young passenger is kidnapped, and the Transporter has to draw on his military training to get him back to his parents in one piece.<br /><br />The bad "guys" include the usual criminal mastermind who knows martial arts, and an assortment of goons in various sizes and shapes, but when we get to the pistol-packing babe in the underwear and the dumb and disheveled looking dude who's supposed to be a scientist, you can feel your eyebrows heading towards your hairline.  Fortunately, you're so busy watching Statham do his thing that you can actually swallow the storyline, killer virus scenario and all.<br /><br />Matthew Modine and Amber Valletta do their best with this jaw-droppingly impossible plot, but Statham again saves the day.  Forget reality for eighty seven minutes or so, and let the Transporter do his thing.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 5, 2006</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A horrible mutilation of the book"></head><body><p>Fuqua has turned Hunter's thoughtful book into a nutcake leftist fantasy where the baddies are all greedy, piglike Republicans. It could still have been otherwise entertaining, but the result is neither terribly thrilling nor intelligent; unlike the book, the action doesn't showcase Swagger's smarts, and his sidekick dons a Che T-shirt - perhaps to honor the gay-killing murderer? Fans of Hunter's books (and Fuqua's previous movies) will be repulsed by this rabid drivel.</p></body></html>

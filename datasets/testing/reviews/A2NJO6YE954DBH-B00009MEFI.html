<meta name="summary" content="If you hear a pay phone ringing, just leave it alone..."></head><body><p>In &quot;Phone Booth&quot; a fast-talking, two-timing Broadway press agent named Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) stops at his regular phone booth to call the young wannabee actress he wants to be his mistress (Katie Holmes) so that it does not show up on his cell phone bill where his wife can see the number.  But as soon as he hangs up--and refuses delivery of a pizza--there is a second phone call and a voice telling him what to do and what to say or else he is going to be shot.  Everyone should know the situation from the trailers and recognizes the voice on the other end of the phone as belonging to Keifer Sutherland, which is enough to take the situation very seriously.  Stu takes a bit longer to be persuaded and by then he is into this situation so deep that there looks like there is no hope of ever getting out of it. <p>&quot;Phone Booth&quot; is only 81 minutes long, which makes sense since Stu gets himself into this situation pretty quickly and since the intensity is on high for almost the entire film.  This is not a film where you try to figure out what is really going on and why the voice on the other end of the phone is playing out this twisted little game with Stu.  After all, can you really believe anything said by somebody who is holding a gun on you?  What the voice wants does not matter.  The question is how many people are going to be dead when this one is over.  The motivation is secondary in a thriller such as this one.  <p>At first I thought that Sutherland's voice work is too good, because director Joel Schumacher does not filter the voice through a phone so that we hear it the way Stu would.  Instead we hear Sutherland's voice clearer than we hear Farrell's.  But then it dawned on me that doing this was to help force the viewer more into the perspective of a voyeur.  After all, since we do not know where the sniper is which means that any and all camera shots could be his perspective.  <p>In the final analysis, what makes this film work for me is the character of Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker), the cop who shows up to take charge of the situation and tries to find out what is going on instead of jumping to conclusions.  As was the case in &quot;Panic Room,&quot; I very much appreciated the idea that there are smart cops out there who do their jobs the way they should be done.  What really saves &quot;Phone Booth&quot; from being a two-dimensional film is when Ramey turns the dyad into a triad.</p></body></html>

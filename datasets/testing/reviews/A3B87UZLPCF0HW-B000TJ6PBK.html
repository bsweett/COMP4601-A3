<meta name="summary" content="I liked it-good acting by Cusack....."></head><body><p>This movie was made from a short story by Stephen King, 1408 is like a minibar version of Stanley Kubrick's take on The Shining: everything that made that film great has been reduced here into something smaller in scale that's easier to consume but significantly less satisfying. Another film about a writer being driven insane by an evil hotel, it offers a refreshing stop-over for horror fans seeking a rest from the torture porn excesses of Saw and Hostel, yet boasts none of the complexity, the intellectual nourishment or the intense creepiness of Kubrick's thematically similar horror masterpiece.<br />What it does have in its favour is John Cusack.<br />He plays Mike Enslin, a failed novelist who has managed to make a living debunking the presence of ghosts, ghouls and poltergeists in a series of bestselling guidebooks to America's most haunted hotels. His usual trick is to travel to some roadside motel where he'll be eagerly greeted by proprietors ready to regale him with tales of grizzly suicides and malign spirits haunting the rooms. He then tries to settle in for a good night's sleep, after making some effort towards, if not quite professionalism, then at least taking the job half-seriously.<br />This all changes when he receives an anonymous postcard imploring him not to enter room 1408 in Manhattan's upscale Dolphin hotel. His interest suitably piqued, he calls up to reserve the room, only to be told it's unavailable - at all times. With the aid of his publisher's legal team, however, he manages to secure a reservation and flies from his home in California to check in, only to be greeted by the hotel's creepily officious manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), who pleads with him to take an alternative suite.<br />His reasoning is simple---Four people have died horrible deaths under his watch and, in its 95-year existence, a litany of people have lost their lives by torturous means. Nevertheless, Mike is determined to check in and, sensing he's fighting a losing battle, Olin allows him to do so, ominously leaving him at the room's door to face a whole host of personal demons and malevolent spirits.<br />Once he's shut off and isolated in the room, Cusack is also the kind of actor you don't mind spending the majority of a movie with, and he's great when Mike's cynicism gives way to disbelief and outright terror. The film has a few neat touches, too--I won`t give then away....<br />It's too bad the film eventually goes overboard with CGI effects, but heck it kept me interested for a couple of hours.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good Atlas"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good movie.<br /><br />I think the biggest and most important thing is that Brandon Routh makes a great Superman.  Maybe it's his unknown status, maybe it's his lookalike affinity with Christopher Reeves, but he fits and plays the iconic character pretty much to the T.<br /><br />The other characters, not so much, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were bad.  Kevin Spacey was a brilliant Lex Luthor, but Spacey's bad misfortune is to have a very recognizable face.  He's... Kevin Spacey.  However, the baldness suited him and he really did seem to move around comfortably in Luthor's shoes, so to speak... sometimes acting very chillingly.  Kate Bosworth did a good Lois Lane, but I must say that this movie really made me dislike the character.<br /><br />I don't remember Kitty from anywhere, but that is one great character, especially as a foil to Luthor.  Her ditziness can get annoying, but the way it helps one underestimate her character is actually one of the better parts of the movie.  I can say that Kitty stole the show with this one, though nobody else ever mentions her.<br /><br />Many people told me this movie was too long before I went to see it, but it's really not.  I hardly noticed the playlength.  That, to me, is a sign of a good, well-paced movie.  I didn't really get too much into story as a whole or even the action, it was mostly the characters and especially the exploration of the very iconography that interested me.  I think the most commonly seen image in this movie is Superman holding the weight of the world... various forms of the image "the world"... on his shoulders.  It's a very intriguing image, I must say.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></body></html>

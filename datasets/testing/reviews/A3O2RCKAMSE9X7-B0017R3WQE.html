<meta name="summary" content="Tony Montana: I Don't Need Nobody--Yes You Do"></head><body><p>SCARFACE is more than just a modernized excessively violent and profane updating of the Depression era original.  Al Pacino as Tony Montana speaks volumes about the need for people to connect to reach other, even on the most superficial of levels.  Montana is speaking to his best friend Manuel (Stephen Bauer) and tells him, "Do you know when you've made it? When you make enough money for people to come to you.  The broads, the cars, the coke, they are just symbols of the money."  To a certain extent, Montana repeats the ages old belief that even if money can't buy love, it can rent it.  The renting of love implies that the possession of material objects is done alone, hence Montana's oft repeated refrain: "I don't need nobody."  Those who come to a bad end in this film are usually the same ones who have taken that credo to heart and the audience wastes no tears over their demise, but director Brian DePalma includes two who do come to a bad end not because they embrace that money-oriented philosophy, but because they get too close to those who do.  Both of these are coincidentally enough, the same two who are closest to Tony  Montana, his friend Manuel and his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  Each was raised in a glittery age of 'me-first' longings, but both instinctively recognize that true happiness consists in needing others to share a communal life.  For Manuel and for Gina, they reach out across a blood divide that demands that Tony lethally forbid his cronies from forming personal relationships with his family.  The extreme profanity and dozens of well-photographed killings are so stylized that they take on a life of their own and tend to hide the film's moral center, that a life of crime based on the need to possess things rather than on one that requires shared effort is fated to wind up with either getting killed by mafia assassins or by one's best friends.  In either case, SCARFACE makes it clear that in any culture that prizes possessions over people, the result is a glitzy death for one or a tragic death for the other.</p></body></html>

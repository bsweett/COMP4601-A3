<meta name="summary" content="release the alien"></head><body><p>Spielberg and J.J. Abrams got together to do homage to the former's earlier adventure time and alien movies and filming old school style and then used a bunch of CGI effects to do it. Did they want to say, see CGI can be used to create the same experience?<br />J.J. Abrams Loves flare. (Flare are the flashes of light across the screen that occur from reflection on the lens. It is gay especially when excessively present, which it is).<br />This movie is loaded out the hole with metaphors for coming of age psychological-social drama. In small town USA. The train carrying the monster alien crashes into the kids as love/lust blossoms. The girl and boy and their two daddies' conflict and the mother's death.. Girl tells boy not to give up his train for the domineering fat boy. The oppressed alien is released from it's subterranean dwelling, builds it's rocket ship on the town's tallest structure and launches off -after the boy tells the alien it can live and be free. The town is destroyed in the process and the ultimate symbol of society's repressive, overwhelming force (the military) is overcome. And if you aren't paying attention you still get the scene when the boy symbolically lets go of the chain his mother gave him and it becomes part of the alien's ship.<br />Maybe it worked better on paper.</p></body></html>

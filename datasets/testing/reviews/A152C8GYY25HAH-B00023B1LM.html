<meta name="summary" content="Well made, interesting spy thriller"></head><body><p>"The Bourne Identity" is a well-crafted, reasonably intelligent spy thriller that is akin to the classics made in the 1960s and 1970s. It has high energy moments, like an elaborate auto chase through the streets of Paris, but it eschews the flashy, over-produced special effects of movies like `XXX' in favor of greater focus on the characters and the story. While the plot has a number of hard to believe elements to it, it's still intriguing enough to keep an audience well entertained. <p>The crew of a fishing vessel discovers an unconscious man [Matt Damon] floating in the water off the coast of France. He has two bullets in his back and an odd little gadget sewn into his hip. The man recovers physically but is plagued by amnesia. Using the gadget, the captain learns that their passenger has a numbered bank account in Switzerland. Later, after making his way to Zurich, the confused victim finds out he is John Borne, American resident of Paris. It's more complicated than that, though, because he also uncovers several other passports. Is he Borne, is he someone else, or is he all of these identities? At the American Consulate, he learns one more thing: He is a wanted man whom some group wants to assassinate. Enlisting the aid of a German girl, Marie [Franka Potente], he makes his way to Paris. There, both he and Marie are in even greater danger. He establishes that he was a CIA agent, and, as his memory slowly returns, he comes to understand that he was anything but a nice guy. <p>Damon does a great job of playing an action hero. It's an interesting role for him, almost but not quite as multi-layered as his part in "The Talented Mr. Ripley'. He and Potente make an excellent on screen couple, both in the action scenes and the romantic ones. <p>The movie was directed by Doug Liman, who also did the cult classic "Swingers" and the wonderful [and little seen] "Go". He brings a modern feel to an old genre. Adding to the film's appeal is the excellent photography, which was done on location in Paris, Prague, Switzerland and Greece.</p></body></html>

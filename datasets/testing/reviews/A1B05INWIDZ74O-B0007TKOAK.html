<meta name="summary" content="Bachelor Party"></head><body><p>This movie centers on four characters. The two main characters are the two old college odd-couple buddies Jack (Thomas Haden Church) and Miles (Paul Giamatti) hit the road for Jack's last week of freedom before his wedding. Jack is an actor who was on a daytime soap opera once, but now does voiceovers for commercials. And Miles is a mid-school English teacher who fancies him self a novelist.<br /><br />Miles thinks he is going to introduce his friend into marriage with a tour of the wine country and some golf. While Jack has no morals and wants to just go wild party every night. They both hook up with woman played by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. While Jack is getting him self deeper into to trouble each day, Miles is just standing at the edge of life and is waiting to be pushed back into it.<br /><br />I would have given the movie three stars instead of four, but the acting is superb in this movie. Paul Giamatti is at his best. The movie not only has a plot, but some subtext as well. A well-written script, well edited for timing and flow.</p></body></html>

Robert Downy plays Harry, a man from out east who had a less than desirable past thrust into the hollywood scene by accidently stubling into a casting call after a botched robbery.  The role that the call was for is a detective part, he manages to get selected, and then has to shadows Val Kilmer, AKA Gay Perry, a detective who gets pushed into his biggest case that he never expected, dragging Harry with him.  Along the way they meet Michelle Monaghan at a party, who is an old friend of Harry's from Indiana.  Of course, the stories continue to get more conveluded and intertwined as the body count goes up, to an ending that is a nice surprise.  Funny, entertaining, suspenseful, a movie that could have been promoted more by the company.  Rent it now, buy it now, either way, you will be happy.</p></body></html>

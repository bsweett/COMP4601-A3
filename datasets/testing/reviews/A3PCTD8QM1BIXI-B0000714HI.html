From the opening spoof AustinPussy one knows it's gonna be a great film. The jokes are on taregt , the script is witty and the cameos are great.Beyonce does a good acting job, despite what the critics said as her performances really just requires her to be eye candy. All in all a fun film.</p></body></html>

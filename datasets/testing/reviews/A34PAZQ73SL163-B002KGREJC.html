Ellen Page is absolutely magnificent in the central role and Michael Cera fit well the part he plays. Personally, I was a bit skeptical of Juno's essence as a character. She struck me as being partially a male fantasy of what a girl would be like as it's improbable that a high school kid nowadays would have anywhere near the type of musical education she possesses (or walk around with an unlit pipe in her mouth). Page's Juno is highly engaging as a personality and it's hard to take your eyes off of her though. Also, I thought Jennifer Garner and Justin Bateman put in solid backup performances. Juno is entertaining and fun even if its intricacies sometimes make it a challenge to suspend disbelief.</p></body></html>

She was such a happy person with so much joy to look forward too. She was marrying a man who shared the same amount of energy towards her as she him. They just completely exhibited such completeness. This was so well acted because you only had a few scenes with them both but you got the vibe so well before the actual tragedy hits. The impact leaves Erica played by Foster, in such a way that it takes her identity and reshapes her into a person who is without any of herself much glimpsed. When she goes out into the city after experiencing ptsd, the visuals are used in such a way that reflects trauma. The way the camera plays on the ptsd hits home. The loud sounds, the hyperviglance the way Erica holds her body, all shows what happens after an event that scars an individual. Her reactions to her job and people take on a drastic change and she does seem shut down and on pilot, living her life with impulsive acts of violence. She realizes this and seems to want to be punished for the actions of crime she has committed. There is a dissociation that can be seen in her, and people who have experienced a tramatic event can relate to this. She seems to be impacted by two people and other than them she seems cut off from the world. A detective and a neighbor seem to impact her with words of wisdom that hit home. She seems so angry but it is repressed. When she talks about the killings that have yet to disclose the perpatrator who is secretly her, she seems to be disgusted by the uncaring remarks of her radio audience, they disregard humanity and lack compassion, which suggests a polarity or a split in her. I liked the identification I had with the character and her meditation and reflection in healing. I loved her depth in her words and how she portrayed herself towards the detective and on her radio program. The moment was stronger cus of the impact her words made on others and almost felt like prose. The movie had a dark depth of spirituality to it and even had Sarah Mclauglin music, this particular singer gives off that aura. The movie has the buildup of  revenge and sadness. The movie could be a turnoff to some but the darkness makes it different and creative. The beautiful relationship between the two as reflected in the hospital scene again shows the polarity between pain and exquisite pleasure. A very engrossing film.</p></body></html>

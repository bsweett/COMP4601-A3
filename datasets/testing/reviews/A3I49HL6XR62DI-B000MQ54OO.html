<meta name="summary" content="Great fun, but a warning for parents!"></head><body><p>This animated feature is very unusual. Directed by the great Australian film maker George Miller (Mad Max, Road Warrior), it is thoughtful, endearing, funny and, at times, surprisingly dark. It's an all-singing, all-dancing version of March of the Penguins with adorable vocalizations by Elijah Wood (Mumble), Robin Williams (Ramon and Lovelace), Britney Murphey (Gloria), Hugh Jackman (Memphis) and Nicole Kidman (Norma Jean, Mumble's mom). You have to see it to believe it and you will either love it or you won't get it. I loved it. Caution: the killer whales and the elephant seals (with Aussie accents) are very realistic and pretty scary. The leopard seal is absolutely terrifying. Parents should exercise caution with very small children. But Mumble is the cutest and older kids will love his incredible journey as he teaches the worlds of nature and man to co-exist. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

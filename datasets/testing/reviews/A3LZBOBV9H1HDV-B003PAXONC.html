This is how the story goes: Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable...and manmade. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City...and maybe the world. But he is not alone. He is surrounded by "the Infected" -- victims of the plague who have mutated into carnivorous beings who can only exist in the dark and who will devour or infect anyone or anything in their path. For three years, Neville has spent his days scavenging for food and supplies and faithfully sending out radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. All the while, the Infected lurk in the shadows, watching Neville's every move, waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But his blood is also what The Infected hunt, and Neville knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time. The cast led by Will Smith (as Robert Neville) is excellent! The directing by Francis Lawrence (who also directed "Constantine" (2005) is great! The screenplay, (which is based on the novel by Richard Matheson, and the 1971 screenplay of "The Omega Man" by John William Corrington & Joyce Corrington) by Mark Protosevich (who also wrote the screenplay to "Poseidon" (2006) and the story and screenplay to "The Cell" (2000) & Akiva Goldsman (who also wrote the screenplay to "I, Robot" (2004) and the upcoming "Hancock" (2008), both which also starred or stars Smith), he also produced "Constantine", "Poseidon", & the upcoming "Hancock") is excellent! The music by James Newton Howard (who also did the music to "King Kong" (2005), "Michael Clayton" (2007), "The Lookout" (2007) and the upcoming "Charlie Wilson's War" (2007) & "The Great Debaters" (2007), he also is doing the music to the upcoming "The Happening" (2008) & "The Dark Knight" (2008) is excellent! The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (who also did the cinematography to the "Lord Of The Rings" (2001, 2002, & 2003) trilogy & "King Kong", he also did the cinematography to the upcoming "The Lovely Bones" (2009) is excellent! The film editing by Wayne Wahrman (who also did the film editing to "Constantine") is great! The casting by Kathleen Chopin (who also did the casting to "Hitch" (2005), which also starred Smith) is excellent! The production design by Naomi Shohan (who also did the production design to "Constantine" and the upcoming "The Lovely Bones") & David Lazan (who also  an art director for "Constantine") is excellent! The art direction by William Ladd Skinner (who also did the art direction to "Mr. Brooks" (2007), "Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End" (2007), & "Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" (2006) & Patricia Woodbridge (who also did the art direction to "Hitch") is excellent! The set decoration by George DeTitta Jr. (who also did the set decoration to "Michael Clayton" & "Enchanted" (2007), he also did the set decoration to the upcoming "The Lovely Bones") is excellent! The costume design by Michael Kaplan (who also did the costume design to the upcoming "Star Trek" (2008) is great! This is an great sci-fi horror-thriller that keeps your heart pounding and your mind thinking. This is one of the better Will Smith action-type movies in recent history.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A game with a finale that you simply don't see coming"></head><body><p>It all starts with loving, and with visiting people you love to show off just how much you care. Then it progresses to the bizarre, with a man that almost acts as a force of nature plowing into your home. Invading your sanctum, taking apart everything you are, replacing it with the little pictures he keeps in his delapidated truck. Him, with his overexaggerated features and his thick arms and legs, torturing you and the person you love. and yet - there is always more buried underneath the surface.<br /><br />When I first saw high Tension, I was not certain that I agreed with the conclusion of the film. Do not worry - I will not spoil it - i hate it when that happens. I am simply commenting on the way the movie went and the way it turned and tossed, like a ragged infant in a bed filled with anger. It was a mad movie, too, filled with great acting and terror and torment most foul. It was simply the thing at the end, the part you did not see coming, that took this watcher aback.<br /><br />I am not going to say it hurt the movie that much, either. Some will say it did, partly because they could not perdict it and partly because it is one of those oddling things, but it also has a nice impact in a lot of ways. There is sheer terror in it, madness too, and that is brillant in a lot of ways. I did not see it coming and would not have guessed it. I am not certain it is made for you to figure out.<br /><br />If you like foreign and you like Hitchcokian madness, this is a great way to play. It will make you guess and keep you wondering, then reward you with a little taste of weird. I liked it and more the second time around, until I felt like I had been rewarded by multiple viewings. A 5/5 on that side of it alone, not to mention the rest.<br /><br />Thank you and I hope you like it. It had some really odd toys that came out with it, like a toy baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire and little buttons and other things if you also want them. They are still there to find if you are so inclined.</p></body></html>

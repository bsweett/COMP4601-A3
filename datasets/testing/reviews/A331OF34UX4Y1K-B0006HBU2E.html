IT seems all of the critics are getting bribbed....<br /><br />It's absurd. They hailed this movie as a "smart action flick", "one that has brains", "better than the original". Don't believe all these lies. Whatever merits this movie may have, they are ruined by one single fact: THE EDITING OF THIS MOVIE SUC..S!! It's the worst I've seen in a long time. It's video clip / MTV edition all the way, you can not follow the car chase or the fights. It's annoying, really annoying. The camera don't star  "firm" in position for more than one half of a second<br /><br />The lack of quality of the story is another point. It's much less, I mean MUCH LESS, suspenseful than the first one. Youc an see miles away waht happened.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie wven for rental.</p></body></html>

During decades, directors and screenwriters have presented -some with more success than others- stories about justice ups and downs, stories about facts and circumstances that often become stiff machinations where the blind lady wins, others not so much. That's why when I went to see Michael Clayton, my hopes weren't too high, since I thought I would find the same worn out formula: two lawyers, a villain, and the classic confrontation in a courtroom with a foreseeable and boring verdict.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />And my first mistake was to tag Michael Clayton as a legal thriller. Yes, it's about lawyers; yes, it has lots of suspense, and yes, it's a drama, but it's so much than the meaning of all these words. All thanks to his director, Tony Gilroy, who has outsmarted all those movie clich&eacute;s we've seen for 30 years. Instead of that, the director has weaved several subplots in a story that unfolds slowly but in a way that keeps us alert and interested, filling in the blanks, without losing emotion.<br /><br />George Clooney is Michael Clayton. A man that works in the shadows, solving other peoples problems, without much glory. Clayton is the best fixer, but behind his apparent success lays a man troubled with debt, vice, a failed marriage, family issues and above all, tired of his lifestyle and a job that doesn't bring any satisfaction.<br /><br />Clayton's life complicates when a colleague and friend, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), suffers a nervous breakdown that jeopardizes one of the firm's most important clients. Clayton is sent to control the situation, but he finds an Arthur decided to reveal the dirty laundry on their client.<br /><br />Conscience is the main theme in Michael Clayton, since the characters expose the weariness produced by selling it to the highest bidder. However, the movie doesn't try to criticize the human behavior, but shows the situations and surprises given just by taken the right choice, and to see what others are capable of doing when you stop following their game.<br /><br />All the actors are at the top of their game in Michael Clayton, not a single performance is wasted. Director Tony Gilroy presents his message in an no-nonsense way, and even though it appears he gives us a climatic finale of justice served, the last scene leaves us with an image of Michael Clayton that puts in our mouth a sweet and sour flavor, the very same we have when found ourselves winners in a war that's already lost.</p></body></html>

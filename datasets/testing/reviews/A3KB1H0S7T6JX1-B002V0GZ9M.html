<meta name="summary" content="Guaranteed to shed a tear!!!"></head><body><p>An extraordinary movie, The Lake House, brings to the screen the story of a man and a woman who somehow manage to communicate through letters (and fall in love with each other) even though they are two... years apart!<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Lake House is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></body></html>

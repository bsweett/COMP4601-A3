"A Clockwork Orange" was adapted from a novel by Anthony Burgess, who based some of the events in the book on the brutal rape of his wife.  Stanley Kubrick, the director, pulled this film from release in his adopted country, England, after there were copy-cat crimes based on incidents depicted in the film.  His concern was the heinous acts portrayed in the film would be mis-interpreted by impressionable minds.  In the United States, this film was originally given an "X" rating, prohibiting anyone under seventeen from viewing it.  On a personal note I saw this film(repeatedly) as a teenager and the selling point to me was how cool the stylized violence was portrayed in the film.  Preaching aside, this is a great film for adults.  The story, set in an undetermined future, where youth gangs rule the streets of England.  One particular gang,or "droogs", is led by the charismatic Alex(Malcolm McDowell) who enjoy nothing more than assaulting homeless people, pinching autos, raping women,and just general mayhem.  After accidently killing a woman in a breaking and entering, Alex is imprisoned.  To his fortune or misfortune he is selected by the present government to receive treatment that would involuntarily supress his propensity for violence.  Released from prison without the free-will to protect himself from the malevolent forces who would prey on him, Alex is victimized.  The question that has to be asked by discerning viewers is does this film concern itself with free-will or is is it just an excuse for displaying stylized, choreographed violence?  I would have to say this film does effectively navigate itself on the side of free-will.  The rationale for the prettiness of some of the violence is that the story is told in the first person, as it was in Burgess' novel.  We have to see violence as Alex sees it and Alex loves violence.  McDowell does a charismatic turn as Alex and is supported by a fine cast(Patrick Magee, Miriam Karlin, etc.).  The art-deco look, the editing, the cinematography, the music(including moog classical by Wendy Carlos) is excellent.  Kubrick further cemented his reputation as the top director in films at the time and also contributed a superior screenplay.  A lot of the dialogue in the film is in "nadsat", a hybrid of English slang and Russian.  In the novel, Burgess uses an appendix to explain some of the terms but Kubrick effectively conveys here the meaning of a lot of these terms.  On a final note, the film ends somewhat ambiguously where Alex states "I was cured alright".  This corresponds with the ending that appeared in the American editions of Burgess' novel.  The British version contains an additional chapter that only appeared recently in America where it would appear that Alex repudiates his old ways.</p></body></html>

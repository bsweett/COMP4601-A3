This is no masterpiece, but not a terrible flick.  Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play characters who have little in common, save for the fact that they each have diagnoses of terminal cancer. To pack as much life as possible into their limited time, they collaborate in writing a "Bucket List," a to-do list of things to do before they die:  skydiving, car-racing, world travel, etc.  In the end, the Grim Reaper wins out but not before the characters find meaning in their lives.<br /><br />Of course, such an endeavor is facilitated if you leave your family or have a multimillionaire buddy and a private jet to bankroll such a quest.  You must suspend your disbelief for much of this movie.  For example, Nicholson's character has his head shaved but is in the hospital long enough for his hair to grown back.  What kind of HMO is he on?  The movie's end is somewhat of a formulaic tearjerker, so have some Kleenex on hand.<br /><br />In the end,  we are all terminal.  We do not know if we have days or decades left to live.  Perhaps this movie will inspire viewers to compose their own "Bucket List" and get busy living their dreams.  Not a masterpiece, but not a bad movie either.</p></body></html>

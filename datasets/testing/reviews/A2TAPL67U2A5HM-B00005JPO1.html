Try as he might, the magic of Indy is just not there. The storyline is just all-right and the the dialogue so so. The special effects are good but nothing that I have not seen before. Overall an film that is just descent. However, this is just the problem. An Indiana Jones film should be awesome. Still I give it a 3 out of 5.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you believe in love at first sight,you never stop looking"></head><body><p>"Closer" begins quite traditionally: two strangers fall in love. Dan (Jude Law), an aspiring novelist, cannot help but feeling immensely attracted to Alice (Natalie Portman), a young American waitress and stripper who is in London escaping from a failed relationship. But nothing last forever, and after some time he meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer, and feels attracted to her. The film's subtitle says it all: "If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking".<br /><br />Nothing happens right away, but from then onwards, things go downhill for Alice and Dan. Yes, they don't break up, but Dan is already mentally involved in another relationship, even if he is too coward to leave Alice, and although he knows that Anna won't go out with him. Dan is so obsessed with Anna that he even impersonates her in a sex-chat, unintentionally paving the way for the meeting of Anna with her future husband, Larry (Clive Owen).<br /><br />Eventually Dan, Alice, Anna and Larry take part in a twisted dance of deceit, guilt and anger. Betrayal, lack of trust, and relationships gone sour are the themes of "Closer". This isn't  a movie about love, but rather one about attraction, lust and lies.<br /><br />What is the truth?. What is love?. Can we just decide not to be in love?. As you see this movie, you will ask yourself those questions and quite a few more. The characters are not specially lovable, but they are somehow fascinating, in the way snakes sometimes are. All the same, their acting is really superb. Natalie Portman, in particular, was outstanding as Alice. Innocent yet seductive, vulnerable and worldweary, Portman delivers some of the more striking lines in the film, for instance when Alice says to Larry that "lying is the most fun a girl can have while keeping her clothes on".<br /><br />Mike Nichols did a wonderful job directing a movie out of Patrick Marber's play. However, you should be warned that he uses explicit language in order to shock the spectator, and achieves his aim quite well. Also, at times the emotions displayed by the characters are so strong that you will be too close for comfort.<br /><br />This is a film about the kind of relationship you hope you will never have, one based on lies. It is also a movie where truth isn't specially important: it is merely a excuse so characters will have (and do) what they want. If you don't mind the subject and the language, you will enjoy this movie, because it has good actors, and it provides you the opportunity of knowing exactly what NOT to do in a relationship.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

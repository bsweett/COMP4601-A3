<meta name="summary" content="&quot;This Planet Crawls&quot;...unfortunately, so does the film."></head><body><p>Yes, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; does weave a fairly strong (and clever) anti-fascist theme into its storyline, and features some brilliant special effects, but unfortunately, it's not enough to overcome a lame script and  some of the worst acting in recent years.<p>Think of a Roger Corman flick  with $100 million in special effects and you get the idea. <p>Let's start  off with the good stuff: &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; features truly  harrowing and effective visuals - some of the best in recent years. And  director Paul Verhoeven has always been great at weaving a tale of a  moderately warped future, and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, with its'  neo-fascist ideas (check the uniforms - Gestapo all the way!) and strong  hint of genetic perfection (nobody is fat or ugly, and nobody has pimples),  does get some sly shots in at the goose stepping/master race crowd.  <p>Also, check out the terrific score by Basil Poledouris (who also did  &quot;The Hunt for Red October), with its fascist propaganda-ministry  overtones. It sounds like recruiting music for the armed forces, and works  VERY well. <p>But these strong points are countered by a weak script (best  line: &quot;This planet crawls!&quot;) and  hack performances by Casper Van  Dien and Denise Richards (not to mention Neil Patrick Harris, best known as  TV's Doogie Howser, as a supersecret government spook). Only Dina Meyer,  who plays one of Van Diem's soldier cohorts, displays any kind of depth;  she gives her character, Diz, a nice mix of toughness and  vulnerability.<p>Then there's the techno-gaffes. The producers of this film  would have us believe that mankind has mastered faster than light travel,  but can't stop meteors from hitting the earth? And why send in millions of  humans to basically uninhabitable planets when they can just blow up the  planets and the bugs with them? They can't just flood the planets with  Raid?<p>But &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; isn't about the science in  science fiction. It's a blow-em-up, and works well on that level, but with  decent actors and a better script, Verhoeven could have used his visual  inventiveness and keen satirical edge to make a far better movie.</p></body></html>

He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXS">Jurassic Park III</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031EGV">Jumanji</a>), so I thought that with Johnston at the helm for The Wolfman, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for The Wolfman sure made it seem like at least the action and the scares would be there, but ultimately I found The Wolfman very slow-moving and hardly scary.<br /><br />For a "monster movie", I want a lot of monster. Johnston's Director's Cut runs for a full two hours, and I'd say that there's a monster(s) on screen for maybe about 25% of the two hours. The rest of the movie is a bunch of boring Benicio Del Toro lumbering around looking more like that character Anton Chigurh from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011BE3K0">No Country for Old Men</a> than Larry Talbot. Except when Chigurh was on screen in No Country you paid attention, when mild mannered Talbot is on screen in Wolfman someone better be there to pinch you if you want to be awake when some action finally starts.<br /><br />And surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Anthony Hopkins and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that a lack of action might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are miscast and gravely underused in The Wolfman.<br /><br />So my recommendation is to skip The 2010 version of The Wolfman, perhaps check out the original if you've never seen it, but if you want a really good werewolf story, go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VLFE76">Underworld Trilogy</a>.</p></body></html>

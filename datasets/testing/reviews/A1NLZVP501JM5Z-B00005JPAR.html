I still am not sure if I really liked this movie, but thats the way I'm leaning right now so it gets 5 stars.  I'll start off with the easiest thing to review.  The effects.  I was blown away by the shots of Thomas in the bubble with all the golden fragments falling down from the sky, that was great CG.  Actually it was done by photographing different stuf under a microscope(Don't expect me to be Mr. In depth:)<br /><br />The direction was either great OR not so great, like I said earlier I'm leaning towards great.  Hugh Jackman is very good in his 3 roles as is Rachel Weisz, I did like Hugh better in The Prestige, but thats just me.  This is a kind of movie you have to see more than once to fully appreciate it.  I know that this movie divides audiences.  The person I went with loathed it.<br /><br />Overall if you like to have everything explained to you and to not have any loose ends by the time the credits roll I suggest you go out, rent a Tom Cruise movie, and enjoy.  Of course theres nothing wrong with enjoying a Tom Cruise movie(I own a few of his myself) I'm just saying that by the end of this movie you will have to think about it and come up with your own  interpretation of it.  Some like that, some don't, but if you go into The Fountain with an open mind you'll at least have a chance to love it.</p></body></html>

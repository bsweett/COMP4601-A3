I was pleasantly shocked to see this movie get such rave reviews from so many people and that was a major factor in deciding to watch this film and I am not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />The casual observer would never think that Jim Carrey (known for his comedic skills) would be able to pull off a dramatic role but he did it (and then some) with "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."  I like the way he whispered throughout the film when a memory with Clementine came up.  It added depth to what was about to happen ("This was the last time I saw you").<br /><br />I've always had great respect for Kate Winslet (I feel she was slighted for never receiving an Oscar for her role in "Titanic" and she was superb in "Quills") but watching this just made me respect her a little bit more.  She played flaky but introspective Clementine convincingly, drawing you into her character.<br /><br />The supporting cast was just as good.  I didn't think I'd be impressed with Kirsten Dunst but boy was I wrong.  I thought she was going to play an empty role and leave after a few scenes (scene candy) but what a twist the ending turned out to be (watch it to find out).  Mark Ruffalo was cute in his role as the assistant to the scientist behind the memory cleansing technique and who could have guessed the turn Patrick (Elijah Wood) would take?<br /><br />This is quite the proverbial cut above the rest.  I feel the way the film was edited added to the depth of the storyline.  The film's format was far from conventional (having the opening credits roll 18 minutes into the movie underscored that) - there was no spelling out of the plot nor was it too obvious, the twists at the end, for me, were a pleasant surprise (not a shocker that left you wondering "Where did *that* come from?") and the way the scenery would collapse as Joel's memories were erased was outstanding as well as the way he would convey his current feelings in the context of past events ("By morning you'll be gone.  The perfect ending to this piece of s*** story!").<br /><br />There is only one word to describe "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind": BRILLIANT!  Do yourself the favor and watch this movie without any interruptions.  - Donna Di Giacomo</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="214 Minutes Later"></head><body><p>Ah, what better way to spend 3 1/2 hours than watching bloody projectile vomiting in high-def?<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by Stephen King's The Stand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169530">The Stand (Signet)</a> where a deadly virus escapes a secret government facility and obliterates the world as we know it, Director Danny Boyle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALTG">Trainspotting</a>  and writer Alex Garland (rumored to be involved with the film adaptation of the video game Halo...sweeeeet!) take the killer virus theme to the next level in 2002 with 28 Days Later.<br /><br />28 Days opens with what happens when animal activists go wild. In a short, violent sequence we see how a voraciously contagious virus that turns people into raging lunatics gets released into society. Flash to pre-Scarecrow Cillian Murphy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins</a> waking up  several days later in a hospital bed after most of the rest of society has been affected by the germs. (Coincidentally{?} we see this same beginning to a world gone mad in two other recent zombie-type stories: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582406723">The Walking Dead, Vol. 1: Days Gone Bye</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RXZL04">Resident Evil / Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a> ).<br /><br />Boyle does an excellent job of directing Murphy from his hospital bed into a fight for survival in a new world. And it turns out that Murphy and the folks that he bands up with need to fear more than just 'the infected'. 28 Days is frightening, suspenseful, thrilling, disgusting, realistic, emotionally-charging...all the ingredients in the Horror genre that make up a Classic.<br /><br />Too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days.<br /><br />28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud "PUNG!!!" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect.<br /><br />28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie.<br /><br />It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me.<br /><br />Final words: Buy 28 Days Later for your collection; rent 28 Weeks Later.</p></body></html>

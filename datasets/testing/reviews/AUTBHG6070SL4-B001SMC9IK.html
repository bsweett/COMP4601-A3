<meta name="summary" content="Decent movie, poor remake"></head><body><p>The aliens come, decide that the people of Earth are more of a nuisance than we're worth, and let us know that no Earth people at all would be an improvement - unless we clean up our act. That, a guy named Klaatu, and a robot named Gort (or G.O.R.T.) are about all this twenty-first century effects-fest has in common with that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">Cold War classic</a>.<br /><br />Both movies tap into the big concerns of the time. Back then, the big threat was nuclear war - the aliens just didn't want to deal with that kind of neighbor. Today, ecological collapse seems a much more likely form of self-inflicted extinction. Again, the aliens are quite content to see humankind gone, but not if we take other species with us. Interestingly, a human family takes an interest in the alien in each version, but the 1950s ideal of family and the 2008 vision differ dramatically.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves does an outstanding job representing the alien, for all the same reasons he does so poorly at representing humans. Klaatu, the alien, had no native understanding of human emotion, so Reeves's chronically flattened affect worked out for the best. The effects really made this movie, though - especially the big dramatic scene at the end. Outside of that, it's pretty forgettable. The 1951 original has nothing to fear from the new version.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

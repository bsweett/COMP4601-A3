The way he unfolds all three stories (past, present, and future) into one coherent whole is something that we don't regularly see in films these days. The overall vision of The Fountain reminds me of Stanley Kubrick: I'm not saying that Aronofsky is nowhere near as good as Kubrick (who is one of my favorite directors), but Aronofsky does seem like the new Kubrick of our generation. I'm hoping he continues to make these sorts of films so that they could dazzle us straight through.<br /><br />The only problems I had with the film were the extreme closeups of Jackman and Weisz. They were so close to the camera that I sometimes had to look away. But nonetheless, Jackman and Weisz gives astonishing performances. Jackman especially knows how to look and act like an obsessive man who will stop at nothing in finding eternal life. He should've been nominated for an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe.<br /><br />So mix in Aronofsky's visual creativeness, Jackman and Weisz's great acting, Clint Mansell's minimal and often meditative music score, and you've got a visual masterpiece. I think it's time for me to watch "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream", too.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

Yes, he gets a little preachy in the end but overall, this is enjoyable and top-notch film-making.<br /><br />Even though this had some violent moments, what impressed me was the restraint not to overdo the violence. I thought there was just the right amount. Being a long movie at two hours, 45 minutes, too much action would have worn out the viewer and too little would bore he/she.<br /><br /> It also was fascinating to me as almost a travelogue, seeing a lot of different cities around the world, following this team of Israelis as they track down and kill many of the men responsible for murdering hostages in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.<br /><br />That's the story of this film: not what happened at the Olympics, but how the Israelis tracked down the killers/terrorists afterward.<br /><br />Some of the violence is room-shaking if you have good speakers as a few of the explosions felt like it made my room shake when they went off! However much of the film deals not with that but with the men involved and how this mission affected them. In the end, Spielberg gives us a chance to reflect on a big question: how do you respond to terrorist attacks?  Basically, it is his view vs. how Israel responds. (Israel wasn't real pleased with this film, and I understand that. I think they are right, but I still love the film.)<br /><br />The movie is well-acted and has a story that will keep most people very involved while watching it. We plunk our dollars down to get entertained....and this movie delivers. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

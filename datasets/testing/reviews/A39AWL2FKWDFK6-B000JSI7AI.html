<meta name="summary" content="An unconventional love story"></head><body><p>Ang Lee's slightly overhyped "Brokeback Mountain" was a decent story about a relationship forged between two Wyoming cowboys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who were to become lifelong soulmates.  The film benefited from Hollywoods perchant for heralding particular themes when selecting films for awards.  This years theme of alternative lifestyles elevated the film's status.  No question the film was cinematographically stunning with its gorgeous western panoramic vistas and desolate Wyoming towns.  The relationship between the men was poignant yet the film dragged at points.<br /><br />Their tabooed relationship was in stark contrast to the social mores present in the 60's and 70's in the remote West.  Ledger in particular was very effective as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar who finds love with Gyllenhaal playing Jack Twist as they work a summertime job of sheepherding on Brokeback Mountain.  Both men go on to marry and have children existing in largely unfulfilling relationships.  After a hiatus of four years they reconnect are able to find chunks of time where they go off together.<br /><br />The stories chronicles the evolution of their relationship over an approximately 15-20 year period of time that culminates unfortunately in tragedy.<br /><br />Ang Lee did a nice job in his direction and hefty Randy Quaid did well in his portrayal of the sheepherding boss Joe Aguirre.</p></body></html>

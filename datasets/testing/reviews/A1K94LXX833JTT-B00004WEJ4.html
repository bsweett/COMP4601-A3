<meta name="summary" content="New Ultimate edition for collectors (and gift-givers) coming out for Christmas"></head><body><p>Possibly the most popular film around, 1942's Casablanca pairs two iconic actors, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, in a story of lost love and reluctant heroism.  Warner Brothers put out an excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">2-disc Special Edition</a> in 2003.  (That older set is going to receive new artwork on December 2nd, but it will otherwise be the same.)  This new 2-disc Ultimate Collector's Blu-ray Edition includes the features from the 2003 set and adds a documentary about studio head Jack Warner, along with a bunch of memorabilia.  This is the only Blu-ray edition.  Here are the announced new features, the ones not included in the 2003 set.  All but the first are memorabilia.<br /><br />-- Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul, a 1993 full-length biographical documentary (104 minutes)<br />-- 48-page photo book<br />-- 10 roughly 5x7" cards with color reproductions of poster art and such<br />-- 3 reproductions of archival correspondence (a memo from producer Hal Wallis changing the title to Casablanca, a memo from Wallis to studio head Jack Warner urging the casting of Bogart over George Raft, and a letter from the publicity head instructing the publicist to shift Bogart's image from tough to romantic lead)<br />-- reproduction of Victor Laszlo's letter of transit<br />-- passport holder with Casablanca logo<br />-- luggage tag with Casablanca logo<br />-- mail-in offer for 27x40" movie poster<br />-- all in a pretty collector's box with an intricate laser-cut Moroccan design<br /><br />The documentary, which comprises the second disc, is also available separately on standard DVD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000COF1QW">here</a>).  It was written, directed and produced by a grandson of Warner, and is said (by Variety) to be somewhat sentimental but not to overlook Warner's defects.  It isn't about Casablanca in particular.<br /><br />There are more than enough extras in the 2-disc standard DVD edition for most people.  I'll list them below.  The video and sound quality of that set are very good, about as good as could be for a 1942 film on standard DVD.  The movie was released in 1080p HD in 2006, and it was acclaimed as looking even better, sharper, smoother, with more detail.  The 1080p Blu-ray should look the same as the HD.  Whether it's enough better to matter to you is an individual thing.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1941 Casablanca, Morocco, controlled by the Nazi-collaborating Vichy French government.  Bogart plays Rick, a nightclub owner with a past he doesn't talk about and a determination not to get caught up in current events.  "I stick my neck out for nobody," he says.  He comes into possession of two letters of transit, invaluable items to the many refugees seeking passage out of the grasp of the Nazis.  The intended recipients of the letters soon show up, resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Bergman).  Ilsa, it turns out, was once Rick's lover, who broke his heart when she left him with no explanation.  Their old flame is rekindled despite themselves, and Rick must decide whether to help his rival for her love, thereby helping the war effort he has claimed no interest in, or help himself.<br /><br />No one expected this movie to be such a classic, and even though it won three major Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it only gained its place as a classic gradually over the years.  Undoubtedly the two stars are a big part of the reason it grew on us.  Bogart is perfect as a cynic who has more heart than he lets on.  Just by being there, Bergman instantly conveys every reason we need to understand Rick's broken heart and feel the force of his dilemma, and she convincingly portrays her own conflict between two loves.  Somehow the movie also gets other things just so.  Several of the supporting actors manage to be morally corrupt and still likable; others are just likable.  The writing, a fair amount of it done quickly, by committee, with no thought of it being great writing, has panache, and hits on several turns of phrase that just work.  Even the music works beyond what was expected, making "As Time Goes By" unforgettable.  All of these things lift up the story of love, higher duty, and the triumph of good over evil, and over cynicism.<br /><br />Here's the list of the features included from the 2003 Special Edition:<br /><br />-- Introduction by Bogart's wife and frequent co-star Lauren Bacall (2 minutes)<br />-- Audio commentaries<br />. . . . . by Roger Ebert<br />. . . . . by film historian/author Rudy Behlmer<br />-- Documentaries and featurette<br />. . . . .

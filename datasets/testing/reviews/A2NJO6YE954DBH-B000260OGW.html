<meta name="summary" content="Robert Duvall plays another epic old cowpoke"></head><body><p>While I was watching &quot;Open Range&quot; I was thinking back on the epic westerns of John Ford, shot in Monument Valley, Utah, where the rugged beauty of the scenery gave a sense of grandeur to the spectacle of John Wayne riding a horse.  As a director of Westerns Kevin Costner certainly proved he had an eye for visual spectacle in &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; (the buffalo hunt is the obvious example, but there are others).  However, in &quot;Open Range,&quot; the monumental spectacle is clearly Robert Duvall, who plays Boss Spearman.  The quintessential cowboy, Spearman is moving a herd of free-range cattle.  For the better part of ten years (&quot;they call it a decade&quot; Boss points out), Charley Waite (Costner) has been riding with him.  Rounding out the company are Mose (Abraham Benrubi), a gentle giant, and Button (Diego Luna), a young boy that they are trying to turn into a man.<p>Westerns are often about a clash between the past and the future, and in &quot;Open Range&quot; it is Spearman and grazing cattle on the free range that comes into conflict with men like Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) with his giant spread.  When Mose is sent into town and does not return, Boss and Charley set off in search of him and find him badly beaten up in the jail of the local sheriff (James Russo), who is in Baxter's pocket.  Baxter lays down the law of the land (his land, his law), while riles Boss, who does not like anybody telling him how to live his life.  Knowing what is coming from the hooded figures that are watching a few hills over, Boss tries to head off trouble, but with horrible success.  Now Boss wants justice and Charley wants vengeance.<p>&quot;Open Range&quot; is really about the relationship between these two men, who are no longer boss and employee, but two men who share a common set of standards that dictate what you are supposed to do in the series of escalating situations in which they find themselves as this film plays out.  Charley takes a liking to Sue Barlow (Annette Bening), the sister of the town's doctor, and while their awkward courtship has its tender moments it is secondary to what exists between Charley and Boss.  In another film the romance between Sue and Charley could have sustained an entire film; here it is only a substantial subplot.<p>This is very much Duvall's film until the shooting, which consists of what are probably the loudest gunshots in the history of Westerns, starts.  Duvall's most memorable performance was as Gus McRae in &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; but his Boss Spearman compares favorably to that epic role.  The biggest thing they have in common is their embodiment of the values by which they have lived their lives and dictate their actions.  Boss and Charley both do what a man has to do, not because of some macho notion of manhood, but because they have a frontier philosophy that clearly establishes what is right and what is wrong.<p>However, there are key differences between Boss and Charley that this gunfight brings out into the open.  Charley has been trying to bury his past and to be more like Boss, but the task at hand involves killing and it turns out Charley knows a whole lot more about that line of work than he has let on.  This is not to say that Charley is a great shot, but that he is going to shoot first and keep his head once the shooting starts (this is a Western where most of the shots fired do not hit anybody).  This film is more about character than gun fighting, which may well be why it puts off the gunfight as long as possible.  <p>Ultimately, &quot;Open Range&quot; is a notch below being a great western, but in terms of contemporary cinema that makes it pretty good.  The film does not suffer that much in comparison to &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Dances With Wolves,&quot; or &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; and it comes off a lot better than any other westerns of recent vintage you would care to name.  For that matter, Costner's performance stands up well against Duvall's, and you get the sense that as an actor Costner is moving on to the next level, with his co-star showing him how it is done.</p></body></html>

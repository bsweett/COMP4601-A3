Brad Bird, the writer-director-voice behind The Incredibles, isn't shy about this quiet truth.  In fact, Bird even dares to suggest -- Heavens! -- that maybe even without superheroes, some of us are more equal ... okay, better -- than others.  So the heroes in The Incredibles have two kinds of enemies -- supervillains and a society that wants nothing more than to make everyone equal (and therefore equally mediocre).  Who leads the fight for mediocrity?  Liberal lawyers, of course ... those insidious creeps who not only want to turn basic human emotions and conflicts into money, but are hell-bent on [...] concepts of legal equality into factual equality.<br /><br />Yes, boys and girls, The Incredibles actually stands for something that ought not be controversial, but is.  If you want your kids to go on believing that people are all the same, watch out!  This movie might quietly burst that silly illusion.<br /><br />It's also a darn good movie -- more of James Bond, than of Toy Story, full of action, explosions, and peril.  The dialogue is crisp, and there are no ridiculous fart jokes.  This isn't Shrek.  The folks at Pixar are too intelligent to aim that low.<br /><br />This film is a vast improvement over the so-so Finding Nemo, and is every bit as good as A Bug's Life and Toy Story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A lightweight caper with brilliant chemistry"></head><body><p>After a runaway success with this year's heavyweight TRAFFIC, director Steven Soderbergh relaxes his pace with a hilarious take on the enjoyable caper, a remake on the 1960s Ocean's 11. It is in fact one that surpasses the original starring Rrank Sinatra and his Rat Pack pals - and part of the luminous glow attributes to Soderbergh's stylish directing and cinematography. The Las vegas glamour and casino burst in full glory with the cameras - consistent with the brilliance of the mega stardom. Danny Ocean played by the enigmatic George Clooney decides to erase criminal history with a heist on the casino tycoon Terry Benedict. He conjures up a plan to penetrate the 200 feet vault and ultimately the 150 million prize. Yet his motives run deeper - his ex wife played by Julia Roberts is now Terry's interest. Danny joins forces with a motley of swindlers and pickpockets - including Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, Brad Pitt as Rusty - his sidekick, Don Cheadle with his British accent as a bomb expert, Shaobo Qin as a acrobat, Carl Reiner as an experienced hustler et al. <p>Despite the first hour of the movie rounding up the characters, there is never a dull moment. That's where Soderbergh's storytelling confidence takes full fledge - each is with his distinctive personality; their rapport and chemistry has bolstered the good-natured fun. The plot remains outlandish with a slight twist or two, speckled with some smooth humour and sleek moves in the action department. This year's best heist thriller? It is an intelligent plot serviceable enough but not much powerhouse acting like THE SCORE. Ocean's 11 has no plans to outshine or compete - the mood is dexterously imbued to entertain the audience with some light fluff and clean fun. The competent directing and scripting robs away your mundane boredom to light you up with a smile.</p></body></html>

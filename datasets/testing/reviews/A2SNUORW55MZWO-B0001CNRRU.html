I understand that the directing was different because the movie goes back and forth through time to explain the story, but this wasn't interesting to me. It just served to confuse and make the movie move along at a snail's pace. The more Sean Penn films I see, the more I am starting to think that he ain't so great. Naomi Watts was so annoying in this movie and I'm sorry, but I felt no sympathy for her at all. Benicio Del Toro was great, but he is great in everything so it was no surprise that he did a great job in his role. Ultimately, this is a slow movie that is way overrated. I didn't enjoy this film and was very happy when it was over. I give it 2 stars because it tried to do something different.</p></body></html>

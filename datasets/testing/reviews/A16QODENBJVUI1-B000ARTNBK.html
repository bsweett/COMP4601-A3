<meta name="summary" content="Not nearly as bad as I had expected"></head><body><p>OK, it is kinda odd to give a movie two-stars and then state that it wasn't as bad as anticipated, but that is the case here.  Friends on the online TV/movie board I post on had universally panned this as one of the worst movies ever and the critics were equally unkind when it came out.  So, I was expecting something utterly awful.  I only decided to see it after finishing rewatching both seasons of DARK ANGEL for a project I'm involved in and wanting to see how Jessica Alba of last summer compares to the Jessica Alba of four years ago.<br /><br />The basic problem is that nothing much really happens.  If a super hero movie involving not one but four super heroes and one super villain isn't an action film, I don't know what is.  But the truth is, this is a pretty boring movie.  Much of the story feels rushed, especially the first fifteen, where the leads are all rushed unceremoniously into space to meet the radiation wave that will transform them all into genetically altered creatures.  All of this happens way too quickly and we don't get any real feel for the way their individual transformations affect them.  A lot of the problem is that the run time is just over a hundred minutes, which is simply too little time to stretch out the narrative properly.  I can understand why they didn't properly introduce us to the characters and develop the story about how they became the Fantastic Four:  they wanted to keep the film short enough to guarantee more showings per day per screen in order to maximize profit.  The film needed at least another forty minutes or so, but that would have meant eliminating one or two showings per day.<br /><br />On various fan boards the remake that is supposed to start filming later this summer is receiving some serious criticism, but I think there is actually a chance that a sequel could be much better than the original.  The group is set up and there is actually a chance now of focusing on a story.  The question is whether they have a decent script.  The Spiderman films, especially the second one, have shown what a good script can mean to a super hero movie.  But Sam Raimi has grasped something that few others working in the genre has:  not special effects but the story is the main thing.  Raimi went out of his way to recruit novelist Michael Chabon (author of THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, a novel about two comic book writers in the early forties, which won Chabon a Pulitzer Prize) to write the stories for the second and third movies.  Has a similarly strong story been written for the Fantastic Four sequel?  One can hope, but Mark Frost, who wrote the script for this one--and the script was the biggest problem with this film--is writing the sequel.  Frost does not have a good track record.  His lone claim to fame was being co-creator of TWIN PEAKS, but one suspects that the brilliance of that show had more to do with David Lynch than Frost.<br /><br />In an obvious cost-saving move the producers went with TV actors, who usually command far smaller salaries than established film actors.  I love Jessica Alba, who is not only one of the most perfect looking human beings on planet earth, but who seems to be a genuinely nice person, but she isn't the most capable actress in the world.  I am hoping with her winning personality that she can craft a nice movie career.  On a completely superficial level I'd love to see her go back to her natural hair color.  She actually looks better with very dark hair.  She just looks . . . well, odd, with light hair.  It doesn't fit her skin tone or her huge dark eyes.  On a nonsuperficial level, I think she was an asset to the film and since she has enjoyed a surprising amount of success post-FANTASTIC FOUR she is actually the major star in the film.  Still, when she was signed she had almost no film work behind her and was known almost exclusively for having starred in DARK ANGEL and for being one of the world's most beautiful human beings.  Michael Chiklis has established a reputation for being one of the finest actors in television, but has yet to achieve any kind of success in film.  Still, like Alba his price was low compared to others.  Chris Evans was and is an unknown, while Ioan Gruffudd is known primarily for playing Horatio Hornblower on TV.  Julian McMahon, of course, is another television actor, playing the morally challenged plastic surgeon on NIP/TUCK.  My point is that the producers did a great deal to minimize expenses on the film, both keeping salaries low and keeping per day screenings high.<br /><br />There were, of course, a vast number of special effects in the movie, but we are way past the point where special effects can carry a film.  Special effects are only (no pun intended) effective when in the service of the story; a story cannot be used as a clothesline upon which you string special effects.<br /><br />Still, I never found the film impossible or painful to watch.  Mainly I just found myself waiting for the moving to start even as it was coming to an end.  Hopefully they will learn from their mistakes and strive to come up with an interesting story for the sequel.</p></body></html>

Hollywood got this one wrong.<br /><br />Val Kilmer plays Scott, a Secret Service operative assigned to do the dirty tasks that would otherwise not be countenanced by squeamish bleeding hearts. For instance, in order to get crucial information from a suspect, Scott is not above breaking the scumbag's arm. In the defense of Mom, flag and apple pie, a Hard Man is good to find.<br /><br />In SPARTAN, a VIP's daughter, Laura (Kristen Bell), is kidnapped from her college dorm after her Secret Service protection is temporarily withdrawn to supplement that of Ol' Dad's when he comes to town to visit his mistress during a re-election campaign. The script never specifically says so, but the viewer presumes we're talking about the President here. In any case, the girl is apparently destined to be sent to a country bordering the Arabian Gulf where she'll become the sex slave of a rich sheikh. At this point in the plot, the kidnappers don't know whom they've got, and Scott must retrieve Laura before the story breaks in the press.<br /><br />Mind you, Kilmer gives a taut performance as the Service's Rambo. And the supporting cast includes the ever-watchable William H. Macy as the VIP's political Machiavelli, and Ed O'Neill as the agent in charge of the rescue. (I can never see O'Neill without hearing MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Peggy whine "Aaaa-lll!") However, when the audience finally meets Laura, she turns out to be such an unappealing brat that the viewer perhaps wonders why all the bother. Finally, Laura's deliverance from the Middle East is by such a successful, albeit fortuitously unexpected, route, that one questions why Scott didn't plan something similar - such as marching into the local BBC office with the girl in tow - from the very beginning instead of trying to be cute about it.<br /><br />The title "Spartan" makes reference to the proud habit of the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, when asked by a neighboring city to send military aid, of sending just one of its super warriors to get the job done.</p></body></html>

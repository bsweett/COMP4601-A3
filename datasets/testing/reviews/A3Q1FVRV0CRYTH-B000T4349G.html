It's completly and utterly FORGETTABLE, and I say that mostly because it fails to deliver when it has the chance to.  The plot is actually pretty unique in itself, the idea of waking up one day and having everything you've thought you've known be a lie, the children you've raised never existing and everyone you've ever known is convinced your crazy.  Yeah, so the plot is decent and the acting is pretty good.  Julianne Moore is a good actress and she plays the distressed mother quite well.  So in this film she plays a woman whose son was killed in a plane wreck or so she thought.  She's been seeing a shrink for some time trying to resolve her feelings of loss.  But soon things start to change.  The pictures in the house of her son are gone, his room has changed, his things are missing and all of a sudden her husband and friends and shrink are all saying that she never bore a child and that she's been living a lie for years believing something that never happened.  Add in some aliens and you have a classic B-Grade sci-fi film.  The only problem is that, while building up great suspence and delivering some eerie performances the final few frames just fall to pieces.  It's almost like the writters sat down and said "we have a great concept and a great two thirds of a script, but I just can't fingure out how to end this $hit...what should we do?" and the producers said "anything, I need my movie" and so they just threw together an ending that is probably the worst ending I've ever seen.  It makes no sense and all the suspence and drama that had built up throughout the film is null in void after watching the pathetic excuse for an ending...and don't even get me started on the alternate ending supplied on the DVD...it's even worse!  I just was dissapointed, as were the critics since for the most part this film was panned.  It has it's moments, and there are a few jumpy scenes, and if it weren't for the appauling ending this film would be a decent thriller (nothing brilliant) but at least stomachable and worth a watch every once in a while, but the ending kills it for me.  And that's why I say it's forgettable, because it builds up speed as it races towards it's finale but it never quite makes it off the runway, it never delivers that final blow that could have sealed the deal and made this a great thriller...instead it fizzles and dies and remains a lame attempt at a cheap thrill.</p></body></html>

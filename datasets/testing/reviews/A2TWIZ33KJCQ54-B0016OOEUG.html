Looking at that painting one can only wonder, will we ever really know Laura?<br /><br />5-STAR ENTERTAINMENT: #220 ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE'S BEST FILM LIST!<br /><br />"Laura" is the story of a beautiful young woman [Gene Tierney] whose story is told after her death. In showing us her life, through flashbacks, the gruff New York detective investigating her murder [Dana Andrews as Lt. Mark McPherson] falls in love with her portrait which is conspicuously mounted on the wall of the dead girl's apartment.<br /><br />THERE'S MORE - MUCH MORE: [contains plot spoilers]<br /><br />Detective Mark McPherson, [Dana Andrews] investigates the brutal murder, systematically interrogating the chief suspects: Dandy, waspish columnist, Waldo Lydecker [Clifton Webb]; roguish, socialite wannabe, Shelby Carpenter [Vincent Price]; and Carpenter's well-to-do sugar mama, Ann Treadwell [Judith Anderson]. But there is something not quite right about the whole case and it is starting to irritate McPherson.<br /><br />FOR STARTERS ---<br /><br />Everywhere McPherson goes on his investigation, Lydecker, Carpenter and sometimes even Ms. Treadwell are in tow! Boy, does this seem strange! Why do you suppose they are following McPherson around? And, boy, does everyone love Laura. How could anyone have possibly wanted to murder such a lovely creature?<br /><br />---------- ABOUT THE CAST: Most of whom are murder suspects!<br /><br />---*- Gene Tierney - Laura Hunt [perfect "Laura" in every way - recently engaged to Shelby but owes much to Waldo]<br /><br />---*- Dana Andrews - Mark McPherson [Waldo declared him a hero on first meeting - true to form]<br /><br />---*- Clifton Webb - Waldo Lydecker [fast talking, waspish fop, with a venomous quill - real S.O.B., but loves Laura almost as much as himself]<br /><br />---*- Vincent Price - Shelby Carpenter [shameless, gold-digging pretty boy with a southern lilt]<br /><br />---*- Judith Anderson - Ann Treadwell [shameless old lady - wants Shelby at any price despite his engagement to Laura who is her niece.

NOW THE PLOT THICKENS [*warning* plot spoilers below]<br /><br />The murder of Laura was a really fiendish act. In fact, someone shot her in the face with a 12-gauge shotgun as she answered the doorbell. Were we glad they made this film before they could show this kind of thing graphically!<br /><br />---*- THE DVD & SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The best features were the 2 A&E Biography's;<br /><br />Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait<br /><br />Vincent Price: The Versatile Villain<br /><br />Commentary by: David Raksin and Jeanine Basinger<br /><br />Commentary by: Rudy Behlmer (Unknown Format)<br /><br />Extended version<br /><br />THE COMMENTARY: THE BEST I KNOW OF!<br /><br />There are 2 commentary tracks. Jeanine Basinger's covers the film and an in depth analysis of all the major plot elements and the scenes. David Raskin who's biggest claim to fame is writing the theme to "Laura" and the accompanying variations also has his comments spliced in-between Ms. Basinger's for a complimentary mix between the two contributors.<br /><br />Rudy Behlmer's commentary covers the production, news, facts and figures, and some significant documented artifacts from Director Otto Preminger and the studio. Both commentary tracks were wonderfully interesting and worthwhile, unlike most.<br /><br />Deleted scene (with commentary by Rudy Behlmer) plus Theatrical trailer<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, Spanish<br /><br />Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), English (Dolby Digital 1.0), Spanish (Dolby Digital 1.0)<br /><br />IS IT A DREAM? --- THE PLOT THICKENS: [big plot spoiler below]<br /><br />While McPherson is studying Laura's apartment, the crime scene, he dozes off in her easy chair. Then, as if he were having a dream about all those letters and diaries he'd been snooping through, the front door opened and in walked a woman. McPherson awakened to find, you guessed it, Laura standing in front of him, demanding an explaination for his presence. Is it a dream?<br /><br />OK --- SO WHO'S THE DEAD LADY THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS LAURA?<br /><br />Why was she killed? Did the murderer who shot when the door opened think it was Laura, or did the killer know who answered the door? Where has Laura been for the past 3 days? Did Laura have anything to do with the murder?<br /><br />---*- IN CLOSING<br /><br />Laura features a wonderful plot, terrific acting by all (especially Clifton Webb), and crisp, literate dialogue to match the visually rich settings. This film's pace is uncharacteristically fast for this type of film, so hold on and pay close attention to the dialogue and details. Ok, NO more spoilers, you'll just have to see the film, and it is the best of its type that I have ever seen. What type? Film Noir, I am told. While I am not including any more plot spoilers, there is still plenty more plot and many surprises waiting for you when you see "Laura".<br /><br />-*--- OTHER RECOMMENDED FILMS OF THE GENRE AVAILABLE ON VIDEO OR DVD:<br /><br />  *- Dial M for Murder, 1954, Alfred Hitchcock<br /><br />  *- Niagara, 1952, Henry Hathaway<br /><br />  *- Double Indemnity, 1944, Billy Wilder<br /><br />  *- D.O.A., 1949,  Rudolph Mat&eacute;<br /><br />  *- Leave Her To Heaven, 1946, John M.

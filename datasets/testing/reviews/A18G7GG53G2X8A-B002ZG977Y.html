<meta name="summary" content="Greek Mythology Has Never Looked So Good"></head><body><p>While I've never agreed with the idea that only bad movies should be remade, the 1981 version of "Clash of the Titans" is a perfect example of why such statements are valid. This new 2010 version is, quite simply, a better film. It features special effects that are convincing, and with all due respect to his fans, the same cannot be said about the Ray Harryhausen claymation of the original. It tells a story that's equally preposterous but far less campy. The characters, while lacking any real depth, are given lines that no longer border on embarrassing. And the action sequences are much more exciting, in large part because of the aforementioned special effects, which are now presented in 3-D. When compared to the original, there really is no comparison.<br /><br />As a standalone piece, however, it certainly isn't without its weaknesses. The story, while relatively easy to follow, is painfully short on detail, and it generally seems at a distance from the Greek mythology on which it's based. It's nothing more or less than a showcase of CGI, which means you're meant to look at it but not really think about what's going on. I don't mind this, as long as my senses aren't being assaulted; unlike recent big budget effects extravaganzas like "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" and "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra," "Clash of the Titans" allows the audience to take in its visual delights, to savor the effort that went into them. One can watch it and actually be entertained.<br /><br />The story focuses on a demigod named Perseus (Sam Worthington), born as the result of an affair between a mortal queen and the god Zeus (Liam Neeson). When his beloved adoptive family is killed at the hands of Zeus' wicked brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Perseus vows that he will have his revenge. He then ends up in the seaside city of Argos, where Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker) angers the gods by daring to claim that her daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), is more beautiful than the goddess Aphrodite. In response to this, Hades gives her two options: Either Argos will be destroyed by a monstrous sea creature known as the Kraken, or Andromeda will be sacrificed. Thus begins Perseus' heroic journey, one that will take him from the cave of the Stygian Witches to the ruined lair of Medusa.<br /><br />Keeping continuous watch over Perseus is Io (Gemma Arterton), priestess for the goddess Hera. Why she's compelled to protect him is never adequately explained, although I suppose it has something to do with Zeus, who can't seem to decide whether or not Perseus should be helped or harmed. Why harmed? Because he, like the entire city of Argos, has turned his back on the gods and no longer offers his prayers to keep them sustained. I personally find that very immature coming from omnipotent beings, but then again, we find much immaturity and vengefulness in Greek mythology. Consider Artemis: Because a commander named Agamemnon killed a sacred stag, she wouldn't let him or the Greek Fleet sail to Troy unless his daughter, Iphigenia, was sacrificed.<br /><br />I digress. The truth is that "Clash of the Titans," while hardly a great movie, succeeds at being exactly what it wants to be. One can easily admire the work that went into the visuals, the makeup, the costumes, and the action. One of the most exciting sequences involves a disfigured king named Acrisius (Jason Flemyng), whose body has been fortified by Hades himself; when his blood drips onto the sand, it results in the creation of gigantic scorpions, which then flail wildly as Perseus and his men attack with full force. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed when it's eventually discovered that these beasts can be tamed and ridden like horses. Where's the fun in that?<br /><br />And then there's the final sequence with the Kraken, featured prominently in the ads. The ensuing battle is surprisingly short, which, considering the level of technical wizardry on display, is a bit anticlimactic. Still, what little we are shown is exhilarating, aided greatly by the 3-D technology.<br /><br />Sometimes, it's fun to see a movie that doesn't require the audience to think. It merely wants to entertain you, to take you on a two-hour journey away from life. That's exactly what "Clash of the Titans" did for me; it's an escapist film, a delightful distraction that consistently kept me involved. You don't often come across remakes that outshine their predecessors. Then again, when you consider how bad the original "Clash of the Titans" was, director Louis Leterrier and the screenwriters didn't have to try all that hard. It sort of makes you wonder, then, why no one thought to wait until now to make this into a movie. If we learned anything from the Ralph Bakshi version of "The Lord of the Rings," it's that we shouldn't force a movie into existence before the technology is available to do the story justice.</p></body></html>

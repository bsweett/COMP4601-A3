<meta name="summary" content="Denzel is amazing"></head><body><p>Denzel absolutely earned his Oscar with this performance.  I have never hated such a character before in my life.  A good script, yes, perhaps a few too many coincidences; especially about the girl Hawk saves being related to the men Denzel recruits to get rid of Hawk.  The one thing and perhaps the only thing you remember about this is Denzel.  highly, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

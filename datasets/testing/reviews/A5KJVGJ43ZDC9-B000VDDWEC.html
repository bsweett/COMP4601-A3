You would think that the director of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; would put out another original piece of work. You'd be wrong in this case. And then the box has the nerve to say this is the scariest film since the Exorcist? Please- it was neither scary or even comparable to that true classic. Last movie made that claim was &quot;The Ring&quot;, and that box lied, too. That's it,no more buying movies with the word &quot;Exorcist&quot; on it. I should know better. Boring, overlong zombie film.</p></body></html>

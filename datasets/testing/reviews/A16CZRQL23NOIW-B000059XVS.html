<meta name="summary" content="The best film of David Lean!"></head><body><p>This is simply , a towering movie. Just a few films show with so splendor the epical sense as this one. Not only it established a standard as the best work filmed in  the desert: the kinetic existence of this well educated man who fights in a conflict absolutely out his concerns . It's impossible not remind to Lord Byron when he died in Greece , fighting by a noble cause.<br />All the cast was incredible. Alec Guiness , Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn , Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains and obviously this legendary actor Peter O'Toole who lost the prize as best actor in 1962 with Gregory Peck in To kill a mockingbird.<br />David Lean adapted the book the seven pillars of wisdom with overwhelming results.<br />Lensed in Jordan and Spain , the film has countless astonishing sequences , but I 'd really wanted to underline , just ywo of them.<br />When the army has crossed the Akaba desert , there's a man who apparently fell from the camel. Lawrence decides go bacj for him : and then he listen the warning : you won't get back from the journey don't challenge the destiny . Obviously Lawrence ignores the warning and goes for him . When he arrives with the half dead man , he states those brilliant lines: the destiny is just right here and he touches his head.<br />The other scene is just the opening sequence when he crashs his motocycle and dies in an absurd accident.<br />The hero's life doesn't have any sense after the the triumph of the last battle. Something similar happens with Gladiator &gt;<br />I can't imagine the hero thinking in quiet life or a normal life as the rest of the human being . The hero has completed his mission , has completed his own cycle and the time comes for him to fade . This mythical cycle makes the death of Lawrence,has been more than casual .<br />This work is much more than simply an extarordinary film ; it's a real triumph of the western world ; an artistic treasure ; a timeless picture!</p></body></html>

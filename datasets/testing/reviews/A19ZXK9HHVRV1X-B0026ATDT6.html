In no time flat, the toxic waste has mutated into a massive sea creature that can live both on land and in water and which devours any hapless human unfortunate enough to wander onto its path.  It also captures certain individuals and drags them to a sewer where he keeps them for later feeding.  One such victim is a young girl named Hyun-seo, whose family members - a kindly grandfather, an aunt and an uncle, and her own childlike father - after receiving no assistance from the governmental authorities, are forced to make a desperate attempt on their own to rescue her.<br /><br />Directed by "Memories of Murder"'s Bong Joon-ho, "The Host" is not a laugh-a-minute parody in the scattershot mold of the "Airplane," "Naked Gun," "Scary Movie" franchises.  Instead, it mocks the conventions of its genre while at the same time treating those conventions with seriousness and respect.  The characters may act in ways that are silly and goofy, but the threat posed by the creature is always real, so that we laugh at the same time we are awaiting the next suspense-filled jolt to come our way.<br /><br />The movie, in many ways, is really more about the dynamics of this one family than it is about a city coping with a man-eating monster.  Of particular interest is Hyun-seo's father, Gang-du, a kindhearted man who lives with his dad, sleeps most of the day at the store they run, and seems never to have fully grown into adulthood.  His idea of good parenting skills is playing video games with his daughter while handing her a freshly opened can of beer.  This puts him in direct conflict with his younger brother and sister, who continually berate Gang-du for being an irresponsible parent.  It is only in the midst of an intense crisis such as the one the family is facing that Gang-du finds the fortitude, courage and maturity he needs to be a true father to his daughter.<br /><br />As in most films of this nature, the scientists and governmental authorities in "The Host" are viewed with suspicion, if not downright hostility.  They spend most of their time lying to the general public in an attempt to hide their own inadequacies and incompetence.  The Americans come in for a particular black eye in this film, which prompts one to wonder just how favorably the United States government is viewed by the people (or at least the filmmakers) of South Korea.<br /><br />The performances are good, though "The Host" might have been a better film with a few minutes shaved off its running time. As it is, it runs a little long for a movie of this type, with most of the best laughs occurring in the front portion of the film.  It also has a tendency to take itself just a bit too seriously in its final half hour, blunting its satiric edge somewhat as a consequence.<br /><br />Still, this is a clever, entertaining film with cool special effects and an appealingly self-mocking tone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's Worst Film"></head><body><p>There was no justification to "reimagine" this 1968 sci-fi classic. From a box-office standpoint, the 2001 "Planet of the Apes" filled 20th Century Fox's coffers as a cynical, money-grubbing enterprise. Artistically, the film represents a low point in director Tim Burton's mostly impressive career, with an all-star cast hopelessly lost in space. A thoroughly unpleasant experience.</p></body></html>

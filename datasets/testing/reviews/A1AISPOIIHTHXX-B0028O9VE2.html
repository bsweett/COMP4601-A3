<meta name="summary" content="Will also use the word "surprising" for this film"></head><body><p>A lot of good directors will tell you good stories can often fall apart if the casting is bad. There are particular actors and actresses that are not terrible in their respective films but they feel woefully out of place among the talent around them (Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection or Denise Richards in the World is Not Enough). In this case, it's Adam Sandler who actually doesn't even feel miscast. He does a very respectable job at getting away from his Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison schtick but this time instead of being miscast, he just seems like a lightning rod for miscasting rants from people.<br /><br />The film actually centers around Flor and Cristina, a Spanish mother and daughter respectively who move to California. Flor ends up taking a job as a housekeeper at a really nice house. Only thing is she can't speak any English whatsoever so that causes some initial problems. Things still continue when both of them move in and Cristina finds herself being at a huge center of attention from the wife Deborah. Deborah is shifts moods radically while her husband John is an unhappy restaurant chef, even when he gets a 4 star review. The film mainly centers around different styles of parenting and dysfunction that can happen in families.<br /><br />Now I should get this out of the way: Sandler doesn't feel miscast, in fact he's quite good, despite some Sandler-esque bits (his dialogue during a rather strange love scene is very reminiscent of his other stuff) but I think his presence suggests this is going to be a low-brow humor geared to frat boys. The real stars are Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, the headstrong but slightly stubborn mother and the wise beyond her years daughter respectively. In fact Bruce steals the show where she not only has to translate a fight with John and Flor but she nails the shifting emotional states of both characters. Tea Leoni I always felt gets really bad reps with stating she's a terrible actress (although her performance in Jurassic Park III made me wish a dinosaur did snack on her) but here I loved her.<br /><br />The film's main problem is its running time. Ever watch a movie that felt long or was long but looking back on it you couldn't figure out where you'd take the scissors if you had the chance? Spanglish to me is similar in that at 2 hours and 10 minutes it does seem a bit long yet I couldn't tell you what scenes required additional editing since they're important in and of themselves. Not to mention it's not exactly the most cliche-free plot as there's some scenes that are going to be obvious and when they happen they don't really surprise (a possible romance between John and Flor, Deborah and her mother having an all-out or jealousy among Flor and Deborah) but the film's entertaining anyway.<br /><br />Should you watch the movie? Personally I say so. It's rare lately to watch a good comedy movie that never felt as if all you'd get out of it was laughs.</p></body></html>

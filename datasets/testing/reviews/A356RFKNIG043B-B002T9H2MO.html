<meta name="summary" content="Very nice concept that takes a little too long to unfold"></head><body><p>I love the basic idea here (won't spoil it with details), but by the time it was revealed and started to flower, we were rather bored. It then got very interesting and thought-provoking, however, so if you can wait for about 45 minutes there is a fine payoff. If it had been revealed early on and then played out with more time, I think this would be a truly classic film.<br /><br />Rockwell certainly is good here, though of course I can't really detail that comment without spoliers!<br /><br />I was overly reminded of 2001 and Blade Runner a little too often, especially the latter towards the end here. But, those are fine progenitors to have, so fair enough. The director is to be complimented for such a fine job on a pretty small budget, in any case, and for getting a great performance from Sam.<br /><br />In short, if you like character peices and/or sci-fi, this is well worth checking out.<br /><br />The blu-ray is excellent, btw, with a nice transfer and a bunch of good extras, including two commentaries, a few little docs, and a rather good short film by Jones, quite decent in its own right, with some very fine footage of Swiss locales and an interesting plot.<br /><br />All in all, a nice little package for a unique film.</p></body></html>

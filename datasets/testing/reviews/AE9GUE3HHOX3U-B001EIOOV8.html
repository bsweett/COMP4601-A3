You feel so involved while viewing it, you get so tangled up in all the crap that ends up happening.  It's an emotional investment worth the payoff.  All of the performances are brilliant, especially the scenes between Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro.  There was some funky energy between the 2, like they really hated eachother at times.  They're fights and tirades seemed so real, I was mezmorized while watching them.  When Sharon Stone finally gets confronted in the Italian restaurant, and Robert DeNiro graps her and she mutters, "I wouldn't do that if I were you", I felt the raw emotion of her performance.  This role was Sharon's crowning achievemnt in film in my oppinion.  This is one of my favourite films, I wish someone could make another epic drama like this again, there seems to be a shortage of good stuff like this around.  ENERGY PEOPLE!</p></body></html>

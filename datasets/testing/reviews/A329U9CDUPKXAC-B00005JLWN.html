This movie more than made up for that. This is the best science fiction action movie I've seen in a LONG time. It's incredibly intelligent. Every time I thought I knew what was about to happen there was a twist. This movie is totally unpredictable unlike &quot;The Matrix.&quot; This movie is better than &quot;The Matrix&quot; in every way possible. The fight scenes in this are so brilliantly done. I've never seen gun battles like this. It reminded me of some classic Japanese Animes I've seen. But &quot;Equilibrium stands completely on it's own. It's completely original and I want to watch it again.</p></body></html>

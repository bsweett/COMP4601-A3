<meta name="summary" content="Fun With Brad and Angelina"></head><body><p>There's no shortage of screen chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in this action-filled romantic comedy from "Fair Game" director Doug Liman. In fact, the gunplay, fisticuffs and chases remain secondary to Brad and Angelina's considerable star power - a rarity in today's cineplex environment. "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" (2005) is refreshingly old-fashioned in the classic Hollywood tradition.</p></body></html>

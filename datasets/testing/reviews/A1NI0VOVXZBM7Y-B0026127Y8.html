Great Edge of your seat Thriller, Involving a Former spy, and Showing that torture for the interest of Public safety in a official form*In  this case a CIA Agent*( I do not Condone) is NOT BAD, But A Preventive Measure, Of course the movie has nothing to do with Torture per se, but There are parts of torture of course he does this to find his daughter. Who lied about where she was going, and her naive mom let her be. All lessons and social commentary aside, Excellent movie, especially for SpyMovie Buffs and Action Packed Movie Fans.</p></body></html>

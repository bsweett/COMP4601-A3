I thought it was absolutely terrible. For one thing, let me just say, for the first hour NOTHING! happens. It doesn't pick up at all until almost the end, and even then it's just mediocre at best. I was nodding off in the theatre waiting for some action and NOTHING! happened. There are only 4 people in the entire movie 1 being the killer and 3 being the victims. It had no point or reasoning behind it. It followed every other slasher/stalker movie cliche in the teen horror genre even though it's suppose to be based on true events. Needless to say, I felt robbed, disappointed, and I wasted an hour and 45 minutes of my life.</p></body></html>

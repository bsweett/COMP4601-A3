I think the plot suffered because there really isn't a real story here. All the main characters and even the minor ones appears to be very confused about themselves. Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire proves to such a loser in civilian life, it almost pathetic. Peter Parker spent much of this movie confused about whether he wants to be Spider-Man or not. I supposes that is why he make such a good Spiderman. Kristen Dunst plays Mary Ann Watson proves to be beautiful but she's confused throughout the movie on whether she loves Peter or the other guy. James Franco who played Harry Osborn still regards Peter as his best buddy but regards him with hostility because he thinks Peter is buddy with Spider-Man. This character is totally twisted all over. Alfred Molina who played the main villian, Dr. Octopus, is pretty good. But he too, like the other characters, remains confused on whether he wants to be good or bad.  Even Jonah Jameson goes from anti-Spider-Man to pro-Spider-Man and back again. The entire movie appears to be populated with very confused characters. <p>What works is the special effects, action scenes and interaction between our confused characters. For a guy who likes to keep his secret identity secret, Toby Maguire's character spent a lot of time wearing that costume without his mask on. Why cheapen the character by showing us the actor's face all the time?? (Does Sam Raimi believed that Toby Maguire is so handsome that his face deserves more exposure??) But its a motion picture comic book, so everything work out in the end and as long as you don't think too hard about the movie, it should be quite enjoyable for everyone.</p></body></html>

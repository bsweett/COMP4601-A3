<meta name="summary" content="Movie A- Extras A+"></head><body><p>Everyone thinks that this is a Tim Burton film but he did not direct it.  The film is based on poem that Burton wrote and he produced the film.<br /><br />This film takes place where every holiday has a "Land". Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon / Danny Elfman) is the king of Halloween Land.  Another brilliant Halloween is over and Jack is bored with Halloween.  Jack wanders the forest and finds the entrance to the other "Towns".  He is drawn to the bright and shiny door of Christmas Town.  He is sucked into the portal and what he sees amazes him.  He is dazzled by the Christmas lights and snow.  And Jack decides to take over Christmas.<br /><br />Christmas Eve arrives and Jack takes over for Santa and delivers the presents made by Halloween Town.  Unfortunately, they are more appropriate for Halloween than Christmas.<br /><br />Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is the servant to the evil scientist (William Hickey) but she has a fascination with Jack.  When Oogie Boogie (Ken Paige) decides to take over Halloween Town, Sally comes to Jack's rescue.<br /><br />In the end everything works out.<br /><br />The story is well thought out and the dialogue is witty.  The production design and character design are outstanding.  They create the atmosphere of the movie.  Add to this a brilliant score by Danny Elfman.  This creates one of the best stop animation movies.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS:<br /><br />Commentary by director Henry Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik<br /><br />Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - A 25 minute making of featurette with Burton, Selick, co producer Kathleen Gavin, Danny Elfman, storyboard supervisor Joseph Ranft, supervising animator Eric Leighton, art director Deane Taylor, set designer Gregg Olsson, cinematographer Pete Kozachik, motion control camera operator Dave Hanks, sculptor Greg Dykstra, animator Mike Belzer, armature engineer Blair Clark, character fabrication supervisor Bonita DeCarlo, animator Anthony Scott and track reader Dave Mason.  As you can see this is not your ordinary making of featurette, you get a full understanding of the stop motion animation process.<br /><br />Storyboard to Film Comparison -  A four minute comparison that has a storyboard on top and the scene below.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes: Deleted Storyboards described by Henry Selick - Three deleted storyboards that were never animated totaling 3 minutes with reason why they were not pursued.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes: Deleted Animated Sequences described by Henry Selick - Four deleted scenes totaling 5 minutes with reason why they were cut or edited.  I like when there is commentary so we know why it was cut.<br /><br />The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - This takes you behind the scenes in Halloween Town, Christmas Town and the Real World.  This shows character design, concept art and sometimes animation tests.  Usually I don't care about these extras but this is a unique film and this is a unique look at the creative process that you need to see.<br /><br />Tim Burton's Early Films: Vincent - A 6 minute stop animation short narrated by Vincent Price.  It's a cute parody on Vincent Price's movies.<br /><br />Tim Burton's Early Films: Frankenweenie - A 30 minute parody of the Frankenstein tales with a boy and his dog that was run over by a car starring Shelly Duvall, Daniel Stern and Barret Oliver.<br /><br />The extras are exceptional to go with an exceptional film.</p></body></html>

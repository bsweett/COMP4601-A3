<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Greatest!"></head><body><p>This would have to be one of the all time classic movies. A very good history of the Corleone family. This movie has everything. The role of the family head is well played by Marlon Brando. The roles of the two sons are played very effectively by Al Pacino and James Caan. This movies chronicles some of the events that take place in the world of the Mafia. The attempt on Don Corleone and the revenge by Michael his youngest son. Especially interesting was the method employed by Don Corleone to convince the Hollywood producer to give the leading role in a war movie to his godson. One will never forget the horse's head in the bed. The death of Don Corleone and the assension to power by the youngest son Michael is also shown. The movie ends with a bang with the Corleone family killing the heads of the rival families and gaing vengance for the murder of the Corleone son Sonny.Also to be noted is the outstanding scenery and the way that it is used to reflect the time in history that the events are taking place. Definitely one of the best movies ever made.</p></body></html>

Then there was either something wrong my ears, or my sound, cos Jake Gyllenhall & Heath Ledger seemed to mumble all their lines! It got very annoying, and I kept turning the sound up 'til nearly as far as it would go. Then the sex scenes are actually filmed in nearly complete darkness, so it's very difficult to see what actually is going on, but it's also very well done. But then they just seem to be sleeping, and the next thing you know is one is jumping on the other ... you know the rest.<br /><br />I quite liked both Jake & Heath in this, apart from the constant smoking, and the rest of the actors in this are amazing. Michelle Williams, playing a dowdy character for once in her life, is simply amazing as Ennis' on screen wife (and off screen), the scene where she discovers her husband's betrayal will bring a lump to anyone's throat, although it's implied in her previous scenes that she knows. Anne Hathaway takes her first major step away from The Princess Diaries & Ella Enchanted, by playing a bit of a cow, and doing her first blink-and-you'll-miss-it topless scene. Randy Quaid & Anna Faris also appear in this, as unrecognisable characters, I didn't actually realise it was them until reading the cast list.<br /><br />There is no other love story like this out there, and can play itself out without much in the way of dialogue, apart from half way through. Heath & Jake both took a major risk getting involved with this film, but they both pulled it off with little embarrassment. Ang Lee and all actors didn't shy away from the material put in front of them, they got on and did it and pulled out an unforgettable film.<br /><br />The ending is heartbreaking, and unforgettable, but also unpredictable. I did not see this coming. The almost final shots of their shirts together, and a postcard of Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />This is a very hard film to review, second only to United 93. If you've known love, you'll be hit by a ton of bricks watching this film, it's so emotional, and really tugs at the heart strings. It's a film that some people will never see, but should.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="James Bond Lives On"></head><body><p>DIE ANOTHER DAY is a Bond movie in which everybody tried hard to come up with something special. The predictable result of all that striving was, of course, that DIE ANOTHER DAY is mostly ordinary Bond du jour.<br /><br />This, the 20th in the Bond series and the 40th anniversary Bond film, was consciously crafted to be a "supermovie," and it is--in spots. Hard-core Bond fans will appreciate all the nods and winks to the earlier films. Halle Berry's sudden appearance on a beach in Cuba complete with diver's knife, is pure DR. NO. And again, Berry being strapped to a laser table to be cut in half is straight out of GOLDFINGER. A diamond-powered spacecraft is the legacy of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Bond plays idly with his THUNDERBALL jet-pak in Q's laboratory, and so on. Taken all together these scenes form a kind of retrospective melange that is fun to watch. How many can you identify...?<br /><br />The movie begins on an interesting but unusual note: Bond is captured and tortured by the North Koreans. After more than a year a dirty, long haired, battered Bond is released in a prisoner exchange. Kept in an isolation chamber by MI-6, he is stripped of his 00 number. Managing a quick escape he begins to hunt for whoever betrayed him.<br /><br />His travels lead him to Jinx (Berry), an American NSA agent who is also hunting the turncoat. Together with fellow agent Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), they target the bizarre billionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stevens) whose right-hand man turns out to be Zhao (Rick Yune) the man Bond was exchanged for.<br /><br />The usual gadgets make their appearance. Best of all is an invisible Astin-Martin Vanquish, which, when visible, is easily the most-lethal looking car Bond has ever driven.<br /><br />Brosnan once again reprises the Conneryesque "dark Bond" of DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. Brosnan has aged a bit, and his face has developed character. In the seven years since GOLDENEYE he has finally made the role his own in a cool open-neck buttondown manner. The Havana beach scene underscores this by having the "James Bond Theme" played in the background with a Latin beat.<br /><br />There has been talk that Berry deserves her own Jinx franchise, and it certainly would sell. Jinx is a female Bond, wisecracking, irrepressible and endearing.<br /><br />The difficulties with DIE ANOTHER DAY are all the result of overexuberance on the part of the production team. They tried to create an epic, but the story drags its feet after a very promising beginning. The script quickly becomes predictable and so there's virtually no tension. The bad guys are bland (a mark of recent Bond films). Graves is too fey to seem dangerous and Zhao looks as if he mistakenly stepped off the set of THE MATRIX. Director Lee Tamahori consciously patterned this film after that franchise, and his derivative filmmaking leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The producers need to spend more time crafting a storyline and less on the set-action pieces that define Brosnan's Bond. They also need to bring back the Bond who knows which champagne to order at what temperature. In this styleless era such touches would have a life all their own.<br /><br />The title of the film grinds on the mind, coming so soon after TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Worse yet is the eminently forgettable Madonna title song, a piece of techno-pop throwaway that couldn't even survive in the dance clubs. Madonna's bad cameo as the owner/instructress of a fencing school is hopefully not the augry of a 21st century trend to having the title song artists appear on camera.<br /><br />There is a hyperreliance on special effects. Bond parasailing off a glacier is nothing more than the most heavyhanded CGI imaginable, exactly like a video game. It looks cheap and unconvincing in the midst of this high-budget project, a film with otherwise beautiful location shooting.<br /><br />The DVD is a two-disc set that is loaded with production goodies. It's all great fun. Though DIE ANOTHER DAY is "Bond 20" it definitely ranks in the top ten.</p></body></html>

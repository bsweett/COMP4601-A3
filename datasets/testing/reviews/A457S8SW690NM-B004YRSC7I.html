This movie is very deep and you'll need to think a lot to understand it. I actually plan on rewatching it as I only saw it once and I was confused at certain points. This movie might make you feel like tearing your hair out if you don't pay attention to something. Now, for the plot. The movie centers around Leonard, a man that has no short term memory. After he was hit in the head while trying to save his wife who got raped and murdered, he lost his ability to retain new memories. While he can remember everything up to the incident, everything since after around 15 minutes is impossible for him to remember. Leonard thus thinks that everyone is a stranger to him. He takes polaroid pictures of everyone that he has met and writes their name and information that he should retain about them from a past encounter. (if they're a liar, etc..) He also must take pictures of his car, and Inn where he stays. Lenny's goal is to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. He's got one big gun and will do anything to find this man. He gets assistance from a cop and a good friend. But, he doesn't know who he can trust and life gets very hectic for him. The movie is told in reverse chronological order, going from the end until the start. Not until the very end (start...) of the movie will you understand everything. And then, you probably won't understand everything and will need to rewatch it. This movie is a masterpiece and it's one that I will definitely add to my collection. The ending is very unpredictable and excellent. The movie is a masterpiece as I have said because it's so original. The acting is great notably by Joe Pantoliano. After watching this one, believe me, you'll want to rewatch it over and over to be able to understand everything.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="LA Plays Itself"></head><body><p>Tom Cruise got a lot of favorable press at the time of this film's release for playing an unredeemed and unredeemable killer.  He is good, to be sure.  You won't quickly forget his steely, relentless hitman.  He's like demon from an icy hell.  Still, while not exactly a one-note performance, he takes a back seat to Jamie Foxx (literally AND figuratively) in this taut thriller.  Foxx, of course, has the advantage of portraying a Mensch, not a psychopath.  You feel for him every moment he is in the clutches of Cruise's madman.  And just when you think he might get out, he always gets sucked back in.  It is as nightmarish a scenario as any horror film.<br /><br />Even the predictable elements (like the fact that Jada Pinckett Smith's character will somehow wind up getting embroiled in the mayhem) are fraught with twists and turns.  Her involvement ups the ante for Foxx's taxi driver hero Max.  He has already proven himself more resourceful and resilient than viewers might have guessed at first.  By the end of the film, Max proves himself more than the killer's equal, matching him manoeuvre for manoeuvre.<br /><br />At the film's beginning, Max is revealed as a cab driver who knows Los Angeles like the proverbial back of his hand.  He can tell you exactly how long it will take to get from one point to another in that sprawling city.  Affable and modest about his talents, he nonetheless conveys quite early on that, in the contest of wills with this murderous outsider, he will prove to have home turf advantage.<br /><br />And what a home turf it is.  As many have stated, LA by night is as much a character in the film as the two principles.  It's seamy glamour has seldom been better portrayed.  Contemporary Los Angeles takes on an almost surreal, foreboding aura.  It's like BLADE RUNNER, without the sci-fi elements.  That creepy.  And that good.</p></body></html>

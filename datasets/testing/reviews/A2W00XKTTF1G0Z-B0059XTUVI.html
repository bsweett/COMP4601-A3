Her performance is amazing. It's detailed and extremely subtle. Broadly gentle and very honest in what ends up being the end of her life. I understand why she was nominated and why she won! With the make-up, movements and emotion...she was Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />However, Director Phyllidia Lloyd may not have the chops this type of drama film. It was slow to start and has the style of seeing the legendary English leader going through her daily routine as an elderly, dementia stricken woman - by going back and forth with flashbacks brought on by her old pics, memorabilia, news clippings and even clothing. Director Lloyd did a much better job directing Mama Mia.  The fast paced, toe-tapping, gotta-sing-along, movie musical with the ABBA soundtrack!<br /><br />What makes this movie passable and worth waiting for is the performances; once you get to them! Thatcher's husband Denis, played humorously by the brilliant Jim Broadbent (Harry Potter, Moulin Rouge, Indiana Jones) makes their partnership - both in life and death extremely heartfelt.<br /><br />Other amazing performances included those by Anthony Head (Merlin, Buffy The vampire Slayer) who was the Parliament President and that of Richard E. Grant (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Corpse Bride) who played Parliament's lead man. The two against Meryl were engaging to say the least.<br /><br />Overall the screenplay, written by Abi Morgan (from British TV) like the film, is a little slow handed. The pieces of controversy over English issues with her people and the Falkland Islands became great dialogue scenes with anger, frustration and why Thatcher was coined `The Iron Lady' by the Russians. If anything the performances and inside view of history that Margaret Thatcher made, make this film worth watching. I can see why she won the Oscar and the other performances were nominated....but I can also see why the rest of the picture wasn't nominated as film overall. Meryl is definitely worth it as is the rest of the cast. There is a great ensemble of actors in this film.....just takes a little while to get to those scenes!</p></body></html>

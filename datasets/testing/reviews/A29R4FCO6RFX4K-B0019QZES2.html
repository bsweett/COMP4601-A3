No matter how good the writing is, or how charming the Hollywood A-list cast is, comedy sequels always receive indifferent reviews, and regardless of box office success, they never reach the heights of the "sometimes not that great too begin with" original movie. Sure, there are laughs, but Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro did all this before, and second time around, the back-and-forth shtick doesn't hit it off. The highlight is Dustin Hoffman, who manages to take a stereotypical character and give the film the most laughs. But cheap jokes about sex and circumcises are more painful than positive. And I think we got the idea that Gay Lord Focker is a queer name, it's only drilled into your brain every 5 minutes. On the plus side, the music zips the movie along at a sprightly pace, and there are some genuine chuckles to be had, but you shouldn't have to search for them. Like the recent string of comedy sequels (Whole Ten Yards, Ocean's 12 etc) Fockers thinks it's way funnier than it actually is. If easily pleased empty head American audiences actually sat back and watched the movie, they would realize what others have: there's nothing special about it, and probably a waste of your hard-earned green. Fockers fares better on DVD, where late-night viewings amuse more easily.</p></body></html>

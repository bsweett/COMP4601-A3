There were too many racial slurs and slangs which made me feel uncomfortable at times.  Just too much name calling!  The filming was a bit dreary, it was depressing to watch.  The climatic end was touching but it left me feeling empty.  There hasn't been a really good movie released in over a year, what's up???</p></body></html>

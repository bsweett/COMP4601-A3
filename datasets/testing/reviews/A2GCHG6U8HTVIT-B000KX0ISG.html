My take was that two thirds of it was a very good, interesting film, but a third of it was just self conscious direction with a lot of the hip ultra-violence. I liked Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi a lot, especially Penn (although I didn't recognize him at first). The premise was interesting.<br /><br />But then I kept bumping against items like these (which may be spoilers):<br /><br />Mr. Blonde has already been established as a psycho, so why the extended cop torturing and ear removal? What did that add to Madsen's character or to advancing the plot? It seemed to me it was just calculated violence to be hip.<br /><br />Why the camera work that, for me, only brought attention to the camera work: The circling camera; the stationary camera in front of the window with the actor walking back and forth out of camera range; the set up in front of the graffiti-laden wall for apparently no reason except the graffiti looked great? Unusual camera work can add to the feel of a movie (just look at Welles' stuff) but it shouldn't keep saying, "Hey, look at me," which was the effect it had on my viewing.<br /><br />Why the over-the-top melodrama of the three-way shoot-out climax except to give the audience a chance to say, "Cool"?<br /><br />Why the over-the-top and, in my opinion, indulgent groaning, moaning and spluttering of Keitel at the end?<br /><br />As I said, I found about two-thirds of the movie pretty good. Many say it's been very influential, and it probably has. But like a Paris high fashion gown, it might get your attention, it might be influential, but sooner or later it becomes dated and a little ridiculous. I think that may be Reservoir Dog's fate.</p></body></html>

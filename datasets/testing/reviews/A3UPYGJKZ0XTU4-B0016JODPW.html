<meta name="summary" content="Desperation Begets More Desperation, and Then Some."></head><body><p>"May you be in heaven half an hour...before the Devil knows you're dead." Thus begins the 45th film of Sidney Lumet's 60-year directing career, a New York crime drama with an intimate feel and a gamut of emotions. Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an upper-middle class executive living beyond his means. His brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) is a working class divorc&eacute; with burdensome child support payments. They both need money in a hurry. The cooler Andy cajoles the malleable Hank into robbing their parents suburban jewelry store. And one disaster leads to another.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" shows us the robbery first, then jumps back in time to what led to it. The mystery is not who committed the crime, but why. We see the days leading up to the robbery more than once, but nothing is actually repeated, as we are seeing events from different perspectives. Then it is forward in time, to the aftermath. The story is told through conversations in closed spaces, which create an accelerating sense of the world caving in on Andy and Hank, a downward spiral from which they try to escape with increasing desperation.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet was quick to label this film a "melodrama", and if viewers take it any other way, credibility will be strained. People tend to think of melodrama as something that goes over the top, leaving the audience either laughing or dozing off out of incredulity. That's melodrama done badly. I'm a huge fan of the crime thrillers and murder dramas of the 1940s that came to be known as "film noir". They're about extremes of behavior. Pure melodrama. They succeeded because they were introverted, and the actors emoted as little as possible. They barely moved their facial muscles.<br /><br />Ever since more histrionic styles of acting came into fashion in the 1970s, melodrama has been a risky undertaking. Bizarre behavior and emoting are a dicey combination. Performances can easily slip into the realm of the ridiculous. This happens a few times in "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead", but the mundanity always overcomes the melodrama. The film grounds itself in constant reminders of just how mundane it all is. The score and all the little middle class details tell us how ordinary these lives are, even as they are flipping out. So we can enjoy the fireworks without questioning the behavior.<br /><br />The DVD (ThinkFilm 2008): There is a featurette, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. '"Directed by Sidney Lumet: How the Devil Was Made" (24 min) interviews Sidney Lumet, actors Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, and Marisa Tomei, and producers Michael Cerenzie and Brian Linse, about the script, melodrama, Lumet's directing style and rehearsal process. The feature commentary is with Sidney Lumet, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Ethan Hawke. In a friendly tone, they discuss shooting in HD, working with familiar New York actors, casting, and provide some scene-by-scene commentary. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.</p></body></html>

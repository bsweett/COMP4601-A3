Everything works like going from picture frame to picture frame. Even the color and dialog mimics the simplistic style and phrasing from a comic book.<br /><br />The movie is very violent but, this work is adapted from a very violent graphic novel. The violence should not surprise anybody. This is hardly for children.<br /><br />The stories are fun and suspensful. You will root for teh hero and wish nothing but pain for the villains.<br /><br />The best performance is from Micky Rourke playing a very violent thug that also has as soft place in his heart for women. He portrays the toughest SOB I have ever seen in film. I love the electric chair scene.<br /><br />This is a very daring, adventerous yet arty movie that worked, It should not be taken seriously.<br /><br />Other movies tried to be like a comic book (Dick Tracey, Batman, Superman) but this actually accomplishes it. The others are comic book inspired flicks butthis is actually a moving visualization of a comic book.<br /><br />This gets an A+ for the artistic effect and a B+ for the movie content.</p></body></html>

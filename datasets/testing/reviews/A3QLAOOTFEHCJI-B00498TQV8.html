<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films from 2010"></head><body><p>Young Jennifer Lawrence (Ree Dolly) is so effective in this movie as she was in a little seen movie from 2009 called "The Burning Plain" staring Kim Basinger. "Winter's Bone"  is set in poor rural Missouri which is even more bleak than the setting in "Burning Plain". Ree at 17 heads a family consisting of siblings of 12 and 7, a mother who is mentally ill and jail prone dad who's disappeared. He must show up for trial in a week or the family will forfeit the family home and property. Hell, it must only be worth $100 and that's if you set fire to everything. In any case, it's all they have. Ree sets out on foot (can't afford a vehicle) through the rural countryside to find clues about her dad's whereabouts. He's a meth cook and distributor but it's clear he got in trouble with the bad guys when he blabbered while in custody. Ree is determined to find him or his remains so the bond can be lifted and they can return to their life of eating dirt. It's unsettling to watch, but I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.<br /><br />I saw this film when it first opened and mentally nominated Jennifer Lawrence for an Oscar for her strong performance as Ree, the reluctant matriarch of a poor family in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.  John Hawkes was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for his role of Teardrop, Ree's uncle. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant especially Dale Dickey as Merab, the wife of the county drug lord. Old favorite Sheryl Lee shows up in a small but terrific performance as the ex-girlfriend of Ree's dad. The film is bleak, dour and depressing but gives an unflinching look at life among hardscrabble mountain folk. A superb second outing for director Debra Granik who also co-wrote the script.</p></body></html>

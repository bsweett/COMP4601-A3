<meta name="summary" content="Aronofsky's latest is a visually stunning (lightweight) masterpiece of psychological horror"></head><body><p>Darren Aronofsky's latest tells the story of a troubled young dancer.  Withdrawn and focused on perfection, she channels in her tiny, muscled body the ambition and resentment of her overbearing mother.  Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance as Nina, who's won the role of the Swan Queen in an ambitious adaptation of Tchakovsky's Swan Lake ballet.  She begins to break down under the strain of a demanding choreographer, who insists she be more passionate, and a controlling mother who wishes her to remain a biddable child.  I never expected a story about ballerinas could be so viscerally intense - at once moving and horrific.  It's a small, simple film that aims to do just what good psychological horror does, to affect the viewer, to disorient and frighten.  Worked for me.</p></body></html>

But we plunge into grayer areas when we get to discuss mules, which are people, usually women, who smuggle drugs into the US in their stomachs, risking their lives in the process. Of course it is an offense punishable with prison, but in this case one should consider that in many cases the offender might have found herself down a path that she could not avoid; that is the case of Maria Alvarez.<br /><br />Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a seventeen year-old girl, living in a small town in Colombia and working in a flower nursery, stripping roses of their thorns. The working conditions resemble a subtle form of slavery and workers are mistreated relentlessly and paid below what is needed to satisfy their basic needs. When she ends up pregnant by a boyfriend she does not love and who does not love her, she decides to go to Bogot&aacute; in search of a brighter future for her and her baby. Right before leaving she meets Franklin and when he says he can get her a well-paid job in Bogot&aacute; she does not hesitate and jumps on his bike.<br /><br />When Maria arrives in Bogot&aacute; we get to see how dealers get people who are going through a tough time to do their dirty work, first suggesting the deal as if it was legal and little by little letting the true story slip out. All the while they present a friendly face and promise riches beyond belief for these poor girls. When on her first trip into the US, with an old friend and a new one, Maria has to face a disastrous situation, she has to show what she is made of and decide how she wants to live the rest of her life.<br /><br />A few aspects are noteworthy about this movie, like how well it shows the hardship that most people living in South America have to go through in their everyday lives. As mentioned, we get a gut-wrenching depiction of the methods drug dealers use to gather their "troops" and the differences between the situation they promise and what reality is. Finally, we get to see that a loving family, that took the time to inculcate the appropriate values, always has an impact on the decisions we make when the going gets tough.<br /><br />Besides the thought provoking and emotional story, this film counts with an actress that delivers an amazing performance, especially when one considers that this is her first movie in a leading role. One thing is guaranteed, we will have many chances to see her in future productions, and I will be waiting for them.</p></body></html>

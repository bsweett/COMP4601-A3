<meta name="summary" content="Very Enjoyable Movie - Recommended"></head><body><p>"Underworld" is one of those movies that I can watch just about any time. While some horror purists may take exception to the folklore surrounding the vampires and werewolves portrayed in the move, I think the minor changes are logical and work well, with the exception that the vampires are a lot weaker than they should be.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the centuries long struggle between vampires and werewolves. On the surface, the vampires appear to have the upper hand with squads of "Death Dealers" (including Kate Beckinsale)  hunting down the werewolves. The twist comes when the werewolves appear to become interested in human target, for purposes other than eating him.<br /><br />The movie has a great dark atmosphere that gives a gothic feel even though it is set in the current time (except for the flashbacks). The cinematography is very good and the special effects are generally well done and certainly not over used. The acting is fairly good and Kate Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie! Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

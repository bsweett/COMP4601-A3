<meta name="summary" content="But Her Hair Never Gets Tangled, Only the Plot"></head><body><p>OK, it's pretty funny, and Rapunzel's hair is not only beautiful, it is magical. For one thing, it never did get tangled, for all the title suggests. As someone whose hair was nowhere near that long when a week's worth of bed head was bad enough to cut it off, I find it very hard to believe that she was able to keep it so smooth and clean and healthy. Imagine what it must have been like to wash!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie does not explore these practical matters. What's more, her hair often seems to change in length, which is an inconsistency not common in Disney films. Still, the girl is undeniably pretty, even if she sounds far more 21st century than back in the "once upon a time" days. This is not particularly unusual for Disney princesses, however.<br /><br />Just in case anyone has missed the basic premise, a princess was born with long, magical golden hair. It could cure anything, including injuries and old age. She was therefore kidnapped by an old witch who kept her locked in a tower, claiming to be her mother who was protecting her from the mean old world outside, and using Rapunzel's hair to keep herself young.<br /><br />Rapunzel remembers nothing of her former life consciously, but some of it comes out in her painting, which she does all around the walls and ceiling of her tower chamber. But all she knows of the world outside is what she can see from her window. And one thing she can see is that on her birthday every year, thousands of glowing lights appear in the distance, all different colors and floating on the wind. Her mother says they are stars, bur Rapunzel is smart enough to know that they don't act like the stars do. She does not know it, but her royal parents have made a tradition of setting lamps like tiny hot air balloons adrift on her birthday, in her memory and in the hope that she may see them and know that they are calling to her.<br /><br />Of course there must be a handsome rescuer, but this time it is a thief who has just broken into the palace and stolen the crown which sat on an altar waiting for the return of the golden-haired princess. I doubt that he knows that story, or he would probably have known who Rapunzel was when he met her.<br /><br />In any case, the story is the traditional one with lots of amusing additions, including a little chameleon who is Rapunzel's pet. It's pretty and it's fun, but it's Disney, which means it's a pretty high sugar content for me.</p></body></html>

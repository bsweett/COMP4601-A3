Quentin Tarantino was the hottest director to emerge out of the early 90's. Expectations from others placed on Quentin Tarantino were so high that he had to top Reservoir Dogs in the next film, and he did. Back to Reservoir Dogs, everything I could possibly ask for was in the film. Reservoir Dogs may boast of having the strongest introduction ever because it's that good...creating naturalism, setting the atmosphere, and getting know to the characters and then liking them immediately. Somehow, I would say, if I had my expectations extremely low when starting off the film, I would have been totally unprepared for the rawness that Reservoir Dogs brings. Meanwhile, Reservoir Dogs was an acting workshop where each character can work out their manners, lines, and movements. All of the performances were equal and of superior kind. I did think that Chris Penn gave the best performance out of the bunch. The more interesting thing about Reservoir Dogs was that Quentin Tarantino did not show the actual diamond heist gone bad but rather allowed the audience to absorb the details as if they were creating a secondary story. In a result, the optional scene became superfluous. That's a brilliant work of a director. The aftermath after the fiasco was much more interesting and set the tone for the entire picture while at the same time the beforehand knowledge of the characters became the more the merrier. Of course, it's violent, bloody, and explosive. Then again, the idea was to top something else for the sake of newness, and, in that case, it's The Wild Bunch. Perhaps the most memorable character out of Reservoir Dogs was the psychopath Mr. Blonde played well by, ironically, the black-haired Michael Madsen. Then, came along Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, and Steve Buscemi for their supporting roles...they were all outstanding. Lawrence Tierney, a veteran actor of dark film noir, was the perfect boss because he looked exactly like one. There was a couple of problems in the film. One was the weak character development of Mr. Blue. Don't you think his character ought to be cut out? Secondly, when I slo-motioned the final confrontation scene, Chris Penn fell backward as if he got shot yet he wasn't shot yet. Anyway, the latter was really trivial. Now finally acknowledging it as a masterpiece as I raise its rating from `7' to `10', Reservoir Dogs is one of the fewest coolest pictures made, and it's already a cult film for so many reasons.<br /><br />6/11: Going to drop my rating of Reservoir Dogs from `10' to `8', I still think it's a good film. Just a couple of flaws in it. One is the acting is a bit overdone at times and just a bit too theatrical for me. Two is that so much blood came out of Mr. Orange over time that it becomes hard to believe he is still alive. The story is as clever as it gets, and the random moments are all connected together. It's a great piece of work where Quentin stole ideas from so many films and incorporated them into his own film, and the result is quite good. Of all actors, I think Sean Penn's work stands out the most. He is real good in his performance. The rest of everybody else is decent. Of course, there is a lot of moments in the film, making it a very watchable picture. All in all, no matter how bloody the film looks, Reservoir Dogs is worth watching.</p></body></html>

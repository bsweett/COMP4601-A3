<meta name="summary" content="Director's getting better, though he couldn't have gotten much worse."></head><body><p>Hide and Seek (John Polson, 2005)<br /><br />Polson (who is far better known as an actor than as a director) was responsible, before this, for a travesty of celluloid called Swimf@n. Had I known that before, I'd probably have been a lot more wary of this interesting, if ultimately predictable, Robert DeNiro vehicle.<br /><br />Psychologist David Calloway (DeNiro) and his daughter Emily (Dreamer's Dakota Fanning) relocate from New York City to a small town upstate following the suicide of Calloway's wife (Amy Irving). Things immediately start going somewhat awry-- in addition to some extremely odd townsfolk, Emily finds herself a friend named Charlie. David starts off convinced that Charlie is an imaginary friend into whom Emily is pouring her emotional reactions to her mother's death, but as Charlie's pranks get more and more vicious, David has to face the fact that Charlie really does exist. Things come to a head when David tentatively befriends Elizabeth Young (Mysterious Skin's Elisabeth Shue). Charlie doesn't like that-- no sir, not one bit.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the movie works like a charm, building up suspense like nobody's business-- we know Charlie's not just a figment of Emily's imagination, but David steadfastly refuses to believe it. Unfortunately, once he starts believing as well, the film goes downhill fast. Polson wanted to pick up the pace, I guess, and lost pretty much any sense of suspense, continuity, or believability he'd bought for us in the first hour.<br /><br />Interestingly, the DVD version gives us four alternate versions of the final scene, all but one of which actually work better than the film's climax (I preferred the fourth, YMMV). A bit of rewriting in the third act, and this might have been the film Darkness so desperately tried (and failed) to be; as it stands, it's just another routine cheap-thrill flick. ** ?</p></body></html>

However, despite the fact that this isn't a perfect movie, I found it to be extremely enjoyable and didn't want it to end. Let's face it, this sort of film was always going to be more about action and somewhat less about storyline. And what action there is I found to be very entertaining, with lots of variety in the way the combat between the three races (if you include humans) takes place as well as many unpredictable moments and inventive use of each races particular traits.<br /><br />Quite simply all my favourite aspects of the two film series are thrown together in one place, and I'm praying for an even better sequel.<br /><br />To have a balanced viewpoint I should comment on the minor niggles that some people seem to dwell on (and miss out on the otherwise enjoyable parts of the movie). The plot itself - I won't comment on the specifics, but the story that emerges later on is perhaps a little too ambitous, and a simpler story that could have been built on in future sequel(s) may have been better received. My only other minor complaints were a couple of plot holes and minimal character development in most of the characters - but none of these will affect your enjoyment of this DVD as long as you don't dwell on them like most people seem to...<br /><br />A few years ago most people doubted whether this crossover would ever happen. Now it's here most people are demanding perfection! I for one would rather appreciate what we have got and think about two of the greatest and most inventive sci-fi creatures ever created battling it out before your eyes. Superb!</p></body></html>

I like watching Part 3s, especially Part 3s to successful, blockbuster flicks.  By the time you get to a Part 3 in a series, the screenwriters are trying their damnedest to put a new spin on the story and take it in a different direction to separate it from the first.  This usually results in laughable, silly and outrageous ideas on film.  After all, everything cool and worthwhile was in Part 1, and sometimes you can wring a few interesting concepts from a Part 2, but by Part 3 you're really stretching it(and of course even more so if more sequels are made).  Stuff like Star Wars and Back to the Future don't count coz they were envisioned as trilogies from the getgo.  But Part 3s can be very fun to watch in their own right.  They might be bad films(in rare cases they are better than the Part 2), but can be enjoyed in a different way than the first film was enjoyed.<br />It's because of Part 3s that Rocky is getting thrown out of the ring by Hulk Hogan, and that Superman is teaming up with Richard Pryor and dealing with an evil twin.  It's also the reason Karate Kid 3 ended up being Karate Kid 3.<br />Well, in this case of Part 3s, I'm talking about the Antichrist.  No, not Will Farrell, good ol' Damien from The Omen.  In the Final Conflict he has managed to go from 5 to 32 years old in the space of 5 years.  He is now reigning king of Thorn Industries and ambassador to Great Britain.  He gets a bit worried when he finds out that Christ has recently been reborn, and sends his "Disciples of the Watch"(Ha! Now I know where Testament got that!) to kill all babies born on that particular day.  If that weren't stressful enough for the Antichrist, there's a gang of Antichrist hunters out to assassinate him.  Armed with those daggers that were given to Gregory Peck in the first film, they periodically attack, only to fail of course.  Besides, wasn't this act supposed to be carried out on hallowed ground?  Oh well, it's a Part 3.<br />There's also a reporter who has the hots for Damien, then eventually realizes who he is, but by that time her son has been brought into the Antichrist fold.  Damien also introduces her to the wonderful world of rough sex.<br />This movie is okay.  It's not terribly exciting, but just interesting enough to make you want to see it through.  Yes, some new concepts are thrown in, but this movie really doesn't feel like a horror film at all, and that's a far cry from the first Omen.  I've always really liked Sam Neill, but it's difficult for me to buy him as the Antichrist.  He's too nice or something.  He seems more just like a corrupt and shrewd  corporate headhoncho than the son of the devil.  Plus, you'd think the "final conflict" between Jesus and the Antichrist would be a bit more epic.  I mean, this is the battle of all battles, baby!!  This should be Cecil B. Demille on friggin' steroids.  This should make Lord of the Rings look like Deathstalker 4.<br />Oh, well.  I guess for a movie that was pretty unnecessary to begin with, it wasn't all that bad.</p></body></html>

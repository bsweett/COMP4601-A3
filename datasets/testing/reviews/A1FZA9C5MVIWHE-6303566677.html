Simpson was supposed to be the Terminator, however, Arnold Schwarzeneggar grabbed that role. since Arnold is now governor, I know the perfect candidate for the Terminator in case no. 4 comes out: Jean-Claude Van Damme. the plot line for all three Terminator movies is simple: assassinate John Connor so that the human resistance will lose. as always, a protector is sent to keep him from harm. In this case, Kyle Reese is sent to protect Sarah from the T-101. Kyle becomes the father of John. the T-101 gets terminated in the end, right under a hydraulic press. please produce Terminator 4!</p></body></html>

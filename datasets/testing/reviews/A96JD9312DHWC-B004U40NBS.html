<meta name="summary" content="Little Swan, can you be a good and bad dicotomy"></head><body><p>(movie review)<br />To become the best, you have to literally "become the best." That is what the delimma here is. In order to dance the swan in the newest version of Swan Lake, Natalie Portman is asked to become both the light and dark sides of herself. Doing the first part is her specialty but the dark - that is different. Still, she has already managed to take the place of her former and feel good in that. The flipside there is that she also has someone new breathing down her neck, waiting to take over. With the pressure adding up and time running out, can she become the thing she hopes to be?<br /><br />When I went to see Black Swan, I don't know what I expected but I did expect something more. I'm not downing the movie either, because it delivers on a psychological plateau. Still, the hype about awards and about the darkness within this movie make it out to be something that should be able to overwhelm you with the mystery of the moment. Instead, it is mostly about the struggles of one dancer trying not to lose it as she makes herslef into something more.<br /><br />There are admittedly odd parts and those are interesting. There is also this feeling of paranoia that stretches all across this picture, making you feel like something is happening. Things appear in the shadows, people do not seem to be what they claim to be, and a metamorphsis seems to be transpiring. all the time you watch this and wonder what is going on, and good acting leads you to really question the reality and the sanity of the situation. That's the upside. The downside is that small bits happen here and there, adding in about fifteen minutes of mystery into this growing feature. In some ways it has Jacob's Ladde rmoments that are really downplayed, making you wonder what you just witnessed. Still, it is not all good. You have slow places mingling in, making the movie drag in places. she dances and practices and loves and does other things. she even has a moment where her director tells her to go home and touch herself. That and the "moment" her fellow actress share - the thing some people seem to have hyped - are things that were seen by a lot of people but should not be such big things.<br /><br />There's a lot more to this than that.<br /><br />If you want to know this movie, think mindgames and then decide. You know what the person wants and you know others will want it, too. You also know it has oddity, but this is not a new feeling. It does have a good setup and I like it enough to say it is a solid 4, but I am not overly impressed. I would not see it again, for example, having my fill of it. That said, I did like it and I thought it was good - I just hate critically acclaimed because it misleads.<br /><br />4 stars - again, this is for the movie on the big screen and one time through.<br /><br />Thank you for your time</p></body></html>

Sure, Troma's been doing movies with silly, outrageous plots for some time now, but we all know what those films are like.  Bubba Ho-Tep is a film that is B movie all the way, and aims to make you laugh, and succeeds in a more classy way than a Troma film.  I was inpressed by Don Coscarelli letting his wacky side loose.  Honestly, I had begun to think that he couldn't really do anything outside the Phantasm series, which I also love.  It's so hard to try and explain this movie because it's not the typical B horror comedy, or the Army Of Darkness humor that Bruce Campbell worshippers have come to expect.  Sure, he's funny as hell in his role, but not in his trademark slapstick way.  He can also act.......and good!  The role is bizarre and far fetched, but he's very convincing and obviously Bruce really believed in this project coz it shows in his performance.  It's amazing how his performance is a spoof, yet it's also a serious tribute to Elvis Presley.  Not too many guys could pull this job off, folks.  Most actors could only play it totally bio-pic serious or straight forward comedy.  Ossie Davis?  I've always liked Ossie Davis, and he's just as likeable and funny here as Bruce.  I can't say he hit JFK right on the head, he could have just as easily been a different character.  That's small potatoes though, coz he's perfect as Bruce's partner either way you cut it.  This movie could have worked just on the "what if" premise of it's two stars, but no!  It gets more outrageous as it goes along by pitting these celebrities up against a soul sucking mummy type guy that sucks souls through people's butts and writes dirty messages on bathroom stall walls in hieroglyphics.  Really, could you ask for a better movie late at night in the theater over some buttered popcorn and a box of Dots?  Cheesy B movies in a theater at night is what living's all about.  Too bad it doesn't happen that much anymore.  We're stuck with having to see crud like Gothika which takes itself way too seriously, and in many ways is alot more silly than this film!  It may be hard to track down considering your local corporate theater chains won't have the time of day for this film and would rather play crud like the Texas Chainsaw remake for another week instead of this film.  But, if you can find it, see it!  You'll like it!  Thank you, Mr. Coscarelli.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Critics are dumb and I'm not!"></head><body><p>Teenage comic geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) asks the question "why hasn't anyone ever tried to be a super hero ?" to his friends. Which leads to him giving it a try and calling himself Kick-Ass. He gets hurt bad the first time, which doesn't stop him from trying it again. After his second attempt is a success and he becomes a hit with the public, a dangerous criminal leader Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a hit on Kick-Ass.<br /><br />  D'Amico thinks that Kick-Ass is the super hero that's getting in the way of his business, when it's in-fact Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his sidekick daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz). To get his father's approval, Chris D'Aico (Christoper Mintz Plasse) volunteers to disguise himself as a super hero named Red Mist and become friends with Kick-Ass and gain his trust.<br /><br />  Oh no! There's an 8 year old that curses her head off! I should be a big wuss and hate the movie like some of the dumb critics out there. Sue me though, I loved Kick-Ass. Critics who hated the film mostly due to Moretz's potty mouth annoy me. I mean Roger Ebert for one, loved the Exorcist and Orphan and didn't those films have young girls saying horribly disturbing things ? So that's just a poor excuse to hate on the film. It's still incredibly entertaining and easily the best comic based movie since the Dark Knight.</p></body></html>

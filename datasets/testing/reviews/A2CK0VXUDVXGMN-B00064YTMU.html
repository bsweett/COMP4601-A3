I say, Zilch!  Its almost what this stupid movie is worth - 0 stars. But I was in a generous mood and gave it 2, only for the visual experience.  Bad plot, bad script are the tale of this movie.  Seeing all these positive reviews tells me more about the dumbing down of American society than anything!</p></body></html>

Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as Clarice Starling, she sure made the right decision! Moore is awkward as Starling, she has a hard time tackling the accent. Hopkins is still creepy but that scene with the pigs is so vile, I covered my eyes, ugh! Horrible movie, Red Dragon is better than this.</p></body></html>

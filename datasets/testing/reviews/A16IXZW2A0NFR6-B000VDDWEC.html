This excellent film as well as the very funny Shaun of the Dead and the decent Dawn of the Dead remake have given us hope. This one is the best of the three. Suspenseful, well written, smart, and well acted this movie succeeds not only for horror fans, but fans of good quality cinema.</p></body></html>

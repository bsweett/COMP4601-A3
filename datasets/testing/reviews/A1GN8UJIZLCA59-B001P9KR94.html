<meta name="summary" content="Eye Opening Academy Award Winner"></head><body><p>Slumdog Millionaire has been dubbed the little film that could going from an almost direct to video film into an eight-time Academy Award winner including Best Picture.  The film has an incredibly interesting premises, detailing how an illiterate street kid could be one answer away from winning $20M rupees on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire by showing how he knew the answers through a series of flashbacks detailing where his knowledge of the answers came from.  Most of these flashbacks show the dangerous and hellacious aspects of life in the slums of India.  The way young children are used and abused by the Fagan like hustlers is disturbing.  Director Danny Boyle ultimately turns the movie into a love story, but he doesn't shy away from the gritty details of the life of the so-called slumdogs.  Griping, intense and ultimately heartwarming, Slumdog Millionaire is worthy of all the accolades it has garnered.</p></body></html>

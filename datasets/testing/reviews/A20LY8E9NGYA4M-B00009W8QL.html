<meta name="summary" content="BRIEF AND ENTERTAINING MOVIE."></head><body><p>&quot;Phone Booth&quot; is a brief, entertaining and brisk film. I can believe that it was directed by the same director of the pathetic movies &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman & Robin&quot;, this time Joel Schumacher did the things right.<br /><br /> Colin Farrell stars in "Phone Booth", he plays an egocentric, self-centered, manipulative guy, and Farrell really gets the job done, he dominates the role because not only he plays in a very convincing way the character, but as the movie moves forward Stu changes and Farrell displays a good range of emotions.<br /><br /> Kiefer Sutherland plays the psycho that harasses Stu, most of the movie Sutherland only uses his voice, and that's enough because the audience really is convinced by his performance. The beautiful Katie Holmes plays Pamela, she is Stu's "girlfriend", and even though Katie appears briefly in "Phone Booth", she is more than welcome.<br /><br /> The movie's pace is very fast and the editing is very cool, like in the TV action series &quot;24&quot;. Farrell is good as Stu, but Kiefer Sutherland steals the show, he is a great villain in this movie with his creepy voice. &quot;Phone Booth&quot; should entertain most of the people.</p></body></html>

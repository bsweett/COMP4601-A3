<meta name="summary" content="An immediate classic!"></head><body><p>I was hesitant about this movie for one reason. From the previews I saw I figured it depicted gay men in a negative light by getting married and eventually hurting the women and children they belonged to. But I was wrong.<br /><br />This movie isn't about that. It is about love, plain and simple.<br /><br />There aren't the descriptives here to express the ability this movie has to move you.<br /><br />The acting is stellar from all. The story is excellent and carried out very well on screen. The cinematography is breathtaking at times and the music truly reflects the mood.<br /><br />The basic theme of this movie is that love will strike in it's own time, and with whomever it deems is 'the one'. The love that struck the two main characters here was taboo and they do the best they can to quell the fire within them. When the realization hits that it's bigger than the mountain they met on they meet throughout the rest of their lives to satiate the need they have for each other.<br /><br />The angst, confusion, identity issues and all the other problems that would go with a 'taboo' love are what carry this movie.<br /><br />An unlikely forerunner in the award category, this movie is destined to be a classic. It has all the right elements.<br /><br />If you have been hesitant to watch this movie because of the theme do yourself a favor.... rent it and watch it. It has a lot to say about life and love.</p></body></html>

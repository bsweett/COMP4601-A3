<meta name="summary" content="MAN OF STEEL"></head><body><p>I waited a while to see this film because I was just not sold on Routh as the man of steel, but after seeing the movie, I think he was a good choice, eventhough it was a bit creepy to see him mimic Christopher Reeve, it was almost like caracature.  Kevin Spacey was fantastic, though i was taken aback at how dark they made Lex, I mean to have him actually Murder Superman was shocking and the way it was done was so cold and raw, but he did channel Hackman with some of his humor.  It was a gorgeous film to watch, the cinematography was stunning.  If  you have any interest in Superman or enjoyed the Superman of Christopher Reeve, then i dont think you'll be disappointed in this film, but be forwarned it can be dark.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE RUSSELL CROWE BOXING MOVIE!"></head><body><p>Among thespians there is a tradition and superstition around the play Macbeth.  IT is simple referred to as "The Scottish Play."  This film needs a similar tradition.  From hereon out, I decree that this film shall be called "The Russell Crowe Boxing Movie."<br /><br />Except for the title, there is nothing wrong whatsoever with this film. It is the perfect feel-good movie.  It is not only about Braddock taking on the boxing ring and the Depression, but we are also treated to his wife point of view.  Aussie Russell Crow glides easily into the Irish accent, and Zellwegger manages to talk like Betty Boop throughout the movie.<br /><br />Howard gives you a feel not only for Braddock's struggle, but also for the devastating impact of the Depression on many people. The power outages, the past-due bills, and the watering down milk for the kids.  He should get an Oscar just for his accurate portrayal of the era.<br /><br />I think Howard has finally come to his own and found his voice as a director.  It is not the front-view boxing images, but that quick flash of the X-ray when Braddock cracks his ribs.  Genius!<br /><br />I give this film Six stars, and take away one star for letting the odd title in the films. It is not a major part of the movies (it is mention twice), and sounds too much like Jerry Lewis's Cinderfella.  Rename and re-release this film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An action, political adventure at its best!"></head><body><p>"Blood Diamond" is the kind of action film that makes you think that 'a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life...'<br /><br />The film opens in Sierra Leone, 1999 when Civil war rages for control of the diamond fields...According to devastating reports, these stones are being used with both rebels and government forces to purchase more weapons and finance civil war...<br /><br />Danny Archer--crazy for diamonds like everybody else--believes this pink gem holds his ticket out of this godforsaken continent... He is a smuggler, a former mercenary and weapons trader from Zimbabwe who bribes all, and supplies arms to both sides... He gets Solomon Vandy--captured by government troops--out of jail only because he overhears that the fisherman might have found a clear massive stone about the size of a bird's egg...<br /><br />Vandy--forced apart from his family and sent off to work as a slave in the minefields--has hided the enormous 100 carat diamond from his captors and buried it in a secret place within the jungle... His son Dia is taking away by a brainwashing militia called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) turning him with lies, drugs, and liquor, into a cold-blooded murderer...<br /><br />Danny makes a deal to help the noble fisherman find his family if Vandy will lead him to the diamond... The majority of the story is their journey across the war torn country...<br /><br />Leonard DiCaprio is both ruthless and charming as the cynical soldier of fortune who knows an opportunity when it presents itself... But he also is aggressive and selfish willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants... He illustrates the black side of the dirty diamond trade... On his trek to find the stone, Archer's eyes are opened to some enduring values that surpass his own self-profit...<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou eventually realizes that Danny's connections and money are his only hope... He plays a helpless character totally passionate as the resolving and fiercely determined father desperate to learn the fate of his family...<br /><br />Connelly is an idealist who wishes to display corruption... She thinks that with Archer's help she can get a unique story line surrounding the civil war but also revealing corporate malfeasance and cover-up behind the diamond trade...<br /><br />It is also good to mention Arnold Vosloo in the role of Colonel Coetzee, head of the army unit also trying to claim the diamond... He's a great character actor and remains a powerful presence and one of the screen's most efficient scene-stealer...<br /><br />Nominated for five Oscars, "Blood Diamond" is an action, political adventure at its best!</p></body></html>

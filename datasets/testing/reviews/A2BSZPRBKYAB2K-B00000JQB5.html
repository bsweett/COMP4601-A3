The plot is almost the same as the classic Mummy story.  Ancient Egyptian Priest has forbidden love, Priest gets caught, priest gets tongue cut off and cursed for eternity, Priest comes back to life as a Mummy 3000 years later, havoc ensues.  What makes this movie different are the outstanding special effects, good acting, and great action.  Brendon Fraser is the hero, Rachel Weisz is the love interest and Arnold Vosloo is "IMHOTEP" the Mummy!!  This is a great action movie that is worth watching on a rainy day when you can't go outside.  The Mummy returns is an excellent sequel as well.  Great fun that is recommended!</p></body></html>

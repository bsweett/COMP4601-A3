<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Video Quality, but not Excellent"></head><body><p>Please describe (accurately) the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.  No thanks to those who say a Blu-Ray has excellent audio/video quality, when it doesn't.<br /><br />After reading all of the reviews (for this UK version and the USA version) saying the video quality is excellent, I am disappointed.  I thought the first movie had very good video quality.  In fact, I thought it looked great.  After putting in the second movie, I immediately saw that the image was not nearly as good as the first.  There was grain, and I didn't remember seeing grain in the first movie.  I thought the 3rd, 4th, and 5th movies looked better than the second, but not as good as the first.  I rate the movies between 8.0 (the second movie) and 9.0 (the first movie) on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />All five of the movies have an aspect ration of about 2.35:1, and have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio.  There is not much surround sound in these movies, nor much sub-woofer bass, if any.  Most of the sound comes from the front center speaker.  I did notice more surround sound in the 4th and 5th movies.<br /><br />The first movie lasted about 2 hours.  The other movies all lasted about an hour and a half.<br /><br />Although disappointed in the audio and video quality, I still say this is a good Blu-Ray purchase.  I am glad not to have the huge box that the USA set comes in.</p></body></html>

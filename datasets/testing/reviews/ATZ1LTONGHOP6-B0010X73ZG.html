After a massive storm, a dense mist descends upon a small town in Maine, bringing with it a swarm of giant, blood-thirsty insects. When the monsters arrive, artist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane), finds himself and his young son trapped in the local supermarket with a large group of townspeople and it doesn't take long for him to realize that these people must band together if they hope to ever leave the store alive.<br /><br />Although this is a monster movie, in the traditional, tentacles and fangs, sense. The giant insects get very little screen time. In a two hour movie, I only counted about six appearances of the insects and these are all relatively short, albeit, very gory (you may prefer to watch a different movie, if you happen to have a weak stomach). Instead, writer/director Frank Darabont (who also directed screen adaptations of two other Stephen King stories, "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile"), focuses on the monsters inside the store, that is, the humans, in particular Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a fundamentalist Christian who is even more dangerous than the monsters outside.<br /><br />This is really a film about how humans behave in extreme situations. I read somewhere that one of Stephen King's favourite novels is "Lord of the Flies", and in a way, "The Mist" can be seen as being a variant on "Lord of the Flies", with adults rather than children. As with "Lord of the Flies", the message of this film is that if you take people out of their familiar surroundings and scare them enough, they will become savages - not exactly a message to restore your faith in humanity.<br /><br />This is a very well made film, with acting that is, in general, excellent (give or take a couple of the supporting actors). It's not as good as "The Shawshank Redemption", but few films are. I didn't particularly like the ending, but it is consistent with the general message of the film and I can accept Darabont's decision to end the film this way. Be warned however, that this is not a fun film. If you want a fun film about people being trapped in a shop by monsters, see the "Dawn of the Dead" remake. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a thoughtful, adult horror movie, then this is the way to go.</p></body></html>

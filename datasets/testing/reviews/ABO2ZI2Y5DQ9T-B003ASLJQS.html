<meta name="summary" content="Superb Acting, But You May Not Like Its Brooding Mood"></head><body><p>I know "Mystic River" is a great film.  It has unanimously great acting from the cast, and its gloomy mood is morbidly appealing.  but you may not like it.  And I didn't like it either for all its greatness, I confess.<p>Still it's a four-star film, deserving one win of Oscar of maybe two.  The story is about three ordinary kids in Boston, Jimmy, Dave and Sean.  When they are 11 year-old boys, playing baseball and having fun curving their names on the street, a guy with a badge scolds them, ordering only Dave to come with him.  In the backseat of the car, Dave (and we) realizes that a traumatic event is waiting for him.<p>After 25 years later, Dave and Jimmy are living in the same neighborhood.  But one daughter of Jimmy is brutally murdered, and Sean, now a police detective, comes back to his old places to meet them again.  As Sean investigates the case, Jimmy is also desperately after the murderer, and Dave's wife (Marcia Gay Harden) thinks something is wrong with her husband.  <p>But what really happened, and is going to happen at the end?  The story (based on Dennis Lahane book, adapted by Brian Helgeland) is nothing that can be called original, and to some, it simply looks impossible.  Things turn up at the exact moment when the film wants them to happen, and the conclusion is too neatly done.  And if you love to watch mystery films, it's not hard to guess the truth.<p>The strength of the film is its actors.  Tim Robbins is impeccable as a man whose tragic past haunts and torments him forever, and Sean Penn gives another great acting as a man in agony whose own personality is his worst enemy.  If Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne seem a little less impressive that is because they are now outsiders of this tightly secluded  community in which the two lost souls represented by Penn and Robbins keep wandering.<p>More surprisingly, director Clint Eastwood managed to bring life to female characters, especially to Dave's wife who has to witness his husband's pains so close.  Marcia Gay Harden, after her perfect turn in "Pollock," is wonderful to see though this "wonderful" means inevitably "painful."  <p>Do not watch it as a thriller; it's more about the characters.  And they must all somehow or another face their destinty.  But this somber tone of Greek tragedies is exactly the virtue of "Mystic River."</p></body></html>

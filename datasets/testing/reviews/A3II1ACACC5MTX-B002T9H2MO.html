Its finally stopped asking me if Im over 13!!<br /><br />Watched this the other night, unsure of what to expect. Its a sort of futuristic retrospective, redolent of all the films others have mentioned, and also of Space 1999, and other Anderson-esque type offerings. Spacey is dull and emotionless at the best of times, making his work here as Gerty excellent casting! Rockwell is excellent as he has little to go on here, carrying the film by the strenght of his perfomance. The premise is realistic, although one couldnt imagine any corporation no matter how stingy, only manning the operation with one bloke, of course WE know why this is the case, but even so.... also the reaction of the characters to each other (trying not to give spoilers) is unusual, in the same situation, I would have spent the next 3 years WTF-ing and not so quickly fall into the rapid acceptance of their situation the characters do.<br /><br />Plotwise, (SPOILER ALERT), my other main niggle would be the lack of explantion of the ilness suffered by Sam 1. It shows all the hallmarks of radiation sickness which would be a believable by-product of his activities on the moon, as exposure to solar radiation or even mining by-products could explain this. The Director alludes to a Bladerunner type limited lifespan,but this is a much more Deus-et-machina explantion than the former, in my view.. anyway..<br /><br />Ok, you can open your eyes now, yes, excellent low budget, well put together work, feels almost like you could present it as a stage play, good score, holds the attention even though there is a lack of aliens, explosions, chase scenes etc. Go ahead and try it. Watch is with Silent Running or Dark Star and compare and contrast!!<br /><br />K</p></body></html>

The moral of the story that you have to have good friends to make life worth living is one that kids everywhere can relate to.  Owen Wilson's voice is so good as Lightning McQueen that you actually feel like it's a living character.  As big a fan as I am of Bonnie Hunt, I actually didn't realize it was her voice as Sally the Porche until afterwards.  Paul Newman does an excellent job as the former Piston Cup winner Doc Hudson who has now retired to the small town after surviving a major accident and being unable to get sponsorship to get back in the races.  I enjoyed this movie far more than I'd anticipated I would.  It's a heart-warming tale.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

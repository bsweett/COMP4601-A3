<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Story. Very Slow Paced. Interesting Sets."></head><body><p>Last night's DVD movie was "The New World," the story of John Smith and Pocahontas and the settlements in the New World. I discovered the DVD on our DVD shelves. Evidently my wife must have purchased it and put it there for future viewing. It figures. It's the type of story she'd enjoy.<br /><br />Well, to me the movie seemed ultra-long and really dragged out. Maybe I'm just more used to action movies but this one really had a glacial pace. Some of the sets were rather good and it gave the feeling of a wild frontier in a strange new land. The photography was quite good. The acting was of the slow moving school where little is happening. The savages were, well, savages. I really can't remember seeing such a dreary depiction of American Natives. The fight scenes looked like really primitive brawls, which they might well have been. The storied love match between Smith and Pocahontas seemed to lack any kind of zest. All in all, the movie just ground along at it's ultra-slow pace and I grew somewhat weary of watching it. Maybe I was just not in the right mood. Maybe it was just not all that good of a movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

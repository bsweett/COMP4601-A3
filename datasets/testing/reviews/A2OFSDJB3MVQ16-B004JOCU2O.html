<meta name="summary" content="The besy action film of 2010 is unstoppable in Hi-Def"></head><body><p>With the fifth pairing of actor Denzil Washington and director Tony Scott, this film is a blockbuster in terms of quality and action.  What's more the pairing of Washington and newcomer Chris Pine, fresh from his "Star Trek" stint as the young Captain Kirk, provides some sparks in this already suspense film inspired by a true incident.  The supporting cast is fine also with Rosario Dawson fine as the train company's superintendant, and Kevin Dunn as the CEO eager to save face at the expense of equipment and lives. I saw this film in a good theater with DTS sound and the same holds true for the Blu-ray edition of the best action film of 2010!  If you want a demo disc to show off your home theater system, you can't go wrong with this film or the latest "Star Trek" reboot by J.J. Abrams.</p></body></html>

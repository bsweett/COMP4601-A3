I'd say the screenplay & storyline are fairly original to this movie as well. So many movies out there today are remakes of older films or so similar to other films that have been made, which makes "The Illusionist" refreshing. It is also refreshing to watch a movie that isn't based on using excessive violence, foul language, sex/nudity, or the same old silly slapstick that has become the norm for so many movies today.<br /><br />The acting, costuming, and cinematography are also great in this movie too. "The Illusionist" is a well-rounded, must see movie!</p></body></html>

She has shown in the past two or three years that she has talent I NEVER noticed before.  Anyways, I just wanted to make mention of that while it was on my mind.  Spanglish was a film I had wanted to see but never had the urge to spend money to see, but since the library had it and it was a free rental I picked it up over the weekend.  I just want to say that although it may have not been marketed perfectly, you have to know walking into this film that it is by no means a 'comedy' in the sense that most 'comedies' are today.  It's more along the lines of 'The Family Stone' just not as good.  It's a drama with funny scenes.  The heart of this movie is not to make you laugh but to make you think.  The story revolves around Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a single Latina who is strugling to raise her pre-teen daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce) in LA.  She gets a job house cleaning for the Clasky family, but she never could have known what she was getting herself or her daughter into.  The Clasky's are not your typical family...their off, just a little.  John (Adam Sandler) is a top-notch chef and the 'sane' one in the family.  Deborah (Leoni) is the high strung, depressed and over whelmed mother who doesn't know how to deal with herself let alone her family.  Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman) is a drunk ex-jazz singer who serves as the reason and also the solution to most of Deborah's problems.  Bernice (Sarah Steele), the overweight daughter, is going through those normal teenage years and is starting to butt heads with her mother enough to loath her for it.  Oh yeah, and they have a son but he never speaks.  As Flor moves in with the Clasky's over the summer the families start to interact in ways neither of them expected and bonds are formed between each and evrey one of them, while walls are built around others.  Writer/director James L. Brooks for the most part gets this very right for he creates people that we care about while painting a picture that is very believable.  The actors, especially Leoni, really sink their teeth into their roles, and Paz is such a warm hearted delight she's such a joy to watch on the screen.  Sandler tackled a role I would have never expected him too and he surprised me by pulling it off.  As I said, this is a dramedy with a lot of heart, a lot of humor and a lot of sincerity.  I'd pick it up, if you haven't already.</p></body></html>

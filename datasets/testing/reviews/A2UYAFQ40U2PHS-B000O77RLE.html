<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood is a truly extraordinary filmmaker and artist...."></head><body><p>Letters from Iwo Jima is an extraordinary film.  Despite its depiction of war, it is a much quieter, serene, and moving film than its sister film,  Flags of Our Fathers.  It does touch on how soldiers are pawns in politicans' schemes like Flags, but this film concentrates almost exclusively on the Japanese soldiers themselves, most of whom died defending the island.  Ken Watanabe gives a towering performance as the commander of the island, a vastly intelligent, articulate, caring man, who nevertheless does what he feels is his duty to his country, knowing very well that he will most likely be killed.  Like Flags, we really get to know these soldiers like we were in the platoon ourselves, and aside from a few war speeches, Letters and Flags never feel like they are propaganda, gun-ho garbage that Hollywood and others have been known for putting out.  Clint's direction is breathtakingly assured.  When you take into account that Clint speaks no Japanese, and he directs a film almost exclusively in Japanese, it makes the film even more extraordinary to behold.  There has only been a few films in history that have managed to do this, a film where a foreign director immerses himself so much in the culture that if you didn't know it was a foreign director directing the film, you'd swear it was a native of the country (Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice are examples of this phenomenon).<br /><br />Perhaps the best example of Clint's direction is in the following scene. One of the Japanese soldiers arrives at the island, and the other soldiers believe him to be a spy sent by the officers.  He eventually tells them his story, and why he was sent to Iwo Jima.  He was enforcing curfew in a local town with one of his officers, and they pass by one of the houses where a dog is barking rather loudly.  The officer informs the soldier to take the dog inside the house, and shoot it.  The soldier takes the dog into the house, and the family is horrified.  The soldier shoots a bullet in the air, and tells the family to keep the dog quiet. The soldier then leaves the house, but the dog barks again. The officer becomes furious, and he goes into the house to shoot the dog. But you never see the dog being shot, you only hear the shot, and see the soldier's reaction (only the officer goes into the house).  This makes the scene so powerful and sad. The soldier was sent to Iwo Jima because he let the dog live, and the officer was furious that the soldier disobeyed him.  The way Clint films this scene is why it's so memorable.  A lesser director would have shown the dog getting shot, with hand held shots and hysterical screaming. He would have tried to justify his decision by saying "it's more realistic", which it is, but there is no art, poetry, or intelligence in that. It's lame shock value, which will always lessen the dramatic impact of a scene.<br /><br />The lessons of war are so vivid here and in Flags.  Almost none of the Japanese soldiers made it back from Iwo Jima, and the American ones who did got exploited by the media and the government.  When they were done with them, they were forgotten about.  Both films are very sad, but they are necessary viewing.  There are moments of pure poetry in both films.  Letters has more though.  There is a deep sadness to this film especially, and it's darkened cinematography really enhances it.  This is one of Eastwood's greatest films, and one of the best war films ever made...</p></body></html>

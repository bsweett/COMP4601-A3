Most of the rest of the cast: best role ever. (The notable exception: Gary Sinise, who didn't have enough screen time to  really get his teeth into the role.) The guy who played the warden, whose  name I completely forget, has made a career-- and a great one-- out of  playing total jerks. And he does it well. This may be his first role as the  good guy, and even though I kept expecting him to grab a tommy gun and mow  down the rest of the good guys, he's just plain jaw-droppingly good as a  man who's simply at the end of his rope. <p><p>But the guy who really needs  singled out here is Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan plays the huge, gentle,  mentally deficient John Coffey so perfectly that he'll go down in history  as one of those actors who plays his role so well that people walk away  from the experience wondering whether the actor himself suffers from the  same deficiencies as the character. The only role like that in the last  thirty years or so has been Larry Drake's wonderful character on L. A. Law;  before that, you have to go back to To Kill a Mockingbird. There probably  aren't many Hollywood roles around for seven-foot-tall four-hundred-pound  actors, but if there's any justice in this world, and half a brain,  collectively, in Hollywood, someone will start writing roles for this guy.  <p><p>Want some more superlatives? How about the makeup jobs on Michael  Jeter and Harry Dean Stanton, which are up to the standards set by the  makeup jobs on Murphy and Lawrence in _Life_? There's gonna be a steel cage  match for the make-up Oscar this year, and both The Green Mile and Life are  equally deserving. The special effects, what little were needed, are  chilling, brutal, and unglamorous; there's no glorification of death here.  The direction is fantastic; the camerawork is some of the best I've seen  all year. <p><p>My problems with the film are few, and the main one is  related to the book, so most people who haven't read it probably didn't  even notice. The subplot in the book regarding the Percy-like nurse's aide  who confronts Edgecombe towards the end of book five is completely missing  from the movie. Because of this, there are a few scenes at the beginning  that trail off into nowhere. Also, the closing monologue slips pretty far  into melodrama territory, and the film would have been just as good without  it. But these are small things in comparison to the monster that is this  film. Critics have been pretty uniform in panning it; ignore them  completely. This is one of the best, if not the best, of the year. It  deserves every accolade it receives, and probably more. Filmmaking in the  nineties has only rarely been this good. However, it HAS been this good  before, and those little niggling annoyances make me give it a **** 1/2.  Still one of the best movies of the decade. If you miss this one, you're  cheating yourself.</p></body></html>

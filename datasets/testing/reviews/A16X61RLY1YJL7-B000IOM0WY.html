<meta name="summary" content="The Italian Job - A very good heist/caper movie!"></head><body><p>&quot;The Italian Job&quot; is a good, fun and intelligent &quot;heist&quot; type movie predicated on the revenge factor.  I found this movie to be quite entertaining from the opening scene all the way to the closing scene which is a bit unusual for these types of movies.<p>Mark Wahlberg has certainly come into his own as a superstar and he quite well proves it with his performance in this movie.  The ever beautiful and alluring Charlize Theron stars and performs quite admirably in this movie.  The supporting cast of Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G and a brief but poignant performance by Donald Sutherland all of which deserve high praise for their collective performances which combined, all bring this movie to a new height.<p>Director, F. Gary Gray also deserves praise for bringing this great heist/caper movie to fruition and putting together such a wonderful cast.  The score for this film perfectly enhances the overall feel of the movie.<p>The Premise:<p>Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) has planned the perfect heist and carried it out perfectly with his crew as they go to Italy to steal millions of dollars worth of gold bricks.  The one thing he didn't plan for was being double crossed by a member of his crew, Steve (Edward Norton).  As part of his plan in double crossing Charlie and the rest of the crew, Steve kills Charlie's mentor and Stella's (Charlize Theron) father, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), but fails to kill Charlie and the rest of the crew as he thought he did.<p>What follows from there is a very intelligently written and played out heist/caper movie as Charlie finds Steve once again and enlists the aid of Stella in regaining the gold that they'd stolen.<p>I highly recommend this movie as it is one of the better and most enjoyable movies of its type.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Pedal to the Metal:  The Making of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-Putting the Words on the Page for &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-&quot;The Italian Job&quot; - Driving School<br />-The Mighty Minis of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-High Octane:  Stunts From &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-6 Deleted Scenes<br />-Theatrical Trailer</p></body></html>

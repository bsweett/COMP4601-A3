<meta name="summary" content="Saw an advance copy DVD of this enjoyable sci-fi romp"></head><body><p>Perhaps one of the most high-profile, if not the most successful movie of 2004, was the sci-fi thriller `Alien vs. Predator'. The film, starring Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen, sought to double the thrills and suspenseful horror of both the Alien and Predator series of movies by bringing the two together in a monumental battle. With the majority of the action occurring inside a pyramid discovered underneath the Antarctic ice, this movie is essentially a prequel (as discussed in one of the commentaries) to the 1986 movie `Aliens' (which was itself a sequel to 1979's `Alien.' In fact, director Paul Anderson admits during his audio commentary that the James Cameron sci-fi thriller is his "default" movie that he is inclined to watch again (and again) whenever he is bored.<br /><br />Taking place in the present day (well Oct. 2004), Henriksen plays multi-billionaire Charles Weyland (and founder of the company which rules pretty much everything in the earlier futuristic movies) whose satellites have spotted what appears to be either an Aztec or Cambodian (opinions are split) pyramid below the Antarctic. Weyland assembles a team to investigate and upon arrival at the site, the group finds itself caught in the middle of a centuries-old battle between the Predators (from the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie) and their age-old quarry Aliens.<br /><br />Adapted from stories published by Dark Horse Comics, Anderson is able to stay true to the original movies while still setting his story in the present day. In fact, the actual reason and history behind the struggle between the two alien species surprised this reviewer. Henriksen, of course, has the standout performance in this picture, but Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver (star of the `Alien' franchise). This movie really shines in the special effects - which surprisingly rely more on traditional methods (as explored in a second audio commentary by the effects team) than the present-day reliance on computer generated imagery (CGI).<br /><br />In addition to the two commentaries, (the lighter Anderson, Lathan and Henriksen one and the second more technical special effects one) we also have a surprisingly involving half-hour documentary on the production of the feature. Separated into chapters, the featurette covers such areas as the development of the story (apparently numerous writers took a stab at the concept, but Anderson "hit it out of the park" on his first try), casting and special effects work (mostly miniatures and animatronics).<br /><br />The DVD also includes an extended edition of the feature that includes, among other things, an entire prologue set on the whaling station that is found abandoned in the theatrical cut. Presented separately from this are three "deleted scenes" which are actually more accurately extended scenes. There are also some rather lame Fox promos, including one for a `King of the Hill'-type cartoon named "American Dad" and the new Jennifer Garner movie `Elektra" as well as some examples of the artwork from the Dark Horse AVP comics.<br /><br />Generally of interest to the sci-fi crowd, if you enjoyed either of the two franchises on which this takes its inspiration then this should prove an enjoyable ride.</p></body></html>

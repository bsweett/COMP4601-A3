<meta name="summary" content="THE PRODIGAL WOLFSON?"></head><body><p>Lawrence Talbot (Benecio Del Toro) returns to his family estate to investigate the brutal murder of his brother. Emily Blunt is the widow and Anthony Hopkins is the estranged father.  Eventually, Del Toro and Hopkins virtually tear up the screen in this often beautifully rendered, action-packed thriller.  Not taken from literature, but rather folk tales and of course the classic Universal film of the same name, The Wolfman still lacks a literary pedigree and heft, but this incarnation is just fine - especially the extended version "not seen in theaters."  Too bad the metaphor of the Prodigal Son, hinted at in dialogue during an early scene, is not played out in all it's inverted and demented potential of a father seeking redemption through his son.  Wonderfully moody and atmospheric.</p></body></html>

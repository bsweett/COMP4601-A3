<meta name="summary" content="THE VIEW"></head><body><p>I'll make this short and sweet, This is a very good movie but it should of been beter.The acting was OK of corse the story was great  and the fight seens were ok.THE PROBLEM, The problem with Resident Evil Apocalypse is that the camera views are awful.When you watch a fight seen you want to see the fight at a good angle and on many different angles.The views were so bad it's almost hard to describe them  but think about seeing a fight seen and the whole time the camera's focused on the person's chest the entire fight there's kicking and punching but you can't see much of the kicking or punching.SO GO See the movie if you love the game series or want to know the second part of the story, the movie wont let you down completely but those camera views are gonna start to get to you while watching.</p></body></html>

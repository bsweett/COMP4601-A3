<meta name="summary" content="A Triumphant Return"></head><body><p>The name Rambo is synonymous with violence, so with Rambo 4, John Rambo or whatever you want to call it, they were determined to make this the most violent Rambo to date. Taking the setting to Burma to give the mainstream audience a view on how violent parts of Burma are, Rambo is revived in a triumphant massacre. This time, he's not alone.<br /><br />After being approached by a group of Christian Aid Workers, Rambo takes them up the river and into Burma. He starts to fall for one of the aid workers by the name of Sarah (Julie Benz) but they are both two very different people. Whilst on their aid trip in a small village, the village is attacked by the armed militia and the aid workers are kidnapped along with Sarah. Rambo, having left the workers behind, is approached 10 days later to help track down the workers. This time he has help from a group of mercenaries which will help him save Sarah, and take down the evil regime.<br /><br />This is a really good movie that, when involving the violence is no holds barred graphic wise. I can't help but think we've been lied to somehow as Sly has said in numerous interviews that he didn't use any CGI for this movie. This appears to be untrue as there's one part of the movie that we see a considerably large explosion that seems very much computer generated. Sly seems to be wanting to bring back the old glory days of the first rocky movies and the first Rambo's. With the success of Rocky Balboa and now with the success of Rambo 4, it's clear that Sly still has what it takes to give us a really good film. The only really bad point is the length at just over an hour and 10 minutes. Buy it, you wont be disappointed.</p></body></html>

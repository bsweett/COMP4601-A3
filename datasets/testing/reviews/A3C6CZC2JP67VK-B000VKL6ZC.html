<meta name="summary" content="3.5--Yes, I'm a fan of the original yet this has also gotten my attention"></head><body><p>The opening of the film is clever and deals with the events leading up to Michael's first murder. I was very happy with the back story of Michael Myers & how brutal his life was & you could almost see day by day how he was driven to kill almost his entire family.<br /><br />Minor details that were simply Rob Zombie's way of putting his mark on the film include a white trash family that Michael allegedly comes from (even though in the original his mother and father seem to be pretty straight-laced, almost nerdy, people) and the fact that his mother is a stripper. Dr. Loomis is introduced early on, in the film, at Michael's school after some questionable things he done. I just feel that there was enough of a set up in the original John Carpenter film for Zombie to build off of, without going and adding the trashy nature of Michael's family and sympathy we are supposed to feel for him. On top of that it was great to see inside Smith Grove as well - Dr Loomis was far better in this version - although the original is a classic this version had a lot more depth & rather intense ending.<br /><br />Now, even though the film begins in 1963 and then flashes forward 15 years to the night Michael escapes and returns to Haddonfield. Why, then, do the characters have cell phones and are there 1993 Ford Mustangs along the streets of Haddonfield? To me, this just makes the film seem sloppy and badly imagined. If you are going to take the time to "re-imagine" a film that is as iconic and famous as Halloween, these should be obvious things to deal with.<br /><br />The "chase" scenes are well staged and Zombie throws in some decent scenarios not found in the original. The climax is an entertaining combination of classic 80's style horror where you are screaming at the female lead for being so dense and modern horror grisliness where you feel sick to your stomach after enduring it.<br /><br />This film did go well with me and my biggest complaint, however, is with the sloppiness of the time difference in events. Aside from that Zombie's "Halloween" is a calculated gamble to add to these sequels, and it does pay off in the end, "Halloween" is perfectly watchable for any horror buffs so if you haven't seen it yet take the time to see it this month.</p></body></html>

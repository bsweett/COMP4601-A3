It's a very nice mix in this incredibly strange sci-fi film. The story is basically about a woman named Alice who is basically a renegade vampire chick(Think Underworld, but wierder) who is a member of a resistance of vampires trying to prevent the humans from wiping them out, then it turns out the humans have a weapon; which is a child; which has a substance within him that can wipe out the Hemophages(a.k.a. the vampires) or destroy them. So basically the whole story goes from that. This film has gorgeous computer-generated effects, gorgeous action thrills, an awesome protagonist, and a cool storyline. The only issues I have with this movie is the fact it's more computer-generated than realistic and that people will have a hard time appreciating what an awesome one-of-a kind sci-fi movie this is or liking how strange it is. But I know that this movie will be liked be people who actually like good movies and not that stupid comedy or High School Musical crap.</p></body></html>

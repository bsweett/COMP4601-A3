<meta name="summary" content="Hellboy  is an A+  adaption"></head><body><p>While I didn't follow the comic I did like two things about this movie. Ron Perlman's lead as Hellboy and creator Mike Mignola's creation being done faithfully. He didn't sell this character to Marvel and DC and still got the movie made.  I hope there is a sequel.  Unlike Spawn, which didn't have the personality of Ron Perlman's character, didn't have any successful comebacks.  Without getting too deep into the story I have to say it was a good film I would see again.  The action was in abundance in this one so you never got bored.<br /><br />This was the same Ron Pealman who was in Beauty and the Beast. Now why didn't someone make a movie about that series?</p></body></html>

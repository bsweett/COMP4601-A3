<meta name="summary" content="A sort of universal teen movie"></head><body><p>Dress changes, music changes, but the struggle of teens to find a place in the world continues.<br />The Janitor in this movie has more wisdom than the vice principle?<br />The kids don't get worse, the teachers get older and less adapted to the future that is happening around them?<br />Here the pairing off of the males and females is kind of strange:<br />the popular girl with the Jock to start that changes to the<br />jock and Kook and the princess and the criminal.<br />My old criticism of the movie is that they left the Brain as solo.<br />I enjoyed this movie which may actually become a classic as it holds up 20 years later.</p></body></html>

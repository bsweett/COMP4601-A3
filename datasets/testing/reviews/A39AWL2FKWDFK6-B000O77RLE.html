Using bleached almost colorized black and white cinematography which enhanced the representation of the bleak terrain,  Eastwood mixes dialogue with excerpts from letters unearthed from Japanese soldiers years later to tell the tale.<br /><br />Watanabe arrives on the island ordered to defend it as a strategic and essential buffer to homeland security, at all costs.  The organized and compassionate general quickly alters the slipshod preparation already made for the upcoming invasion gaining the respect of his men.  Digging a series of honeycombed caves in the volcanic rock, the soldiers hole up and await their fate.  Watanabe soon however learns of a series of devastating military defeats which dooms the ability to reinforce Iwo Jima.  He conveys the suicide nature of their defense to the defenders and what plays out is a touching depiction of how the men deal with their tragic situation.<br /><br />Amid a dizzying display of brutal combat and intense psychological turmoil, we gain empathy for the Japanese ordered to fight to the death.  With the revelation through their letters that their thoughts and feelings are identical to their American enemies, Eastwood gives us a previously unconsidered respect for the condemned Japanese troops.</p></body></html>

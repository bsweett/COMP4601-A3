<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining but more than a bit disappointing"></head><body><p>Elizabeth and Will's wedding day is interrupted by an arrest warrant, and Will goes off on a desperate hunt for Captain Jack. This sequel starts off with a bang and gives back all our favorite characters, but goes downhill from there. There are too many subplots and too many loose ends that are never tied up. The movie gives us plenty of dazzling swordfights - but they're dragged out for too long, and improbability is only entertaining for awhile before it becomes simply absurd. The viewer begins to wonder if the movie will ever end, and then is disappointed with a cliffhanger that leaves nothing settled.<br /><br />I was also turned off by the violence. Davy Jones and his monster crew crossed over from simply grotesque to stomach-turning, and the violence (floggings, prisoners being murdered) crossed the line for a swashbuckling adventure flick.<br /><br />Let's hope the next movie gets it right. Only three stars.</p></body></html>

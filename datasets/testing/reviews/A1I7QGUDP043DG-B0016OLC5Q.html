<meta name="summary" content="Incredible story."></head><body><p>Having lost a young adventurous cousin (Donald Charles Williams) in the mountains of Arizona while he was on a camping trip (he was murdered, and to date, his killer has not been found), this movie had special meaning to me.  The young often go on 'seeking' quests, full of the normal human debates going on inside them, often urging them 'into the wild'. I believe that if Chris McCandless had lived through his Alaska adventure he would have come back with new wisdom that helped him grasp the fact that his parents were imperfect humans doing the same juggling act with struggles we all encounter in life in one form or another. I also believe he forgave them for their imperfections. It's heartbreaking to watch this movie, but I was so touched by it that I thank the family for allowing it to be told. It must have been very painful for them. Penn did an excellent job of adapting Krakauer's book by the same name.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br />Author of 'Souls of the North Wind'</p></body></html>

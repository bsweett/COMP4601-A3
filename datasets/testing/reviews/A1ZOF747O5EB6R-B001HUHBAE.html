<meta name="summary" content="A Clever and Unusual Whodunit"></head><body><p>"Zodiac" is a wonderful whodunit genre film set in San Francisco and its environs in the 1970s and 1980s.  It is based on the true story of a presumed serial killer who identified himself as "Zodiac".  He was successful in terrorising the broader community.<br /><br />Unlike most Hollywood crime films, "Zodiac" has no crisp ending where the bad guy is killed or captured and all the loose ends are tidied up.  Rather, the film concludes with the killer still at large notwithstanding many suspicions.  Of course, many murder investigations end this way but rarely so in Hollywood.<br /><br />The film is well scripted with many outstanding performances.  Robert Downey Junior as the drunken newspaper crime writer, Brian Cox as the media savvy lawyer Melvin Belli, Jake Gyllenhaal as the awkward cartoonist turned crime writer and Mark Ruffalo as the hardened cop immediately come to mind.  It's a great ensemble cast.<br /><br />If I was to have any criticism of the film, it is that it's a bit too long.  Sure, the plot is complex and details need to be explained but a film in excess of 2 ? hours is testing an audience's patience.  However, this criticism is not substantive in the greater scheme of things.  Do not let this comment distract the viewer.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can recommend it to all.  Its languid yet enthralling pace, its clever recreation of the time, its ambiguous conclusions and its very competent cast ensure that this is a film well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

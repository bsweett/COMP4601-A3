It has warm, self deprecating humor, drama, and beautiful, beautiful music.<br /><br />It's hard to beat the opening scene with Maria (Julie Andrews), the young woman in training to become a nun. spinning with youthful exuberance, on a stunningly gorgeous green hill in Austria.  Then, the beautiful words, "The hills are alive with the sound of music...."  For me, only Julie Andrews could capture the wit, the whimsy and the spirit of Maria.  Though, Mary Martin was wonderful in the staged production, Julie added her own touch of class, mischief and flamboyance to the role, along with that gorgeous, gorgeous soprano voice.<br /><br />This wonderful, delightful and poignant story of the young Maria, who has too much spirit to stay within the confines of the convent, is sent out into the world to be a governess for a widower and his seven children, remains timeless, irresistable and very entertaining.  Amazing to imagine that it is now forty years old!!! The young actors and actresses, cast as Baron Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, dance and act wonderfully.  Also, even though I have heard stories that Christopher Plummer refers to this musical as  THE SOUND OF MUCOUS, he managed to pull of his role as the gruff Baron, whose heart melts after coming to know the irresistable Maria, with class.  (Though, I swear , there are some scenes where I swear he is trying to keep from sneering, and doesn't always succeed!)<br /><br />This film is filled with some of the most well known tunes from musical theatre repertoire ("Edelweiss," "Do Re Mi," "Climb Every Mountain," and "My Favorite Things," among others).  Also, the cinematography is gorgeous.  You feel like you are in the Alps with Maria and the children, and can almost smell the dew in the grass.  Perfect for the family, and essential for every film buff.  Even if you aren't a fan of musicals, I think almost everyone can find something to love about this movie.</p></body></html>

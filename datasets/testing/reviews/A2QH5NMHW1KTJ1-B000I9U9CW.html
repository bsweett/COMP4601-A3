<meta name="summary" content="Great, but colin farrel?"></head><body><p>I have never been a big Colin Farrell fan. You know with the dating the slut thing. This movie looked good so I picked it up. I was very surprised by the films intense look. It is very heart pumping. You wont expect what happens next. Colin Farrell's perfomance though kind of killed it for me. Because he gets shot in the ear and he just goes you shot me. Then through out the rest of the movie they totally forget about it. That is why I only gave this film 3 stars. Also becuase theres no special features But this is still a great film, which needs good acting. Johny Depp or Mel Gibson either would have been better. This is a great film but only watch it for the pshycology.</p></body></html>

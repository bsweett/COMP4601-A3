Abused by a sadistic police officer (Jack Starrett), he becomes a fugitive, ultimately going on the offensive when Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) simply refuses to "let it go."<br /><br />The film starts out great but becomes a bit too routine toward the end, which features explosions galore.  Stallone's physical presence lends great authority to his role, and an impassioned monologue in the film's final moments ends the movie on a powerful note.  The gorgeous landscape of the Pacific Northwest provided an excellent setting for the action and was a major reason for my appreciation of this film.</p></body></html>

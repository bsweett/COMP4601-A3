<meta name="summary" content="clever but not as fun as it could be"></head><body><p>As its title suggests, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is a film noir spoof whose energy and style  compensate for its overall dearth of laughs.<br /><br />The highly complicated plot begins when Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.), a petty thief living in Manhattan, literally stumbles into a movie acting career while fleeing the police on a heist gone wrong.  Before he knows what's happened, he's standing by a pool in Hollywood surrounded by a slew of moviemaking hotshots and wannabe starlets including Val Kilmer as a gay private eye and Michelle Monaghan as an aspiring actress who also happens to be a childhood chum from Harry's days growing up in Indiana.  Then, as if he had suddenly fallen into one of those dime store crime novels, Harry finds himself plunged into a dark mystery involving not one but two unexplained murders.<br /><br />Writer/director Shane Blake has a great time lampooning not merely the conventions of film noir and Chandler-esque pulp fiction - the convoluted plotting, the self-conscious dialogue, the smart-alecky narration and the casual popgun violence - but Tinsel Town phoniness as well.  In both storyline and style, the film often blurs the fine line separating mundane "reality" from the contrivances and absurdities of movie fiction, most notably by having Harry frequently address the audience directly in his narration.<br /><br />There's no denying that "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"  is a high energy lark, filled with creativity and imagination and featuring sharp performances from Downey Jr., Kilmer, Monaghan and a whole host of excellent supporting players.  The problem with the film, though, is that for all its cleverness, it really just isn't as witty as it should be.  Although we can sense what it is we're supposed to be finding humorous, for some reason the laughs just never seem to come with any great regularity.  Too often the humor feels forced and strained so that at best the movie elicits a chuckle here or there instead of a series of full-throated guffaws.<br /><br />Still, this is a fast-paced, clever, if not particularly memorable film that captures the quintessence of L.A.-derived fiction.</p></body></html>

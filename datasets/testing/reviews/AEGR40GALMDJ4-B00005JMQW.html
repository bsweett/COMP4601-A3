<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of the year."></head><body><p>After seeing this movie, I left the theater feeling completely fulfilled.  Nothing about this movie was bad.  It may not be the best superhero movie, but it comes pretty close.  The movie shows more character development, and the visual effects are more stunning than the first.  It is definately the best sequel I have ever seen.  Awesome Awesome Awesome.  I highly reccomend it.</p></body></html>

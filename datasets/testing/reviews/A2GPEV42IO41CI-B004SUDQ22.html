<meta name="summary" content=""I didn't find it.  I wrote it.""></head><body><p>A mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins) has died after suffering from schizophrenia for years.  He was cared for by his daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow), who now fears that she may have inherited his insanity.  A young graduate student (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is studying the great man's notebooks,  discovers a ground-breaking mathematical "proof," but Catherine claims her father didn't write it; she did.<br /><br />With these great stars, I expected so much more, but I was very disappointed.  The movie is hampered by a bad script and direction that has every line sounding like a hysterical tirade.  There are no pauses, no un-snappy retorts; every speech is delivered as if the actors are on stage trying to project to the last row of the balcony without a microphone.  The movie is, in fact, based on a play that also starred Paltrow, and it retains the too-large gestures and shrieking that probably fit just right in a big theatre, but look stagy in close-ups.<br /><br />Both the father's mental illness and the math discovery are spoken of in vague terms but never really shown or explained, so the whole plot is left unresolved and unsatisfying.  Gyllenhaal's performance is the most sincere and believable, while Hopkins and Paltrow overact throughout.  Overall, a dry, pointless film.</p></body></html>

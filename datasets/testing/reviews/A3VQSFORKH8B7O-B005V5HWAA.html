Rather than focusing on the victims of the killer, the film focuses on the killer himself. This gives Kevin Costner, an underrated actor in Hollywood, a chance to play a character that is different from any he has played before, and does so surprisingly well. While the crimes he commits are truly horrible and unforgivable, Costner's performance allows us to empathize a little bit with the character. At the same time, there are scenes where he really creeps the audience out. While his performance isn't perfect, it is overall powerful and chilling.<br />The supporting cast for the film is also worthwhile. Dane Cook's Mr. Smith is great, while Demi Moore turns in a surprisingly good performance as Detective Atwood, who is hell-bent on bringing Brooks, who is known only as the "Thumbprint Killer" by the cops, to justice, while also struggling with personal problems, and another killer bent on destroying her. Marg Helgenberger and Danielle Panabaker are good as well. But the real treat among the supporting performances is William Hurt as Marshall, Brooks' alter ego. He is at once chilling, but frighteningly likable at the same time.<br />The script itself, which focuses on the power of addiction, is a bit of a let-down in some places. There are some slow passages that drain the tension at times, and there are some truly unbelievable moments as well. But the fantastic performances, coupled by some truly shocking and surprising moments, make up for these slower passages. Overall, "Mr. Brooks" is a fascinating look at one man's addiction to murder, and how he tries to hide it from his loved ones while fighting the urges. Even if you don't typically watch this kind of film, it is still worthwhile to check it out.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></body></html>

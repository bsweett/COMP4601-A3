<meta name="summary" content="A notable remake that can stand on it's own"></head><body><p>I loved the original 'Dawn of the Dead'. So much so that when I heard it was being remade, I shook my head and sighed "Well here we go again. Another dud for Generation Xers to sit through while the original reigns supreme."<br /><br />Well it's true and not so true. I like both movies. They both have very good parts. I still prefer the slow moving zombies of the original and older films, but the new Dawn of the Dead has a charm all it's own.<br /><br />The first ten minutes is amazing. As our heroine flees for her life as her husband is turned into a flesh eating maniac in their own bedroom. The little girl was just disturbing in her initial attack on him. As she races out of the bathroom and gets in the car, panic has already taken to the streets. Car accidents, zombies eating their victims on a bus, it's just a total nightmare.<br /><br />Then the plot foolows the original as our desperate heros barracde themselves in the mall. Here they find three security guards who at first are none too welcoming. After everyone gets along the usual fun begins. There's target practice in the parking lot ("Burt Reynolds! Get Burt Reynolds!")<br /><br />A truckload of human refugees arrive and we get more characters to interact with. Before they escape the mall though, The zombie birth and zombie baby is a great scene.<br /><br />In the basement of the mall we get a little McGyver and two trucks are made into Mad Max type vehicles. The plan is to get to a boat and sail off to somewhere.<br /><br />The ending during the title credits gives the film more of an ending than the original did. The original was just a cliffhanger, but we see here in the remake that their survivng the mall was for nought.<br /><br />All in a all a great zombie movie. I realize now that modern zombies move fast thanks to 28 Days, but I prefer the slow stupid zombies.</p></body></html>

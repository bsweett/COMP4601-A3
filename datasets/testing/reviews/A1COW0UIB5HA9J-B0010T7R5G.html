<meta name="summary" content="Dazzling Sci-fi fantasy extravaganza now in high def!"></head><body><p>Set in a gloomy always nighttime city where no sunshine shines during the day set somewhere in time and space, a race of malevolent beings called The Strangers who come from another dimension called "The Strangers" who have unique powers to make people go to sleep, take their memories including implant them into other people as they even feed off others memories to survive and even transform the city into any style of city from the decades. John Murdoc (Rufus Sewell) has woken up from the bathtub only to find himself losing his identity and his memories as he has a gift similar to the strangers only it might even be as powerful and has been accused of a murder he didn't commit. However with the help of a so-called wife (Jennifer Connelly) and a Doctor named Schriber (Keither Sutherland), he must try to find his identity and battle against these beings to bring light back into the world.<br /><br />Brilliant and criminally underrated Sci-fi horror fantasy film noir combination from director Alex Proyas (The Crow) puts all those genres in one amazing cocktail that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The film is smart and visually stunning at the same time with a clever original storyline, This movie has always been a dream project for Mr. Proyas. William Hurt with Richard O'Brien with sexy Melissa George co-stars in the labyrinth of a movie that keeps you thrilled, entertained and even brain-teased that predated The Matrix only i think this is superior. The Matrix is excellent but this one is even more brilliant as i enjoyed loving this movie since i saw it in theaters at age 15 turning 16 since i've always been a Sci-fi/fantasy/horror junkie all my life.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers incredible picture and sound quality that makes it perfect. This offers an even better director's cut version that improves on the original movie as well as the original theatrical cut, five commentaries, director's cut fact track, Text essays, featurettes, production gallery, Neil Gaiman review of Dark City and trailer. It's a must have Blu-Ray for Sci-fi, fantasy and film lovers everywhere.</p></body></html>

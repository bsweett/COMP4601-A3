<meta name="summary" content="Streep and Blunt walk away with the movie"></head><body><p>'Devil Wears Prada' ostensibly stars Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Streep upholds her end of the bargain.  Her riff on Anna Wintour (Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue) is an awesome sight to behold.  But Hathaway is outshone not only by Streep, but also by Emily Blunt.  In fact, Blunt - in conjunction with Streep - steals the movie.  She deserved that Golden Globe.  The line that absolutely killed me was:  "If you lose Paris for me, I will search every Blimpie's in the tri-state area till I find you."  Great line, perfect delivery.  Meanwhile, Hathaway is put in a bad place: she's forced to act in conjuction with Adrian Grenier, who's playing her boyfriend.  He's just totally 'blah' here, no other way to say it.</p></body></html>

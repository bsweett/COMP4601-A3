<meta name="summary" content="The toys are back in town"></head><body><p>The toys finally return after 1999's Toy Story 2 movie, but which is rare for 3 movies to have good reviews animated or not. It is rare for 3 films to be this strong, even without running out of gas at some point, how many can say that? There are a of returning toys, and then some new toys including Barbie getting her Ken. Or does she I am going to leave it up to you to find out. And seeing this being a Disney-PIXAR film, I was expecting this to get and win for best animated feature film, these films seem to be a lock for it. While I am lost to tell you what I liked best about this film, I can tell you do things that I didn't lkike the film, there are a couple. One I didn't like and that I was hoping that it wasn't going to, but did anyways the words idiot and moron are used in the film. But I realized that they used in the first 2 movies they had either one or both the words in the movies. The movie opens with the toys in a western opening scene with some of them good guys and others like Hamm on the bad guys. Then they have a montage of Andy growing up. Then we get to really the present of the movie where Andy ( voiced by John Morris) is now 17 years old, and now is getting set to leave home for college. And he stills lives with his mom and kid sister, Molly that we also get to see more grown up. The toys are now bound for his toy chest, or the ones that are left over, including Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark replacing the late Jim Varney), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), and the Potato Heads Mr. and Mrs. (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris). The toy soliders are still around, lead by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey)  decide their time is up, and time to leave, before they end up in garbage bags. All the rest of the toys are not in the film, but the film does mention 2 of the toys tat are gone, but never really explains what happened to them, other then they had gone missing. Or even gone on to better owners. So while the toys place a phone call on a phone to Andy, whose cell phone is in with the toys, just hoping to be played with again. But Andy has pretty much grown up, and he believes and warns his baby sister Molly (Beatrice Miller), about staying out of his room. Then his Mom (Laurie Metcalf) tells Andy that it is time to clean his room, which includes packing up for garbage, throwing trash out. And which includes his toys, that they either have to be packed away for college, or put in the attic or they will be thrown away. And he does it, he places all but Woody in Trash bags, meaning to take them up to the attic. Woody is packed in the box for college, but gets out, and Andy is about to put the bag of toys in the attic, when he leaves them on the floor, and the doors closes itself for the attic, to help Molly out, and his Mom finds the bag and assumes it is garbage. The big problem, the only toy that really saw what happened is Woody, and when he finds the rest of the toys, once they have been taken to the garbage. But they mange to sneak into her car, and along with Molly's old toys, they are donated to a daycare named Sunnyside. Where they are welcomed by Lots-O'Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty ) who turns out to be the movie, and we also meet Ken (Ned Beatty).  They are assigned to a room with the toddlers, which leads to playtime that they didn't expect or want. The rest of the movie I am going to leave up to you. One other problem I do have with the movie, there is not a whole lot of new music in this movie, there is only one new song that plays during the end credits, and I really don't think that it is memorable enough, or good enough for Best Original Song, which it got nominated for and one, the only other song that plays during the movie is You've got a Friend in Me once again sung by Randy Newman.</p></body></html>

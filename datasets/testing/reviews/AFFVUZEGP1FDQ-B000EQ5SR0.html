The portrayal and drawing of the characters were not only appealing but intriguing as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the animated Aeon FLux and I was very excited when I heard this movie was coming out. What a dissapointed. Although the stylistic approach may be there and the storyline is interesting someting just falls flat. The action sequences are good and Theron did a good job. But, none of the elements came together as they should have. Something was defiantely missing, such as a better and a little more ruthless Goodchild and a little colder Flux. There was also something missing from this dystopian future world. It was not that good of a movie. On the other hand, the animated Aeon Flux DVDs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8I9XQ">Aeon Flux - The Complete Animated Collection</a>) are excellent.</p></body></html>

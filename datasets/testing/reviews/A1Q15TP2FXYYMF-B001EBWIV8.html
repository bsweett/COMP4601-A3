The film is about NEO (Keanu Reeves) must complete the prophecy that Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) believes in to save the world. The effects, martial arts, action and stunt scenes in this film are amazing. Whenever he has to fight all the agent smiths is a pretty cool scene. Whenever the film starts off with trinity jumping off a bike in mid air and sending the bike into a security hut and then the security hut explodes the film has you completely hooked!<br /><br />The freeway scene in this film has you absolutely gob smacked! Whenever neo has to talk to the architect this part of the film is a real brain teaser. The explosions in this film are quality. I think that reloaded is as good as the first film. A lot of people would disagree with me because alot of people I know that have seen this either don't like it or just thinks its ok. Well I think its brilliant and I definitely recommend it.</p></body></html>

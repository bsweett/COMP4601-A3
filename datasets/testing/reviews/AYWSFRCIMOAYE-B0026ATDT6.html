<meta name="summary" content="The BEST MONSTER DRAMA released on DVD in 2007.  A movie filled with family love."></head><body><p>Let us be clear this is not a Hollywood-style action movie. So, if you're anticipating quick-paced action from the beginning till the end, you'll be disappointed. It does have a lot of action scenes, but they're not as fast and furious as American- made films. It's not a comedy either. It's more like a drama.<br /><br />This film emphasized  family relationship. It depicts the strong bond between family members. It's so powerful that everybody was willing to sacrifice himself/herself  to save the other. In the film, you can see the grandfather, the aunt and other people did everything they could, including risking their lives to save the young girl from the monster. You will also see the father asking other members to love his brother who was intellectually underdeveloped. He said something approximately like this "Love him for who he is. Do not make fun of him".<br /><br />If your family already had a member with terminal disease or disabilities of any kind, you'll feel related to this movie. It will reminds you how heart-wrenching it was to watch your loved one dying even though everybody had tried everything. Or it will make you recall how painful it was to struggle everyday to find a way to help your disabled relative to be "normal". This movie helped open up conversations between my family members, my friends and me. After watching it, we discussed how the characters treated each other and how we treated our love ones. It warmed up our hearts.<br /><br />If you think movies these days just contain explosions, and nonsense killing, then this movie is for you. It's certainly worth buying. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

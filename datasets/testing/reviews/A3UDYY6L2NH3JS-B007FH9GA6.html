<meta name="summary" content="Excellent and fascinating, though it is a remake"></head><body><p>The Swedish film was good and nothing has been changed in the drama nor the thriller. It is made more explicit on things Scandinavians practice a lot but do not show, sex and emotions. So the sex scenes are more developed though they remain within Parental Guidance and the emotions are of course essentially present at the end and of course again in the negative way, the disappointment is for Lizbeth, the poor girl who thought she could be loved by a real respectable man on a permanent basis.<br /><br />The film does not bring one iota more on the exploitation of the young people who are made dependent on the state and under guidance, control and even at times more from some kind of bureaucrat who takes advantage of the situation for his own perversions. Be sure if it were a woman the situation would be the same. The bureaucrat always thinks his authority gives him the privilege of exploiting those who are under his or her control.<br /><br />In the same way a family business has become an impossible quagmire because the members of such a family consider that their name gives them the privilege of exploiting the business to their own benefit, to exploit the workers with the same objective, and of course to cover up their worst impulses under the virginity of the power of money. It is true at the same time the Swedish family business that is used as a screen to hide criminal activities is redoubled with the case of another international business, this time not family at all, that is a blanket covering the recycling and laundering of all kinds of drug and criminal money. This extension is quite funny in a way since it will serve the vengeance of the raped and humiliated and exploited dependent girl who gets rich by just hacking a whole set of accounts in the Caiman Islands. No complaint possible since it is criminal money in a tax and financial haven.<br /><br />What's left is the denunciation of the deep hypocrisy of the Swedish society about its past. Sweden was one of the first countries in the western world to introduce eugenic laws against all kinds of people who were a burden to society, more than thirty of forty years before Hitler in Germany and quite in line with what the British author H.G. Wells advocated at the end of the 19th century that will also produce social Darwinism and behaviorism in the USA.<br /><br />Then in the past and still in the present the people who are classified in those categories, Swedish or foreign, are silent preys to the predators who are in the positions where they cannot be asked any question. The police will do its job but without the means they need, nor the will they need, to get to the rock bottom of the problem and the criminals will walk free and proud, respected and even loved in society.<br /><br />That film should make us think and think again and we should keep in mind that politicians are too often doing the same and a prostitution ring can operate in one of the most important hotels of a big city, across from its opera and nothing is done till finally some scandal comes up generally from outside the country or from a marginal complaint and political interests are finally giving the police the power they need to do their job. Everyone knows about it, and first of all the mayor or mayoress of the city but everyone pretends nothing is happening, including the press that is so blind at times.<br /><br />If you don't believe it is possible just go to Lille in France, New York in the USA and presently a city in Shanghai had the same problem with the mayor being demoted;, including from all his national and regional jobs and his wife is in custody under the charge of having killed a British journalist who was too nosy.<br /><br />What is the world coming to? Go see that film and you'll understand just 10% of what it really is.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

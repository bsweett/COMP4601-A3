Conran needs to get on with Lucasfilm, or Dreamworks SKG.  He has the same eye and more importantly, the same sense of artistry that Spielberg and Lucas have.  He understand that the camera is for framing, and not merely recording, and is almost virtual actor<br /><br />You really feel that you are in the retro-future of Art Deco, balancing Fritz Lang and Flash Gordon.<br /><br />There are only two weak points: the storyline and the casting (not the acting).<br /><br />On the DVD, you can see the 6-minute short that was used to pitch the film.  I think Conran spent so much time working on the visuals that he neglected to think out the whole story line.  That is why the first 10 minutes of the film seems luscious, and slowly gets thinner as the film progresses.<br /><br />Another problem was with the "McGuffins."  The movie begins with the German scientist with the Adam and Eve test tubes and the plans to the Mechanical Monsters, but these are ignored as the movie progresses. This is disconcerting, since the expectation is that the whole plot of the movie will hinge on these two objects.  As the film runs past the two McGuffins, we move from McGuffin to McGuffin-the bubble-gummed map, the information that leads to Monster Island, and so forth.  We are given a thread, but it just snaps in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />Admittedly, this film is an homage to serials and the 1930's films, which are disconnected and fragmented, but having a smooth McGuffin would have made the film easier to watch.  Follow Spielberg's and Lucas's lead in Episode IV and Raiders by holding the story together with one McGuffin.<br /><br />Secondly, the casting is . . .I'm not sure different is the right word.  Jude Law would not be my first or even last pick of the Sky Captain.  He delivers the lines accurately, is believable, and took a professional risk doing a film like this.  But having an effete, British pretty-boy play the Air Cowboy almost works, but it is not what you would expect with such a unique film.<br /><br />Gwyneth was a good pick. She looks like could be from the 1930s, and has the hair to suit the role. However, mid way through the film she falls out of character and acts like a 1990s woman.<br /><br />I thought the banter dialogue was superb and makes the film relatable. However, the 1930's had a unique form of slang that, except for Jolie, no one picks up on.  The slang-which can be read in the Doc Savage and Lensman stories adds color to the ear, and is as important as chronologically-sound costuming and props.<br /><br />By the way, Jolie with an eye patch was an unusual move.  It hearkens back to Nick Fury, but looks rather weird on a British Dominatrix. Wasn't this first done in "Twin Peaks?"<br /><br />The last complaint has to do with the robots.  In order to have the technology, you need money, and remember there is a Depression going on. Also, the hovering hunchback robots were a bit too much.  It crossed the line of believability.  After all, if Totenkopf has the technology to have antigrav in robots, he could have put it on the rockets.</p></body></html>

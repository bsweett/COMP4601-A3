<meta name="summary" content="5 stars for the film, none for this DVD release."></head><body><p>I am a big fan of the original versions of Star Wars and I already own the special editions on DVD. I will not take this release. This crappy release is nothing but an insult to all of us true star wars fans. George Lucas should get with the program and release the originals with 5.1 surround sound and anamorphic widescreen. Skip this and wait for Lucas to release these in better quality.</p></body></html>

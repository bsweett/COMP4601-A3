It's no exaggeration in the slightest bit to say that this series not only made archaeology fun, interesting and sexy for the masses but it more than likely also inspired hundreds of men and women across the globe to become archaeologists! That's the power of truly great cinema!<br /><br />Personally, I'm convinced Temple of Doom was the best in the series with Raiders falling incredibly close behind. I've probably watched TOD fifty times and it never seems to get old. Concerning The Last Crusade, well, I don't want to get too negative but I thought it was an irritating entry. Whichever entry you love or hate, this collection is perfect for fans! You get the special editions of each film plus extras! Fantastic!<br /><br />What can I say? These are freakin' awesome and this set is worth every penny! There's only one small problem, one small reason why I wouldn't recommend purchasing this, and that is the fourth film. The fourth film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, there's a great chance you'll be seeing ANOTHER Indiana Jones box set released with all the releases of this set plus the new film. I mean, why bother purchasing this for about $30 and get 3 films when you get wait another 8 months and purchase all 4 films for $50? If you can't wait, grab this anyhow.</p></body></html>

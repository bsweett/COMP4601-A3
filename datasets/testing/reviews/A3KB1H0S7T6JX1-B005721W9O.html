Things will become a bit more complicated when a group of genuine aliens arrives on earth and attempts to recruit the cast, believing that the show's episodes are actual historical records and that the characters are real heroes...<br /><br />Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.<br /><br />The only major setback is in relation to the "friendly" aliens being portrayed as morons.  Why?  What was the point of that?<br /><br />In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, the humor, and the music are all very good.<br /><br />Though not a masterpiece, Galaxy Quest is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

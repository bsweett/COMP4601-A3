<meta name="summary" content="Film better than I expected"></head><body><p>After the bad press & disappointing box office when the film was release I did have mixed feelings about the film.<br /><br />So, now that I have purchased the DVD & seen the film I am happy.<br /><br />Not the best film ever made, but I did enjoy it.<br /><br />2005 press made it sound like it was a film full of things blowing up.  These scenes did NOT even start until over an hour after the film began.<br /><br />True, some scenes & situations you could see coming a mile a way.  I knew Djmon's character would turn at the end.<br /><br />I was, however, TRULY DISAPPOINTED about how little Michael was used in the film.  2 scenes & his character on a bill board.  THAT WAS IT!!  Why did the credits NOT read "Special Appearance BY Michael Clarke Duncan"?<br /><br />Liked Ewan in the film.<br /><br />Over all an enjoyable action film.<br /><br />DVD package-I HATE, HATE, HATE, these packages with the little flip down openings.  THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!</p></body></html>

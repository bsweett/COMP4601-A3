<meta name="summary" content="What a bitter dissapointment!"></head><body><p>After hearing all of the anticipation and actually accepting the hype that surrounding the release of this movie to the theatres during the autumn of 2004, I could never get a chance to actually see it on the big screen and thus the movie passed me by for a long afterwards until I rented it on DVD. As painful as it is, I have to be honest with my opinion of "Sky Captain". This movie is completely disappointing in my book. I might not get a lot of support with my review but I stand my ground on this. This is certainly far from being the worst movie by any means so at least try not to view this review as smashing this movie to bits.<br /><br /> "Sky Captain" is lacking in good storyline and the entire movie meanders in so many directions that it ends up being confusing and hard to enjoy because of this ("Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions" suffers similarly but far less so). The the giant robots are outright ridiculous and almost made me laugh at the way they looked more like something that combined the cartoonish quality of "Inspector Gadget" (a great cartoon series) and some kind of Tomb Raiderish CGI figures. I could understand very much the idea focusing this during the end of the 1930s and early 1940s and such but a lot of the technology and many machines almost make it look like 2050 or 2105 (100 years after writing this review) yet somehow aircraft and other obsolete technology is transported through a time machine and dropped off in the far future. That's what this movie feels more like as opposed to a World War II era storyline.<br /><br /> The movie was indeed shot combing live action footage of the cast with all-CGI backgrounds and that is a very interesting new technique. I'm sorry but upon hearing how the special effects were `groundbreaking' I have to disagree with this. Some of the CGI effects are actually very good and are breathtaking in their visual appeal but for the most part, the special effects are actually quite blurry and make the movie difficult to watch. This is one of the things that killed this movie for me. I am all for CGI-effects even if they do get overblown but SKATWOT's special effects are just so overdone, so overproduced, to the point that it saps the quality out of it. The special effects in "Lord of The Rings" and even the Matrix trilogy (including the 1999 original) were far superior to the EFX in "Sky Caption". I did not see much of anything that looked revolutionary or groundbreaking in this movie. What could've been groundbreaking instead comes off as overdone and a grand waste of opportunity.<br /><br /> I'm not saying avoid this movie like the plague necessarily but do not expect anything out of the ordinary on this movie. A bitter and crushing disappointment to say the least, you're better off just passing this by.</p></body></html>

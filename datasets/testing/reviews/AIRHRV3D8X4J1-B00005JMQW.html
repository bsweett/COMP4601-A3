<meta name="summary" content="Spider-Man 2 Superbit Edition will wake up your home theater"></head><body><p>Spider-Man 2 sure lives up to the expectations set up by the first. This movie has some great action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very few sequels can live up to the original, but Spider-Man 2 sure does. I can't really say much more than what has all ready been said about this awesome film. I have to say this Superbit edition is truly breathtaking with the vibrant picture detail and amazing sound. The regular Spider-Man 2 edition is clear but the superbit edition is much clearer and much more detail is seen. Another great thing about the Superbit edition is the choice of sound options. You get the DTS soundtrack (dts only available on superbit edition) which brings the film to life far more than just the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. You have to be a true die hard fan to really appreciate this superbit edition. If you want to experience Spider-Man 2 with the best picture and sound get the superbit edition because it blows the regular edition away. The only downside to this superbit edition is you get no bonus features, but the clarity and sound more than make up for that.</p></body></html>

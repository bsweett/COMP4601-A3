<meta name="summary" content="not that great"></head><body><p>I honestly can't jump on the same bandwagon that many people do concerning Eagle Eye.<br /><br />The action scenes, while fun, were *extremely* exaggerated- the two main characters escaped danger so many times and yet, so many things continued to fall into place for them time and TIME again so they would never be seriously injured.<br /><br />I'm usually a big fan of action movies but I like a *little* bit of believability too.  This movie had absolutely NONE of that.<br /><br />The acting was good though, and it was a decent enough storyline, but not nearly as good as the many positive reviews I have seen make it out to be.</p></body></html>

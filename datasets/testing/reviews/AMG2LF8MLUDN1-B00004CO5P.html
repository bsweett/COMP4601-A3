It's already been said.  Morgan Freeman should receive awards just for breathing.  He's phenominal.  Just think, all that talent going to waste on that kids show, the electric company, many years ago.  His best scene is probably when he comes across Shaw for the second time.  The first time they meet is just after a battle where Shaw is wounded and laying on the ground, unconcious.  Freeman's character kicks Shaw to see if he's still alive (he was the grave digger).  The second time they lay eyes on each other, Shaw is reviewing the troops and Freeman's character is standing in the ranks.  Shaw is riding by on horseback.  The two men lock eyes and their heads slightly nod as they ackowledge each other.  Freeman's nod to Broderick is the coolest thing in the movie at least to me.  It lets us know that he is not easily scared or panicked.  It serves him well later on in the film.<br /><br />As for Matthew Broderick (Colonel Shaw), I believe that this is the best film he's ever done.  He gave a wonderful performance as the leader of an all black unit.  Broderick does a fine job of letting us see Shaw trying to find a way to communicate with his men and trying to figure out how to train men that will probably never get to fight like the white units do.  I believe due to the subject matter, all parties tried to give it the proper respect and honor to the real soldiers of the 54th.<br /><br />Frankly, I think all the performances were on target.  Even the costuming department went through great pains to get the uniforms exactly as they were back then.<br /><br />Denzel Wahington's finest scene is probably the whipping scene.  His character, private Tripp, leave the camp to find shoes so that he can fight.  Instead he finds himself charged as a deserter and is sentenced to be whipped in front of his unit.  His shirt is remove and reveals that he has already beat beaten many times with the scars from the whip to prove it.  In defiance, his stifles any screams that might escape from his throat while being beaten and instead, lets one tear roll down his cheek.  The timing of that one tear just as the music swells to the crescendo is pure genius.  Also noteworthy as this film unfolds are the relationships that develop between these three men.<br /><br />Unforunately, everyone in the 54th unit dies (in the movie anyway) and it always makes me sad that my favorite characters don't survive.  Shaw and Tripp who were at such odds in the beginnig of the movie are buried together in a mass grave at the end of the movie.  I had never heard the story of the 54th nor had I known that there was an all black unit anywhere.  I'm glad the movie brought the story to light.<br /><br />This movie is a must see!</p></body></html>

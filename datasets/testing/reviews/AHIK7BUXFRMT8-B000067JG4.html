<meta name="summary" content="A Timeless Treasure Beautifully Performed and Packaged"></head><body><p>This musical is a total joy to watch; I would not even try to count the number of times I've seen it but it always remains beautiful and lovely to watch and hear. This particular version is well planned and presented and seems to nicely capture the special nature of the 45th Anniversary of this fine work.<br /><br />It will need a special place on your shelf as it is not intended to simply fit in with all of your other discs; it is, however, worthy of the honor as it is beautifully executed and includes all of the special extras that come with the Blu-ray disc that make it truly a collectors choice.<br /><br />First of all, the quality of the Blu-ray disc itself is excellent; the video and the audio both are as close to perfect as I could imagine. There is absolutely nothing there that gets in between the viewer and the performance; Salzburg has never looked lovelier nor has Julie Andrews. In addition to the feature film there is a second Blu-ray disc devoted to additional special features. The fact that they are presented in Blu-ray is somewhat unusual as this kind of disc is often in a DVD format. There is a full version including special features in the DVD format on the third disc and a fourth disc which is a stereo CD of the soundtrack.<br /><br />There is a protective sleeve which shows the box to be part of a Limited Edition and gives the number assigned to your particular set. The inside box slips out of the sleeve and has a hinged top which opens upward to reveal a "Letter of Authenticity" from Twentieth Century Fox. On top is a large hardback book in full color called "A Few of our Favorite Things" which first tells the real story of the Von Trapp family in a section called "The Von Trapp Family: Separating Fact from Fiction." It has many photographs of the real family and tells the actual story of their lives and adventures. One quickly discovers that considerable "artistic license" was taken as the script was written for the movie.<br /><br />The second section of the book is called "The origins of The Sound of Music" and describes the steps that eventually led to the movie version. It is the longest part of the book and covers the original book written in 1949 by Maria von Trapp, "The Story of the Trapp Family Singers," it's progression to Broadway and its final progression to the screen. It is filled with interesting insights about the people and the process that made it all possible.<br /><br />Section 3 of the book is called "Salzburg: The City of Music" and along with some lovely pictures gives more information about the city, its history, and the locations where the movie was shot. The final short section of the book is called "The Legacy of The Sound of Music" and tells the story of the movie after its original release. All told, the book is a treasure and a worthy addition to the set; it will not be available for individual sale according to the inside back cover.<br /><br />Under the discs are two items, a reprint of the 1965 booklet which was available for sale at the 1965 rerelease of the movie, and a set of color photos of scenes from Salzburg. In addition there is a small hand painted music box which plays "My Favorite Things;" the box is curiously heavy and has a feel of quality.<br /><br />The bottom line on all of this is one has here a remarkable collector's item for any who appreciates this memorable musical; the excellent video and audio, the book, music box, photos and the booklet all combine to create a very special opportunity to enjoy again the wonders of this production.</p></body></html>

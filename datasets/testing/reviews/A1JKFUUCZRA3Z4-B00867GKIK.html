<meta name="summary" content="Very touching movie!"></head><body><p>The first 10 minutes of this movie and the last 5 minutes of this movie are the most touching, romantic, and tear jerking moments in this film.  There's also some great metaphors sprinkled throughout the movie, too, especially about learning to let go of the past in order to appreciate the present.  I especially liked the scene where all his furniture comes flying out of his house and I took note of how the furniture landed on the ground.<br /><br />It surprised me that a kid's movie would be so meaningful.  I'm sure the meaning will be lost on little kids, but they should still appreciate this movie given the imaginative aspect of it (a flying house, a talking dog) and will probably think the little boy and dog are funny.  And adults will be reaching for the tissue box.  So this is a movie I see both adults and kids liking.<br /><br />The reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars (that was a hard thing to do since I loved this movie so much) was because it was slow moving at parts and the whole villain with attack dogs didn't quite work for me for some reason.  But other than that, a wonderful movie.</p></body></html>

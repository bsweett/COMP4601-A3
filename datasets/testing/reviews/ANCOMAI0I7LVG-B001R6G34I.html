<meta name="summary" content="One `monster' of a classic..."></head><body><p>I guaranty you that when `King Kong' was released way back in 1933 that no one, and I mean NO ONE, even entertained the notion that it would turn into a classic to redefine classics.  Sure, they probably thought it would rake in the big money and that the special effects (which are quite unbelievable even today) would be the start of something wonderful, but to become a cinematic staple; I highly doubt that idea was even considered.  But, regardless of their initial thoughts, `King Kong' has become as legendary as the title character, and for good reason.<br /><br />Now, I will let you know this right off the bat; I have seen both this film and Peter Jackson's 2005 remake and I firmly believe that Jackson's film is superior.  Know that, because, while I am going to praise this '33 classic I am also going to try and point out the reasons why Jackson's is the better film.<br /><br />Please, devoted fans, don't click the `unhelpful' button just yet.<br /><br />Most everyone knows the premise of `King Kong', but here is a quick rundown.  Carl Denham is a movie director who wants to give the public something they've never seen, and so he gets a large crew to travel to a distant island no white man has ever seen (well, except the one that gave him the map) to film a moving picture with the mythical beast known as Kong.  When they arrive his leading starlet, Ann Darrow, is taken hostage by the natives and offered to Kong, who falls in love with her.<br /><br />What this '33 version does extremely well is take the standard `movie monster' formula and perfect it, with state of the art effects that are still mind blowing today.  Don't get me wrong, there is no way that these effects can technically hold a candle to those of today, but they are still impressive.  I couldn't believe that these came out of 1933, they are truly remarkable.  Most of the older films suffered from the lack of reality in their special effects, but nothing is taken away from this film at all.  The action sequences are all superb, and there are a lot of them; each one as exciting as the last and completely engrossing.  The acting is also quite good for a film of this nature.  One has to remember that you have to understand the genre before you can critique a film.  Monster movies are made much differently than dramas or comedies or epics and so you have to judge accordingly.  For a monster film, the acting is spot on.  Fay Wray is totally believable as the wide eyed damsel in distress and Robert Armstrong is fabulous as the greedy in-over-his-head director; and macho man Bruce Cabot makes good use of his character to create a hunky (and even realistic) hero.<br /><br />So, for a monster film this one is top, top notch.<br /><br />But, and here is that dreaded `but', this is just that; a monster film.  Now, I admit to having seen Jackson's film first (how did THAT happen?) and so I was expecting something else from this version, but regardless of what I was expecting or what I saw first I feel my opinion would still be the same.  What is so glorious about Jackson's reinterpretation is that he takes the genre and adds so much warmth and depth.  Devoted fans of the original have attacked the '05 film rabidly, but I feel that is unfair.<br /><br />IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENJOY BOTH FILMS PEOPLE!<br /><br />Yes, Jackson's film is three hours long but what he does with those three hours is phenomenal.  I don't understand the complaints about the beginning, for Jackson actually establishes these characters as real people and makes us like or dislike them depending on their depictions.  We get to know who they are, which helps us to follow their storylines later in the film; and his reinterpretations of Skull Island are impeccable (those graphics are TO DIE FOR), and the pacing is flawless, that final Empire State Building scene is flawless (and one of the best scenes in cinema this decade) and the fact that he actually gets a deep rooted emotional response from the audience based on the love blossoming from a woman and an oversized monkey is just remarkable.<br /><br />So, I don't want to review Jackson's film (I'll do that later) but I just wanted to point out that they are two separate films.  In the 30's you just didn't make relatable monster films.  The point for `King Kong' was not to reach out emotions but to excite and thrill us, and it did just that, but as Jackson (and many other modern filmmakers) has proven, today you don't have to make a conventional anything anymore.  It is possible to blur the lines between genres and offer us something that excites all of our senses, giving us something funny, scary, moving and all around engaging without slacking in your delivery.<br /><br />Yes, the original `King Kong' is a classic, and deservedly so; but Jackson's `Kong' is a much more complete `film' in every sense of the word.<br /><br />And `YAY ME' on review #1,000!!!</p></body></html>

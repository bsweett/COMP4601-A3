<meta name="summary" content="one of the best fantasy films since LOTR"></head><body><p>for some time, i have been looking for the next fantasy film that will move me and astonish me like the LOTR's trilogy did. sure, Narnia and HP are good films to but they still didn't hit that cord with me. then, that all changed with Pan's Labyrinth. in this film, we are transported into the mountains of Spain were young Ofelia and her pregnant mother are sent to live with the cold and mercelous Cpatain Vidal in the midst of WW2. it is here that Ofelia stumbles upon a wonderous Labyrinth presided over a strange faun. belived to be the long lost princess of the faun's Underworld, she is set with three tasks that she must complete before the full moon to take her place as queen. what follows is a mind bending and wonderous adventure into the mind. what Del Torro does is he takes us back to the original roots of fairy tales were things never always got there happily ever after and that fantasy can be used to buffer the harsh reality our heroine faces. first of, i have to say the effects are simply astounding and the acting at its finest with Sergi Lopez giving a chilling performance as the mercilous captian. now don't be fooled kiddies, this ain't some PG rated fantasy film, there are some pretty violent scenes in this film but luckily at least they aren't so in your face and frequent. it still baffels me how this film lost the Forigen Picture award but then again i ain't a member of the academy. so if you all are pretty tired of all the regular fantasy's out there and just want to enjoy a back to basics fairy tale then Pan's Labyrinth is the one for you. it will fry your imagination and leave you in its grasps long after it ends.</p></body></html>

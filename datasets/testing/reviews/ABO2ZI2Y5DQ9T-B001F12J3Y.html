<meta name="summary" content="Visually Stunning But Story Too Thin. Plus Bizarre T. Hanks"></head><body><p>As to its stunning visuals, we can see no disagreement among us.  'The Polar Express' has shown where the CGIs would be leading us in the future.  However, as to its story and, well, the virtual star Tom Hanks (who looks and moves in a very weird way), there is still room for improvement to be done.  All in all I liked the film simply because I love to see newer things on the big screen.  But if you are kind of audiences who would feel dizzy after watching the flood of CGIs, you may consider buying the original book (and that's beautiful) instead.<br /><br />The original book by Chris Van Allsburg contains only 29 pages, and for the film (that runs 100 mins), Robert Zemeckis stretched the story.  Maybe he did it too much, but anyway the film follows one boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, the kid of 'The Spy Kids') who lost his faith in Santa.  But one Christmas Eve, an old-fashioned train led by a steam locomotive stops right in front of his window.  It's The Polar Express, and The Conductor invites him to board the train to join in the travel to the North Pole.<br /><br />The rest of the story needs no summery; The Hero Boy meets new friends, sees the elves (including one cameo played by Steven Tyler), and, yes, the man in red clothes, with white beard.  The voice cast include Tom Hanks (playing five roles), Michael Jitter (playing two roles Smokey and Steamer), Norah Gaye as Hero Girl, and Peter Scolari as Lonely Boy.<br /><br />But the merit of the film is mostly the visuals (not those of humans, which, quite annoyingly, often look embalmed bodies in motion).  The snow-covered railroad track, the icy field on which the train slips as if skating, and the well-crafted designs of the town in the North Pole are all fantastic.  If only Tom Hanks appeared exactly as he is, without tampered by the 'performance capture' system (whatever it is).<br /><br />The sound effects are amazing, the songs are pretty good, but the fact remains that 'The Paolar Express' is based on a very thin book -- you know what I mean if you remember 'Jumanji' which was another film based on Chrs Van Allsburg's book.  Great images with very few things to say, that's my verdict.  And very bizarre Tom Hanks, more bizarre than him in 'The Ladykillers.'</p></body></html>

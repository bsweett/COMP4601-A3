<meta name="summary" content="GRIND HOUSE CLASSIC"></head><body><p>Another movie that was designed to be bad. This movie is patterned after the other Grindhouse type films with nudity, killing, guns, excessive blood, bad acting, bad dialouge, and a plot that doesn't make much sense. In this film Rodriguez thankfully parts way with the Drive-in intermission as well as the fake burning film, and film noise.<br /><br />Danny Trejo, who makes Steve Tyler look like a pretty boy is the main hero is this film. Jessica Alba plays an immigration agent. Steven Seagal, using various bad Mexican accents plays a drug lord. DeNiro is a state senator who, along with his aide is in cahoots with the drug lord as well as a vigilante group along the border. Michelle Rodriquez leads a group of poor Mexicans, all with cell phones.<br /><br />The plot is immaterial. In one scene the car starts on fire before it hits anything...then explodes. Lindsey Lohan goes topless and later dresses in a nun's outfit, packed with a gun. (Plot Spoiler?) She goes to shoot DeNiro, and says, "In the name of my father" BAM! BAM! then says "I forgot the rest." In the end, all alliances break down and everyone tries to kill everyone.<br /><br />Alba is also naked in the shower with her arms and legs strategically placed. She is best in the deleted scenes as her own twin sister which we never see in the movie. Every time Alba comes home she finds her in bed with some guy. Her twin calls her a "B" word and Alba responds by calling her a "slut."<br /><br />There is nothing believable in this movie, nor should we expect it. Oh yes, and the nurses wear very short smocks.<br /><br />There are no orientals in school girl outfits. I wonder how they missed that?</p></body></html>

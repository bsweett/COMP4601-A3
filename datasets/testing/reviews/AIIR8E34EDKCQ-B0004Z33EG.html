The story of a wandering Vietnam vet who walks into a small, quiet town in Washington in search of his last remaining friend never reaches a happy ending. Upon discovering that his last buddy has died of cancer, John Rambo heads into town trying to find a place to eat and collect his thoughts but instead he gets picked up by the sheriff and thrown into jail for vagrancy. When Rambo starts seeing flashbacks from his days as a prisoner of war  that mimic  the abuse caused by deputy Teasle and his buddies all hell breaks loose as he fights his way out of the prison, grabbing his 14 split sawteeth blade, the only trusty friend in his world and dashes out in the wilderness.<br /><br />From his dog tags the sheriff knows that Rambo is a war hero and a green beret, but still is unable to leave him alone. He drives after him and begins a hunt, one that will change his life in allsorts of ways. Attacked for no reason, Rambo tries to talk his way out but when they draw first blood he fights back the only way he knows how, and that only means one thing - lots of surprise attacks and lots of bodies that starts to vanish, as if sucked into the mountainous terrain by a mysterious force. The more Teasle pushes to find Rambo the worse their personal war gets and in the end the town in hanging by its last legs as John unleashes all the demons in his head unto the smug sheriff and his unfriendly town.<br /><br />This is such a great movie, I finally got to see it again after many years and it's still amazing. I was in the mood to make it a Rambo day yesterday and see the other three parts but life got in the way. But man, this is so enjoyable and satisfying, it reminds me of the sweet days I spend with my dad watching these movies as a kid and while he lives far away they make me feel close to him. The misty, smoky mountains turned into a trap that Rambo maneuvered skillfully with bare hands except for his trusty knife. I still have a memory of my father making a replica of the Rambo knife, without the compass, so seeing it in the movie made me chuckle, the shape burned into my memory. For those who have never seen it give it a try, it's good even all those years later and has truly stood the test of time.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It wasn't the animated movie of the year...?"></head><body><p>I guess their holding out until they award it with Animated Movie of the decade. In my humble opinion, this movie was shafted at the Oscars because it wasn't from Disney or Pixar and CORALINE, is a threat to the animated movie market that has been monopolized by Disney/Pixar for...ever. Yet, CORALINE stands by itself as the kind of movie that will change the landscape of animation in the years to come. It doesn't need the publicity to pull this off. It does it with its quality and its magic.<br /><br />Quiet simply, CORALINE is amazing. It may be slightly strange, and it may be slightly dark, but so was MONSTER HOUSE. It is a ghost/witch story for children. It may be slightly scary, but that is part of the fun of it.<br /><br />I first watched it with a group of adult friends, in 3D (FOCUS was nice enough to release the 3D version, regular blu-ray & dvd blu-ray with special features with their first release, not the special secret overpriced edition 6 months later like some companies), and found it mind-blowing.  It was the first time that I had seen a 3D movie, at home, actually work.<br /><br />So, my first inclination was that it was too scary for my 4-year old and probably too scary for my 9-year old. Yet, not soon after, the 9-year old asked for it and there they were, both of them, glued to the television like I had never seen. Most movies hold their attention for a while and they end up drawing or wrestling, yet CORALINE had them staring at the television the whole time, jaws open, floored.  Thirty minutes after it was over, they wanted to watch it again... and again... there they were, awe struck through the entire movie, just like I was.<br /><br />Coraline tells the story of a little girl who is feeling gilted by her parents who are too busy with their lives to pay her attention. So, when she finds a secret door that leads her to an alternate universe, with attentive, loving parents who give her floats for dinner, she is enticed to say goodbye to the real world and join her alternative universe where everyone has buttons for eyes.<br /><br />It's a classic that should be held in the same esteem and long-lasting category as Wizard of Oz and it will, at least in my home, be one of the most loved children movies of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The flipside of James Bond"></head><body><p>In director Robert DeNiro's ambitious film, the professional rise and spiritual fall of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) through the ranks of the CIA reflects the evolution of that organization from its creation in the wake of WWII until the debacle at the Bay of Pigs.  The character of Wilson is much like the film itself: enigmatic, quiet, and tightly controlled.  Some may be put off by the long running time and the lack of big action scenes, but more patient viewers will be rewarded with a compelling presentation of the psychological damage caused when mistrust is the normal state of human interaction.  Wilson emerges as a tragic figure, having gone into government service with the best of intentions but, step by step, coming to the point where he becomes responsible for horrific acts.<br /><br />DeNiro does a fine job in his second film as a director.  He has assembled an excellent cast, including some outstanding cameos.</p></body></html>

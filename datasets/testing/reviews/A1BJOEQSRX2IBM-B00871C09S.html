Jimmy Stewart is in top form playing L.B. Jefferies, the photographer who enjoys to spy on his  neighbors in his free time. The beautiful Grace Kelly delivers a strong  female presence in the film, the scene where she first kisses Stewart is  incredibly sexy. While she is not remembered the most by her acting, but  then Hitchcock always said he used women as 'sex objects' and chose them  for their looks (the blonde goddess look seems to be his favorite), however  politically incorrect his methods were, it sure worked, and will keep on  working. Maybe Hitchcock's greatest accomplishment was making us feel like  a 'voyeur', and thinking that Stewart spying on his neighbors is a natural  thing, and we even want him to, more and more, as we get enthralled in the  mystery; did Mr. Thorwald kill his wife and is he really chopping up her  body?. We get hooked on that premise and that is when Hitchcock takes us  for a ride into his psychological roller-coaster, making us; the 'viewer',  feel like the 'voyeur', when we know that it is not right. The extremely  suspenseful ending is a knock-out and the whole film is an example of  Hollywood in it's golden years and of a genius at his peak. Extras: the  usual Hitchcock cameo; the person adjusting the clock in the piano player's  apartment. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!</p></body></html>

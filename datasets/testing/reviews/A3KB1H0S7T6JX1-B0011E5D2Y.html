<meta name="summary" content="NEAR PERFECTION!"></head><body><p>A great comedy, Wedding Crashers, as the title indicates, brings to the screen the story of two buddies that make a habit out of going to weddings uninvited in search of food, drink, and women.  Things become a bit more complicated when one member of the dynamic duo falls in love...<br /><br />Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!<br /><br />Strongly recommended for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

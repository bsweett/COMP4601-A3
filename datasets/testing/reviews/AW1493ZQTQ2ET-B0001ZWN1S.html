I found it gripping from start to finish.  The focus is clearly on the men in the family, since the female characters are hardly developed.  Superficially, one might be tempted to say that this is just a story about a particular group of criminals, but of course there's much more to it than that; indeed, this movie is an iconic classic for good reasons.<br /><br />Rather than attempting to write a thorough review which winds up just echoing what countless others have already said a million times, let me first highlight what I personally find to be the most striking aspect of the movie, namely the moral contradiction of these people.  On the one hand, they care for honor, they love their families, they respect traditions, they're nominally religious, they have a sense of responsibility as citizens, and they have a strong work ethic as businessmen (talk about high-stress jobs!).  But on the other hand, they resort to crime, terrorism, violence, and murder to attain money and power, thus being quite willing to disregard social norms and laws as they deem necessary.  I think many of us are fascinated by this juxtaposition because we all experience at least some degree of moral contradiction in our lives (after all, tough moral choices involving tradeoffs are routine), so a key contribution of these intense characters and circumstances is that they make explicit a tension we're all intuitively familiar with.<br /><br />Another theme which jumped out at me is that the mob is able to coerce even very wealthy and powerful people through violence or the threat of violence.  This is possible because they have an extensive and disciplined organizational structure which enables them to both circumvent law enforcement and apply force which no individual can resist (if you fight back against a mobster, you're fighting his entire mob family).<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a movie one simply recommends.  Rather, everyone needs to watch it at least once as part of their cultural education.  Also, this movie has much in common with "The Sopranos" series, so be sure to watch that series if you like this movie (in my opinion, it may be the best dramatic TV series ever made).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Big Lebowski"></head><body><p>`The Big Lebowski' is one of those films that started off small and over the years has gathered a cult like status. With Lebowski fests and often repeated phrases from the film, this has certainly entered the film goers psyche.<br /><br />After `The Dude's' rug gets urinated on after a case of mistaken identity he very rapidly gets drawn into a convoluted kidnapping mystery, when all he really wants is to get a replacement rug, drink White Russians and get back to his bowling league. Not too much to ask you would think. Yet he finds himself fending off threats from all sides and tries valiantly to keep his car from being totally wrecked in the process.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude and plays the part spot on. His long hair, slightly vacant look and stoner drawl fit the role to a tee. John Goodman is also good as The Dudes angry Vietnam vet friend Walter and the rest of the cast turn out great performances as well. The direction is very good and the more weird dreamy scenes are especially fun to watch.<br /><br />All in all this is a low key film that has risen to the top of the barrel over the years and it will keep you interested and will raise a laugh or two as you go along. There is a certain appeal to The Dude's laid back lifestyle and his charm really makes this film. Sit back and enjoy this minor cult classic.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HULK MAD! MOVIE BAD!"></head><body><p>The Hulk isn't one of my personal favorites. I'm one of the few people in this world who feel that the only thing good to come out of the Hulk was Wolverine (Issue #180-181 of the Hulk was Wolverine's first appearance.) Then again I did grow up on re-runs of the Hulk TV series as well, so I did have some level of high expectations for the film. Despite my belief that the plot of the Hulk (until recently) has been relatively thin, and more about Hulk tearing things apart than anything deeper I had hoped that the movie would opt to explore the more recent Jeckyl and Hyde approach of the newer comics, which have been incredible (pun intended.) Hulk should be a horror story, not an action movie. I think the biggest flaw of this film is that despite its attempt to remind audiences that its based on a comic book (wipes and fades that look like a page turning, comic like "cells" that also resemble TV's 24, etc.) this is Ang Lee's Hulk... not Stan Lee's. I appreciate the nod to the TV series, like the cameo by Mr. Ferigno, and "David" Banner... I don't appreciate the changes to the character's origin, which were done poorly.<br /> Stan Lee had this thing about making super heroes out of radiation, these days we know a lot more about radiation than we did then, so we replace radiation with genetic engineering. In my opinion if the origin of the Hulk was to be changed it should have followed the new origin presented in Marvel's "Ultimate" continuity. Even though I'm not that big of a Hulk fan I feel very betrayed by this film. That was not the Bruce Banner I remember, or David Banner (from the TV series), and in all honesty what they did with his father was just plane bad. The story seemed incoherent, and Hulk looked fake. I'm sorry but that's all there is too it. I would have liked it more had it not dealt with the father subplot. Exploring Banner himself, repressing his rage over a bad break up perhaps? Dealing with everything going wrong in his life at the moment and then BOOM his hit with the Gamma rays, or if I had my way the Super Soldier Serum, which would also open doors for a movie based on the Ultimates.<br /> It's really a shame to see Fox with the rights to X-Men and universal with the rights to Hulk... I'll never get to see the live action epic battle between Wolverine and the Hulk, and maybe Wolvie's making an appearance here could have saved this movie, since nothing else could. Who knows, the movie did have a lot of good ideas, they were just poorly executed. Perhaps the sequel will be better.</p></body></html>

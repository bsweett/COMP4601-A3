<meta name="summary" content="It should've been called AvP F (for fail)"></head><body><p>Short review of the extended combat edition. I don't know where to start. Movie is boring all the way. There were not a single good actor. Acting wasn't good.  I hated that they put love of teenagers in this already stupid film. Even children didn't act well. People, show me some fear! This is not what you call fear! A teenager got tailed by a predalien near the heart. Let's do math, and the result is he should've been dead. EVEN if not dead, he didn't act like he had pain and that should've been very painful. No, please no heroes. Oh no. slap on the face. We are dealing with aliens and predator. Nobody seems to be scared of that encounter. It's all just action here and there with a very boring set of actors that make story be unbearably bad! Do I have to repeat myself from the review of the first Avp movie that the host does not die right after waking up. It takes time. And no, it does not mean that 2 hosts have to die from aliens within their chests with only 2 or 3 seconds interval. Their deaths could've been acted better. Predator seem to have a lot of blue liquid that vaporizes corpses. Plasma.. does it ever need a recharge? National guards died within 5 minutes, when main heroes survived. Not 1, not 2, not 3 of them. Seriously? Aliens are the deadliest species in the universe..so was told in the previous movies... One of the vision modes in the predator mask could have been improved to look a little less human.<br />Acid actually burns through the floor and other surfaces. They forgot about it in the middle of the movie and right until the end. That's when acid became green alien juice. Miss Yutani... NO! She seems like a cheap actor and if I see her in another avp movie, forget about me buying it. General was a sucky actor too. There are more things to say, but this movie doesn't deserve me wasting time on it. It also does not deserve to be in Alien-Predator movie history.<br /><br />Good thing: New gadgets for predator that maybe will make it into the games.</p></body></html>

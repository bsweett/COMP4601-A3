It seems the Russians, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), are searching for a crystal skull believed to have magical powers.  They want it for their army and believe Jones knows where it is, so they kidnap him, he escapes, and the chase is on.  Along the way he meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who needs Indy's help to find his mother, Marion (Karen Allen).<br /><br />I have mixed emotions about this fourth installment in the Indy series.  It was better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Temple of Doom</a> (but not by much), but it had way too many characters in it and the plot was so complicated I honestly didn't know what was going on most of the time.  Happily, it  IS Indiana Jones; the excitement is still the same, the music is great, and when they slow down every once in a while, it's still fun.  Director Spielberg went way overboard on the CGI stuff, though, and put so many death-defying stunts (which Indy walks away from with nary a scratch) that much of it is cartoonish.  I wish they had concentrated on character rather than action.  Ford is still in good shape; it was lovely to see Marion brought back from the first movie and LaBeouf made a pleasant, though unnecessary, sidekick for Indy.<br /><br />It's an exhausting movie to watch and I drifted off to sleep a few times when it became too taxing to try and follow the plot.  I liked the nods to the characters of Indiana Sr. and Marcus Brody and the quick glimpse of the long-forgotten ark from the first movie.  Action fans who can overlook the convoluted storyline may well enjoy this movie.</p></body></html>

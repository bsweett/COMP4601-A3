Either fans are based within two categories: the ones that absolutely love it or the ones that thinks that it's just okay. I have yet to meet someone who ever dispised the series, and with good reason. Harrison Ford had and has such an appeal as the early to mid 1900's archaeologist and explorer that it became his most recognizable character, giving even more of a chance to showcase his acting chops than his work in the original Star Wars trilogy as Han Solo. The first three Jones films were shot at Ford's peak as an actor while he was still in his early forties, easily able to keep up with the films action packed scenes and storylines. But like life itself, you can't stop the passage of time, and almost 20 years later can Ford, along with mainstay producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg, be successful with a now 65 year old Indiana Jones? Could he still crack a whip and knock out the bad guys all the while not looking like someone who's just past his prime?<br /><br />Taking place 19 years since the events of the third film "The Last Crusade", Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr, is still up to his old tricks. Part time college professor, part time explorer. But now the adventures are getting harder and harder. His long time mentor and friend Marcus Brody has passed and his rival father Henry Jones Sr. is gone too. Also, the world around him has changed as well. The German threat is over, and now the fears of the Russians, Cold War, and Nuclear Weaponry loom over each personal success. After a fouled up assignment to stop Russian Spys from stealing "extra-terrestrial" artifacts from a hidden Nevada goverment station, Indy finds himself on a forced leave of absence from Barnett College. While trying to leave, he runs into a young man by the name of "Mutt" Williams who has been looking for Indy to help him rescue Harold Oxley, Mutt's father figure and Indy's old friend. Oxley and Mutt's Mom (eventually found out to be none other than Raiders co-star and former flame Marion Ravenwood, again by seemingly ageless Karen Allen) have been lost while searching for a Crystal Skull within South America that as legend tells has strange powers that might not be from this planet. However the Russians, led by Cate Blanchett want this too, and will do anything to stop Indy and his gang from achieving the ultimate goal of returning the skull to it's proper resting place. Will this so-called alien artifact open a doorway into the great beyond, or is it as Indy originally thinks, just something that belongs in a museum?<br /><br />While watching this film it surprised me how the Lucas/Spielberg team were able to hold back the outrageousness of previous films to bring this one into a more realistic light, especially for it's star. Jones is older in this, and at times it shows yet being respectful and still highly entetaining. While other Indy sidekicks have provided little more than comic relief, Shia LaBeouf's Mutt picks up the slack where Jones shouldn't be able to provide at this point in his life. Don't get me wrong, Indy still will whip your butt, but it's just not as easy as it once was nor should it be. Another classy move is how the first three films reflected the memories of 1940's action adventure films, this chapter moves properly ahead to the 1950's Cold War era with it's Atom Bomb testing and the threat of Russian dominance & communism. Honestly cast-wise there's not one weak link here, everybody does a great job and keep this 2 hour & 2 minute movie going without any drag or unnecessary parts. While the idea of Indiana Jones dealing with an alien-like scenerio might seem hokey, it really does fit well here, be it the film's ending might have had you expecting something a little bit different. Overall, the once heralded Lucas/Spielberg has provided another great film instead of say another Episode I thru III, all the while keeping it in it's place knowing that it could never be as good as the original nor should it be, just an extension like revisiting an old friend years after your first glory.<br /><br />The Single-Disc edition (that I'm reviewing here) has the usual fantastic picture and audio of a modern day SD-DVD release, but also comes with two 15 minute plus documentaries speaking of both the Indiana Jones legacy and how some of the shots were accomplished. Many may be awfully surprised to see how little CGI was used in this flix (even the film itself was shot on actual film, NOT digitally!), and how much effort was made to keep this within the confines of the trilogy before it. Sorry, we again get no Spielberg/Lucas commentary, but this should be considered a good thing if you ever sat through a Lucas one. So while I assume you get behind-the-scenes overkill with the 2 Disc set, those with light wallets won't get bare-boned with this version either.<br /><br />Like seeing an old friend from high school it was nice to revisit such an icon of many's theatrical past. While it isn't the Indy of old (or is that young?), he still has some life left in him for this chapter. Nice cast additions and a story that keeps you going throughout, Crystal Skull will entertain and having that theme song back in your brain for weeks to come.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)</p></body></html>

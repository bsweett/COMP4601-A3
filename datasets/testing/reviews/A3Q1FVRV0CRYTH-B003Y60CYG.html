<meta name="summary" content="Hmmmm, I don't understand the love for this one..."></head><body><p>The late Robert Altman, a director praised up and down for his successes in writing and directing, has left us (or at least me) in a bit of a shock.  `A Prairie Home Companion', which deserved me due to its countless rave reviews, failed to illicit even the slightest vein of interest in me.  In all actuality if it weren't for Meryl's spectacular acting ability I would have most likely turned the film off before the credits began to role.  There is no denying that Meryl Streep is a brilliantly gifted actress, and if she receives an Oscar nod for this film I will completely understand for her ditzy Yolanda was the best part of this borefest.  Not only was this film boring but it becomes increasingly ridiculous with its side plots of angels of death that just further prove my distaste for this movie.  The acting was surprisingly good, all except for Kevin Kline and Virginia Madsen who just come off bland and completely uninterested with their roles, and thus we, the viewer, become less and less interested.  I just can't muster up much of anything to say about this movie that won't border negativity unless it's concerning Meryl so I'll end this review with:<br /><br /> "So many love this, I don't understand why, I couldn't bare to watch it again, so average movie watcher beware, this film is not all it's raved up to be."</p></body></html>

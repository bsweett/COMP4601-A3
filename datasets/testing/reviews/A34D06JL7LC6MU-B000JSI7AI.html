<meta name="summary" content="An Affecting Film, No Matter What Your Sexuality Is"></head><body><p>This movie was the "IT" movie of 2005. It was the most talked about, most joked about, it scored the most Oscar nominations.<br /><br />It won 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture for director Ang Lee and was the subject of the big Oscar upset when 'Crash' won Best Picture. Personally, I think 'Crash' was a better movie. But despite it's labels ("the gay cowboy movie") and the jokes made on it's behalf (Brownback Mountain, etc.) this movie proves to be one of the best films of 2005 and a deeply sad movie about unexpected love. I'm straight, so I was worried when I saw this movie just how affected I would be by the love story of two men...I was surprised. Oscar nominee Heath Ledger (Best Actor, Brokeback Mountain) stars as Ennis Del Mar, a tightlipped cowboy searching for work. Ennis ends up at a trailer where he meets Jack Twist (Oscar nominee Jake Gyllenhaal). The two are hired (by Randy Quaid) to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain. After a while on the mountain the two hit it off and one cold night they end up having sex. The scene is somewhat graphic, but not sickening. Both Ennis and Jack are surprised by the sudden act, neither one of them are aware that they're gay. That's expressed in a fantastic scene as the two stand on a mountain and Ennis says "You know, I ain't no queer".<br /><br />"Me neither" Jack replies. Anyway, when the job ends; both men go their separate ways. Ennis marries a woman named Alma (Oscar nominee Michelle Williams) and has two daughters. Jack moves to Texas and marries Lureen (Anne Hathaway, obviously trying to shed her "Princess Diaries" image) and has a son. Four years pass, when Ennis recieves a postcard from Jack. The two meet up and the passion is rekindled immediately. For the next 20 years the two continue their relationship, with Jack insisting that the two can live together somewhere on their own ranch. The tighlipped Ennis however realizes that can never be so...<br /><br />Also, Jack is the only one who seems to really accept that he's gay...Picking up a male prostitute in Mexico and forging a relationship with a man in Texas. Now, this story isn't really just about two gay cowboys. It's about forbidden love and I'm going to paraphrase Roger Ebert's review here; but it could have just as easily been about a muslim man and jewish woman or<br /><br />a black man and a white woman. It shows that love can happen at anytime even with someone you least expect. It's deep stuff.<br /><br />Ledger finally gets to step out into the limelight and Gyllenhaal shows off some more acting chops (which he's done before in movies like "The Good Girl"). I haven't seen Michelle Williams outside of anything other than "Dawson's Creek" and it's amazing to me that she could strike up the kind of emotions she does as Alma, the wife who knows of her husbands relationship but is to nervous (and scared) to bring it up with him. Hathaway was underrated in her role as Lureen, Jack's wife and shows that she could begin to be taken seriously in the years to come. This is a marvelous film, that I highly recommend.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

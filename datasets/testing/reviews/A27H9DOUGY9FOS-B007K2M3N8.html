<meta name="summary" content="An Unfortunately Shallow "Sea"--A Look At Two Contemporary Musical Biographies"></head><body><p>The musical biography is always a hit-or-miss genre for me. These pictures can be effective, but oftentimes lack dramatic heft as we move through the years. It's a Cliff's Notes version of someone's life only stopping for the dramatic scene or recognizable milestone. Recently, I've seen two films structured so similarly that they almost require comparison: Kevin Spacey's loveletter to Bobby Darin "Beyond the Sea" and "De-Lovely," the story of Cole Porter.<br /><br />Both films use an interesting framing device. Bobby is in a fantasy movie set recreating the highlights of his life and Cole is in a fantasy theater recalling his legacy. Both use relevant music to dramatize significant events and link passages of time. And both come to the end with an imagined, jubilant musical number to play us out.<br /><br />Here's the thing. When looking at a biographical movie, I have to ask myself two questions. Is the person relevant enough to merit a full blown film? And is there enough of interest to warrant that film? Here is where these film diverge, because I think Bobby Darin's story just isn't that interesting or significant. Sorry. Cole Porter, however, was a talent ahead of his time that led a pretty daring lifestyle.<br /><br />"Beyond the Sea" was problematic from the beginning. Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly a talented actor, he severely miscast himself here. Everyone knows it and the film even winkingly acknowledges the fact that he's way too old. But forgiving that, the film glosses over the dramatic points. A childhood deadly disease--song--Sandra Dee doesn't like him--song--problems in the marriage--song--a neglected child--song. No issue is ever handled effectively by the script, instead a musical video number comes along and the problem doesn't exist anymore. Still as trite entertainment, the film was fine initially--but the longer it goes on, the more self important it becomes. Then boom, let's call that illness up again and end this picture with a showstopper. Even Bobby Darin knew he was obsolete by the end of the sixties, so I'm not sure why I'd care 40 years later anyway.<br /><br />"De-Lovely" was more of a surprise. Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd are in fine form, and the movie allows them to ACT! There is much more story here as Porter was an influential figure in theater and film--and more drama in his personal side from his double life, sex clubs, loss of limb, etc. The film isn't perfect, however, it presents the more controversial aspects of Porter--but never really handles them in an anything but polite manner. And the movie lags toward the end, which is more forgivable because you've actually come to care about these characters.<br /><br />OK, music: One of these films has contemporary stars like Diana Krall, Robbie Williams, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow and many others giving elegant spins to classic numbers. The appearance of these performers adds a nice touch to the musical segues. And John Barrowman's "Night and Day" is an absolute showstopper! The other film handles the musical interludes a bit differently. In it, we get the limited appeal of Kevin Spacey singing and dancing and singing and dancing. It's fine, but hardly the stuff to make young girls all aflutter. I'll leave you to figure out which is which.<br /><br />The final number in each: "de-Lovely" brings everyone in the entire cast together for one more celebration of Cole Porter's music. "Beyond The Sea" offers one more self-indulgent song and dance from Mr. Spacey. Look, "De-Lovely" obviously is the movie I prefer--it's a solid four stars. "Beyond The Sea" started out as a three star film because of its harmlessness but sinks to one star by the end due to its own pretensions. KGHarris, 10/06.</p></body></html>

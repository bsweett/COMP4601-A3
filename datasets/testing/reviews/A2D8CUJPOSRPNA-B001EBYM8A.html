<meta name="summary" content="On The Run"></head><body><p>If any TV series deserved the big screen treatment, it would have to be THE FUGITIVE.  This superb series, which starred the late David Janssen and ran on ABC-TV from 1963 to 1967, was a huge hit on the small screen.  And in 1993, it got to the big screen with excellent results.<p>Taking over from Janssen, Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, who is arrested, tried, and convicted for the murder of his wife Helen (Sela Ward)--a murder that he did not commit.  On the way to an Illinois prison, the bus he and other prisoners are riding in suffers a catastrophic accident and a collision with a train.  Ford manages to escape, but now the feds, under the leadership of U.S. marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), are after him, and they are relentless.  Ford is forced to do whatever it takes to stay just out of the law's reach and not only find the one-armed assailant who actually killed his wife, but also why the murder even happened in the first place.<p>Without an unneccesary amount of graphic violence or out-of-control explosions, director Andrew Davis (UNDER SIEGE) manages to build suspense in the classic Hitchcock tradition.  Indeed, both the film and the TV series upon which it is based are superlative variations on a favorite Hitchcock theme--a man on the run for a crime he didn't commit.  If the plot seems a bit incredulous at times, this is only a minor flaw; and it is easily forgotten just watching Ford piece together a sinister puzzle to prove his innocence to everyone, especially the tenacious, hard-as-nails Jones.<p>Jones won a richly-deserved Oscar for his slightly sardonic performance as Sam Gerard, especially for his line about searching every "warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, and doghouse" after the train wreck.  But it is Ford who really carries this movie.  We sympathize with his plight and we are with him just about every step of the way.  Like Hitchcock's characters, as well as those in Spielberg's movies, we are put into the shoes of Ford's character and forced to think about what we might do if we were ever under the same kind of pressure.<p>THE FUGITIVE is vigorously recommended to anyone who appreciates good, old-fashioned suspense and thrills with believable characters and a believable plot.  Pick it up!</p></body></html>

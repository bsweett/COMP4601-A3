<meta name="summary" content="A poor movie that is only a little entertaining"></head><body><p>I wanted to like "Jarhead."  I am a former Army officer myself (by way of disclosure) but I have always had a soft spot for Marines.  This film has several problems that essentially will ruin it for almost any viewer.  There is virtually no plot, there is virtually no war, and the depiction in the film of the Marines does not cut the mustard in terms of accuracy or plausibility.<br /><br />With respect to plausibility--to take just one example, in the film a recruit dies in a live-fire exercise.  The drill sergeant curses up a storm, and things move on, apparently with no consequences.  What rubbish.  Anyone who has ever served knows that such events, rare but not unheard-of, involve huge consequences and the military (yes, including those tough Marines) take such events very seriously.  Generally losing a soldier or Marine under such circumstances is a career-ending move for the man in charge.  This flick implies that the Sarge went out for a beer afterwords and forgot about it.  Not likely.<br /><br />Another outrageous matter in this mediocre film was the notion that one Marine could (or would) pull a firearm on a fellow Marine.  Complete nonsense.  This would constitute, at a minimum, an assault under the UCMJ and would never be tolerated, not anywhere or anywhen.  A court-martial would be the inevitable outcome, probably ending with a bad-conduct discharge.<br /><br />The overall depiction of Marines was more or less a Hollywood stereotype.  Yes, combat troopers, whether Marines or Army, are loud, irreverent, and yes profane, but not to the idiotic extremes depicted in this film.  After awhile the endless (and they are endless in the movie) antics, yelling, and horseplay by the Marines starts to grate.<br /><br />I could have (barely) tolerated and forgiven the Hollywood stereotype of Marines if this film had had a decent plot.  Sorry, there pretty much is no plot.  I can handle the notion that the First Gulf War was 99% hurry-up-and-wait.  That is the gist of modern warfare, and probably most warfare going back to ancient Sparta.  But this is, after all, a movie with a presumed purpose of entertaining the viewer.  So we needed a plot a little bit deeper than the various Marines' girl friends being unfaithful to them.  But we don't get one in this film.<br /><br />There are some funny moments in this flick that redeem it from being a one-star, but this is not a film that most viewers would ever want to watch more than once.

Overall, great attention has been paid to historical detail, such as Heath Ledger's character being sewn up in a 'coccoon' - this was done back then when a young man stayed at someone else's house to make sure he didn't do hanky-panky with the young women in the house - I laughed at this and thought it was great, it showed that research had been done. The story itself is riveting with quite a few emotional scenes and some sadness, so be ready to have your heartstrings tugged at. The camerawork and action scenes are also nicely executed, so two thumbs up!</p></body></html>

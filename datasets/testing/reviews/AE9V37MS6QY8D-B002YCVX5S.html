<meta name="summary" content="Four and a half stars for a bunch of basterds!"></head><body><p>Seven months ago, upon my first viewing of the trailer for Quentin Tarantino's highly anticipated WWII film, "Inglourious Basterds," a small coat of goosebumps covers my arms and neck. The words flash across the screen: "You haven't seen war ... until you've seen it through the eyes ... of Quentin Tarantino." And after viewing Basterds, never have any truer taglines been used for a movie's publicity. To say that Tarantino has his own style of filmmaking is one of the most obvious understatements to even a novice filmgoer.<br /><br />Tarantino's magnus opus (to this day), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7Q2WM">Kill Bill - Vol. 1 & 2 (2 Pack)</a>, is the greatest testament to his style, blending spaghetti western, Shaw Bros. Kung Fu films, 1970's revenge pics, grindhouse B-movie and Japanimation. It's the quintessential Quentin film, showcasing his cinephile hodge-podge style that has driven most viewers to the love-him-or-hate-him mantle that has recently emblazoned into audience and critics' minds alike. No matter how violent, profane, or sometimes cartoonish Tarantino's characters may seem, you still have to admit that he creates some damn cool characters with dialogue that only he could conjure, and puts them in run-of-the-mill plots that shift with breakneck speed into SNAFU situations. Now, he's taken his unique style to early 1940's Nazi-occupied France. But first, a brief interlude.<br /><br />Growing up, I was never a big fan of war movies. Upon the first reading of this, my wife's jaw will most likely drop of shock and awe as she knows of my strange draw to the dark war and crime thriller genres that I often watch. But I promise you - and her - it's true. Don't get me wrong, I watched war films, but I was never drawn to watch them. I just watched them to watch them. During my pre-adolescent years, I vaguely remember brief glimpses of John Wayne and Gary Cooper war films that inundated my uncle's TV when I would sleep over my cousins' house. My dad - himself a fan of films - while he loves a good action movie, he never can bring himself to sit down and watch a war movie. He doesn't mind movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W8OM5Y">Braveheart (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELL1S0">The Patriot (Extended Cut)</a>, or "300," but after serving in Vietnam, a Navy photographer surveying the madness of war from a helicopter as bullets whizzed past him (similar to Joe Galloway from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068TPN">We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)</a>), any movies depicting battles from WWII to the present, he won't even attempt to view. I watched classics such as "Johnny Got His Gun," "Full Metal Jacket," "Platoon," "Tora Tora Tora," "Born on the Fourth of July," and now-personal favorites "1941," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HWZ4CA">Sergeant York (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, "The Longest Day," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTURQ">The Dirty Dozen (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, "Glory," and "Memphis Belle" (I watched them just to watch them), but it truly wasn't until Steven Spielberg's 1998 masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBLVI">Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> that I purposely watched war movies. Of course, some aren't as reflective and poignant as Spielberg's. But there have been excellent films of this genre to follow in its footsteps and have filled my DVD collection: "Black Hawk Down," "We Were Soldiers," and the HBO miniseries <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXSS">Band of Brothers</a>.<br /><br />Now, "Basterds" has joined the ranks of these great war films. Yes, it has Tarantino's quirky trademark stamp, but it's also one of the most serious, and, at times, non-Tarantino, films he's created. Sure, there's the occasional interludes of Samuel L. Jackson narration, the Ennio Morricone-riddled score, a brief comic book-style character profile and the fantastic opening sequence between SS Colonel Hans Landa (the superb Christoph Waltz) and a French Jewish sympathizer that is somewhat reminiscent of the famous Dennis Hopper-Christopher Walken scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FDCF">True Romance - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> (just one of my favorite cinema scenes ever). Nonetheless, this film also has a majority of subtitles, a mostly foreign, unknown-in-America cast, and probably is the least violent, more talkative films Tarantino's ever done.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't first mention the most stand-out element: Christoph Waltz. He was awarded the Best Actor Award at Cannes, and Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes and SAG, and, after viewing the film, it's easy to see why. Waltz can transition from laid-back ease one moment to child-like zaniness to nail-biting, cold ruthlessness all in one brilliant quick natural stroke. Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a southern hillbilly who gloriously terrorizes any Nazis who cross his path, leads the Special Ops team known fearfully to the Germans as the Basterds. They - including a brawny director Eli Roth as the "Bear Jew," Donny Donowitz, who beats Nazis to death with a baseball bat inscribed with the names of Jews who his neighbors worry about back in the U.S. (a fact only known by reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316070351">screenplay</a> since the scene was cut from the film) - tear a bloody path across France, littering it with dead, scalped Nazi soldiers in their wake. And while the movie's title refers to this small band of bastards, don't expect Pitt and his crew to headline and have dominated screen time. The central characters to this film are Hans Landa and the Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent - think of a French Sarah Polley). Although Shosanna has made a life for herself managing a small cinema, her wish to avenge her family's death comes into fruition when she catches the eye of the Nazi's "Sergeant York," Private Zoller (Daniel Bruhl).<br /><br />Apart from Pitt and a few of the Basterds, each of the cast is rather unknown in America since Tarantino wanted to use real German and French actors to play their counterparts (fun little fact: Leonardo DiCaprio was considered for Hans Landa, but Tarantino wanted a German actor to play the part). The acting is solid on all counts. Pitt delivers a small but important role similar to his Mickey O'Neil in Snatch. Roth, Diane Kruger, and Michael Fassbender give good, quirky performances, but the best performances go to Laurent and Waltz. They perfectly capture the seriousness and the sometimes-zaniness of the plot without seeming hokey.<br /><br />While Inglourious Basterds certainly had room for improvement, it marked far better than certain other action flicks this summer (uh-hum, *G.I. Joe*). I did wish that some of the "basterds" backgrounds were slightly more explored as well as what became of their fates (it's probably just an assumption to the audience that they were K.I.A. during their mission). However, with a rewrite of history, quick, outrageous bursts of violence, a majority of subtitles and a cast of serious, A-list actors (most of them foreign), Tarantino nearly perfectly balances the line between cheesy B-movie action flick and serious epic WWII film, placing it in the same class as one of my favorites: "The Dirty Dozen." This one stands in file behind "(500) Days of Summer," "Up," and "Away We Go" as my best of the summer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, but Agatha Christie did it better"></head><body><p>Ten strangers are trapped in a hotel on a dark and stormy night.  One by one they begin to die and each body is accompanied by a room key, counting down from 10 to 1.  The atmosphere is suitably spooky and the action is intense.  The ensemble cast, led by John Cusack and Ray Liotta, does a good job of portraying a random bunch of people, from an actress to a convicted murderer.  Gradually the pieces begin to fall into place and the viewer begins to understand the tangled web of this psychological drama.  It makes for an entertaining evening, but sometimes less is better, as in the case of the original book &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; by Agatha Christie.  Still, this movie is well-done and worth a look.</p></body></html>

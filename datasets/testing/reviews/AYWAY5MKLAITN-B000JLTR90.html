<meta name="summary" content="Another Masterpiece by M. Night!"></head><body><p>Let's start with the cinematography. Every frame of this movie is bewitchingly beautiful and mystical. The whole gist of this movie is that a woman, found in the pool of an apartment complex, is part of another world; a world of others like her who have a purpose in their race. her name is "Story" and she comes up to the surface to find her purpose. Paul Giamatti plays a perfect lanlord/custodian "Cleveland Heep." He has a troubling past but somehow finds his purpose by Helping Story find hers. The whole story has a mystical fairy tale for a new generation feel to it. It resonates with the slow-pacing/ alfred hitchcock directing style that were so familiar with from M. Night. This is surely a "Must own" movie that you'll watch again and again. If you loved "Unbreakable", then you will fall in love with this one. It's a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece from the master himself. He really makes you believe that it really could happen.<br /><br />Buy this movie. Ignore bad reviews.</p></body></html>

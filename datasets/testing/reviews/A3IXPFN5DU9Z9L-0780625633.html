The film does not lecture but nor does it pardon - it approaches its delicate subject matter with conviction, maturity and stark imagery.<br /><br />Set among the resurgence of Neo-Nazism among California's disenchanted urban youth in the 80's and early 90's, X is the story of one family, headed by eldest son Norton, and how the seed of racism takes root in his heart and begins to grow.<br /><br />Leading man Norton delivers an explosive and utterly convincing performance as a young man who's world view becomes twisted by racist convictions. Soon his festering and misdirected rage lands him in prison, where hard lessons await. Outside of the prison walls Norton's younger brother begins the cycle anew as he seeks to follow in the footsteps of the brother he has come to idolize.<br /><br />A fascinating and deeply layered tale of prejudice and the painful lessons of lives misspent in its shadow, American History X is explicitly violent but superbly performed and executed. The ending, as shocking as any I've seen in cinema, is as uncompromising as the rest of the film and will provide little comfort to happy-ending seekers. DVD includes deleted scenes, cast bios and theatrical trailer. Widescreen format is included. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

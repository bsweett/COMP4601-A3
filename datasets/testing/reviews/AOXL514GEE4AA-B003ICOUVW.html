<meta name="summary" content=""Lawrence, you've done terrible things." Blu ray review"></head><body><p>Wolfman is a remake of the Universal Classic. It tells the tale of Lawrence Talbot(Del Toro), who is lured back to his family estate by his brother's fiance Gwen (Blunt) after he goes missing. Reunited with his estranged father and haunted by his past, Talbot sets out to find his brother. After he is attacked, he soon discovers that something with brute strength and a lust for blood has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline (Weaving) has come to investigate. The curse of the wolfman begins and as he falls deeper into madness, he makes a startling revelation! Can he destroy the evil behind it all, before it destroys him?<br /><br />This movie is getting high praise and serious criticism on here. It deserves neither. The critics are ridiculous and I wonder what they expected? The cast is excellent and the script (all things considered) original and refreshing. What fun would it be to see the original film remade frame by frame? Talbot is a more complete character with a haunted back story. The relationship with his father is the main storyline in the film, which gives it substance. I have not seen the theatrical but the problem with the Director's Cut is that it gores it up too much. Otherwise, this is an excellent remake and enjoyable movie.<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Universal morphs out a monstrous disc! Absolutely stunning! The robust picture fills the screen with excellent colors and marvelous darks! Great sound too. The special features are interesting and insightful (especially the 2 alt endings and making of). FINAL THOUGHTS: A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

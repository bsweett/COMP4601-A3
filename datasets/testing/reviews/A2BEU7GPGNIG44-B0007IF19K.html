The film Ray details Ray Charles early years and his career rise and the many struggles that he went through in both his personal and professional life. Actor Jamie Foxx won a Golden Globe award for his amazing role as Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx really did become Ray Charles for this film. The film also stars Regina King (Jerry McGuire, A Cinderella Story), Clifton Powell (Woman Thou Art Loosed, Sugar Valentine), Larenz Tate (Why Do Fools Fall In Love), and other wonderful actors.<br /><br />The DVD is very impressive. The DVD case is enclosed in a shiny color protective slip cover. The DVD itself includes two discs. Upon opening the case you might not notice that there are two discs, but yes, the second disc in in there. Disc one includes the theatrical version and an extended version not shown in theaters. There are a few extras on the first disc but the bulk of the extras are on disc 2.<br /><br />Disc two is filled with a plethora of extra's and bonus material. The most moving bonus feature is Walking In Hist Shoes. This is a revealing look at Jamie Foxx's transformation into Ray Charles. There is also a short little scene where you see Ray and Jamie at the piano. It's moving to see the two together. This short will also let the people know who were not aware that Ray Charles endorsed this film and Jamie Foxx portraying him. Ray Remembered is another bonus feature-but it's too short! We see Quincy Jones, Jamie Foxx and a few others paying tribute to Ray who passed away last year. However, this short only lasted between 5-7 minutes.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the performances in the film the DVD includes complete uncut music performances from the moving, including the performace for "Hit The Road Jack." Disc two also includes 14 never before seen deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

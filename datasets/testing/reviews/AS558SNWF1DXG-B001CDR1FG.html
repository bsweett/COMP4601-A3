<meta name="summary" content="So much potential, so little payoff...."></head><body><p>Given the choice between a comic book adaptation that's dark and deep and one that's wafer-thin, I'll take seriousness and depth. Too many recent superhero fantasies have involved by-the-numbers stories dappled with computer-generated graphics.<p> But, man, Ang Lee's &quot;The Hulk&quot; requires way too much heavy lifting for your basic monster movie.<p> In telling the story of Bruce Banner (Eric Bana), a scientist transformed by his experiments into a big green behemoth, Lee gets a lot right. The colors and camera angles and production design neatly evoke the Marvel Comics renderings of Jack Kirby; the blunt, stark dialogue all but floats over the characters' heads in "word balloons"; and an array of split-screens, wipes and dissolves replicate the panels of a comic book, even if they are overused and distracting.<p> The crucial element that's missing, however, is fun. There's not a drop of fun in this long, low movie. There's no sense of adventure or wonder, which is the core of any fantasy. Instead, by filling the plot with lots of half-baked psychology about Bruce's evil dad David (Nick Nolte), Lee and screenwriter James Schamus have transformed "The Hulk" into a bland allegory about bad family ties. If they had injected just a little hope and humor into the story, it might not have mattered that the title character is obviously a digital effect. But they didn't, and "The Hulk" is clearly just an artificial creature.</p></body></html>

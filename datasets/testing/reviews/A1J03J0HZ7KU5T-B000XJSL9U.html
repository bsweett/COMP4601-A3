<meta name="summary" content="Decline Hard!"></head><body><p>After a 12-year absence, Bruce Willis returns as New York detective John McClane in this disappointing "Die Hard" sequel. Willis delivers the "yippee ki yay" goods, but the film lacks a strong cast, coherent scripting and the firm hand of director John McTiernan. The cyber-terrorist plot is a letdown after McClane's cat-and-mouse games with the Gruber brothers - further hindered by cartoonish action sequences and a ludicrous climax. Though slightly better than "Die Hard 2," this fourth installment doesn't measure up to the Willis-McTiernan collaborations.</p></body></html>

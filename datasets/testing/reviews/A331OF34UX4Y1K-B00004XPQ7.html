<meta name="summary" content="DISHONEST"></head><body><p>This is a dishonest movie. Everything here is pure Hollywood cliche. But, like in some modern painting full of meaningless traces and figures that  nobody knows what's about, people wants to see messages of  &quot;love&quot;, &quot;patriotism&quot; or wherever in this garbage.  GIBSON is clearly working for his paychech here. The screenplay is so  terrible I almost left the theater at once. Everything is pure cliche: the  villain that seems like the Devil himself, so bad he is; the ridiculous  love plot between Gibson's character son and a lady; from scene one, you  know who will live and who will die. THis is the worst kind of thing  American Movi Industry can offer us. People get butchering theirselves all  movie long, but are still capable of talking &quot;deep&quot; and  &quot;intelligent&quot; dialogues, more or less like this: &quot;I'm gonna  kill you like I killed your sons&quot;. &quot;No, I'm the one who's gonna  kill you&quot;. All the while, beautiful classic music is playing as  soundtrack. As we know, being slayed by a hammer, an axe or a sword must be  a delightful experience ... Why &quot;Last of THE MOHICANS&quot; is much  better ? WHy &quot;BRAVEHEART&quot; is so better ? Because they started as  good-natured projects, but &quot;THE PATRIOT&quot; started from the first  page with the only intention to get money, money, money. Blergh !</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It really is as bad as the reviews say"></head><body><p>I went into the remake of The Fog with an open mind and expected a fairly decent movie, I didn't think it would be better than the original or an instant classic, but I was expecting a fairly decent movie. I heard The Fog was terrible, but to be totally honest since right now we are in remake hell I thought maybe people are just being harsh since this is the latest remake. And a remake of a popular movie by John Carpenter, that makes this movie a sitting duck.<br /><br />But I have to agree with the majority. The Fog was indeed a very bad movie. Things go from bad to worse over the course of the movie. I was amazed at how horrible The Fog was. Like I said I wasn't expecting a classic, but a fairly decent movie. The Fog didn't even have the so bad its good vibe going for it. Only the so bad it's well bad.<br /><br />I did like the original John Carpenter version, but I do believe there were some problems with the original. While the original did have a creepy feel to it there were also some slow moments. The Fog is also a bit dated, while it's still a good movie it hasn't aged as well as some of Carpenter's other movies. Overall though I did enjoy the original and I didn't think the remake would be better, but maybe stand proud next to it.<br /><br />The screenplay by Cooper Layne was quite bad. The characters are one dimensional and boring. They aren't fleshed out at all. John Carpenter and Debra Hill's script wasn't perfect, but it was well written. Layne Cooper though, well his script was bad. The concept behind The Fog was a simple story and that is why it worked. Cooper Layne takes a simple concept and creates a total mess.<br /><br />Despite the flaws of the original John Carpenter was able to make up for it with some really great atmosphere. He uses his setting to his total advantage and is able to make a movie that has a lot of suspense and tension even with the flaws. Sadly director Rupert Wainwright is not able to do the same. Ok so he didn't have much of a script, but I have seen many horror movies that weren't all that well written become a lot better cause of the director.<br /><br />Rupert Wainwright never really creates much of an eerie feeling. There were a couple of scenes late in the movie with he showed some flashes of something. But by this time do we even really care? The answer is quite simple. No we don't, not this late in the movie. Wainwright never uses his setting to his advantage his scenes are all poorly paced, he wasn't able to build any suspense or tension.<br /><br />The acting was quite weak as well. Tom Welling is just going through the motions here. Maggie Grace though gives a fairly good performance and is somewhat able to make a poorly written character a bit interesting at times, but barley. Selma Blair though is excellent. She gave a solid performance in my opinion, but it's sadly wasted here. She doesn't have nearly enough scenes and I think she could have made The Fog a bit better had she been given a bigger part. Selma Blair may not be Adrienne Barbeau, but she does manage to bring something to the character and really is the only positive thing about this movie.<br /><br />The Fog really was as bad as the reviews stated; it relies too much on CGI, which was quite bad I must say. A simple ghost story became a complete waste of time. Like I said before I wasn't expecting a great movie, but a fairly decent one. But all I got was a bad movie and not in a good way.</p></body></html>

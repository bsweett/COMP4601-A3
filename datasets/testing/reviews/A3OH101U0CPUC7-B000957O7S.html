<meta name="summary" content="Nicely done romantic comedy"></head><body><p>Alex "Hitch" Hitchens (Will Smith) is the "date doctor" who helps men get to first base with the woman of their dreams. He isn't a sleaze who teaches them to lie and con their way forward, he helps build their confidence and form a plan so they don't look like fools. His latest challenge is Albert (Kevin James), a portly tax accountant who lusts after a glamorous heiress. While Hitch is coaching Albert in the toughest assignment of his career, he also pursues a reporter for a New York tabloid. As one might expect in a romantic comedy, misunderstandings ensue and both Hitch and Albert will have to struggle if they want to capture true love.<br /><br />Will Smith is one of the most likeable personas around and he exudes his usual easy charm here. The ethics of his profession had the potential to get dicey, but it's made very clear that he doesn't help guys score, he helps men looking for love. Just as most shrinks seem to be emotionally damaged, so too the love doctor is suffering the long-term effects of a broken heart. Hitch is charming and witty with a woman but letting her inside is a bit too scary. Albert is the opposite, of course. A big teddy bear who would declare his love for the heiress before she knew his name (with disastrous results) if he didn't have Hitch to advise him. The training sessions with the two of them are probably the most enjoyable of the whole movie and certainly enjoyable.<br /><br />If there was a downside to the movie, it was the character of Sara, Hitch's love interest. She is so judgmental and shrill that I found myself wishing that Hitch would find someone a lot more pleasant to pursue. Alas, the poor man was smitten and so can look forward to continued verbal maulings for quite some time.<br /><br />This is an easy movie to watch and an easy movie to like. Hitch is funny, entertaining, and has a good-hearted feel. Will Smith is as good as expected, but Kevin James plays a critical role in providing warmth and vulnerability in a movie that could otherwise have come off as slick and cynical.</p></body></html>

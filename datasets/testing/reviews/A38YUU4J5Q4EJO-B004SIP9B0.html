<meta name="summary" content="A flawless portrayal of the Queen"></head><body><p>Always having been fascinated by the Royals, (especially Princess Dianna)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />It is centered at the time that the Princess died, and the Queen came under such negative scrutiny for her lack of emotion, and her failure to make a public statement about her death.<br /><br />Although I am not saying that the Queen was right in her silence, I DO now have a clearer understanding of Royal tradition,and protocol. I now understand her silence a little better.<br /><br />Even though the Queen clearly did not like her ex Daughter-in-Law, It still was/is not customary to show one's feelings in public in the Royal family.<br /><br />Viewing this film brought the period of Diana's death back like it was yesterday, and I liked how they added live footage of her throughout the film.Like millions of others, I admired the Princess, and will watch this film many times to come.<br /><br />Also, I now have a new respect for the Queen. This really is a wonderful movie!</p></body></html>

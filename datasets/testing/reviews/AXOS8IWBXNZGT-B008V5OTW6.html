<meta name="summary" content="Munich was only the start..."></head><body><p>...at least, that's the premise of Spielberg's latest film, Munich.<br /><br />I went with with a friend to see the movie yesterday afternoon, in Palo Alto.<br /><br />The film opens with the terrorist attack upon the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. Palestinean terrorists seize a number of Israeli athletes, some of whom are killed in the initial attack, others who are killed at the airport at the attempted getaway.<br /><br />It's the aftermath that the movie portrays. Israeli leadership calls itself to action, and sends an off-the-books assassination squad after those responsible for the attack. Their activities are restricted to terrorists located in Europe.<br /><br />  Ephraim: We have 11 Palestinian names, each one of them had a hand in planning Munich. We want them all dead.<br /><br />Eric Bana plays the leader of the squad (Avner). He and his team proceed down the path of righteous retribution, with the best of intentions. But, they question their way down the path more and more as time goes along.<br /><br />  Carl: It's strange, to think of oneself as an assassin.<br /><br />  Avner: Think of yourself as something else then.<br /><br />The men are to only hit the men responsible for the attacks, and avoid collateral damage, and they take this seriously, panicking when children or newlyweds stumble into the line of fire. They can also sense that, mostly off-screen, the terrorist organization they hunt is retaliating.<br /><br />In the end, when their hunt is called off, Bana finds himself a changed man. A family man, even more important to him than being an Israeli, he comes home to his wife and child, and cannot shake the sense of paranoia that has become a part of him, due to the task he'd had, and he questions the success his handlers tell him he's achieved. Terrorism has continued, actually gotten worse, with new leaders springing up in place of the fallen.<br /><br />It's an ambivalent ending...no answers are given. Why should there be? We, out here in the real world clearly don't have them.<br /><br />It's a well-executed film. Spielberg's brought his A-game to this project. In many ways, the film feels minimalist, but that's because of the squad's single-minded purpose. The film was shot on location in Paris (near the Bir-Hakeim Bridge), Hungary, Malta, and New York City, with a good effort put into making the scenery have the feel of the mid-1970s. The cast is superb, with Eric Bana leading the way. The violence is graphic, brutal, and believable.<br /><br />It's a film designed to make you think. I'd recommend y'all go see it, and think about it.</p></body></html>

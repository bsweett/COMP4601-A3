<meta name="summary" content="Spacey Solidly Mimics Darin in So-so Movie"></head><body><p>"Beyond the Sea" came out more or less the time of "Ray," about Ray Charles. It is impossible for me to review one without thinking of the other.<br /><br />Two different singers, two different people were profiled in each.<br /><br />Charles was a kid from rural poverty who fought his way through racism and blindness and denied each victory by dominating R&B. On the charts in the same era was Bobby Darin, a Sinatra-like crooner who wanted to supplant Frank from being chairman of the board.<br /><br />Here, profiling Bobby Darin, Kevin Spacey shows us the demons Darin was dealt. A heart disease almost levels Darin as a child who, from then on, considers life a gift. He grows up to be a star. You know the hits.<br /><br />It was the American dream. Darin was a self-made man. He had fame, fortune, the beautiful wife, the delightful son. He ached knowing his days were numbered. How could he make the most of it?<br /><br />Darin wanted it all, and got most of it. While some of his songs are classics, Sinatra has more of everything. Better movies, better music, and twice the adulation. Still, Darin got his share.<br /><br />The biopic challenge stalls the movie. Trying to make it more than a documentary, there are flashbacks and dialogues with himself as a younger boy. This confused me some, not sure if we were seeing the boy or Darin's imagination.<br /><br />As I say in my review of the CD, Spacey does a fine job of imitating Darin. Where this becomes a problem is in its similarity. Darin is only imitated. He is not equaled. I heard "Mack the Knife" on the radio the other day and was reminded how much better the real Darin was. Spacey deserves credit, and yet his limitations are too obvious.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee is unremarkable. She is dressed up like Dee, but never reaches into her personality. The directors set her up as a place keeper and not an instrumental character. This was the Kevin Spacey show, and everyone else is, at best, a supporting actor/actress.<br /><br />Too much is unexplored. I wanted to see more introspective conversation with his younger self, and more time between Darin and his son. The stress between Darin and Dee never seems real. The interplay between Darin's staff comes across forced, as if inserted into the script at the last minute.<br /><br />It is an interesting movie, especially if Darin's music is still new to you. It simply is not as intriguing as "Ray."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></body></html>

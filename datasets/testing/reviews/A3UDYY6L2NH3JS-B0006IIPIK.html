<meta name="summary" content="The mad scientist is at work again"></head><body><p>That's not a great film at all because it is a patchwork of special computerized effects and very conventional situations in that kind of science fiction catastrophic fantasy. And the myth of a new Noah's Ark that will take off this world to go we do not know where and will destroy the earth by taking off is as old as the world, if I can say so, from Ragnarok to the Apocalypse, and it takes a good old (way of speaking, quite in the age of possible procreation) heterosexual couple to save the earth from destruction by a project that was no longer managed by human scientist, since the last one had died more than twenty years before, but by a machine. But it is entertaining because it is so absurd that we do not even try to understand what is happening after a while, we just follow the lead or leash of you feel you can afford a more doglike nature. And we wait for the last spoken remark of that film "Lens cap" that is absolutely exhilaratingly funny. Watch the film to the end and you will find out why it is so funny.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

He wants to become a Chef, and we get to follow him about in Paris as he sets out to pursue his dream.<br /><br />Being a Disney film, of course the artwork is flawless, in all of it's tiny detail, beautiful colors, and crystal clairity.<br />Your kids, (and YOU) will really enjoy this. The story is funny,cute, and it carries a great message of not giving up no matter how impossible your goals seem.<br /><br />This is sure to become a classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Western For Suckers"></head><body><p>I was kind of looking forward to this because I am a HUGE western fan and I loved Wyatt Earp and Silverado (other westerns featuring Kevin Costner.)  But the film is too slow...Painfully so in fact and it doesn't have much in the way of action.  The performances are all pretty weak accept for Annette Bening who is strong in everything I have seen her in.  The score is okay...I think it must have been Michael Kamen's last one 'cuz he died this past year I believe.  Gets two stars from me for a halfway decent shootout towards the end.  I don't mind slow or leisurely paced films in general; especially in the western arena but I at least want them to have a point...In my mind this one didn't at all.  It was almost like it was just there to be there...Like a low budget Steven Seagal movie ripping off Lonesome Dove.  That's kind of what this felt like.  Duvall seems to be going through the motions in this and Michael Gambon is a weak villain who never had a complete hold of his Irish accent. Costner is best in this film when he is shooting of his six shooters.  This film upsets me because it is bad movies like this one that keep good westerns from being made.  Give me an Eastwood or Sergio Leone film over this crapola any day.</p></body></html>

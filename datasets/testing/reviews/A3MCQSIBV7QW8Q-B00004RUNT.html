<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest movies I've ever seen!!!"></head><body><p>I've had this movie ever since it first came out and I love, love, love, love it!!! Bruce Willis is just great, Milla Jovovich is the lovable Leeloo, Gary Oldman was perfect as Zorg, and of course Chris Tucker as Ruby Rod was just... excellent!! These four actors (and actress) is just what I think the greatest ever! This movie has the right blend of action, adventure, and humor. The DVD doesn't have so many special features but you can watch in either wide screen or full screen. And the image and sounds are so clear. I can watch this movie over and over and over. If I could, I'd rate &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; 10 stars! Watch this movie!</p></body></html>

It raises so many serious and ultimately disturbing questions about America's past--and by extension---current foreign policy objectives.<br /><br />This story focuses on the partially-fictionalized Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a founder of what ultimately is now known as the Central Intelligence Agency. Wilson's initial innocence and idealism is tried over the course of those pivotal years.<br /><br />Recruited to join the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, Wilson earns performance kudos at the expense of ultimately loosing what made himself 'him'; humanity. The constant state of paranoia which he is required to operate under finally eats away at both him and his family life.<br /><br />Wilson's real life counterparts James Jesus Angelton (a long-serving CIA director) and Richard Bissell (a covert operations specialist) provided inspiration for this film. Angelton also ultimately became engulfed by the very 'national security' system which he had long-term involvement with.<br /><br />The scripting and directing of this film easily maintained a 'suspense' environment without resorting to flashy special effects. Wilson and his colleagues are not 'bad' people per say, but they are living on the edges of both American and International society by virtue of having creating gray areas which cannot be disclosed to others out of 'necessity'.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The better of Clint's 2008 films, one of his most unusual films, and one of his best..."></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood has been a marvelous filmmaker throughout his entire career, and he continues to amaze us with his range and deep artistry.  He has also one of the most prolific filmmakers around, and in 2008 he made two features.  Whereas many directors in Hollywood can take years between films, Clint cranks them out with ease.  He's done this a lot in his career (1997, 1975 for instance), and here, the two films, Changeling and Gran Torino, are excellent.<br /><br />Gran Torino is the better of Clint's 2008 films.<br /><br />This may turn out to be one of my favorite Clint movies, as it's a real surprise of a film.  It's funny, sad, tragic, uplifting, and fascinating, and Clint packs it all into a running time of two hours (it's shorter than most of his other films, which usually hit the 140 minute mark). Clint gives one of his most memorable performances as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in the Midwest who is a racist.  Through circumstance, he befriends one of his neighbors, a Hmong teenager, and helps him through his life, leading to a stunning conclusion, one of the most surprising and moving in all of Clint's work.<br /><br />This is one of Clint's most surprising films, funny and tender, filled with great cimenatography, funny dialogue (much of which is very un-PC, but it totally fits the story), intelligent situations, and, for the most part, excellent performances.  The two lead Hmong actors overact on occasion, but all of the other performances are first rate. The film is also very respectful of the Hmong culture itself, and I myself knew nothing about it until this film.  This film is also the biggest box office hit of Eastwood's career, which is really wonderful and a bit startling, if you think about it.  When I saw it in the theater, the show had sold out!  I can't remember the last time that happened (lucky for me, the theater added another show an hour later, so I didn't have to wait too long).  It reminds me of when Bob Dylan's Modern Times hit #1 a couple of years ago (and his recent album, Together Through Life, hit #1 as well).  Years ago who would have guessed that Eastwood would have a #1 hit in 2009, especially when you consider most, if not all, his contemporaries are playing caricatures of themselves, are doing mediocre supporting roles, or rehashing old roles.<br /><br />It was a crime that Eastwood didn't get major Oscar nominations for this film (or Changeling, except for Jolie).  I have always wondered what goes through the mind of Academy voters when they nominate and award mediocre films (like this year's Slumdog Millionare, a decent film but hardly a great motion picture), and shut out much more thought provoking, challenging, and entertaining films like Gran Torino.  This film has been compared to Paul Haggis's Crash, but in a way that shows Gran Torino is the far superior film about race relations.  Crash is a bloated, self important, and preachy film.  Most people agree that Gran Torino manages to say more about race relations and tolerance than the ridiculously PC, overblown film Crash (ironically enough, Paul Haggis wrote several films for Clint Eastwood, all of which are better than Crash).  Methinks that the Academy is jealous of Clint, in that he's first an artist, and a celebrity second, and he just makes great films.  He should have gotten something for this film.<br /><br />Eastwood keeps surprising us and himself, making excellent picture after excellent picture.  His last six films, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, and Gran Torino, have been a remarkable run, and I can't wait for the next Clint Eastwood film.</p></body></html>

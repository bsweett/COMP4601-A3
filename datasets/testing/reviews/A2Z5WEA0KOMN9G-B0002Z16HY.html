<meta name="summary" content="Excellent War Movie"></head><body><p>After hearing all the hubbub about this movie, I had to watch it.  Unfortunately, none of the theaters in the immediate area were showing it so I had to wait for the DVD.  I ended up buying the movie because I figured I would like it.  Sure enough, I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The movie really starts about 10 days before the fall of Berlin.  Although, there is a brief scene before that where Hitler hires his secretary.  In the point where the movie really starts, we see an aged Hitler who looks like he's been through alot (which he has).  The information he is getting from his people is bad and he's moving imaginary divisions.<br /><br />There were strong performances all around, especially by the person who played Hitler.  You could see the dispair, exasperation and everything else in his mannerism.  You also had the sense of the inevitable.  It gave a more human dimension to a figure who isn't often portrayed as such.  In that, it made all that did seem that much worse because he knew what he was doing.<br /><br />Anyways, I thought this was an all around good movie.</p></body></html>

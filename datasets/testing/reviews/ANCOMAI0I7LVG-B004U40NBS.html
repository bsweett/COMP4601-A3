<meta name="summary" content="Not quite perfect..."></head><body><p>Last year the world went kind of crazy for `Black Swan', the film that finally brought the world of Darren Aronofsky into the limelight for all to see.  Aronofsky has been creating quality and uniquely intriguing films since the late 90's, and he has brushed Oscar's hand before (garnering acting nominations for `Requiem for a Dream' and `The Wrestler') but it was the bizarrely obsessive `Black Swan' that finally garnered him an acting win (Natalie Portman) as well as Best Picture and Best Director nominations.  It surprises me that this film was `the one' since it is his most immature film to be quite honest.  That isn't to say that it isn't littered with wonderful treats, and Aronofsky's manic yet oddly controlled direction was most deserving of a nomination, but at the end of the day this film is middle-brow Aronofsky at best.<br /><br />I told a friend that this film was like a strange blend of `The Red Shoes' and `Carrie' (two masterpieces) directed by Lars von Trier (genius auteur) with a more polished production thanks to a larger budget.<br /><br />Yes, `Black Swan' is an ugly duckling.<br /><br />The film centers around a young ballerina named Nina who is desperately seeking perfection.  She wants the lead role in her company's revival of `Swan Lake' and she obsesses over the idea of being the Swan Queen, so much so that her whole world starts to take a dark tone.  She is virginal and innocent and childlike in many ways, and so she lacks the otherworldly knowledge to play the dual role part, but she is talented and thus believed in and so she is given the part.  Nina needs to break free from the constraints of her personality, but her upbringing (and her monstrously intrusive mother) makes it hard for her to `let go'.  Then Nina meets Lilly, a young ballerina, new to the company, who possesses everything that Nina lacks; namely sex appeal.  Nina becomes consumed with Lilly, mainly because she is afraid of her.  She begins to suspect that Lilly only wants to take away the lead role from her, and when Lilly is made her alternate she begins to lose her mind with fearful anxiety.<br /><br />`Black Swan' is a very blunt film that doesn't really know the word `restraint', which to be honest is part of the appeal.  The film doesn't hesitate to dive off the crazy train and make a free-fall for deeper waters, especially in the film's final act (which is a visceral work of genius).  The preposterous of the film is highlighted and embraced by Aronofsky's fearless direction, and so you have to appreciate that that is the impression he wanted to make.  Still, there is a feeling of cheapness that erodes some of my affection for the film.<br /><br />I also found that the film's ensemble was very lacking.  There are no layers to these characters.  They are mere caricatures, props for Aronofsky to toy with as he pleases.  I know that a lot of hoopla was made over Natalie Portman and her eventual Oscar win, but I honestly didn't find a lot of depth in her performance.  She was just crazy.  She never really got under the skin of Nina, uncovering who she really was.  Granted, the more I see and contemplate the film I gather that understanding the complexities of Nina wasn't really the point (this film is guilty pleasure personified) but a little depth explored would have fleshed her out and made her more understandable.  Barbara Hershey was also kind of one-note and clich&eacute;d, and not in the way that made her interesting.  Vincent Cassel was horrendous, his line readings were awkward and unbelievable.  In fact, as much as her awards attention baffled me, Mila Kunis was probably the best performance in the film; creating someone we were enthralled with and toying with Nina in a playfully seductive and mysterious manner.<br /><br />And yet still, the film is electrifying and unforgettable.  The cinematography, costume design, makeup, sound (OMG, the way you can hear every swipe of Nina's feet on the floor is to die for), editing and that beautifully haunting reworking of `Swan Lakes' score is just delicious to watch, and Darren Aronofsky knows exactly how to play the audience, drawing us in despite the film's apparent flaws.  This may be Darren's most immature film, but it's quite possibly his best directorial accomplishment.<br /><br />So in the end, I can't hate this film.  I don't understand the unabashed love for it, but I do understand the obsession over it.  It is a film about obsession that captivates its central core by defining obsession.  It oozes with charisma and sucks you in full throttle.</p></body></html>

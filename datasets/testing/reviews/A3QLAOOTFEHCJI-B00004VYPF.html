<meta name="summary" content="Blu ray edition is a nice upgrade to this classic musical"></head><body><p>This is a revisit to a movie I haven't seen in years.  Have I changed my view?  Nope.  In fact, watching the film on the new Blu ray disc more than confirms that the film still holds up after 60 years.  The video transfer maintains the original 1.37:1 aspect ratio. While the images aren't quite as natural as you might like, there are very few distractions.  The colors are spectacular and the dancing is the greatest ever put on film.<br /><br />Gene Kelly seen here in his prime and in a tuxedo, could have been a great James Bond.  Cool, good looking with beautiful women all around.  Dancing never had a better stud.  Donald O'Connor is a second banana here, but check him out in his solo routine, "Make `Em Laugh".  He teams up with Kelly in a couple complicated numbers and you will never see better choreography.<br /><br />The story centers around the time when silent films made the transition to "talkies" (1927) and Kelly's leading lady couldn't make the jump due to her high pitched Brooklyneze voice.  Her voice and singing are later dubbed in by a newcomer named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds).  She's also Don's (Kelly) new fling.  This is all fun, inside stuff but the real action is on the dance floor.<br /><br />The film of course, features Kelly's take on the title song, which I've seen dozens of times.  It is still spectacular.  I had forgotten about the 13 minute dance sequence in the last act featuring Kelly and long-legged Cyd Charisse.  She dances throughout this number with a 30 foot long scarf flowing behind her.  It wraps gracefully around Kelly several times.  It is beautiful to watch, as is the whole movie.<br /><br />While the film in this Blu ray version is visually an upgrade from DVD, the audio is the real star.  The newest option is a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It's a big deal.  The songs in particular have been given a wonderful mix.  The LFE channel is restrained keeping focus suggested by the original mono score.  Special features include a new documentary, commentary by several of the stars and others and a "jump-to-song" feature.  This is a pretty bare bones package (one disc) for what is a milestone film.</p></body></html>

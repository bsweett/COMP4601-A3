<meta name="summary" content="Charleton Heston ... Where Are You Now?  And Bring the NRA!"></head><body><p>Believe it or not, Charleton Heston does make an uncredited appearance in this 21st century updating of one of the greatest science fiction films ever made.  In the original, he was the lead, an astronaut thrown forward in time to a planet ruled by Fascist apes; in this clunker, he appears AS AN APE!<p>Truly the best example committed to film to denounce remaking classics, Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES stinks from every possible direction.  The acting (with the sole exception of the lovely Helena Bonham Carter, disguised thankfully under ape makeup) is one-dimensional; the special effects we've truly seen far better elsewhere; the set production is relatively archaic; and I think you get the picture.<p>The twist ending to POTA (the original's makes this one so laughable) almost promises a sequel, but let's hope apes do rule the planet by then and cinema is an art form long abandoned in favor of banana mashing.</p></body></html>

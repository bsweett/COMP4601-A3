<meta name="summary" content="Slightly hokey, but overall well-worth a watch"></head><body><p>To my surprise, I found myself quite entranced by this mystery movie of a traumatized woman who takes justice into her own hands.<br /><br />I know there are plenty of vigilante movies out there, and to be perfectly honest this one doesn't do much that is original. We get the obligatory philosophical debate of the morality of killing thugs who deserve it, minus that crucial law step.<br /><br />But mostly, this is a movie that impresses it self most by some impressive performances from its leads and the fact that, despite whatever our opinion is on the vigilante syndrome, there is something pretty darn neat about watching jerks get shot in the face by Jodie Foster. Indeed, I pretty much ignored the good/evil debate and happily waited for Ms. Foster to take out another hoodlum.<br /><br />Plus, I thought the filming was just plain pretty--in a dark and sinister kind of way.<br /><br />If guns and good acting is all it takes to keep you happy, this will be worth your viewing.</p></body></html>

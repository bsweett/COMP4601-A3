<meta name="summary" content="Only Clint Eastwood can pull this off"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood is still a badass, even in old age, and Gran Torino (2008) proves it.  We've all seen him in so many roles that have him playing a tough guy over the years - from his western movies, to Dirty Harry, to Escape From Alcatraz, to this movie, Eastwood always plays a badass tough guy and plays it well.  Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in the leading role in this movie.  Eastwood plays the role of Walter Kowalski, a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran who lives near Detroit.  He's old.  He's one of those old, crabby guys that's mad at the world.  He's a racist.  Or at least he starts out this movie as a racist.  His neighborhood has gone from being lilly white to multicultural and overrun by gangs.  His family doesn't have close relations with him.  He's very much alone.<br /><br />His young punk Hmong neighbor, Thao, tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino out of his garage one night.  Kowalski catches him in the act, but Thao escapes.  The stunt was supposed to be for Thao's initiation into a local gang.  Walt realizes it was his neighbor Thao that tried to steal his car.  Kowalski calms down a bit and has Thao work for him to sort of redeem himself for the crime he almost committed.  The two become friends and from that point various bad things happen to Thao's family that are the result of being victimized by the gangs.  Kowalski's anger toward the gang boils over to the point where he personally wants to see to it that the gang pays for their crimes.  The gang's demise and destruction is Kowalski's ultimate goal.  In the process, his racism evaporates as the movie progresses.  I don't want to reveal the ending.  Watch this movie to see for yourself what happens.<br /><br />I like the character Eastwood plays.  He's rough around the edges, in declining health, hardened by war and his own neighborhood's decline.  He has a filthy mouth.  Only Clint Eastwood can deliver the lines he does in this movie and make them work.  They're so Clint Eastwood-esque.  I find his lines very humorous.  The way he carries himself in this movie is classic.<br /><br />If you want to see a very unique movie that can touch you in some ways, see this movie.  It's not overly complex.  It's very simple but very entertaining.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

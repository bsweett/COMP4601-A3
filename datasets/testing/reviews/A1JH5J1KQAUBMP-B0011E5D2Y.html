Despite the great premise, there is not much that is fresh about this comedy, but it succeeds nevertheless because of the great chemistry between Wilson and Vaughn as well as terrific support from Christopher Walken, a surprisingly hilarious Jane Seymour (no Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman here), and a riotous cameo by Will Ferrel.  The cast works so well together that even the obligatory phony dramatics at the end can be forgiven.</p></body></html>

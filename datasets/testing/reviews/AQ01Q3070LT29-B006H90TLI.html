So it really put me in a scared mood already. What intrigued me about this film is it had big name stars in it, so yes, I did pay money to go see this big-budget film in a movie theatre.<br />  This film is for adults. It does contain grisly, bloody violence.<br />  There is a serial killer roaming Texas. His name is Anton Chigurh.<br />  Llewelyn Moss is an ex-wielder who is hunting antelope in the desert. He shoots one, but it escapes. He follows a blood path that leads him to a hurt black pit bull dog. He comes across in the canyon looking from above, several trucks with dead bodies nearby. He goes down there to investigate.  One clue leads to another and ultimately he finds the briefcase full of drug money.<br />  He goes home to his wife (Kelly MacDonald), but is still perturbed by what he saw in the desert. Not able to sleep, he goes back out to the area of the crime.<br />  Suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted. The killer, Anton, has found him.  He is after the briefcase of money and Llewelyn. It becomes a dangerous game of cat & mouse as Llewelyn Moss travels around Texas as the psychopathic killer closes in on him and kills nearly everyone he comes in contact with as he explains, like a coin being passed around for years.  Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail for the killer.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Garret Dillahunt, Eduardo Antonio Garcia, Gene Jones, Woody Harrelson, Barry Corbin, Marc Miles.<br /><br />Filmed in Eagle Pass, Texas. Marfa, Texas. Las Vegas, New Mexico.<br /><br />The well-known stars of this movie really make this film watchable. If after seeing this film, you are still disturbed, just keep in mind, this story was set in 1980 and the way the killer gets into a room and the way he gets away unseen, probably could not happen in real life. The character has left behind so many clues, in real-life he would be stopped and caught.<br /><br />You know when Tommy Lee Jones is in a film, it is going to be a good one.<br />  Javier Bardem is in such an unusual role that as the killer, but is a likeable actor and has done good roles in the past. Bravo to Javier Bardem for traveling to America and in Texas of all places to film this movie.  Josh Brolin also gives a fine performance and makes it easy to follow him throughout the film. You want more.<br /><br /> The entire film has been well-cast, even the smaller roles had just the right actors, especially Gene Jones as the gas station proprietor who gives an unforgetable and memorable performance.<br />  This rated "R" film is abit hard on the eyes sometimes as the murders and bodies are grisly.  However, the film does generously pull back from the violence as the film progresses to give you a breather and leaving some murders left to imagination, thank you very much.<br /><br />  I am positive this film will be heavily edited for broadcast television showing. The DVD version will most likely be a popular one and hopefully will include additional scenes.<br /><br />Running time: 2 hours, 3 min.</p></body></html>

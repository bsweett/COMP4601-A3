"lucas ruined my childhood, lucas ruined star wars and indiana jones" whine, whine, whine. LUCAS IS THE AUTHOR OF STAR WARS AND INDIANA JONES, HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS, IT'S HIS STORY!!! i hate all the lucas bashing, without him, you'd still be watching cheap ed wood sci fi movies. mr lacayo said it best "this movies is awesome and i love all indiana jones. i don't understand why people can't wrap their minds over this story line. most people seem to think that lucas pulled this story out of his ass but the crystal skull mystery is real!!!! the myths surrounding extraterestials and latin america are real!!! i'm a latin american and i really loved this story because their definitely is speculation into how the mayans, incas, and aztecs created some of their artifacts. THIS STUFF IS REAL MYTHOLOGY PEOPLE, WAKE UP!!! also, it seems people didn't understand the concept of the anti-communist/post nuclear/50's era they were going for. to me, it's not lucas that doesn't have an idea or clue but YOU CLOSE MINDED PEOPLE!!!"</p></body></html>

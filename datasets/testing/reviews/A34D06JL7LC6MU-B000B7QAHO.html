Lovely Set Direction"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's "Charlie & the Chocolate Factory" is a remake as well as an adaptation of both the Roald Dahl novel and screenplay as well as a visual wonder of a film. Comparing it to "Willy Wonka & the Charlie Factory" it is a lot more faithful to the book and is a lot better visually. All the actors play their parts well; the visual effects, makeup, and set direction are worthy of Oscar nods. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the androgynous candy maker is spectacular. People compare his performance to Michael Jackson, and there's obviously some Jacko in there, but he also reminded me of an equally controversial singer (Marilyn Manson). The look Depp has in the film brought to mind both Manson and Jackson, the voice Jackson. Whatever it is, Depp is great. The script, adapted by John August, has a lot more depth; Even diving into Wonka's childhood. Burton is still himself, the film has the Burton mood and music (composed by Danny Elfman). Anyway, the film is about Charlie (Freddie Highmore, Finding Neverland) who lives with his father (Noah Taylor), his mother (Helena Bonham Carter) and his bedridden grandparents in their lopsided house. Everyday, Charlie passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A factory which has been open for a while, but seems to never have anybody going in or out. But then suddenly it is announced that Willy Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in candy bars that are to be shipped around the world. Anyway, same ol' story; Charlie finds the golden ticket and along with four other children go into Wonka's famous factory. Now for the children and their parents. Well, there are some changes. The parents of the children are quite different. The kids are pretty much the same; Augustus Gloop is a fat disgusting child. Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat. Violet Beauregard is a competitive gum chewing over-achieving little girl. And then Mike Teevee is still the kid who sits in front of the TV all day, except this time he plays video games. The Oompa-Loompa's have changed quite a bit as well. Instead of the green haired, orange faced midgets we're used too. We have a single actor (Deep Roy) playing the Oompa-Loompa's who now merely wear orange jumpsuits. Very well done. A-.</p></body></html>

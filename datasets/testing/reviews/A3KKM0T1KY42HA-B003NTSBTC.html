<meta name="summary" content="Shut Yer Eyes Land"></head><body><p>I actually watched Shutter Island twice this past weekend. Wait, that's not 100% accurate. The first time I watched it I kept falling asleep; at one point I think I was out for a good 20 minutes. So I watched it again in the daytime on Sunday, and it turns out the movie wasn't quite as bad as me falling asleep might have made it sound.<br /><br />After a clear-minded viewing (versus my original attempt after an exhaustingly long week and a couple of beers), I can say that Shutter Island had some decent moments. I don't know why but even in the first few moments of my initial viewing, something seemed very familiar about the movie. I already knew what the twist was going to be. I mean, I didn't predict all of the intricacies leading up to the twist, but I knew...I just knew!...where we'd end up when the final minute of the long 2 hours plus of a movie's credits rolled.<br /><br />I'm telling ya, I saw a Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or SOMETHING that had the exact same kind of twist...I just can't put my finger on it. There are great movies with great twists all the time (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BRZ5J2">The Sixth Sense</a>) that catch me totally off guard at the end, but Shutter Island just didn't.<br /><br />Making matters worse was a storyline that you really have to take with a grain of salt and give the benefit of the doubt to. Not that the trauma of Shutter Island's 67th patient wasn't indeed traumatic. It's just I had a hard time swallowing the whole idea that such an elaborate scheme could be pulled off. I guess that in a perfect world (poor choice of words for a place like Shutter Island) it could happen, but boy did the stars have to line up perfectly.<br /><br />What the film lacked in believability and 'keeping it simple' (and short), it made up for in atmosphere. I don't know about everyone else, but Director Martin Scorsese made me feel like I was on Shutter Island and that was a creepy, helpless feeling; the movie gets an extra star for that. Scorsese created a living, breathing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401204252">Arkham Asylum</a> where the only things missing were the most notorious villains and the Caped Crusader himself. When did the nuts take over the nuthouse?<br /><br />Oh, and a final word on the acting: great. If you like a psychological thriller and you have a lot of patience, you'll probably like Shutter Island, so move on to the 4 or 5 star reviews for advice that's probably more in line with how Shutter Island will affect you. I think 2+ hours was a long time to get to the point, and I could have used a little more action and suspense to get me to the end...in a conscious state.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good feel-good flick"></head><body><p>Is this, as some have stated, a NORMA RAE for the 90's, uh, 2000's (well, it takes place in the 90's)? Well, yes it is. Hollywood likes to turn out  these &quot;little-man (or more recently, woman) against the system&quot;  spectacles, and they can be counted on to have many in the audience  cheering on the quixotic main characters in their fights against a.  corporate polluters b. union busters c. corrupt politicians d. the powers  that be in any of their permuations.<p>So in that regard, ERIN BROCKOVICH  is not especially original. It is, however, effective--as good an example  of the genre as any you're likely to find.  As a tough-but-sensitive broad  with a heart of gold, Julia Roberts turns in another winning performance.  She cements her much vaunted &quot;comeback&quot; with a somewhat more  serious role than she usually gets and may well walk off with an Oscar for  her efforts. (Think of MASK-era Cher with a social cause.) And the rest of  the cast is very good indeed.  Much attention has been paid to Albert  Finney, who is very good as Erin's irascible boss.  More attention should  have been given to Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger and the all too briefly  seen Cherry Jones.  <p>Following on the heels of THE LIMEY and OUT OF  SIGHT, the film represents another step forward on director Steven  Soderbergh's comeback trail as well.  It is, of course, a much less daring  film than Soderbergh is capable of.  But he is entitled to enjoy the  success (both artistic and commercial) achieved here. So it's a tad  formulaic, EB is solid work all around.</p></body></html>

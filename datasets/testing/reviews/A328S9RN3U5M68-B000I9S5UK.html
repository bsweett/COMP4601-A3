True, one wonders with all of the fine new scripts languishing in the To Be Read bin why  Hollywood elects to buff up old ideas so often.  In the case of this film the story is worth re-telling, if only as a reminder that corruption has seeped into every form of public service - and that is something we must all address.<br /><br />The story? Precinct 13 is a decrepit building in Detroit in the process of being evacuated on New Year's Eve.  The cops it houses include old-timer Jasper (Brian Dennehy), Capra (Matt Craven) and alcoholic drug-reliant Jake (Ethan Hawke), a man with a police work failure past that haunts him.  The deserted building is left in the hands of Jasper, Jake, Iris (Drea De Matteo) and, coincidentally, psychologist Alex (Maria Bello) who is Jake's shrink, frustrated with Jake's inability to shed the past and get past his addictions.<br /><br />Because of a blizzard a patrol wagon transporting criminals to a jail is sidetracked and instructed to house the prisoners in the faulty Precinct 13 for the night.  One of the criminals is Bishop (Lawrence Fishburn) who is in cahoots with corrupt cops headed by Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne).  Once the stage is set the remainder of the film deals with a siege on Precinct 13 led by Duvall in an attempt to kill Bishop before he 'rats' on them.  Knowing that Bishop has informed his fellow housebound folks, the mission becomes one to destroy all of the men and women who are confined to Precinct 13.  How this all plays out includes a lot of deaths, continuous shelling and burning and some surprises as to who is a good cop vs who is a bad cop in a fairly predictable script, but pounced along with enough tension to make it good entertainment.<br /><br />The cast plays this 'Mamet-like' closed room drama for all its worth and while there are few characters with whom one can side, the various actors deliver a solid variety of prisoners vs attackers.  Not a great movie by any means, but a challenging one psychologically.  Grady Harp, May 05</p></body></html>

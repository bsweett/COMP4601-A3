<meta name="summary" content="When you see a horror comedy when you're eight years old"></head><body><p>.....the 'comedy' element is almost nonexistent to a young mind.  With that said, Evil Dead 2 scared the hell out of me.  Seeing it again, however, I can appreciate the humor in the film.  Also, I'd have to say the scene where Bruce Campbell fights himself is probably one of the greatest acting achievements of all time and my man should be given a Oscar for it.  It's something that you can watch over and over.  How about that laughing moose head?  Or Ash bending his knees in synch with the 'evil-possessed lamp'?  Anyone that doesn't outright fall in love with this movie has no business watching movies in the first place.  Am I wrong?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very fun movie"></head><body><p>The Fifth Element is not a movie to be taken seriously, but that is certainly not a bad thing. It is a movie that is just plain fun. It is rather over-the-top in a lot of ways but that is its charm. Well worth watching when you want a wild ride through an impossible future. The special effects are great and the humor ranges from tongue-in-cheek to outrageous<br /><br />GOOD SEE IT</p></body></html>

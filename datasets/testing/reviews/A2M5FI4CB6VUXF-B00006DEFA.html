MOZART, this movie is not the one for you, because there are glaring factual inaccuracies. But if you realize that going in -- as I did -- you can simply sit back and appreciate the well-written thoroughly-entertaining package this movie presents.<br /><br />In my opinion, It's a must-see!</p></body></html>

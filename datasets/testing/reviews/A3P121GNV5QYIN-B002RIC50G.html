<meta name="summary" content="It Started With Revenge"></head><body><p>The fifth and possibly the last of the Lecter films tells the story of a young Hannibal Lecter and shows us why he became what he was.<br /><br />Raised in the time of World War II,we see young Hannibal and his beloved sister Mischa (who's never mentioned in the previous films but in the novels) and their parents fleeing they're home to escape the horror of the Eastern Front with little success.They're parents are killed,leaving them to fend for themselves,which doesn't last long after a few predators of the human kind arrive.And the unthinkable and unimaginable happens and 8 year Hannibal witnesses it all.<br /><br />Fast forward years later,we meet a teenage Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) living in a orphanage which happens to be his old home. He escapes their cruelness and flees to France to find refuge with his uncle's widow a mysterious and beautiful Japanese women (Gong Li), who helps Hannibal to heal from the horrors he survived.But he can't heal until he finds the war criminals who hurt him and his sister.He finds them and basically does to them what they did him and Mischa.<br /><br />Sometimes I've felt bored watching the film but Gaspard Ulliel's performance as Hannibal Lecter kept me intrigued and interested in the film,it was the other performances that left me feeling bored. By no means is this a negative review,I did enjoy the film it just left me wanting more. I'd say go see the film just to see Gaspard Ulliel's performance.<br /><br />7/10</p></body></html>

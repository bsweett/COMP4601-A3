<meta name="summary" content="Not As Good As Original But Not Bad"></head><body><p>The story is completely different from the original which brings up the question, Why is this considered a remake? A lot of things that are on this movie didn't happen in the original story. With that said, the new take on this movie isn't by all means horrible. This movie is actually very good. The tension and horror that was felt in the first movie is still present in this one.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is excellent. The characters are 100% believable. You hate the villains and you root for the good guys even though you know the outcome if you saw the original movie.<br /><br />While no, Tobe Hooper, this director does an excellent job at mainting the eerie feeling the first had.<br /><br />Visuals were incredible, very cringing special fx that sometimes made you not want to watch but compelled to anyway.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent movie. A very tension filled horror movie that makes Leatherface a villain to remember and fear. Leather face is very well done in this movie even though the family's reasosn for killing people is unknown. In the original, they were cannibals. Either, this is a good film to watch, it will leave you on the edge of your seat!</p></body></html>

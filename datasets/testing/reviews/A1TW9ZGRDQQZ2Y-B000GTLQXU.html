Emmy Rossum is pretty bad here, but at least she looks good. If you go to a movie about a ship that flips over due to a 100 foot wave that pops up out of nowhere, leaving people trying to make it the top (actual bottom) of the ship, are you really expecting good acting and dialogue? The special effects are good, but I still can't figure out where the 160 million dollar budget went. It is fast paced and entertaining at times. I didn't feel like I wanted my money back when I left the theater, but then again I knew what to expect going in. Can't wait to see The Da Vinci Code, X-Men III, Superman Returns, and Pirates of the Caribbean 2. It's gonna be a fun summer at the movies!</p></body></html>

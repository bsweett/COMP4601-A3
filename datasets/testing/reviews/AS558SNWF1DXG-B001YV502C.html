<meta name="summary" content=""C'mon, Baby Diego? The guy was a wanker." "Yeah, but he was the youngest wanker on the planet!""></head><body><p>I'm always interested to read about classic films that flopped upon their initial release and only got appreciation years later.<br /><br />"Man of the West," "Vertigo," "Seconds" ... um ... "Office Space" and especially in this case, "Blade Runner" and "Touch of Evil."<br /><br />To that list, I believe we'll eventually add "Children of Men," which I honestly feel was the absolute best movie of 2006.<br /><br />When the end titles flashed up on the screen, I was jolted. I had one of those rare moviegoing experiences where I felt I'd just seen something amazing and awe-inspiring.<br /><br />But apparently about half of the people who saw the film completely disagree. After I saw the movie, I wound up in a lot of conversations with people and kept hearing (and, on Amazon, reading) the complaint, "Well, we never found out WHY the women in this movie became infertile." And although I understand the curiousity, I was actually proud of the film for not breaking it all down for us. I think we can suspend disbelief, especially given the conditions of the movie's world. And, really, had the movie in one of its many flashes to the television, offered up a "Jurassic Park"-style primer on the mass infertility, I still don't think the naysayers would've been satisfied.<br /><br />Admittedly, for some, "Children" is a long row to hoe. Writer-director Alfonso Cuaron makes the viewer really work to piece together the plot, and some of the stories questions go completely unanswered, but I'd much rather walk out of a movie still wondering than exit with everything neatly wrapped up. That's why I buy/rent movies on DVD and watch them a second time.<br /><br />And given the movie's apocalyptic and distopian premise, it would've been completely presumptuous for Cuaron to give viewers any kind of concrete resolution.<br /><br />But there's so much to like here: The totally plausible background story about Baby Diego; those three amazing extended takes; a really brave and against-type turn by Clive Owen (who, all through the movie, looks like a shirt that's been pulled out of a washing machine and not properly dried -- hey, he picks up the change that the bad guys throw to him, you gotta love that); little touches like the use of Guernica, the Pink Floyd pig and the statue of David with a prosthetic leg; a Ken Russellian shot set to King Crimson; and especially the widwife's explanation of *how* (not why) the infertility began, which is really all the explanation the problem needs.<br /><br />It all adds up to a challenging, somewhat mind-boggling movie. I wish more people had liked it as much as I did, but then again it's not really the kind of film that people immediately reach out and embrace. Hey, there are wars going on.<br /><br />*** As much as I liked it, I will for balance lodge a few complaints: I hated that awful cover of "Ruby Tuesday" that got trotted out not once, but twice; I felt Michael Caine's otherwise excellent performance was marred by his excessive use of the word, "Amigo"; I don't believe a man could disable three vehicles while standing within whispering distance of armed guards; I didn't believe a certain medical procedure that occurs toward the end of the film could be performed as easily as it was under the conditions depicted; and I really wish Cuaron hadn't called the Human Project's boat "Tomorrow." But, hey, in the overall picture those problems are minor, especially compared to the wonder of that last six-minute tracking shot, which, as it happens, is the only tracking shot the DVD's extra features *don't* explain. And there again, I'm not sure I really need to know.</p></body></html>

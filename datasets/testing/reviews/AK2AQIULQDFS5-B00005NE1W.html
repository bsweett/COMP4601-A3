It made me remember why I ever went to the movies in the first place. It was Haunting, Wonderous, Exciting, Humourous (when it wanted to be), and most importantly, it was highly entertaining. Now, I am not being Biased. Anyone who has looked at my members page will know of my feelings towards Bruce Willis (He is The Greatest Man to ever walk the face of the Earth). Even if Lorenzo Lamas stared in this film (and gave a good performance), i'd love it just as much. <p>As I said above, these films are the reason I watch movies, I don't think I've felt such wonder since I first saw &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. <p>The Acting is Perfect, the Direction is Perfect, it really is a perfect film. I've heard the word SLOW peppered through some reviews, but I call it &quot;leisurely paced&quot;. And the Ending is one of the most stunning I've ever seen, as with the Sixth Sence, the ending really knocks you for six. (get it, knocks you for SIX..)<p>I pray that the rumours of the Willis/Shyamalan Trilogy are true, at least then we know there'll be one great movie on the horizon.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Such A Cool Movie"></head><body><p>Looking at this year what will most people say was the best comic book movie of 08? Dark Knight, exactly but next in line is without a doubt Iron Man and that's for many different reasons. Out of the 4 comic book movies I can name off the top of my head that were released this year, Iron Man was definitely the coolest, with Dark Knight being the most authentic, Hellboy 2 being the biggest fantasy and Incredible Hulk just being the most insane. Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt made this film what it is, he delivers his very special brand of charisma and acting talent to a very cool and charismatic character. A lot of people have said that you couldn't have gotten a more perfect person to play Tony Stark and they weren't kidding.<br /><br />To those not familiar with the comic or have not yet seen the film, Tony Stark/Iron Man is the owner of the worlds premier weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. In the movie he is kidnapped by terrorists who hold him until he agrees to build them a specialist weapon, he agrees but instead builds an indestructible suit which he will use to break himself out of his prison. He manages to break out, but comes to realise what he's been doing has been the main force in a lot of innocent killings, so he designs a better version of the suit which he will use to help those in need.<br /><br />Downey Jr. has always been known as one of those special actors that will constantly put on amazing performances in little known movies, and very rarely gets a chance at a big time role. Iron Man is one of his biggest roles to date and he gets to star along such greats as Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. Speaking of Paltrow, I don't think you could have gotten a more perfect role for Tony Starks P.A. Pepper Potts than the Oscar winner. The villain of the film is one hell of a scary guy, Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger is actually one of the more intimidating comic villains I've seen to date. Played by Jeff Bridges, I honestly think the guy deserves a round of applause for his role.<br /><br />All in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message. Watch it, I promise you wont be disappointed.</p></body></html>

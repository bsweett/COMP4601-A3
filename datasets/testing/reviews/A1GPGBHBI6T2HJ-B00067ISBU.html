<meta name="summary" content="Sorry but I just didn't 'Get It' with Hellboy..."></head><body><p>I wanted to like this, I REALLY did...however it just fell flat with me.  It began with promise, and seamlessly picked up from the Nazi opening into the present, but not long after this the plot just got bogged down attempting to do too much.  For those Hellboy comic fans, I realize most of us really enjoyed it, but I prefer for my comic-turned-movie to be more coherent.  Just too much wasn't explained, and for even the most devout Hellboy fanatic, there was plenty that was just plain confusing.  I realize I get confused in my old age more often than not, but I ain't dead -- YET.<br /><br />The special effects were right on par with just about anything in film today.  In only a few places did I notice things that didn't look perfectly real.  The casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy can only be described as pure genius.  Nobody, but NOBODY could fill Hellboy's oversized shoes like Ron.  As though he were born to play this roll.  He brought a really great sense of humor to Hellboy that I was worried may not translate well on the big screen.<br /><br />I think all in all, the film wasn't bad, but in effort to please so many people, the filmmakers tried to tackle just too much in bringing this great character to life.  I am NOT saying that I know exactly HOW to do it right, because maybe, just maybe this is one comic character that in order to do justice, needs more than what a single 2-hour Hollywood film can pull off.  'Course I could be wrong, and I probably am to many, but this is just my take on the whole deal.  Looking back on it, I had a tremendous amount of fun watching the movie, but maybe I'm just too much of a purist and feel that more needed to be added in order to make it all right.  All things considered however, I AM glad somebody had the guts to at least give it a try.</p></body></html>

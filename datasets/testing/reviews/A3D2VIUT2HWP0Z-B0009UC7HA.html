<meta name="summary" content="Great Family Fun"></head><body><p>I never saw this film in the theatre, but watching on the DVD player with a very good sound system is a blast.<br /><br />The whole scenario is scripted for fun, and probably thats where the issue lays  for some critics... but they never seem to like the family fun movies anyway :-)<br /><br />As for the hard to believe  parts... this is a film, its meant to be fun and a nice way to escape day to day things. However, one thing that makes the action sequences more believable is that the plot point that the guys are ex-Navy Seals is established virtually  immediately; thus the amazing physical action is easily justified.<br /><br />Anyways, Just like the wonderful NATIONAL TREASURE, its a nice way to while away some time, and have some fun. It's an 'A' Grade ( or B Grade, depending on your view) piece of fun and action. It has just about every conceivable set piece in the action Lexicon without the gross out factor that some action films have. So if you have issues about what the Family can watch, well this is both very Family friendly, and enough to satisfy any action fiend. If McCounaghy[sp?] is trying to establish a Dirk franchise, well I hope he succeeds because this is a gem.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

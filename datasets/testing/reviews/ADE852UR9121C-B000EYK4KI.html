The movie that lingered in the background of the countless tabloid articles that graced our newstands. The movie that brought Brad Pitt together with Angelina Jolie and her kids. In fact, so many things have been surrounding this movie that people tend to miss one very important thing...simply put, this movie ROCKS!<br /><br />The movie's premise is pretty straightforward. A couple's marriage is on the rocks. But the fact that eludes both of them is that they are both assassins. One day however, Jane is asked to kill a target, that John is supposed to kill as well. They then learn the true identity of each another and because their cover is blown, are ordered to eliminate each other. The story ensues...<br /><br />The story is pretty simple. Hardly anything extremely intelligent or thought-provoking. One thing I loved about the movie however, was the on screen chemistry between not just the two leads, but everyone involved. It helps that the movie had some of the best, most sarcastic dialogue I've heard in a long time. The banter and quick quips between John and Jane was highly entertaining. They were a joy to watch. Doug Liman has been churning out great movies like Swingers, Go and The Bourne series and he continues the tradition here. He has a gift for identifying what the audience wants, and if you realize he has dabbled in movies from different genres and pulling them all off with his own style.<br /><br />The acting, especially between Brad and Jolie definitely made the movie much more than it actually was. The passion comes full force when they try to outdo and kill each other. There's a certain sensuality they bring to the characters. This is more sexy than romantic, and I'm not really surprised they fell for each other after the making of this movie. I don't know about real life, but they made a fantastic couple here, neither backing down and both exchanging creative insults. Add a healthy dosage of one of my favorite comedians of all time, Vince Vaughn and you already have a killer movie (no pun intended).<br /><br />Of course, the movie had it's share of absurdity and unrealistic action sequences, but Doug Liman knows this. That's why he never pretends to take the movie seriously because he knows it's all in the name of fun. And that's what makes the movie a blast. In the end, it all comes together very nicely.<br /><br />When you think about "feel good" movies, it doesn't get any better than this. Charming leads, respectable plot, humor, action, witty dialogue...it definitely does not disappoint...perfect for laying back and just enjoying. Thumbs up!</p></body></html>

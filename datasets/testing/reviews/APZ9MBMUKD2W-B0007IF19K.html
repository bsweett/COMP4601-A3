The writing, photography, actors, sound and all the rest again show what Hollywood could do if it wanted to.<br /><br />It showed Ray warts and all which makes it a stronger film. Face it the Mans early life was a mess but he got his act together and we are so much richer as a Nation because of it. Well done to all hands!</p></body></html>

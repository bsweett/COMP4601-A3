<meta name="summary" content="Openers and Closers"></head><body><p>CLOSER has entered that rarefied atmosphere of those films being considered that finest of 2004.  From the extraordinary writing by Patrick Marber (based on his own play by the same name) to the impeccable direction by Mike Nichols tot he fine ensemble acting by Jude Law, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, this film is a brilliant multifaceted jewel.<br /><br />CLOSER (as is so often the case in the English language) as a word can have two meanings: 'closer' as in moving toward, and 'Closer' as in the final word in a conversation or deed. For this reviewer I see the latter as the true meaning of the title of this intriguing story of passion, drama, love, and abandonment among two couples - no, four disparate and desperate people.  Serendipity plays a major role in the way these people meet, react with passion, respond, mate, break up, rejoin, and search for the meaning of love in a time when the blur between sex and love has polarized our understanding of relationships.<br /><br />Each of the four actors in this turbulent tale gives outstanding  performances and it would be difficult to assign the 'best actor' among them.  But more important than their individual achievements is the utter commitment to ensemble acting that Nichols demands and gets. The cinematography is mesmerizing and the music scoring not only introduces a fine signature song that opens and closes the film, but also the movie uses Mozart's "Cosi van tutte" as the ongoing background music.  Those familiar with the parallel story of the opera with the film will appreciate the subtleties even more, but the radiant singing by Renee Fleming and Anne Sophie von Otter suffuses this film with a special glow.  Highly recommended on every level.<br /><br />Grady Harp</p></body></html>

This is based on the real life story of the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr.  A con man who impersonated an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer, all before the age of 21.  He came by it honestly because his father was a businessman and con artist, who helped teach him everything he knew.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is boyishly handsome, engaging and diabolical as Frank Abagnale, Jr.  Due to an unfortunate turn of events in his life (which I won't elaborate on, to spoil the plot), the young man turns to a life of pulling con job after con job, at just age sixteen.  Not only does he manage to make close to $2.5 million, but he finds love, fame and notoreity in the public eye, all the while eluding the advances of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI investigator hot on his trail.<br /><br />This film is intelligent, original and just superb (from the very engaging title credits, down to the intriguing conclusion).  You will definitely be entertained.......</p></body></html>

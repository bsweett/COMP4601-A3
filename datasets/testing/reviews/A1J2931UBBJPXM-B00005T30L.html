<meta name="summary" content="Exceptional Comedy/Drama from Terry Zwigoff"></head><body><p>To begin with, let&#8217;s dispel any misconception that his is just another &#8220;teen&#8221; film; the main characters are teens, to be sure, but it is decidedly anything but.  Rather, it&#8217;s an examination of the methods we employ in the attempt to connect with the world in which we live, and how we negotiate our own specific time, place and environment.  A comedy/drama by director Terry Zwigoff, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; explores what it means to be on the outside looking in, without necessarily wanting to be on the inside, but unsure of what the next move should be or to whom or what we should reach out and embrace.  And, as the story unfolds, we discover that the elusive answers have much to do with our own preferences and perceptions of a world in a constant state of flux that refuses to slow down or wait for us to make our decisions.<p> Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) have just graduated from high school.  Their plans for the future include sharing an apartment-- and so far, that&#8217;s it.  Toward that end, Rebecca has secured a job at a local Starbucks, but Enid is stuck in the procrastination phase, job-search wise.  Be advised, however, these two are no &#8220;Romy and Michele;&#8221; mature beyond their years-- especially Enid-- they have a jaded, cynical view of the world in which they live and those who populate it.  They possess a keen insight into human nature, but regard those around them with a rather cold and detached perspective.  They observe people, Enid sometimes sketching them from a distance, and often they follow their subjects just to see where they go and what they might do.  Life to them is something of an academic character study, with perhaps an underlying sense that by so doing they just may stumble onto their own niche-- though without realizing what they&#8217;re doing themselves. <p> It&#8217;s all fairly harmless, at any rate, until one day they inadvertently get too close to one of their marks, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a man they view initially as a pathetic little geek.  They initiate an incident involving him that is cruel in the extreme, and when they follow it up rather than just dropping it and letting it (and Seymour) go, their lives take an unexpected turn, and for the first time they get caught up in their own scheme of deceit.  And it&#8217;s a step toward the inevitable changes we all face in our lives-- and slowly they begin to understand at least one thing:  That once the die is cast, there is no going back.<p> From the outset, you realize these characters are not your typical, average cinematic teens, and as the story evolves, Zwigoff does an exemplary job of developing them.  They change, they evolve; and you see it.  And given the fact that this story is adapted from a comic book, there is an unexpected depth to it, along the lines of &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; or &#8220;The Ice Storm.&#8221;  It&#8217;s funny, as well-- hilarious, in fact-- but the humor is never contrived or forced, but flows quite naturally from the characters and their situations, just as in real life where you find that even the most serious situation has a humorous side, though to find it you may have to take a step back and look for it.  Zwigoff allows us to take that step back and see that side, along with the drama; and the result is a film that is funny, incisive, insightful, and at times extremely moving and poignant.  The ending alone is enough to initiate hours of discussion.  Extremely well crafted and delivered, Zwigoff&#8217;s work here should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it is clearly superior to some that were rewarded with that honor.<p> For years now, in numerous films, from &#8220;Fargo&#8221; to the sleeper &#8220;Trees Lounge,&#8221; Steve Buscemi has been one of the best character actors in the business, and the role of Seymour is arguably his best work to date.  And inexplicably, like Zwigoff, the Academy overlooked him.  Buscemi&#8217;s Seymour is the epitome of a regular guy who, if not exactly content with his life, accepts it and has no delusions as to who and what he is; and Buscemi plays him beautifully.  There&#8217;s a touch of Donnie from &#8220;The Big Lebowski&#8221; in him, but with much more depth, and an attitude that is decidedly acquiescent.  This is a guy who doesn&#8217;t expect much, because he knows he&#8217;ll never get it anyway.  It&#8217;s an engagingly subtle and honest portrayal that also gives definition to the contrast between his stage of life and that of Enid and Rebecca&#8217;s.  Buscemi was perfectly cast in this part-- absolutely no one could have played Seymour better.<p> One of the true revelations of this film, however, is in the emergence of Thora Birch, who turns in an absolutely commanding performance.  All that she&#8217;s done previously has been but a warm-up for her portrayal of Enid, which, without question, will propel her already successful career to an even higher level.  With an understated and oh-so-subtle manner, she manages to convey so much about what is going on behind Enid&#8217;s eyes; all the emotion, all the confusion that hides behind her mask of external indifference.  Birch knows her character inside and out, and presents Enid accordingly, letting us know unequivocally how she feels about those around her, including Rebecca, her father (Bob Balaban), and especially Seymour-- through her relationship with whom we learn so much about her.  It&#8217;s terrific work by an extremely gifted young actor.<p> Johansson gives a striking performance, as well, though her character is ultimately overshadowed by Birch&#8217;s Enid.  But it&#8217;s good work, and one of the strengths of the film.<p> The supporting cast includes Brad Renfro (Josh), Illeana Douglas (Roberta) and Stacy Travis (Dana).  Filled with memorable characters and scenes, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; is a thoughtful and highly entertaining film, deservedly recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.  This is the magic of the movies.</p></body></html>

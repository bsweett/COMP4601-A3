Right from the opening scenes this will have you hooked. Robert Carlyle as Donald Harris is holed up in a remote house with his wife and some other survivors. This immediately brings 'Night of the Living' to mind, and '28 Weeks Later' can certainly be compared with that ground breaking film.<br /><br />There are a number of brilliantly realised set pieces in this film. One near the start and another that hinges around a plot twist, which you might see coming, but I didn't. It also has some genuinely creepy moments , most noteably in the London Underground, where frankly I didn't want to watch (but had to). The acting is all of a very high standard and the Director has done a fine job recreating the sort of post-apocalyptic feel that the first film had.<br /><br />My only real criticisms are that sometimes I found the fast-cutting a little too fast for my liking, but maybe I'm just getting old. Also there is a rather unlikely scene near the end which seemed a little contrived. However the actual ending was very good and certainly left the producers an opening to make another film. That would be a mistake though, because overall this is cracking film that any subsequent sequel would undoubtably fail to match.</p></body></html>

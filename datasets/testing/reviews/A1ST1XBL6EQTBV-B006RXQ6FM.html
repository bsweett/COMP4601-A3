<meta name="summary" content="One Of 2008's Best Films!!--And That's Saying A Lot!!"></head><body><p>Kudos to Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman,<br />Viola Davis & Amy Adams!!<br />WOW!!--This film is powerful and definitely oscar-worthy<br />in a year of many oscar-worthy performances.<br />The writing an direction are amazing as well..very well put together.<br />Set in a catholic church-school in 1964, a young black kid from<br />a low income/low self-esteem background is sent there by<br />his struggling mother (Viola Davis) who wants her son to<br />have better opportunites and a chance to dodge the evils<br />of his environment, but has she unknowingly<br />made her child jump out of the skillet and into the fire?<br />A fire that most people at that time found to be unimaginable!!<br />But we who watch with 2009 eyes know all too well that strange<br />things have gone on in these places that were once considered<br />to be beyond reproach and sacred enough that we would commit<br />our most precious assets (our children) to without even<br />a second thought!<br />Meryl Streep plays the stern, dogmatic and no-nonsense<br />Sister Superior role to the max in this, and once she senses<br />that something isn't right with the relationship between<br />the Preist (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and the young black kid,<br />she is like a pitbull in her determination to get<br />to the bottom of things!<br />Amy Adams plays her role with a wide-eyed trusting<br />innocence until that innocence is shattered by a chance<br />discovery that awakens many doubts!<br />I don't like to give spoilers in my reviews because<br />I like to leave room for the ones who haven't<br />seen a particular film to judge for themselves.<br />But make no mistakes!--This is a brilliant and stirring<br />piece of work, a must-see and very deserving<br />of it's 5 Oscar Noms!<br />Check it out if you already haven't!!</p></body></html>

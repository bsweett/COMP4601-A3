I appreciate the differences but there is nothing unique about this movie.  The only pleasure is comparing this to the hundreds of other similar movies ("D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu", "Sticky Fingers of Time", "Happy Accidents", etc.)<br /><br />The story is very basic; boyfriend loses mob money to bum on subway.  Girlfriend (Franka Potente quite hansom if you discount the red hair) frantic to help must RUN to his rescuer obtaining 100,000 Deutschmarks (pre-Euro 2002) on the way. We are treated to several versions and there could have been more.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br />This film lends its self well to Blu-ray. And there are a few DVD extras worth watching. Unfortunately they spoke to fast to interpret so I needed the English subtitles. I would have preferred German subtitles then I may have been able to keep up. There is an English soundtrack but much is lost in the translation.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P46QTA">The Lives of Others [Blu-ray</a>]</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Easily the Best of the Series"></head><body><p>After enjoying the first Mission Impossible film and thinking the second was just decent at best, I was surprised to like this film better than both combined. It has the action of the second film and the smarts of the first. J.J. Abrams has done a great job on shows like Alias and Lost, so it comes as no surprise that he has the stuff to direct his first feature film. Tom Cruise is the same old Tom Cruise. Not great, not bad, somewhere in between. He does pull off the fight scenes well, and his gadgets are always cool, but somebody get this man a tissue. He cries or looks as though he is about to throughout the entire film and it kinda bugged me. Philip Seymour Hoffman stole the show as the main villian and I liked Ving Rhames as well. I just wish Hoffman's role was bigger, because a character this nasty needed more screen time. For this type of movie I would rate it a 4.5 out of 5. Bring on The Da Vinci Code, X-Men 3, Superman Returns, and Pirates of the Caribbean 2! The summer movie season has officially begun with MI:III, and what a way to start.</p></body></html>

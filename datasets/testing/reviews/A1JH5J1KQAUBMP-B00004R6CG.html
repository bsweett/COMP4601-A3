<meta name="summary" content="Were we watching the same movie?"></head><body><p>This film was on my &quot;must-see&quot; list for years because of its great reputation.  I finally watched after a co-worker raved about it, and I must say that I have never encountered a more overrated film.  It started  very well and I had high hopes for it.  Many scenes were indeed hypnotic  and beautiful, but they just went on too long.  I was still intrigued,  though, and a great ending would have banished my doubts.  The finale,  though, was so abrupt and ludicrous that I laughed out loud...and then my  jaw dropped in disbelief that this was actually the end of the film. <p>At  the time of its release, this film was not warmly received; now it makes  lists of the top ten films of all time.  Go figure.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark and confusing"></head><body><p>This movie highlights three people--a man who needs a heart transplant in order to live, a woman whose husband and 2 daughters have been run over, and the ex-con turned born-again Christian who accidentally ran over them.  It is full of angst, flashbacks, and good acting, but it is all very dark and the constant switching from character to character and past to future to present is all a bit overwhelming.  According to many of the other reviews, the movie left many viewers in awe of the artistic merits and message of the film, but it simply left me confused and depressed!</p></body></html>

Far to many cops on the take with high end equipment to get anywhere near what could be possibly true. They even have a helicopter that can fly in snow storms for assaulting a building. Now that I have established this premise is more fantasy than not, I will say it is still fun to watch. I did get a little tired of all the headshots. It is as though the director likes to see bullet holes in peoples heads. So expect to see most the stiffs with a hole in the middle of their head.<br /><br />The acting is decent and the effects are good. If the back story had been a little more plausible and fewer police with more realistic equipment had been used, it really would have done better I think. John Carpenter's original "Assault on Precinct 13" premise was better. In a nutshell this version has a handful of police and criminals holding off about thirty plus officers, many armed like S.W.A.T. with the latest toys. All for one bad guy that will tell they were partners in crime. Well as I said a bit much, but you will get lots of shooting action. The DVD is good quality and it includes some extras.</p></body></html>

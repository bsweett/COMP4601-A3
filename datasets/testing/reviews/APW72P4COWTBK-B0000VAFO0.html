THIS MOVIE IS ANIME!!!<br /><br />If you saw animes like Battle Angel and Biohunter then you will realize where the "character's look or style", production, dark setting and most of all action scenes and fights came from.<br /><br />Some other animes that inspired this movie are: Escaflowne, Vampire Hunter D, Twilight of the Darkmaster, Blood the Last Vampire and more... but the main ones are Battle angel and Biohunter.<br /><br />Underworld also have a "goth" look and a horror-fantasy story, so NOT EVERYTHING is anime! But is more anime than a great dark action-packed movie since The Crow.<br /><br />Another american anime tributes are:<br /><br />* Kill Bill vol. 1<br /><br />* Guyver 2<br /><br />* Martix collection<br /><br />* Blade (some anime looks but not THAT much)<br /><br />* Treasure Planet (some anime looks but not much)<br /><br />* Atlantis (some anime looks but not much)<br /><br />* Power Rangers (worst tribute ever)<br /><br />Adios.</p></body></html>

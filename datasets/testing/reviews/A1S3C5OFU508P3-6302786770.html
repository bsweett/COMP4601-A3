<meta name="summary" content="The performance of Wallach should have earned him an Oscar, some scenes are too long or move too slow"></head><body><p>It took approximately 45 minutes of viewing before I began to get the general idea what the plot of this movie was. Three gunslingers with varying levels of viciousness are making their way through life in the United States during the time of the Civil War. Clint Eastwood plays the man with no name and fills the position of the good, although that is a relative term. In the opening, Eastwood is partnered with the Tuco character played by Eli Wallach. Tuco has a large price on his head and their scam is for Eastwood to turn Tuco in, collect the reward and then when he is being hanged, shoot the rope and then the hats off of the leading citizens. Tuco has few redeeming qualities; he will not hesitate to turn on anyone if it suits his purposes.<br /> Lee Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes, another ruthless killer with no scruples. Angel Eyes is searching for a man that has buried $200,000 in Confederate gold in a cemetery, but the "team" of Tuco and Eastwood encounter him first. As he is dying, the man tells Tuco the cemetery where the gold is buried but tells Eastwood the name on the grave. Therefore, both men need each other so they form an unstable partnership as they move through territory where the Union and Confederate forces are battling. As the team of Tuco and Eastwood pursue their goal, the ruthless Angel Eyes pursues them.<br /> This was a big budget picture and for the time, broke the mold of what was considered the standard western plot, with good guys going up against bad guys. In this case, the guy closest to good is still a ruthless killer with a lust for gold. It lags at times and has many logical holes, for example Eastwood and Tuco are able to move through combat zones without being challenged by the forces of either side. It was a time of spies and other espionage, so that seemed odd. The scene in the cemetery where the camera is spinning goes on way too long and can easily make you dizzy.<br /> The best characteristic of the movie is the acting of Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef. They are all humorless and impart more communication with their facial expressions and body language than many actors do with several sentences. My favorite was Wallach; despite his many faults it was easy to have some identification with the Tuco character.</p></body></html>

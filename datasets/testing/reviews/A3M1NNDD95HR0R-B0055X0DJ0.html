<meta name="summary" content="Tight Film, Good Action"></head><body><p>I found this film to be interesting and engaging.  I have been a fan of Transformers since childhood, watching the cartoon often.  This film carries the Transformer torch, and does it with good results.  Ever present is danger, and the possibility of defeat, but Sam and Optimus conquer all, in this all-out battle for the very fate of planet Earth.  Seamless renditions of both Autobot and Decepticon Transformers using computer animation, and a very tight film overall.  Great special effects, and powerful soundtrack.  Five stars.</p></body></html>

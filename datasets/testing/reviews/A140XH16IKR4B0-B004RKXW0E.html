Andy is now 17 and heading off the college. His Mom wants him to clear out his room before he goes -- anything that does not go with him or into the attic will keep trucked to the curb and out of his life forever. Obviously, this causes distress in his toy chest, whose denizens, while wildly loyal to Andy, have not been played with in years, and worry about what will happen to them. The movie spins out this drama believably and touchingly. The standard menagerie of Toy Story toys -- Woody, Buzz Lightyear, the slinky dog, Pig, and Dinosaur are all on hard. Along with a whole crew of nice and not-very-nice toys from a local daycare and at a local girl's house. And let's not forget to mention scene-stealing Barbie and Ken, with his enormous...wardrobe.<br /><br />Pixar has to be commended or taking an  old franchise and keeping it fresh.  There's enough danger, humor, genre allusions and prankishness for everyone to enjoy, old and young. The animation is firt rate. The work that went into Woody's loose-limbed gait was phenomenal. And some scenes that take place by the light of a glow-in-the-dark toy are breathtaking. The voicing was pitch-perfect, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprising their old roles without irony or fatigue. Some of the film is dark and scary, with its overtones of prison movies, which might frighten the really little kids who won't understand what is going on. And the numerous "gay Ken" allusions were tiresome. I saw the film in 3D which did little to enhance the jaw-dropping animation, great voicing, terrific characters and superb plot.<br /><br />A brilliant film, entertaining, affecting, gorgeously crafted and respectful of itself and its audience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good and classy"></head><body><p>ive seen this movie three times.the 1st time it was spoken in chinese with no words at the bottom.the 2nd was the same deal but with the english translation at the bottom.the 3rd was in normal english.thank god!in it,a thief steals a relic and some people go to get it back.it has breathtaking backgrounds like lord of the rings.beatiful music like amadeus and martial arts effects like a pre-matrix but similar.the kids could watch it.theres only one bad part.it is definately a artsy and classy type film.ang lee is the director.he also did the hulk.the hulk is better.it is not emotional per say but more inspirational.there are some chicks  but they are not portrayed in a sexual way.one guy,in the less than apropriate part gets his hand down ones pants.i dont care what anyone says,if you get this in english,it is one of the best movies youll ever see.the special effects are cool.the fighting is outstanding!</p></body></html>

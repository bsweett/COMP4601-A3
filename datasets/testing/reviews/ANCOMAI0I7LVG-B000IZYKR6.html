If you have not seen this little wonder I highly recommend you do immediately.  Director David Slade has done an extraordinary job in delivering a mesmerizing two person act that plays out so smoothly despite it sporadic and at times harsh direction.  That's the real beauty of `Hard Candy', its delivery, which imbeds itself inside your skull and stays with you throughout its full running time, and then still.  The film rarely sees a face other than those of the two leads, but those leads are more than up to the challenge.  Both Patrick Wilson and the young Ellen Page (who's receiving quote the attention for her upcoming comedy `Juno') are phenomenally cast in this dramatic thriller, but I'd be hard pressed to admit the real star is not David Slade.  I was so enthralled with his direction of this film and the risks he was not afraid to take.  In the end this film would have been nothing without him.<br /><br />The storyline follows a young 14-year old girl named Hayley who meets a 32-year old photographer named Jeff on the internet.  The film strategically opens with their chat screen so we can see their interaction before introducing us to them at a local coffee shop.  Hayley is the immediate flirt, as is Jeff, and they soon take their meeting back to his place.  Jeff thinks that everything is going according to plan until Hayley reveals she's not the sweet young thing he thought she was.  She has a secret agenda, a score to settle, a dark secret to unveil and she knows exactly how to do that.<br /><br />The film is a brilliant look at the drive of pure vengeance.  Hayley's character is driven by this inner power, this overwhelming need to exact revenge on a criminal who has apparently gotten away with it all.  She's one smart young girl and this catches her victim off guard.  The fact that I refer to Jeff as a victim is another reason why this film is so amazing.  It allows you to rationalize with a pedophile.  I'm not saying that that is something anyone in their right mind would want to do, but this film allows you to judge for yourself whether or not the punishment fits the crime.  I know that this is not the perfect analogy, and I'm sure people are going to complain about this, but it reminds me a little bit of `A Clockwork Orange', at least the feeling I got the first time I read it.  When you finish the novel you sit back and wonder if the means of justice were just as criminal as the reasons for it.  The same is here.  When Hayley is done the audience is able to sit back and wonder whether or not her means of action were just as horrific as Jeff's initial crime.<br /><br />This film would not have been nearly as effective if it were not for the brilliant performances by the two leads.  Patrick Wilson had such an amazing year, and while `Little Children' was his more popular film, his performance here is milestones ahead of it.  As Jeff he is so incredibly creepy in his charm but he is also pitifully heartbreaking in the eventual breakdown.  He's upstaged though by Ellen Page who gives my favorite performance of the year.  As Hayley she is so in tune with her character's motives and objective that she disappears within her character.  Beings that she was barely eighteen when she shot this film further goes to impress upon us her brilliance.  I really can't say enough good things about her performance, it's that flawless.<br /><br />With a top notch script and excellent acting and direction the film elevates itself into one of the best of the year.  The script for `Hard Candy' was actually conceived after producer David Higgins read reports of Japanese schoolgirls who were ambushing older men who were surfing the web for underage dates.  So this type of thing has happened before.  I highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to watch something separate from the normal media fare.  This is intriguing and entertaining and compelling.  In the end `Hard Candy' tastes utterly amazing.</p></body></html>

Having said that, she does very well in this movie.  You probably know the storyline by now; she meets a guy on a train, they have an affair, someone is blackmailing them.  It's not a total foreign concept for a plot.  It's what happens after the blackmail starts that makes this interesting.  I had a fair bit of it worked out already and so some didn't come as a surprise, but toward the last 10 minutes, there was another twist that you don't see coming.  I love these type of psychological thrillers.  I love how they mess with your head.  This movie does and and does it well.  You really should check it out.  It's never going to be my favourite movie, but it's definately a good one.</p></body></html>

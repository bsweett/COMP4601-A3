<meta name="summary" content="A pleasant excursion into pie-making and determination"></head><body><p>Can a poor, pregnant Deep South waitress find happiness baking pies while married to a redneck bully and having an affair with her married gynecologist? No. But don't count on an unhappy ending once she leaves her husband, sends her lover back to his wife and then, thanks to a fortuitous death, manages to bake pies to her heart's content, and sell them, too.<br /><br />Waitress is an eccentric and affectionate look at the life and times of Jenna, played with great empathy and charm by Keri Russell. Jenna is a small-town young woman who married her boyfriend, Earl, and now realizes what a jerk he is. She wants out, with a new life and another chance at happiness. What she doesn't want is Earl or, at first, the baby. Getting it on with the new, young doctor perhaps isn't the best idea, but it gives Jenna some joy. About the only people who really appreciate her are her two friends who also wait on tables at the diner, and the old curmudgeon, played by Andy Griffin, who owns the place and wants what he wants when he wants it...namely, a slice of Jenna's special pie, served by Jenna. Jenna's pies really are deliciously unique. Her mamma taught her long ago, and now Jenna works out all her frustrations and love by inventing all sorts of pies. Despite her pies, her life looks increasingly bleak until...well, see the movie or buy the DVD. It's no spoiler to say that this slightly contrived, oddball romantic comedy has a happy ending, and that pies are the reason.<br /><br />The nice things about the movie are Russell's performance, closely followed by Griffin's. The writer/director, Adrienne Shelly, who also plays one of Jenna's waitress pals, gives the movie a kind of goofy cheer. The movie isn't a cartoon, but there is enough cheerful exaggeration that most of the time Waitress comes across as kind of charming.<br /><br />A bit off-putting, however, is the role of Earl. The guy is so down-right mean and selfish that every time he shows up on screen you'll most likely flinch. Jenna's doctor, on the other hand, comes across just as needy as Earl but also weak. If one of Shelly's messages is that a woman who needs to be strong shouldn't get entangled with most men, she gives us some first-class examples. Jenna is going to be a happy woman, we know, because of a generous bequest, her pies and her baby. I'm not sure an adult male now will ever figure in the mix.<br /><br />Waitress is the kind of feel-good movie that many people will fall in love with. I'm not sure how many times someone will want to watch it, but the first time, if you're not in a curmudgeonly mood, should be satisfying.<br /><br />And for those who occasionally think life is a series of random acts of pointlessness, Adrienne Shelly was murdered just as she was finishing the editing of Waitress. She had been in her office and had complained about the noise a worker on the floor above her was making. He came down and killed her.</p></body></html>

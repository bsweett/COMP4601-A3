<meta name="summary" content="GREAT, FUN, ACTION-ADVENTURE!"></head><body><p>Indiana Jones type adventure, directed by ever capable Steven Speilberg. <p>A group of kids discover a pirate map which leads them on a fantasy treasure hunt. Lots of fun to be had here where the gang encounter boobie traps along the way, as well as watershoots and also have to avoid some evil crooks hot on their trail which features an exceptionally funny performance from Anne Ramsey (THROW MAMA FROM THE TRAIN). The ending has a pleasant, sentimental twist to it even though a little on the predictable side. The cast includes a very young looking Sean Astin as well as Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton and Ke Huy Kwan.<p>Excellent fun, games and adventures which kids will lap up. A classic. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>
